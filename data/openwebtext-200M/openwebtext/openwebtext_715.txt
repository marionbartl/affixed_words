ghc.exe : panic !
( the ' impossible ' happened ) ( GHC version 6.11.20081202 for i386-unknown-mingw32 ) : idInfo
Argh !
When working on GHC , or in any Haskell in general , it is occasionally useful to know something about what was going on when a program crashed .
Currently we have several ways of doing this ; for example the ghci - debugger or using the cost - center - stacks that are part of the profiling tools in GHC .
For my internship here at MSR , I ’ve been looking at putting another tool in the GHC - users toolbelt , that of selective explicit - call - stack ( ecs ) traces ( in a theme of things described on this wiki page ) ; and today I ’ve had a breakthrough in terms of using the tool I ’ve been working on to actually help debug a real issue I was having in GHC !
So , our panic above was coming from this bit of source :
varIdInfo :: Var ->
IdInfo
varIdInfo ( Global Id {idInfo_ = info} ) = info
varIdInfo ( Local Id {idInfo_ = info} ) = info
varIdInfo other_var = pprPanic " idInfo " ( ppr other_var )
What the ecs-extension I ’m working on does is allow you to add an annotation ( an awesome new feature from that ’s been recently folded into GHC Head ) onto this function to say that I want to debug this function .
import GHC.ExplicitCallStack .
Annotations
{-# ANN varIdInfo Debug #-}
And because there ’s a few things that need neatening up in the implementation , the pprPanic needs rewriting slightly :
varIdInfo :: Var ->
IdInfo
varIdInfo ( Global Id {idInfo_ = info} ) = info
varIdInfo ( Local Id {idInfo_ = info} ) = info
varIdInfo other_var = throwStack ( \s -> pprPanic ( " idInfo
" ++ show s ) ( ppr other_var ) :: SomeException )
Recompiling this source ( for the curious , recompiling meant building a stage3 ghc ) , passing in a - fexplicit - call - stack argument to GHC will essentially create a version of this function that tells all callers of this function to pass in their source locations , and will make the pprPanic print out this location .
What this really means is that the original panic becomes slightly more helpful :
ghc.exe : panic !
( the ' impossible ' happened ) ( GHC version 6.11.20081202 for i386-unknown-mingw32 ) : idInfo in varIdInfo , basicTypes / Var.lhs :238,30
I ’ve been told that just having one level of stack information is enough to help debug many problems ; in this case it was n’t quite , but we can just go an add a Debug annotation to varIdInfo to get more stack information .
If a function that has a Debug annotation calls a function with a Debug annotation , the stack is grown an extra level .
So , lather - rinse - repeat enough times , and it ’s possible to get quite a lot of information .
ghc.exe : panic !
( the ' impossible ' happened ) ( GHC version 6.11.20081202 for i386-unknown-mingw32 ) : idInfo in varIdInfo , basicTypes / Var.lhs :238,30 in id Info , basicTypes / Id.lhs :168,10 in idInlinePragma , basicTypes / Id.lhs:633,37 in preInlineUnconditionally , simplCore / SimplUtils.lhs:619,12 in simplNonRecE , simplCore / Simplify.lhs:964,5 in simplLam , simplCore / Simplify.lhs:925,13 in simplExprF ' , simplCore / Simplify.lhs :754,5 in simplExprF , simplCore / Simplify.lhs:741,5 in completeCall , simplCore / Simplify.lhs :1120,24 in simplVar , simplCore / Simplify.lhs:1032,29 in simplExprF ' , simplCore / Simplify.lhs:746,39 ... in simplExprF ' , simplCore / Simplify.lhs:750,39 ... in simplLazyBind , simplCore / Simplify.lhs:339,33 in simplRecOrTopPair , simplCore / Simplify.lhs:295,5 in simplTopBinds , simplCore / Simplify.lhs:237,35 in simplifyPgmIO , simplCore / SimplCore.lhs:629,5 in simplifyPgm , simplCore / SimplCore.lhs:562,22 in doCorePass , simplCore / SimplCore.lhs :156,40
But what , I hear you cry , are those “ … ” ‘s ?
Well since Haskell uses recursion to implement iteration , it would be a very bad thing if we tried to keep a stack that included all sites recursively entered .
Instead , we have a rule that any call site may appear in the stack only once , and if it would appear multiple times , only the newest one is kept , with any others being replaced by “ … ”s .
Here we can see that simplExprF ’ recursively called itself a few times .
Anyways , there are several issues to solve before this is completely usable for prime time , so I ca n’t promise when it ’ll be available ; but just thought I ’d share what I ’m working on ;
Tristan ( ToRA|MSR )
To understand how the shocking decision to fire iconic Broncos coach Mike Shanahan could have been made , one needs to understand team owner Pat Bowlen .
In recent years , Bowlen has not been afraid to speak of his mortality .
He has made references to his eventual resting place in a pine box while still wearing his boots as Denver ’s NFL franchise owner .
“ I ’ve only got so many years left in this chair , ” Bowlen once said in an interview with The Denver Post .
“ The way that I will be judged after I ’m gone is how many Super Bowls did I win .
To my mind , that ’s tantamount to everything else . ”
By dismissing the coach he so steadfastly supported for the past 14 years , Bowlen demonstrated Tuesday his bottom line is wins and losses , not his financial ledger .
There may have been many factors that went into the firing , but there was just one main reason :
The Broncos , under Shanahan ’s unilateral control , won just one playoff game in the past 10 years .
Bowlen decided that was not enough and called Shanahan into his office about 1:30 p.m.
Tuesday and notified his coach he was going in a different direction .
Shanahan left soon after , then called his coaches into a meeting about 2:30 p.m. to inform them .
“ He said , ‘ I hate to tell you this before everybody starts their vacation , ’ and he told us Mr. Bowlen had decided to go in a different direction , ” said Scott O’Brien , Broncos special - teams coordinator .
“ It was shocking to all of us .
We were all disappointed with the season , but based on what we went through , nobody expected this .
Anytime you go through the kind of injuries we had , it ’s hard .
I give Mike a lot of credit doing what he could do to keep going .
But it ’s a tough deal . ”
The team issued a news release at midafternoon , with Bowlen stating : “ After giving this careful consideration , I have concluded that a change in our football operations is in the best interests of the Denver Broncos .
This is certainly a difficult decision , but one that I feel must be made and which will ultimately be in the best interests of all concerned . ”
Decision surprised the coach
Bowlen ’s decision surprised Shanahan , according to his son .
“ Yeah , I think so , ” said Kyle Shanahan , offensive coordinator for the Houston Texans .
“ I know I definitely was .
When I look at their team as a coach , I thought he had one of his better coaching years , to tell you the truth .
To put up the numbers they did offensively and do that without a running back for the first time in his tenure there , it was impressive how they moved the ball regardless .
“ But I do n’t think that was the point .
It sounded like it was time to move on .
I do n’t totally disagree with that , but I do think he deserved another year , and I think he has the team set up to do well in the future . ”
Mike Shanahan and Bowlen could not be reached for comment .
Tuesday morning , Shanahan had been briefed on the team ’s 2009 salary cap and team budget issues .
He had scheduled his season - ending news conference for 11 a.m. today .
Instead , Bowlen will meet with the media at 11 a.m. , with Shanahan to follow .
Shanahan led the Broncos to their only Super Bowl championships , in the 1997 and 1998 seasons , and leaves tied for 15th all - time among NFL coaches , with 154 career wins .
But there were no Super Bowl appearances since 1998 , no postseason appearances since 2005 and only one postseason victory since the last Super Bowl .
And , in 2008 , the Broncos became the first NFL team since at least 1967 with the start of divisional play to have a three - game lead with three to play and not make the playoffs .
The fact that the Broncos played 13 rookies and lost 16 players — including seven tailbacks — to injured reserve did not protect Shanahan in finishing out his contract , which runs through 2011 and was to pay him between $ 6.5 million and $ 7 million a season .
What about the assistant coaches ?
Almost all of the Broncos ’ assistant coaches are under contract at least through the 2009 season .
Although Bowlen did not give pink slips to anyone but Shanahan , it is understood that the new head coach will have the right to pick his own staff .
However , an NFL source said Bowlen wants to retain some of Shanahan ’s assistants .
“ I think my dad is more concerned about his staff than he is for himself , ” Kyle Shanahan said .
“ Even though he was very confident ( that ) he was on his way to turning things around there , I think he ’s OK with it because he ’s so proud of everything he accomplished there . ”
Who will be the Broncos ’ new coach ?
Bowlen and Joe Ellis , the Broncos ’ chief operating officer , already have a short list of candidates .
Candidates whose names are expected to come up could include former head coaches Bill Cowher , Bill Parcells , Jim Fassel and Steve Mariucci , and University of Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops .
Bowlen has had connections to the University of Oklahoma since attending law school there .
The league requires teams to include minority candidates in coaching searches under a rule named for Pittsburgh owner Dan Rooney .
Some hot minority candidates around the NFL are Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier , Tampa Bay secondary coach Raheem Morris and San Diego defensive coordinator Ron Rivera .
There is reason for Bowlen and Ellis to consider an experienced coach : Nine of the past 11 Super Bowls were won by coaches who had been fired from a previous team .
Included on this list of successful retreads was Shanahan .
He was fired by Al Davis as the Raiders ’ head coach in 1989 , only to lead the Broncos to their only two Super Bowl titles .
At the time , Shanahan was considered “ The Mastermind ” who finally lifted legendary John Elway from repeated Super Bowl flop to two - time Super Bowl champion .
But after losing Elway to retirement and star running back Terrell Davis to injury , the Broncos floundered .
Although Shanahan figures to become a top candidate to fill an existing head coach opening , Kyle said his dad may consider taking some time off .
“ I thought Mike would coach here forever , ” said Broncos running back Tatum Bell .
“ I loved playing for him .
He definitely has a future coaching again in this league .
It ’s just 14 years is a long time to be with one team . ”

Gears Of War Comes to Real Life - Introducing the Chainsaw Bayonet
Up Close & Personal Chainsaw Bayonet Pictures :
You may think having a bayonet on your gun is quite retro , but what would you say if we switched out your pain old knife bayonet and replaced it with a powerful chainsaw bayonet .
If you have ever played the video game Gears of War chances are you would be pretty excited to run around with a powerful gun with a chain saw attached to the end of it , just imaging the people , I mean zombies you could saw in half !
If you were to set one of these up at home , I would highly suggest you treat this chainsaw bayonet like you would scissors ; do n't run with them , or you might saw off a limb !
If you think this is a big joke , I have a video of this bad ass gun / chainsaw combo in action , to back these pictures up !
WASHINGTON  President Obama reversed the most disputed counterterrorism policies of the Bush administration on Thursday , declaring that “ our ideals give us the strength and moral high ground ” in the fight against Al Qaeda .
But Mr. Obama postponed for months decisions on complex questions the United States has been grappling with since the terrorist attacks of 2001 .
Mr. Obama signed executive orders closing the detention camp at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , within a year ; ending the Central Intelligence Agency ’s secret prisons ; and requiring all interrogations to follow the noncoercive methods of the Army Field Manual .
“ We intend to win this fight , ” he said .
“ We are going to win it on our own terms . ”
His actions on the second full day of his presidency won praise from human rights groups and Democrats in Congress , who said the new policies would help restore the United States ’ moral authority .
Mr. Obama invited to the signing ceremony 16 retired generals and admirals who had spoken out against what they called torture .
Their passionate appeal to end harsh interrogations “ made an extraordinary impression on me , ” he said .
Mr. Obama ’s orders struck a powerful new tone and represented an important first step toward rewriting American rules for dealing with terrorism suspects .
But only his decision to halt for now the military trials under way at Guantánamo Bay seemed likely to have immediate practical significance , with other critical policy choices to be resolved by task forces set up within the administration .
Barack Obama has selected the Rev. Rick Warren , the evangelical pastor and author of “ The Purpose Driven Life , ” to deliver the invocation at his inauguration , a role that positions Mr. Warren to succeed Billy Graham as the nation ’s pre-eminent minister and reflects the generational changes in the evangelical Christian movement .
In a departure from past inaugurations , which usually feature operatic soloists , Aretha Franklin will perform .
A quartet that includes Itzhak Perlman and Yo- Yo Ma will play a piece composed for the inauguration by John Williams , whose “ Patriot ” resounded during Mr. Obama ’s election night celebration in Grant Park in Chicago .
Mr. Obama ’s inauguration program , for Jan. 20 , was announced Wednesday by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Celebrations .
Inauguration programs follow a traditional outline but also allow a president - elect to put his stamp on the proceedings and set the tone for his administration .
Why do I love metal ?
I love the crunch , that muted power chord , the chug .
That resonates with me .
Maybe that 's it .
This form of music resonates with me .
It works on my frequency .
All I know is the right riff gets me , the hairs go up , the heart beats faster , I feel it .
The journey started for me when I was about 14 or 15 years old , in my best friend 's bedroom , listening to Iron Maiden 's Powerslave .
Something made sense .
The imagery , the music .
Up until that point I 'd never known what music really worked for me , I just took other people 's influences .
I still have a love of Madness and the Beach Boys , but Iron Maiden captivated me .
From that moment I immersed myself in everything Maiden .
I spent days , weeks , months avoiding my homework while listening to their records and tirelessly examining every inch of the album sleeves .
I was thinking , imagining , creating a whole new world .
This is when I started to grow my hair and when my mum would tell her friends I was " going through a phase " .
I remember the beginning of my next stage well .
I must have been about 16 and we were at my house during a school lunchbreak .
During the playing of various tapes , I stumbled upon part of a song .
I had no clue who it was .
It had a clean part that turned in to a monstrously heavy end section , unlike anything I had heard before .
Back at school I took the tape to a friend in the year above .
I hoped he would know who it was and , without hesitation , he said " One by Metallica " .
It just so happened he had the album from which the song came , ... And Justice for All , on him right then .
He lent me the tape .
That evening I went on a school trip to a local dry ski slope .
I spent the whole journey there sat by myself on the back of the mini bus , trying to take in what I was hearing .
It was love at first listen .
I had found Metallica !
What had begun with Iron Maiden suddenly got heavier .
The flood gates opened from there : Slayer , Anthrax , Sepultura , Megadeth , Suicidal Tendencies .
My appetite got heavier .
I was the only person in my year who liked heavy music .
I had conviction , though .
This was not a whim , this was me .
The next few years were exciting .
I formed a band , playing bass and singing .
Every waking hour was spent listening to , playing or watching music .
I always remember setting the video to record Raw Power , on ITV at 4 am on Friday night .
It was the only metal programme on telly .
In the time before the internet , Raw Power , MTV's Headbangers Ball ( which I would watch at my best friend 's house , he had Sky ) and Kerrang !
were the only way for me to find and discover new music .
Watching Raw Power was where I first saw Dimebag Darrell , at the time Pantera 's guitarist and my musical hero .
Pantera were and always will be my number one love in heavy music .
As time moved on and we all started to move into adulthood with girlfriends , jobs , houses , etc , the all - encompassing world of music in my late teens and early twenties eased off .
Do n't get me wrong , I was still an avid fan and listened to as much metal as I could .
It 's just that other responsibilities take away time .
As I went through the noughties , I started to feel jaded with heavy music .
Sure , there were some good bands , there were some good songs .
Occasionally , I felt those moments of inspiration , but I started to feel like I was destined to be the kind of guy who lived and loved the heavy music of the early 1990s .
I was taking in new music all the time , but I would always go back to my favourite Pantera and Metallica albums .
Nothing seemed to be able to steal their thunder .
All my favourite bands were either making average albums or splitting up and forming new bands that I did n't connect with .
Even Dime , with his new project Damageplan , could n't light the fire .
His guitar playing was phenomenal but overall the album did n't hit the mark .
It was n't Pantera , and that 's what I wanted .
I never gave up hope though .
Then on 8 December 2005 Dime was taken from us .
Shot and killed on stage in Columbus .
I remember exactly how I found out .
I was up a ladder focussing some lights for a corporate show in Bagshot .
My phone rang .
It was my good friend Rob .
All he said was " sorry " .
I was like , " Sorry for what ? " to which his voice dropped and he replied , " You have n't heard , have you ?
Dime 's dead " .
I stepped down from the ladder and walked away .
I spent the day in a daze .
I spent the night speaking to friends , trying to find out what had happened .
I had spent 15 years of my life listening to his music , watching his videos , going to his gigs .
He was my hero .
Only now did I realise what that actually meant .
In 2007 I discovered Gojira , a French metal band .
They instilled a new lease of life into my metal world .
All of a sudden the passion , the fire , returned .
New albums started to appear that I loved : Machine Head , DevilDriver , Arch Enemy , Malefice .
I connected with them .
Then this year , Metallica released Death Magnetic .
A massive return to form .
I even attended their gig at the O2 as a fan .
No thinking about the day job .
Only thinking about whether or not I could get James , Kirk , Lars or Rob to spot me screaming at them from the front row .
All is good again in my world of metal .

Abstract : The HR ( or Hardy - Ramanujan ) program invents and analyses definitions in areas of pure mathematics , including finite algebras , graph theory and number theory .
While working in number theory , HR recently invented a new integer sequence , the refactorable numbers , which are defined and developed here .
A discussion of how HR works , along with details of well known sequences reinvented by HR and other new sequences invented by HR is also given .
Contents
1. Introduction
The following sequence of integers has recently been accepted into the OnLine Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences , [ 9 ] :
It has a simple definition : those integers n for which the number of divisors of n divides n .
It was invented by a computer program .
This note gives some results about the refactorables , followed by a discussion of the HR program which invented them and a look at some of the other sequences HR has invented or reinvented .
2. Refactorable Numbers
Notation .
Throughout , the number of divisors of an integer , n , is written τ( n ) , the sum of the divisors of n is written σ ( n ) and the number of integers less than and coprime to n is written φ ( n ) .
Definition .
An integer , n , is a refactorable number if and only if τ ( n ) divides n .
Lemma 1 . ( Theorem 273 from [ 4 ] )
If the prime factorization of n is
n = p 1 m 1 ... p k m k
1
k
Lemma 2 .
An odd integer k is refactorable if and only if 2 k is refactorable .
Proof .
Suppose k = p 1 m 1 ... p k m k By Lemma 1 , if k is refactorable , ( m 1 + 1 ) ... ( m k + 1 ) divides k .
Therefore the number of divisors of 2 k , namely 2 ( m 1 + 1 ) ...( m k + 1 ) , divides 2 k , and so 2 k is refactorable .
The converse follows by reversing the steps of the argument .
QED .
Theorem 1 .
There are infinitely many odd refactorable numbers , and infinitely many even refactorable numbers .
Proof .
From Lemma 1 , if p is a prime , q = pp - 1 has p divisors , and so q is refactorable .
The result now follows from Lemma 2 . QED .
The set of integers of the form pp - 1 forms a subsequence of the refactorable numbers :
A more interesting way to prove Theorem 1 is to take the integers in numerical order , find their prime factorizations and apply the map :
3 = 31 becomes 331-1 = 9
6 = 2131 becomes 221-1331-1 = 18
It is easy to see that the integers produced from this map must all be refactorable numbers , as they have p 1 m 1 ... p k m k divisors , and for any prime p and any integer m we have m <= pm - 1 , so the number of divisors divides the integer itself .
The result of the transformation on a even number is another even number , and the result on an odd number is another odd number .
It follows that there are infinitely many even and odd refactorable numbers .
This mapping of the integers onto the refactorables produces another interesting sequence :
2.1 Membership Theorems
Since primes have two divisors , 2 is the only prime refactorable number .
Theorem 2 .
All odd refactorable numbers are squares .
Proof .
Suppose n is as in Lemma 1 , and is odd and refactorable .
Since each m i + 1 must divide n , each m i is even , so n is a square .
QED .
Theorem 2 makes it easy to search for odd refactorable numbers , which form this subsequence :
Theorem 3 . No perfect number is refactorable .
Proof .
( a) Even perfect numbers .
Using Theorem 277 from [ 4 ] , we know that if k is an even perfect number , it has the form 2 n - 1 ( 2 n - 1 ) , where 2n - 1 is a prime , p , and using Theorem 18 from [ 4 ] , we know that if 2n - 1 is prime , then so is n .
Using Lemma 1 , we know that k = 2n - 1 p must have ( ( n - 1 ) +1 ) ( 1+1 ) = 2n divisors .
If 2n divides k then either n = 2 or n = p ( as n is a prime ) .
If n = 2 then the perfect number is 6 , which is not refactorable .
If n = p then n = 2n - 1 , which is impossible for a prime n .
( b) Odd perfect numbers .
No odd perfect numbers are known .
If one were to exist , say q , with divisors d 1 < ... < d k = q , then each d i must be odd , and by definition , d 1 + ... + d k- 1 = q .
The sum of an even number of odd integers is even , so , as q is odd , we know that k- 1 must be odd , so q has an even number of divisors .
Therefore q cannot be refactorable as it is odd and cannot be divisible by an even number .
QED .
2.2 Pairs and Triples of Refactorable Numbers
Theorem 4 . If ( a - 1 , a , a +1 ) is a triple of refactorable numbers , then a must be of the form :
for some integer n .
Proof .
As odd refactorable numbers are square , and as no two square numbers differ by 2 , a must be odd and a square , say b2 .
An instance of the Fermat - Euler theorem ( Theorem 72 from [ 4 ] ) states that b2 = 1 ( mod 4 ) , so b2 + 1 = 2 ( mod 4 ) .
Therefore a + 1 is not divisible by 4 and so must have prime factorization a + 1 = 2 p 1 m 1 ... p k m k , where the p i 's are distinct odd primes .
This means that τ ( a+1 ) = 2 ( m 1 +1 ) ... ( m k +1 ) and that each m i +1 must be odd as a +1 is refactorable .
So each m i must be even and therefore a +1 is twice an odd square number .
Therefore we can write a +1 = 2c2 , so b2 + 1 = 2c2 .
This means that ( b , c ) must be a solution of the Diophantine equation x2 - 2y2 = - 1 . Theorem 244 of [ 4 ] states that the positive integer solutions to this equation are given by
for integers n. Expanding the coefficient of x on the right - hand side , we get :
and so a is as in the statement of the theorem .
QED .
These numbers quickly become large .
For example , if we take n = 10 , then a = 2982076586042449 .
By considering n <= 35 , it is easy to show that there are no triples between 1 and 1053 , and it would not be difficult to take this number further .
Conjecture 1 .
There are no triples of refactorable numbers .
There are , however , pairs of refactorable numbers , although these are fairly rare .
The only pairs of refactorable numbers between 1 and 1,000,000 are :
It is easy to see that if ( a , a +1 ) is a pair of refactorable numbers , and a is even , then a is a multiple of four ( from the Fermat - Euler theorem as in the proof of Theorem 4 ) .
If two refactorables are relatively prime , their product is also refactorable .
So the products of pairs of consecutive refactorables produces another ( possibly finite ) sequence of refactorables :
Conjecture 2 .
There are infinitely many pairs of refactorable numbers .
2.3 Distribution
We cannot yet give an accurate measure for the number of refactorables less than a given n , but we can say how many there are with a given number of divisors :
Theorem 5 .
The number of refactorable numbers with n divisors is :
1 , if n = 1 or 4 .
k ! , if n is the product of k distinct primes ( ie. it is square - free : [ A005117 ] ) .
infinite , otherwise .
Proof .
Clearly , 1 is the only refactorable number with one divisor .
If an integer s has four divisors , then it must be of the form p3 or pq for distinct primes p , q . Taking the first case , if it is to be refactorable , then p = 2 and the refactorable number is 8 .
There are no refactorables of the form pq because 4 cannot divide the product of two distinct primes .
If n is the product of k distinct primes , n = p 1 ... p k , then any integer s with n divisors must be of the form s = a 1 p 1 - 1 ... a k p k - 1 for distinct primes a 1 , ... , a k .
If it is to be refactorable , then n must divide s , so {a 1 , ... , a k } = {p 1 , ... , p k } and there are k !
ways to choose the a i 's from the p i 's , hence k! possibilities for s .
Suppose now that n is not square - free , and n = p 1 m 1 ... p k m k .
Firstly , if k = 1 , then n = pm and m > 1 .
Then for any prime q which is not p , the integer s = qp - 1 ppm - 1 - 1 has n divisors .
Further , s is refactorable unless
pm - 1 - 1 < m < => p = m = 2 <=> n = 4 ,
and we have already dealt with the case where n = 4 .
Secondly , if k > 1 , with say m i > 1 , for any prime q not in {p 1 , ... , p k } , the integer
has n divisors .
Now s is also refactorable unless , as above , p i = m i = 2 .
If there is an i > 2 for which m i > 1 , then choosing this i in the construction above works .
This leaves only the case where n = 22 p 2 ... p k .
In this case , for any prime q not in {p 1 , ... , p k } , the integer
has 2 p 2 2 p 3 ... p k = n divisors , and is refactorable because p 2 > 2 implies p 2 - 1 >= 2 . QED .
Theorem 5 tells us , for instance , that there are precisely two refactorable numbers with 6 divisors , namely 12 and 18 , and precisely 6 refactorable numbers with 30 divisors , namely 213254 , 213452 , 223154 , 223451 , 243152 and 243251 .
Also , for a given non-square - free integer n = p 1 m 1 ... p k m k , if we can write :
n = ( m 1 +t 1 ) ... ( m k +t k ) a 1 ... a j
for j > 0 , and some t i > 0 , a i > 1 , then for any set of primes , {q 1 , ... , q j } , none of which are in {p 1 , ... , p k } , the number :
will have n divisors and be refactorable .
So , for instance , because 36 = 22 32 ,
36 = ( 2+1 ) ( 2+1 ) 4 implies 36p3 has 36 divisors and is refactorable ( for any prime p > 3 ) .
36 = ( 2+1 ) ( 2+1 ) 2* 2 implies 36 pq has 36 divisors and is refactorable ( for any primes p , q > 3 ) .
36 = ( 2+1 ) ( 2+2 ) 3 implies 108p2 has 36 divisors and is refactorable ( for any prime p > 3 ) .
36 = ( 2+2 ) ( 2+1 ) 3 implies 72p2 has 36 divisors and is refactorable ( for any prime p > 3 ) .
36 = ( 2+1 ) ( 2+4 ) 2 implies 972p has 36 divisors and is refactorable ( for any prime p > 3 ) .
36 = ( 2+4 ) ( 2+1 ) 2 implies 288p has 36 divisors and is refactorable ( for any prime p > 3 ) .
Note that the first such formula comes from the first non-square - free integer greater than 4 , namely 8 , and we find that 8 p is refactorable with 8 divisors , for any prime p > 2 .
To end the discussion on refactorable numbers , we give a table of the distribution of ( i ) refactorable numbers , ( ii ) odd refactorable numbers , ( iii ) even refactorable numbers , ( iv ) pairs of refactorable numbers , and we compare these with the distribution of the primes and pairs of primes .
n at most primes refactorables odd refactorables even refactorables prime pairs refactorable pairs 10 4 4 2 2 2 2 102 25 16 2 14 8 2 103 168 92 5 87 35 2 104 1229 665 15 650 205 3 105 9592 5257 34 5223 1224 5 106 78498 44705 87 44618 8169 13 107 664579 394240 237 394003 58980 27 108 5761455 ?

Table 1 : Distribution of refactorable numbers , odd and even refactorables and pairs of refactorables , compared with distribution of primes and prime pairs .
We used UBASIC and GAP to compile this table .
Based on this empirical evidence , it appears that the number of refactorables is always at least half the number of primes .
Using the prime number theorem , ( Theorem 6 of [ 4 ] ) , we can conjecture that the number of refactorables less than x is at least x /( 2 log( x ) ) .
3. HR - Automatic Concept Formation
The research of the author includes understanding and automating the processes at work when mathematicians invent new concepts , specifically in finite group theory .
This has culminated in the HR system , named after Hardy and Ramanujan , to emphasize both a theory - driven and a data - driven approach to concept formation .
HR starts with only the axioms of group theory and ends with definitions and models of concepts it has derived , such Abelian groups , cyclic groups , orders of elements and so on .
It does this by :
Finding models of groups using the MACE model finder , [ 5 ] .
Storing data from the group tables which details the core concepts in group theory , namely the group operation , the identity element and the inverses of elements .
Manipulating this data in one of eight ways to produce a new data - table from one ( or two ) old ones .
Assigning definitions to each new data - table using the information about how they were constructed .
Most of the concepts HR invents are calculations which can be made directly from the group table of a finite group .
However , it also makes sequences of groups , for instance , the sequence formed by taking the subgroup generated by the center of the previous group ( which produces sequences of length two only ) .
The sequences produced were mostly disappointing .
For this reason , we looked towards number theory to see if it was possible to find more interesting sequences using HR 's limited set of production rules .
3.1 HR Working in Number Theory
In number theory , HR generated three initial tables for the integers up to 100 :
The set of triples [ a , b , c ] for which a = b * c .
The set of triples [ a , b , c ] for which a = b + c .
The set of pairs [ a , b ] for which b is a digit in the decimal expansion of a .
By taking the sequence of integers with a given property , e.g. the prime numbers .
By taking the output of some function on successive integers , e.g. the τ function .
By finding those integers which , for some function , output an integer larger than any output for a smaller integer , i.e. those integers which set a record , such as the highly composite numbers .
The first time HR was tried in number theory , it invented the refactorable numbers .
When we first saw this sequence , we did not know how it was found , but it looked interesting - it had a mix of odd and even numbers , sufficiently many terms between one and a hundred , and no obvious pattern .
Therefore we looked it up in the Online Encyclopedia , and were surprised to find that it was not listed .
Only then did we look at the output from HR to see its definition ( expecting an unintuitive , complicated explanation ) , and were then even more surprised that this sequence was missing from the Encyclopedia .
We must point out that HR did only the easy part - it invented the concept - we have done all the rest of the above work .
However , HR does make conjectures about refactorables .
For example , it made the following conjecture , which we thought was true until a very large counterexample was found :
Conjecture .
Given a refactorable number n , let
f (n ) = |{( a , b ) in N × N : ab = n , a =\= b}| .
Proof of [ == > ]
Suppose n is refactorable , that f( n ) does not divide n and that n is not a square .
Then f(n ) is equal to the number of divisors of n , and so must divide n , a contradiction .
Disproof of [ < == ] 36360900 , 79388100 and 155600676 are the first three square refactorable number which are divisible by f(n ) .
Since HR only knew the factorizations of the integers up to 100 , the conjecture was not implausible .
Note that there can be no odd refactorable numbers n for which f( n ) divides n , because if n is odd and refactorable , it must be a square , and if so , f ( n ) is one less than the number of divisors of n , so , as n is refactorable , f ( n ) + 1 must divide n , and as n is odd , we can not have both f( n ) and f( n ) + 1 dividing n , as one of these must be even .
We note that HR has in effect discovered the concept of square numbers , for which both τ ( n ) and τ ( n ) - 1 divide n .
The odd or even square refactorable numbers are :
3.2 Recent Developments
3.2.1 Data Mining Using the Encyclopedia
Having down - loaded a copy of the Online Encyclopedia , we have enabled HR to check each sequence it makes against the database and flag those which it has reinvented .
After tidying up the data , we were also able to write an add - on program enabling HR to perform some data mining with the encyclopedia .
We are still implementing , experimenting and collating results , but it seems that it is certainly possible to find previously unknown results using data mining .
For example , we asked HR to identify any sequences for which the refactorables are a subsequence .
It first found [ A009230 ] , in which the nth term is lcm ( n , d(n ) ) , which was not too surprising since for every refactorable number r , lcm ( r , τ( r ) ) = r .
Next , HR spotted that the refactorables are a subsequence of [ A047466 ] , the integers congruent to 0 , 1 , 2 or 4 ( mod 8 ) .
This was an unknown result , which we subsequently proved :
Theorem 6 . Refactorable numbers are congruent to 0 , 1 , 2 or 4 ( mod 8 ) .
Proof .
Odd refactorables are squares , and therefore congruent to 1 modulo 8 .
If a refactorable number were congruent to 6 mod 8 then it would be of the form 2 ( 4n+3 ) , and by Lemma 2 , 4n+3 would also be refactorable , a contradiction .
QED .
This gives us another insight into triples of refactorables :
Corollary .
If ( a - 1 , a , a +1 ) is a triple of refactorable numbers , then a = b2 for some odd number b and b2 = 16 c + 1 for some c .
Proof .
By Theorem 6 , odd refactorables are congruent to 1 ( mod 8 ) , hence a +1 = 8n + 2 = 2 ( 4n + 1 ) for some n .
Therefore , as a + 1 is refactorable and 4n + 1 is odd , we see by Lemma 2 that 4n + 1 is an odd refactorable number .
Hence , by Theorem 6 again , 4n + 1 = 8c+1 , so a + 1 = 2 ( 8c+1 ) and we see that a = 16c+1 .
As a is an odd refactorable , by Theorem 2 we can write a = b2 for some b , and a = b2 = 16c+1. QED .
Another data mining investigation using the encyclopedia , this time to find super - sequences of the perfect numbers [ " even " being understood here ] , showed that perfect numbers are a subsequence of [ A009242 ] , with nth term equal to lcm (n , σ ( n ) ) .
Therefore HR had spotted that , for all ( even ) perfect numbers p , there is an n such that lcm ( n , σ ( n ) ) = p .
In the same session , HR also spotted that the even perfect numbers are a subsequence of [ A007517 ] , in which the nth term is φ ( n ) ( σ ( n ) - n ) .
We have subsequently proved both of these results :
Theorem 7 .
For any even perfect number p , there is an integer a for which lcm ( a , σ ( a ) ) = p , and an integer b for which φ ( b ) ( σ ( b ) - b ) = p .
Proof . From Theorem 277 of [ 4 ] , we note that p = 2n - 1 ( 2n - 1 ) for some n , where 2n - 1 is a prime .
If we take a = 2 n - 1 then
σ ( a ) = 1 + 2 + ... + 2n -1 = 2n - 1
φ ( b ) = b/2 = 2n -1
φ ( b ) ( σ ( b ) - b ) = 2n - 1 ( 2n + 1 - 1 - 2n ) = 2n - 1 ( 2n - 1 ) = p .
QED
So HR has highlighted the following appealing parallel between the refactorable numbers and the even perfect numbers :
Refactorable numbers are of the form lcm ( a , τ ( a ) ) for some a .
Perfect numbers are of the form lcm ( a , σ ( a ) ) for some a .
Refactorable numbers are those n for which lcm(n , τ(n ) ) = n ,
Perfect numbers are those n for which lcm(n , σ ( n ) ) = 2n .

4. Other Sequences
4.1 Re-Invented Sequences
After a preliminary examination , we can claim that HR reinvented the following sequences :
Sequences resulting from factorization :
the square numbers [ A000290 ] .
the non-squares [ A000037 ] .
the prime numbers [ A000040 ] .
the squares of primes [ A001248 ] .
the primes and squares of primes [ A000430 ] .
1 and the odd primes [ A006005 ] .
0 if prime , 1 otherwise [ A005171 ] .
the composite numbers [ A002808 ] .
the highly composite numbers [ A002182 ] .
τ ( n ) , the number of divisors of n [ A000005 ] .
the number of proper divisors [ A032741 ] .
integers with 4 [ A030513 ] , 5 [ A030514 ] , etc. divisors .
integer square roots or zero [ A037213 ] .
writing out the divisors [ A027750 ] .
writing out the proper divisors [ A027751 ] .
the squarefree integers . [ A005117 ] .
the powers of 2 [ A000079 ] .
integers with at most 2 prime factors [ A037143 ] .
integers not divisible by 3 [ A001651 ] .
Sequences resulting from addition :
the even numbers [ A005843 ] .
the odd numbers [ A005408 ] .
writing out the numbers less than n [ A005408 ] .
1 together with the even numbers [ A004277 ] .
2 together with the odd numbers [ A004280 ] .
2,4 and the odd numbers [ A004281 ] .
Sequences resulting from examination of digits :
the repunits [ A000042 ] .
integers with only 2's as digits [ A002276 ] .
integers with a 1 [ A011531 ] , 2 [ A011532 ] , 3 [ A011533 ] , etc. as a digit .
the repdigits [ A010785 ] .
integers divisible by each non-zero digit [ A002796 ] .
each digit is prime [ A046034 ] .
the numbers with two distinct digits [ A031955 ] .
the number of distinct digits in n [ A043537 ] .
number with distinct digits [ A010784 ] .
numbers divisible by every digit [ A034838 ] .
no base 2 digit is a base 10 digit [ A037344 ] .
the natural numbers in base 3 [ A007089 ] .
More interesting than the fact that HR reinvented these sequences are the ways in which HR defines them .
For example , even numbers are defined as integers n for which there is a natural number m such that m + m = n .
The natural numbers in base 3 were defined as integers in base 10 which have no digits which can be written as a + b where a > 0 , b > 0 and a =/= b. Powers of two were defined as those integers with no odd divisors .
HR invented many other sequences which were not found in the encyclopedia .
Most did not seem of any great interest .
However , we deemed the following seven of sufficient interest to be submitted to the encyclopedia .
1 , 2 , 14 , 23 , 29 , 34 , 46 , 63 , 68 , 74 , 76 , 78 , 88 , 94 , ... [ A036433 ] ,
the number of divisors is a digit in the decimal expansion of n .
This sequence contains all primes with a 2 in them , and those primes starting with a 2 , [ A045708 ] .
1 , 4 , 9 , 11 , 14 , 19 , 41 , 44 , 49 , 91 , 94 , 99 , ... [ A036435 ] ,
those integers where all the digits are nonzero squares .
0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 2 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , ... [ A036431 ] ,
f(n ) = |{a < n : a + τ ( a ) = n}|. 1 , 3 , 6 , 8 , 11 , 16 , 17 , 20 , 22 , 23 , 27 , 29 , ... [ A036434 ] ,
integers which cannot be written as a + τ ( a ) for some a ( i.e. those n for which f( n ) = 0 ) . 1 , 2 , 7 , 38 , 122 , 2766 , 64686 , ... [ A036432 ] ,
integers that set a record for f( n ) .
1 , 4 , 6 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 27 , ... [ A036438 ] ,
integers which can be written as m * τ ( m ) for some m ( which of course include twice the primes , [ A001747 ] ) .
1 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 14 , 15 , 22 , 26 , 27 , ... [ A036436 ] ,
integers for which τ ( n ) is a square .
This sequence contains the multiplicatively perfect numbers [ A007422 ] , n such that the product of the divisors of n equals n2 .
HR has also found some interesting finite sequences of integers .
For example , HR invented those integers which have more distinct digits than any smaller number
1 , 10 , 102 , 1023 , 10234 , 102345 , 1023456 , 10234567 , 102345678 , 1023456789 [ A038378 ] .
5. Conclusions
Also , we have shown that HR is capable of producing interesting concepts .
Automated concept formation programs have some advantages over humans , in that they have no pride ( are not ashamed to look at concepts with simple descriptions ) and are very thorough .
The use of computers with integer sequences has also been explored in [ 7 ] , where the Seek - Whence program was used to identify definitions of integer sequences .
Indeed , the Superseeker server for the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences does a certain amount of concept formation in attempting to find a match between a given sequence and one in the database .
A similar program to HR is Graffiti , [ 3 ] , which makes conjectures in graph theory .
Another program , [ 1 ] , automatically invents theorems in plane geometry .
Machine discovery in mathematics and in science in general is a productive and interesting area which is gaining recognition and attention .
HR and refactorable numbers were themselves recently mentioned in the popular press , [ 8 ] , which reflects the interest that machine discovery is attracting .
As more work is done in this area , we hope to make discovery programs as much a part of the mathematician 's tool box as computer algebra packages .

8. Addenda , April 19 , 1999
In this paper we tried to make two points : ( i ) that the HR program we have implemented can invent new and interesting concepts in number theory and ( ii ) that one concept output by HR , namely the refactorable numbers , had many interesting properties .
Because refactorables and associated sequences were missing from the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences , [ 9 ] , and after a preliminary search of the relevant literature , we concluded that the refactorable numbers were a genuinely new invention .
However , on 23rd March 1999 , we received notification from Robert Kennedy and Curtis Cooper , of Central Missouri State University , that they had read the above paper and that the concept of refactorables had been defined already as `τ numbers ' in a 1990 paper , [ 10 ] , which proved that the natural density of the τ numbers is zero .
This news detracts from our original paper in only one way , namely that the title is inaccurate , refactorables were a machine re-invention .
Indeed , the news that they have been developed so recently adds both to the point that HR can invent and re-invent concepts of interest and , of course , to the point that refactorables are interesting .
To add to the argument that HR produces interesting , novel concepts in number theory , we present the following very simple function defined by HR recently :
f (n ) = |{( a , b ) : a * b = n and a | b}| .
This has been added to the encyclopedia :
This was interesting because of its similarity to the τ function , [ A000005 ] : ( τ ( n ) = number of divisors of n ) .
HR went on to define the integer sequence of numbers which set a record for f ( ie .
those integers , a , for which for all b , 0 < b < a , f( a ) > f( b ) ) :
It was easy to spot that these are all square numbers , but a little investigating revealed the following result :
Theorem 1 .
The nth integer setting the record for f as above is the square of the nth highly composite number [ A002182 ] ( the highly composite numbers have more divisors than any smaller integer ) .
To prove this , we need the following lemma :
Lemma 1 . f( n ) = τ( square root of the largest square dividing n ) .
Note that the square root of the largest square dividing n , which we write as s(n ) , is integer sequence [ A000188 ] .
Proof of Lemma 1 .
Writing n=p 1 k 1 ...p m k m , the largest square dividing n is p 1 2 [ k 1 / 2 ] ...p m 2 [k m / 2 ] , the square root of which is : p 1 [k 1 / 2 ] ...p m [k m / 2 ] , where [ z ] denotes the integer part of fraction z .
The pairs of integers dividing n are of the form :
( a , b ) = ( p 1 x 1 ...p m x m , p 1 k 1 - x 1 ...p m k m - x m )
and a|b if for all i , x i =< k i - x i , ie .
x i =< k i / 2 .
Therefore , each x i can be 0,1,2 , ... , [k i / 2 ] , and :
f(n ) = ( [k 1 /2 ] + 1 ) ( [k 2 /2 ] + 1 ) ...( [k m / 2 ] + 1 ) = τ( p 1 [k 1 /2 ] ...p m [k 1 /2 ] ) = τ ( s ( n ) ) ,
using Theorem 273 from [ 4 ] .
QED
Proof of Theorem 1 .
Suppose that a sets a record for f .
Therefore , f( a ) > f( 1 ) , f( a ) > f( 2 ) , ... , f ( a ) > f( a - 1 ) , and by lemma 1 , this means that τ( s ( a ) ) > τ ( s ( 1 ) ) , τ( s( a ) ) > τ ( s ( 2 ) ) , ... , τ( s(a ) ) > τ ( s ( a - 1 ) ) .
Suppose now that c2 is the largest square less than or equal to a .
Then we see that :
τ (s( a ) ) > τ ( s ( 1 ) ) = τ ( 1 )
τ (s( a ) ) > τ ( s ( 4 ) ) = τ ( 2 )
. .
τ ( s( a ) ) > τ(s ( ( c - 1 ) 2 ) ) = τ( c-1 )
If a > c2 , the largest square dividing a will be less than c2 and s( a ) < c.
But then , s(a ) = c - k for some k , and τ ( s ( a ) ) = τ ( c-k ) , which is a contradiction .
Hence a = c2 , s( a ) = c , and τ( c ) > τ( c - i ) for all i < c , which makes c a highly composite number , and a the square of a highly composite number .
Suppose now that b is a highly composite number , and a= b2 .
Therefore , s(a ) = b , and , as b is highly composite , if , for some k , τ ( s ( a - k ) ) > τ ( s ( a ) ) , then s( a - k ) > s( a ) = b , which is impossible .
Hence , for all k < a , τ ( s ( a ) ) > τ( s ( a - k ) ) , and by lemma 1 , f( a ) > f( a - k ) , thus a sets a record for f. QED
Coincidentally , the previous time there was a similar confusion over a machine invented concept , Douglas Lenat , who wrote the AM program , [ 11 ] , thought for a while that what he called maximally divisible numbers were a machine invention .
These turned out to be the highly composite numbers we 've discussed here , which were originally developed by Ramanujan , [ 12 ] .
This time , we will only claim that it is possible that the function f above was invented by HR , and that it is possible that , while the concept of the squares of highly composite numbers may have been looked at before , HR may have been the first to define them as setting the record for f .
It was fortunate that τ numbers had not been added to the encyclopedia , because we may have decided not to develop them .
However , the story of refactorable / τ numbers emphasises the need for databases of mathematical knowledge such as the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences , [ 9 ] , which can be used by people and computers alike to check the novelty of inventions .

Reg Tech Panel Bashing Microsoft for being closed and proprietary has been a popular pastime in the media and the IT industry for many years , and there is no doubt that much of this has been well deserved .
After having its wings clipped on several occasions by regulators , however , the Microsoft of today , while not totally reformed , is a lot more open and well behaved than it was , say , 10 years ago .
Nevertheless , many are still wary of Microsoft for its past transgressions , as well as more recent ‘ crimes ’ such as inflicting Vista on the world before it was ready , and allegedly using undue influence to secure endorsement of its OOXML file format as an ISO standard .
With the rebirth of Apple and the rise of both the Mac and iPhone , it is therefore not surprising that lots of people have latched onto the ‘ Church of Jobs ’ as an alternative that will ultimately save us from the evil ‘ M $ ’ empire .
Indeed in some segments of the press and IT professional community , there is a prevailing view that anything Apple does has to be good , and anyone who does n’t ‘ get ’ how great Apple is must be either stupid or brainwashed by those from the ‘ dark side ’ .
Meanwhile , those of us making a more objective assessment of what ’s going on look at how Apple ’s business is evolving and see a lot of similar traits to those that were apparent as Microsoft was gaining power .
While ‘ A $ ’ does n’t work quite as well as ‘ M $ ’ as a shorthand for depicting hard - nosed commercial behaviour with the profit motive at its core , anyone who thinks Apple is not trying to exploit its brand strength and the dependencies between its offerings as much as it can to extract money from us is probably being a tad naive .
So how comfortable are we that Apple is really the warm , cuddly and open company many would have us believe ?
Well as it turns out , a lot of Reg Readers are not that comfortable .
When we gave respondents in our recent annual barometer survey the opportunity to comment on some deliberately controversial issues , 549 of them provided an opinion on the question of whether Apple or Microsoft could be considered more closed .
OK , we admit this was a bit leading as survey questions go , but the responses were nevertheless very interesting , not least because most of the criticism was levelled at Apple .
When we analysed the feedback , while 21 % said Microsoft was more closed , and 24 % said there was n’t anything to choose between the two , the majority , 55 % , gave the prize for lack of openness to Apple .
The most frequently cited reason for regarding Apple as closed was the end - to - end proprietary nature of its offerings , which tie hardware to software to services and in a way that is thought to restrict choice and interoperability .
Whether it ’s OS X being wedded to the Mac , the iPod being dependent on the iTunes service , or iPhone software distribution being controlled via the Apple Store , there is a strong perception that openness is not always the biggest priority for Apple .
For developers in particular , this end - to - end proprietary approach appears to be a big turn - off , which is interesting given that one of the most frequently cited strengths of the Mac , for example , is the Unix foundation that underpins OS X , which is generally considered to be an indicator of openness and compliance with standards .
One developer explained this paradox by describing Apple as “ closing open software ” .
In terms of specifics , references were made to lack of transparency with regard to proprietary API specifications , and being secretive about known faults , vulnerabilities , and so on – behaviour that Microsoft simply could not get away with nowadays without drawing fire from its customers or the regulator .
Here are some quotes from readers to illustrate the kind of feedback we received in this area :
“ Poor tech docs . "
" Ever tried getting an API definition out of them ? "
“ MS appears more willing to provide good documentation for APIs , SDKs , etc . ”
" Lack of transparency and constant denial of obvious problems . "
" Apple never admits to mistakes / vulnerabilities ( even MS does that ) . "
" At least MS admits security flaws in the software instead of brushing it under the carpet ! "
Strong evidence has emerged of children and adults being used as slaves in Sudan 's Darfur region , a study says .
Kidnapped men have been forced to work on farmland controlled by Janjaweed militias , a coalition of African charities says .
Eyewitnesses also say the Sudanese army has been involved in abducting women and children to be sex slaves and domestic staff for troops in Khartoum .
But Khartoum said the report was " very naive " and called the authors ignorant .
" The government does not condone abductions and it is not government policy , " a government spokesman told the BBC .
" We are working hard to stop such violations .
The rebel factions are mostly to blame for abductions in Darfur . "
Being in a refugee camp is no safeguard against attack Up to 300,000 people have died since conflict began in Darfur in 2003 and at least 2.7 million people have fled their homes .
Thousands of people from non-Arabic speaking ethnic groups in Darfur have been targeted , says the report , published by the Darfur Consortium on Wednesday .
The group of 50 charities says it has around 100 eyewitness accounts from former abductees .
Victims have been rounded up during joint attacks on villages by the Arabic - speaking Janjaweed and the Sudanese Armed Forces , according to the study .
Civilians are also tortured and killed while their villages are razed to ethnically cleanse areas , which are then repopulated with Arabic - speaking people , including nomads from Chad , Niger , Mali and Cameroon , it says .
They were kept telling us that we are not human beings and we are here to serve them
Testimony from unnamed boy Most of the abductees are women and girls , but there is new evidence in Darfur of kidnappers targeting men and boys for forced agricultural labour , says the report .
The abducted women and girls , meanwhile , are raped and forced to marry their captors as well as carry out household chores and sometimes cultivate crops , according to the study .
' Regular beatings '
The report includes the testimony of children forced to become domestic workers .
Kidnapped children are made domestic slaves , says the study
One boy said he had suffered regular beatings from his Janjaweed abductors .
" They were treating me and the other boys very badly , they kept telling us that we are not human beings and we are here to serve them , I also worked on their farms , " he said .
A woman said she was kidnapped from a refugee camp and her captors " used us like their wives in the night and during the day we worked all the time .
" The men they abducted with us were used to look after their livestock .
We worked all day , all week with no rest . "
Sudan 's government has always denied the existence of slavery in the country , although Khartoum has previously admitted abductions occurred in the north - south civil war of 1983 - 2005 , when up to 14,000 people were kidnapped .
The report calls for the joint UN - AU force to be beefed - up But a senior Sudanese politician who did not wanted to be named said kidnappings had also occurred more recently in Darfur .
" The army captured many children and women hiding in the bush outside burnt villages , " he told the report 's authors .
" They were transported by plane to Khartoum at night and divided up among soldiers as domestic workers and , in some cases , wives . "
Call to action
The report urged Sudan 's government to disband the Janjaweed and other militia and to fully co-operate with the United Nations and the African Union .
Dismas Nkunda , co-chair of the Darfur Consortium , said : " Urgent action is clearly required to prevent further abductions and associated human rights violations , and to release and assist those who are still being held . "
The study also calls for the mandate of the joint United Nations - African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur ( Unamid ) to be beefed up so it can use force to protect civilians .
The Darfur Consortium also wants Khartoum to prosecute all those responsible for abductions and ban them from holding public office .
It notes that no - one has ever been arrested over the wave of kidnappings .

While expectations may be high that the incoming Obama administration will reverse many of the worst features of the Bush regime–from warrantless wiretapping , illegal detention , torture , “ targeted assassinations ” and preemptive war–now that the cheering has stopped , expect more of the same .
According to The Wall Street Journal , “ President - elect Barack Obama is unlikely to radically overhaul controversial Bush administration intelligence policies , advisers say , an approach that is almost certain to create tension within the Democratic Party . ”
With hyperbolic “ change ” rhetoric in the air , Obama is relying on a gaggle of former intelligence insiders , warmed - over Clinton administration officials and “ moderate ” Republicans , many of whom helped Bush craft his administration ’s illegal policies .
With U.S. street cred at an all - time low , due in no small measure to Washington ’s hubristic fantasies that it really is an empire and not a rapidly decaying failed state , ruling elites have literally banked on Obama to deliver the goods .
During his run for the White House , the Illinois senator may have mildly criticized some of the administration ’s so - called “ counterterrorism ” policies including the Bushist penchant for secrecy , the disappearance of “ terrorist ” suspects , driftnet surveillance of American citizens and legal residents , CIA “ black site ” gulags and the crushing of domestic dissent .
But in the few scant days since the November 4 general election , the contours of what Democratic party corporatist grifters will roll - out come January 20 are taking shape .
Citing Obama ’s carefully - crafted public relations blitz on the campaign trail opposing illegal spying , the Journal reports :
Yet he … voted for a White House - backed law to expand eavesdropping powers for the National Security Agency .
Mr. Obama said he opposed providing legal immunity to telecommunications companies that aided warrantless surveillance , but ultimately voted for the bill , which included an immunity provision .
The new president could take a similar approach to revising the rules for CIA interrogations , said one current government official familiar with the transition .
Upon review , Mr. Obama may decide he wants to keep the road open in certain cases for the CIA to use techniques not approved by the military , but with much greater oversight .
( Siobhan Gorman , “ Intelligence Policy to Stay Largely Intact , ” The Wall Street Journal , November 11 , 2008 )
The “ current government official ” cited by the Journal fails to specify precisely what it means to “ keep the road open ” when it comes to torturing prisoners of war in violation of the Geneva Conventions .
Considering that top Bush administration officials “ repeatedly discussed and approved specific details of exactly how high - value al Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the Central Intelligence Agency , ” as ABC News reported back in April , and that “ high - level discussions about these ‘ enhanced interrogation techniques ’ were so detailed … some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed –down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic , ” one is left to ponder what “ much greater oversight ” would actually mean .
Perhaps such “ oversight ” entails a cosmetic shake - up at the top rungs of U.S. intelligence agencies ?
The Washington Post reports that “ The nation ’s top two intelligence officers expect to be replaced by President - elect Barack Obama early in his administration , according to senior intelligence officials . ”
But would the replacement of Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell , a former admiral who oversaw spooky Booz Allen Hamilton corporate contracts with the “ intelligence community , ” and CIA Director Michael V. Hayden , an Air Force general who implemented Bushist warrantless wiretapping programs while NSA Director , represent “ change ” or continuity ?
While some Democrats may oppose retaining America ’s top spooks because of their public support of Bushist policies , “ other Democrats and many intelligence experts , ” according to the Post “ give high marks to the current cadre of intelligence leaders , crediting them with restoring stability and professionalism to a community rocked by multiple scandals in recent years . ”
With a subtext arguing in favor of retaining McConnell and Hayden , Post journalists Walter Pincus ( who has a dubious history of collaboration with the CIA as researchers Daniel Brandt and Steve Badrich note ) and Karen DeYoung , cite unnamed “ intelligence officials ” who think their early departure “ could be seen as politicizing their offices and setting a precedent for automatic turnover when the White House changes hands . ”
Hilariously ( though I ’m not laughing ) , Pincus and DeYoung cite the case of Bush ’s retention of George J. Tenet as CIA Director as a “ stabilizing move , ” one viewed favorably within the Agency .
Tenet , a Clinton appointee and political insider was a primary architect of intelligence forgeries , along with Bushist minions in the Pentagon and the Office of the Vice President when “ the intelligence and the facts were being fixed around the policy , ” prior to the 2003 U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq .
According to the Post , both men have expressed interest in keeping their perches atop the U.S. “ intelligence community . ”
And why would n’t they ?
According to Secrecy News the October 28 release by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence revealed that the 2008 budget for the National Intelligence Program amounted to $ 47.5 billion , not counting an additional $ 10 billion in spending on the Pentagon ’s Military Intelligence Program .
It should be kept in mind the $ 57.5 billion does n’t include the Pentagon and other intelligence agency ’s “ black budget ” for undisclosed programs and “ special operations ” hidden within ultra-secretive “ special access programs ” ( SAPs ) kept off the books .
According to defense and security analyst William M. Arkin ,
There are also additional categories “ above ” Top Secret called “ special access programs ” that are used to protect presidential , military , intelligence , anti-terrorism , counter - drug , special operations , and “ sensitive activities , ” as well as classified research and development efforts where it is deemed that extraordinary secrecy is needed to protect capabilities and vulnerabilities .
Special access programs are regulated by statute and are defined as deliberately designated programs where “ need - to - know ” or access controls beyond those normally provided to classified information are created .
The clearance and access requirements are identical to , or exceed , those required for access to sensitive compartmented information , and SAPs require special ( and expensive ) security , access , and communications measures .
( William M. Arkin , Code Names : Deciphering U.S. Military Plans , Programs , and Operations in the 9/11 World , Hanover , NH : Steerforth Press , 2005 , p.18 )
Additionally , we have no way of determining what other secret slush funds are available to the “ intelligence community ” from a welter of illegal ventures such as the laundering of illicit funds by CIA intelligence assets in Afghanistan , Pakistan , the Balkans , Colombia and Mexico .
Derived from the international narcotics trade and “ cleansed ” as they pass through a series of off - shore banks and U.S. financial institutions , far - right narcotrafficking assets involved in the murder of trade unionists , journalists , leftist opponents or indeed , the 9/11 attacks which kick - started America ’s “ war on terror , ” are readily available for planetary - wide U.S. “ special operations . ”
The Obama intelligence transition team is led by former National Counterterrorism chief John Brennan and former CIA intelligence analysis director Jami Miscik , according to the Journal .
But what the Journal fails to mention however , is that Brennan was a former president and CEO of the The Analysis Corporation ( TAC ) and the first chairman of the Intelligence and National Security Alliance ( INSA ) , as investigative journalist Tim Shorrock reported in his essential book , Spies For Hire .
Much of TAC ’s business is with with the National Counterterrorism Center ( NCTC ) where Brennan worked for three years .
As Shorrock points outs , “ In fact , the NCTC is one of the company ’s largest customers , and TAC provides counterterrorism support to ‘ most of the agencies within the Intelligence Community , ’ according to a company press release . ”
During the 1990s , TAC developed the U.S. government ’s first terrorist database , called Tipoff , for the State Department .
In 2003 , management of the database was transferred to the NCTC which Brennan managed .
By 2005 Tipoff had morphed into the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment ( TIDE ) , the mother of all federal counterterrorism databases and the “ wellspring ” for watch lists distributed to airlines , law enforcement , border posts and U.S. consulates world - wide .
According to Shorrock , in 2005 TAC won a $ 2.3 million contract in partnership with CACI International “ to integrate information from the Defense Intelligence Agency into the TIDE database . ”
INSA , according to Shorrock is one of three “ business associations representing intelligence contractors ” and the “ one with the closet ties to the government , ” which “ primarily represents contractors working for the NSA and the CIA . ”
And SourceWatch reports that among INSA ’s leading members can be found such corporate heavy - hitters as the scandal - plagued BAE Systems , Booz Allen Hamilton , Computer Science Corporation , General Dynamics , Hewlett - Packard Company , Lockheed Martin , ManTech International Corporation , Microsoft and Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) .
Indeed , current DNI Mike McConnell , was INSA chairman between 2005 - 2007 before heading up the Office of National Intelligence .
According the The Washington Post , Brennan “ is one of several names that have surfaced , including Sen. Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb. ) , as possible replacements for McConnell or Hayden . ”
One can almost hear the clink of glasses amid popping corks in corporate suites across Virginia and Washington !
What do we know about Jami Miscik , Obama ’s other intelligence transition team leader ?
According to the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , Miscik “ served as Director for Intelligence Programs at the National Security Council during the Clinton Administration from 1995 to 1996 . ”
In the run up to the Iraq war , Miscik played a key role in concocting fake intelligence about Iraq ’s alleged “ weapons of mass destruction ” and “ links ” to al Qaeda that were used by the Bush administration to sell the war to the American people .
During this period , as head of the CIA ’s analytical division she suppressed reports from Company analysts that rejected Bushist claims as unfounded .
More recently , Miscik was “ the Global Head of Sovereign Risk at Lehman Brothers ” according to the CFR .
“ In this capacity , ” Miscik ’s biographers write with a straight face , “ she assesses geopolitical and economic risks for the firm ’s senior management and clients . ”
But with the multi-billion dollar collapse of Lehman Brothers amid allegations of massive fraud and management corruption , the failed firm is now under investigation for dodgy “ structured products ” and “ mini- bonds . ”
One can only wonder what advice the incoming Obama administration would seek from Miscik or indeed from CFR !
Once the Obama team is in place come January 20 , will the crimes of the Bush regime be investigated by Congress or will gross criminality be prosecuted by a new team at the Department of Justice ?
Do n’t hold your breath .
The Washington Post reports that while “ political considerations affected every crevice of the department during the Bush years , ” Ron Klain , Al Gore ’s former chief of staff who now occupies that position for Vice President - elect Joe Biden , dismissed calls to overhaul the Department and compared “ preelection brainstorming sessions of Democrats ” to “ an escalating composition of woes . ”
Post reporter Carrie Johnson writes ,
Obama will have to do a careful balancing act .
At a conference in Washington this week , former department criminal division chief Robert S. Litt asked that the new administration avoid fighting old battles that could be perceived as vindictive , such as seeking to prosecute government officials involved in decisions about interrogation and the gathering of domestic intelligence .
Human rights groups have called for such investigations , as has House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) .
“ It would not be beneficial to spend a lot of time calling people up to Congress or in front of grand juries , ” Litt said .
“ It would really spend a lot of the bipartisan capital Obama managed to build up . ” ( Carrie Johnson , “ Obama Team Face Major Task in Justice Dept. Overhaul , ” The Washington Post , November 13 , 2008 )
But as we ’ve come to expect from the corporate media , Johnson failed to investigate Litt ’s own conflicts of interest when it comes to probing Bushist crimes by CIA and other intelligence officials .
As Glenn Greenwald observes , “ This brazen defense of lawlessness articulated by Litt is now as close to a unanimous , bipartisan consensus across the political establishment as it gets . ”
Indeed ,
Litt ’s argument in favor of impunity for mass murder , torture and lawless spying by high political officials , particularly the President and those closet to him such as Vice President Richard Cheney , mean they literally are exempt from the rule of law .
Greenwald reports that during his tenure at the Justice Department as the head of the criminal division under Bill Clinton , Litt
… spent much of his career as a federal prosecutor , aggressively prosecuting and imprisoning all sorts of ordinary Americans .
He was one of the most vocal advocates for prohibiting government - proof encryption technology in order to preserve the Government ’s ability to access people ’s computer communications as part of criminal investigations , and was part of a Clinton DOJ that very aggressively pursued even garden - variety drug cases and used mandatory sentencing guidelines to ensure harsher sentences for common criminals .
( Glenn Greenwald , “ Post - Partisan Harmony vs. the Rule of Law , Salon , November 13 , 2008 )
While prosecuting and imprisoning low - level drug offenders and the poor is an absolute moral obligation for Litt and his ilk , hauling lawbreaking corporate and political clients before a court of law , like the impeachment of felons occupying high - office , is “ off the table . ”
Greenwald points out that as a partner at Arnold & Porter , an “ up - armored ” corporate legal behemoth , the company brazenly announced on Litt ’s Arnold & Porter page that he represented several employees of intelligence agencies “ in connection with criminal investigations .
None has been charged . ”
While the Post may depict him as an objective analyst , Litt is no more than a shill for well - heeled , “ covered ” clients .
Indeed , if he represents CIA , NSA or White House officials involved in illegal intelligence and surveillance programs Greenwald writes , “ that obviously motivates his insistence that investigations not be pursued . ”
And so it goes …
Memo to Obama supporters : the new product roll - out is a smashing success , “ change ” has come to Washington , the corporate grift continues .

Yesterday while out shopping in Beverly Hills , this famous actress tried very hard to disguise herself from the paparazzi .
Can you guess who it is ?
Could it be Jessica Simpson , Britney Spears , Heather Locklear ?
Take a stroll to the next page to see who it is .
This gorgeous actress tried very hard to keep the photographers from getting a good shot and we think she should have ditched the hat and scarf and showed off her amazing looks .
If you guessed Desperate Housewives star Nicollette Sheridan , then you are correct .
How she keeps looking so young at age 45 is beyond us .
She should write a book on all of her beauty secrets - it would probably be a # 1 best seller .

Gordon Brown 's government did reward the Democratic Unionists for backing the 42 - day detention of terror suspects , Northern Ireland 's first minister claimed today .
In his new year message , DUP leader Peter Robinson said his party 's decision to support the 42 - days bill helped deliver major economic investment for the province .
But Robinson repeated an earlier denial that his party had sought or been granted political favours for backing the prime minister before the crucial Westminster vote on the issue in June .
Robinson said the decision had proved the DUP was a responsible party and that the government later " bent over backwards to help " it .
The House of Commons split by 315 votes to 306 over the controversial counter - terrorism bill – with the DUP 's nine MPs securing a crucial victory for the government .
The bill was defeated in the House of Lords in October .
Brown denied his government had bought the DUP votes and today Robinson said his party had simply done the right thing .
" It would have been much easier to vote with the Conservative party than to vote with the government , " he said .
" We did what was right .
And I think we showed at the same time that our votes matter at Westminster .
" We showed we are a party that can determine a major issue – perhaps the most major issue of the last year at Westminster . "
He added : " We neither sought nor received any pay - off for that .
But I think we have seen since then that if you act responsibly with government , government in turn will act responsibly with you . "
In July it was announced that Bombardier Aerospace was investing half a billion pounds in Northern Ireland , sustaining more than 800 jobs at the Shorts aircraft factory in Robinson 's East Belfast constituency .
" They [ the government ] came up with the goods in terms of the Bombardier deal ... which was the largest single investment in Northern Ireland , " Robinson said .
" But they bent over backwards to help us . "
In November a £ 900 m financial deal to kickstart Northern Ireland 's devolved government was finalised after talks involving Brown .
Robinson said : " Would we have got the £ 900 m if we had been irresponsible in the way that we behaved at Westminster ?
I think there is a recognition that if you are seen to be acting responsibly , then people will act responsibly with you . "
He said the government had also brought forward legislation to compensate Orange Order halls attacked by arsonists and accepted DUP changes to the proposals .
The first minister added : " We did n't ask for any of those things .
We recognised that if people saw that we were behaving responsibly , that we were a credible party at Westminster , that they could deal with , that people would deal with us in a way that was helpful to the electorate in Northern Ireland .
" But there is no link between the two – other than the fact that people knew that when we asked for something , we genuinely had a good reason for doing so . "
EEGs show brain differences between poor and rich kids
University of California , Berkeley , researchers have shown for the first time that the brains of low - income children function differently from the brains of high - income kids .
In a study recently accepted for publication by the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience , scientists at UC Berkeley 's Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute and the School of Public Health report that normal 9 - and 10 - year - olds differing only in socioeconomic status have detectable differences in the response of their prefrontal cortex , the part of the brain that is critical for problem solving and creativity .
( Lee Michael Perry / UC Berkeley )
Brain function was measured by means of an electroencephalograph ( EEG ) - basically , a cap fitted with electrodes to measure electrical activity in the brain - like that used to assess epilepsy , sleep disorders and brain tumors .
" Kids from lower socioeconomic levels show brain physiology patterns similar to someone who actually had damage in the frontal lobe as an adult , " said Robert Knight , director of the institute and a UC Berkeley professor of psychology .
" We found that kids are more likely to have a low response if they have low socioeconomic status , though not everyone who is poor has low frontal lobe response . "
Previous studies have shown a possible link between frontal lobe function and behavioral differences in children from low and high socioeconomic levels , but according to cognitive psychologist Mark Kishiyama , first author of the new paper , " those studies were only indirect measures of brain function and could not disentangle the effects of intelligence , language proficiency and other factors that tend to be associated with low socioeconomic status .
Our study is the first with direct measure of brain activity where there is no issue of task complexity . "
Co-author W. Thomas Boyce , UC Berkeley professor emeritus of public health who currently is the British Columbia Leadership Chair of Child Development at the University of British Columbia ( UBC ) , is not surprised by the results .
" We know kids growing up in resource - poor environments have more trouble with the kinds of behavioral control that the prefrontal cortex is involved in regulating .
But the fact that we see functional differences in prefrontal cortex response in lower socioeconomic status kids is definitive . "
Boyce , a pediatrician and developmental psychobiologist , heads a joint UC Berkeley / UBC research program called WINKS - Wellness in Kids - that looks at how the disadvantages of growing up in low socioeconomic circumstances change children 's basic neural development over the first several years of life .
" This is a wake - up call , " Knight said .
" It 's not just that these kids are poor and more likely to have health problems , but they might actually not be getting full brain development from the stressful and relatively impoverished environment associated with low socioeconomic status : fewer books , less reading , fewer games , fewer visits to museums . "
Kishiyama , Knight and Boyce suspect that the brain differences can be eliminated by proper training .
They are collaborating with UC Berkeley neuroscientists who use games to improve the prefrontal cortex function , and thus the reasoning ability , of school - age children .
" It 's not a life sentence , " Knight emphasized .
" We think that with proper intervention and training , you could get improvement in both behavioral and physiological indices . "
( Mark Kishiyama / UC Berkeley )
Kishiyama , Knight , Boyce and their colleagues selected 26 children ages 9 and 10 from a group of children in the WINKS study .
Half were from families with low incomes and half from families with high incomes .
For each child , the researchers measured brain activity while he or she was engaged in a simple task : watching a sequence of triangles projected on a screen .
The subjects were instructed to click a button when a slightly skewed triangle flashed on the screen .
The researchers were interested in the brain 's very early response - within as little as 200 milliseconds , or a fifth of a second - after a novel picture was flashed on the screen , such as a photo of a puppy or of Mickey and Minnie Mouse .
" An EEG allows us to measure very fast brain responses with millisecond accuracy , " Kishiyama said .
The researchers discovered a dramatic difference in the response of the prefrontal cortex not only when an unexpected image flashed on the screen , but also when children were merely watching the upright triangles waiting for a skewed triangle to appear .
Those from low socioeconomic environments showed a lower response to the unexpected novel stimuli in the prefrontal cortex that was similar , Kishiyama said , to the response of people who have had a portion of their frontal lobe destroyed by a stroke .
" When paying attention to the triangles , the prefrontal cortex helps you process the visual stimuli better .
And the prefrontal cortex is even more involved in detecting novelty , like the unexpected photographs , " he said .
But in both cases , " the low socioeconomic kids were not detecting or processing the visual stimuli as well .
They were not getting that extra boost from the prefrontal cortex . "
" These kids have no neural damage , no prenatal exposure to drugs and alcohol , no neurological damage , " Kishiyama said .
" Yet , the prefrontal cortex is not functioning as efficiently as it should be .
This difference may manifest itself in problem solving and school performance . "
The researchers suspect that stressful environments and cognitive impoverishment are to blame , since in animals , stress and environmental deprivation have been shown to affect the prefrontal cortex .
UC Berkeley 's Marian Diamond , professor of integrative biology , showed nearly 20 years ago in rats that enrichment thickens the cerebral cortex as it improves test performance .
And as Boyce noted , previous studies have shown that children from poor families hear 30 million fewer words by the time they are four than do kids from middle - class families .
" In work that we and others have done , it really looks like something as simple and easily done as talking to your kids " can boost prefrontal cortex performance , Boyce said .
" We are certainly not blaming lower socioeconomic families for not talking to their kids - there are probably a zillion reasons why that happens , " he said .
" But changing developmental outcomes might involve something as accessible as helping parents to understand that it is important that kids sit down to dinner with their parents , and that over the course of that dinner it would be good for there to be a conversation and people saying things to each other . "
" The study is suggestive and a little bit frightening that environmental conditions have such a strong impact on brain development , " said Silvia Bunge , UC Berkeley assistant professor of psychology who is leading the intervention studies on prefrontal cortex development in teenagers by using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
Boyce 's UBC colleague , Adele Diamond , showed last year that 5 - and 6 - year - olds with impaired executive functioning , that is , poor problem solving and reasoning abilities , can improve their academic performance with the help of special activities , including dramatic play .
Bunge hopes that , with fMRI , she can show improvements in academic performance as a result of these games , actually boosting the activity of the prefrontal cortex .
" People have tried for a long time to train reasoning , largely unsuccessfully , " Bunge said .
" Our question is , ' Can we replicate these initial findings and at the same time give kids the tools to succeed ? ' "
This research is supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health .

Yukon Eric was already headed back to the dressing room with a towel wrapped around his head .
The ref put the ear in his pocket and said , " What should I do ? " I said , " Raise my arm .
I 'm the only one left . "
A few days later , I went to get paid at the wrestling office .
They asked me to go to the hospital and apologize .
Apologize ?
I never apologized in my life .
But I went to the hospital .
There were a bunch of newspaper reporters in the hallway .
But I got inside his room .
Yukon Eric was sitting on the edge of the bed with bandages wrapped around his head .
What could I say ?
All I could think of was , " Humpty - Dumpty sat on the wall .
Humpty - Dumpty had a great fall . "
It was the first thing that came to mind .
He looked up and smiled .
I started to laugh .
What else could you do ?
But the only thing the reporters outside could hear was the sound of my laughter .
The next day , the newspapers were filled with stories of me laughing at the sight of Yukon Eric 's missing ear .
When I walked to the ring the next week , people were throwing bottles at me .
" You 're nothing but a killer ! " someone screamed .
From that moment on , I was Killer Kowalski .
I had more than six thousand matches .
As I walked into the ring before every one of them , I meditated .
I visualized an image of Jesus casting his light over the ring and the crowd .
Someone once threw a pig 's ear at me .
A woman once came up to me after a match and said , " I 'm glad you did n't get hurt . "
Then she stabbed me in the back with a knife .
After a while , I got police escorts to and from the ring .
I 've been a vegetarian fifty - three years now .
Lots of vitamins .
No milk .
Little or no cheese .
Here 's how I invented the Iron Claw .
I would drive between matches with a tennis ball in my lap .
I 've got the wheel in one hand and I 'm squeezing the tennis ball with the other .
Squeeze .
Squeeze .
Squeeze .
Then I 'd switch hands .
After a couple of months , I had a tremendous grip .
I 'd put my thumb in the guy 's solar plexus , and he 'd scream in agony .
People said , " Yeah , but how 's the Iron Claw gonna work on Haystack Calhoun ? "
He was about six hundred pounds .
I 'll tell you what happened .
I got him on his back in the middle of the ring .
I 'm on my knees , and I put a claw hold on his stomach .
I put it on so hard to get through all that blubber that I was screaming .
Well , he farted .
The fumes were so devastating , I started to pass out .
He rolled over , jumped on top of me , and pinned me .
It was the best move he had .
A lot of women proposed to me over the years -- from all over the world .
I was in Australia once .
A woman said , " Take me with you . "
I said , " I can 't . "
She said , " Why not ? " I said , " You do n't fit in my suitcase . "
To be a professional wrestler , you 've got to be able to talk .
I learned by arguing with the radio as I drove between matches .
The announcer would say , " It 's a beautiful day .
Eighty - two degrees . "
And I 'd start screaming back , " Lies ! Lies !
Lies !
Never has the temperature been lower than it is today ! "
I 'd be going at it with the radio all day long .
Classical .
Mozart especially .
Of course I can show you how to do it !
Is there a steel chair around here ?
A sad thing happened to Yukon Eric .
He was always on the road .
Some guy convinced Yukon Eric 's wife to take all his money out of their account and take off .
After he found out , he went to the church where they 'd been married and committed suicide .
I got married for the first time last year .
On June 19 .
People ask me , " How can you get married now ?
You 're seventy - nine years old .
And Theresa will be seventy - eight in September . "
I say , " What could I do ?
She told me she was pregnant . "
Our honeymoon ?
We 're still on it .
If I had to do it all over again -- I 'd be an electrical engineer .

The Myth Makers 1 : Scala 's " Type Types "
by Martin Odersky
December 18 , 2008
Summary
Busting some myths that have sprung up around Scala .
Advertisement
2008 has seen a lot of activity around Scala .
All major IDEs now have working Scala plugins .
A complete Scala tutorial and reference book was published and several others are in the pipeline .
Scala is used in popular environments and frameworks , and is being adopted by more and more professional programmers in organizations like Twitter , Sony Imageworks , and Nature , along with many others .
It 's also a sign of growing momentum that well - known commentators like Ted Neward , Daniel Spiewak and the JavaPosse have covered Scala in depth .
Other bloggers have argued more from the outside , without really getting into Scala all that deeply .
I find the latter also useful , because it shows how Scala is perceived in other parts of the programming community .
But sometimes , initial misconceptions can create myths which stand in the way of deeper understanding .
So , as an effort of engaging in the debate , let me address in a series of blog posts some of the myths that have sprung up in the last months around and about Scala .
I 'll start with a post by Steve Yegge .
Like many of Steve 's blogs , this one is quite funny , but that does not make it true .
Steve ( in his own words ) " disses " Scala as " Frankenstein 's Monster " because " there are type types , and type type types " .
( Do n't ask me what that means ! )
In fact , it seems he took a look at the Scala Language Specification , and found its systematic use of types intimidating .
I can sympathize with that .
A specification is not a tutorial .
Its purpose is to give compiler writers some common ground on which to base their implementations .
This is not just a theoretical nicety : the implementation of JetBrains ' Scala compiler for IntelliJ makes essential use of the language specification ; that 's how they can match our standard Scala compiler pretty closely .
The other purpose of a specification is that " language lawyers " - people who know the language deeply - can resolve issues of differing interpretations .
Both groups of people value precision over extensive prose .
Scala 's way of achieving precision in the spec is to be rather formal and to express all aspects of compile - time knowledge as types .
That 's a notational trick which let us keep the Scala spec within 150 pages - compared to , for instance , the 600 pages of the Java Language Specification .
The way a spec is written has nothing to do with the experience of programmers .
Programmers generally find Scala 's type system helpful in a sophisticated way .
It 's smart enough to infer many type annotations that Java programmers have to write .
It 's flexible enough to let them express APIs any way they like .
And it 's pragmatic enough to offer easy access to dynamic typing where required .
In fact Scala 's types get out of the way so much that Scala was invited to be a contender in last JavaOne 's Script Bowl , which is normally a shootout for scripting languages .
But Steve 's rant was not really about technical issues anyway .
He makes it clear that this is just one move in a match between statically and dynamically typed languages .
He seems to see this as something like a rugby match ( or rather football match in the US ) , where to score you need just one player who makes it to the ground line .
Steve 's on the dynamically typed side , pushing Rhino as the Next Big Language .
Java is the 800 - Pound Gorilla on the statically typed side .
Steve thinks he has Java covered , because its type system makes it an easy target .
Then out of left field comes another statically typed language that 's much more nimble and agile .
So he needs to do a quick dash to block it .
If he can't get at the programming experience , it must be the complexity of the specification .
This is a bit like saying you should stay away from cars with antilock braking systems because the internal workings of such systems are sophisticated !
Not quite surprisingly , a number of other bloggers have taken Steve 's rather lighthearted jokes as the truth without bothering to check the details too much and then have added their own myths to it .
I 'll write about some of them in the next weeks .
Talk Back !

A burning car was rammed into a synagogue door in southwest France as the interior minister convened Muslims , Jews and police in Paris to warn against contagion from the Gaza conflict .
Damage to the synagogue in a Toulouse neighborhood was limited to a blackened door , and there were no injuries even though a rabbi was giving a course to adults inside , said an official of the regional prefecture , Anne - Gaelle Baudouin .
Police called to the scene found remnants of a Molotov cocktail in the car and a car nearby with three unlighted Molotov cocktails , Baudouin said .
Violence in Europe Gaza op prompts wave of anti-Semitism in Belgium Yael Levy Protests against Israeli operation in Gaza give rise to violent attacks against Jews across country .
Jews now live in fear here , says Jewish Agency envoy in Antwerp Gaza op prompts wave of anti-Semitism in Belgium
It was not clear whether the incident Monday night was in any way a reflection of frustrations in France as Mideast tensions rise .
France has western Europe 's largest Muslim and Jewish communities .
Nevertheless Interior Minister Michele Alliot - Marie said she was concerned about the prospect of contagion .
She held a meeting late Monday with the heads of the two main Muslim and Jewish groups and police officials to stress the need to " preserve national unity " so that the conflict between Israel and Hamas , the militant Palestinian group ruling Gaza , did not feed passions in France .
Anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim incidents in France have risen in the past when Mideast tensions mounted significantly .
In 2002 , some 2,300 Jews left France for Israel because they felt unsafe .
Incidents of Islamophobia also have been reported .
Alliot - Marie asked the French Council for the Muslim Faith and the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France , or CRIF , for " special vigilance " given the " tense international context , " a ministry statement said .
At least 21,000 people protesting the Israeli offensive in Gaza marched through Paris on Saturday , shouting " We are all Palestinians " and " Israel assassin . "
A group of some 500 later turned violent , burning Israeli flags , torching cars and vandalizing several shops , police said .
A group calling itself the National Bureau of Vigilance Against Anti-Semitism said in a statement that all such gatherings should be banned because they " incite violence , hate and put the ... Jewish community in danger . "
President Nicolas Sarkozy , meanwhile , was on a two - day mission to the Middle East hoping to encourage a temporary cease - fire between Israel and the Hamas organization ruling Gaza .
New Bush rule could hit poor , rural women the hardest David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday December 3 , 2008

The Bush administration is reportedly planning as one of its final actions to announce a " right of conscience " rule that could further limit access to abortion , particularly for poor and rural women , and might even impact a much broader range of medical procedures .
" We should call this the ' Amish bus - driver rule , ' " fumed MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow .
" If you 're Amish and your values and your beliefs will not allow you to operate an automobile , then surely that 's your inalienable right -- but consequently , you will not be hired to drive a bus . "
The rule would apply to over 500,000 facilities nationwide and would allow all healthcare workers -- not just doctors and pharmacists but potentially even janitors -- to refuse to participate in any procedure they find morally objectionable .
Maddow turned for comment to Princeton professor and reproductive rights activist Melissa Harris - Lacewell , asking , " Do you see this as a major setback for reproductive rights ? "
" Absolutely , " Harris - Lacewell agreed , although she emphasized that " this right to conscience is not just about reproductive rights " because it could potentially affect everyone .
" This could have a huge impact , " she stated .
" You want your doctor to be making choices based on medical needs , based on the health of the patient ... not on these moral ' conscience ' questions .
...
We want to make sure that as a nation these kinds of decisions are not being legislated out by these broad opt - out rules . "
Harris - Lacewell explained that regulations like this " right of conscience " rule have " been the new strategy of those who have been opposed to women 's reproductive rights .
...
Rather than fight this out in the courts ... what you do is limit access .
You limit the education that doctors are getting in medical school .
You limit the ability of these doctors to practice in various states and localities .
You just keep reducing , reducing , reducing . "
" That has a disproportionate effect on poor women , on rural women , " Harris - Lacewell stated .
" Women who have private health insurance , women who have private physicians , tend to have plenty of access to a variety of reproductive rights options .
Poor women and women with less access are the ones hit hardest . "

Hello
Here is the latest Caml Weekly News , for the week of January 13 to 20 , 2009 .
React 0.9.0
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/88435fddcac27fbf#
I 'd like to announce the following module .
React is an OCaml module for functional reactive programming ( frp ) .
It provides support to program with time varying values : applicative events and signals .
React does n't define any primitive event or signal , this lets the client chooses the concrete timeline .
React is made of a single , independent , module and distributed under the new BSD license .
Project home page : http://erratique.ch/software/react
Although the code is feature complete and has been tested it has not been in large scale programs yet .
A stable 1.0.0 will be published once I feel we have the right api .
Your reactions are welcome , Daniel P.S. Various incarnations of frp ( frtime , yampa , flapjax , ocamlrt , reactive ) helped to implement React , thanks to their authors for sharing their source .
P.P.S. Here 's the answer to the forthcoming question about how React compares to ocamlrt .
Following are the points I think are different and worth mentioning .
But as I do n't claim to have a thorough understanding of how ocamlrt works feel free to correct me or make additions .
ocamlrt used to be located at http://users.wpi.edu/~squirrel/repos/ocamlrt2
but recently vanished .
The version at http://code.google.com/p/ocamlrt seems to be an older one .
* React does n't use the object system .
ocamlrt uses it internally .
* React does n't use any global data structures .
Care is still needed in multithreaded environments ( see docs ) , but React is more thread and modular friendly .
* React treats constant signals separately via smart constructors , they are not part of the dataflow graph .
* React uses weak pointers in the dataflow graph 's forward dependencies and in the update queue to prevent space leaks .
ocamlrt leaks .
* React uses client provided functions to test signal value equality .
ocamlrt does n't deal correctly with effectful signals .
Correctly means no value change ( according to equality ) , no update , no effect .
* React has most of pervasives ' functions on ints , floats and booleans already lifted in specific modules that may be opened in a given context .
* React is ( and will be ) only a pure OCaml reactive runtime .
Interfacing with primitive events , signals or real time is left to React 's clients .
In other words React corresponds to the functionality provided by the library fr of ocamlrt .
* React has a precise description of the combinators ' semantic in the documentation .
* React does n't depend on extlib .
* Performance ?
I do n't really know .
Some aspects may make React faster : does n't leak , does n't use a global datastore ( which involves a hashtable and universal types ) .
Some aspects may make it slower : use of weak references , subtleties in signal creation , correct treatment of equality .
* Being inavailable ocamlrt seems to be a dead project .
Rtime 0.9.0
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/7538cbe5978c8dd2#
Related to my previous annoucement is the following module .
Rtime is an OCaml module implementing timelines for React [ 1 ] .
It manages time stamp events , delayed events and delayed signals along timelines .
The client chooses the concrete timeline by providing an absolute notion of time .
Running the timeline at the appropriate pace is left to the client .
Rtime is made of a single module and depends on React .
It is distributed under the new BSD license .
Project home page : http://erratique.ch/software/rtime
Although the code is feature complete and has been tested it has not been in large scale programs yet .
A stable 1.0.0 will be published once I feel we have the right api .
Your feedback is welcome , Daniel [ 1 ] available at http://erratique.ch/software/react

A new global map released by the European Commission 's Joint Research Centre and published in the World Bank ’s World Development Report 2009 , measures urbanisation from the new perspective of Travel Time to 8,500 Major Cities .
The map fills an important gap in our understanding of economic , physical and even social connectivity .
In the absence of agreement on the meaning of " urbanisation " , the European Commission and the World Bank are proposing a new definition based on a unique mapping of “ Accessibility ” called the Agglomeration Index .
Key findings suggest that :
we passed the point at which more than half the world ’s populations live in cities around the turn of the Millennium ( 2000 ) - much earlier than the 2007 / 8 estimate ;
more than half of the world 's population lives less than 1 hour from a major city , but the breakdown is 85 % of the developed world and only 35 % of the developing world ;
95 % of the world 's population is concentrated on just 10 % of the world 's land ; but
only 10 % of the world 's land area is classified as " remote " or more than 48 hours from a large city .
Leen Hordijk , Director of the Institute for Environment and Sustainability of the EC's Joint Research Centre , whose scientists prepared the new map , commented : " We have risen to the challenge of combining various information sources with the latest mapping technologies to produce a unique and timely product for the World Bank .
Our map raises the question :
For how much longer will remote ecosystems remain remote ?
Many are crucial to the healthy functioning of our planet . "
How does the mapping work ?
Digital maps of road , river and rail transport networks , population data , satellite - derived maps of land cover and terrain and information on border crossing times are combined using advanced geographical modelling techniques .
For example , the time it takes an individual to travel to a city from 100 km away is calculated from precise knowledge of the terrain he or she must cross whether it is by foot , road , rail or river .

Taking scientists twelve months to complete , the result is a global map of travel time to over 8,500 major cities .
This , in turn , allows scientists to establish a new globally consistent measure - the Agglomeration Index - which will facilitate the work of the World Bank and other international organisations when monitoring the effects of urbanisation .
The world 's population is concentrating in cities
The human population is more concentrated than ever before .
Europe ’s urban sprawl gradually fades as we move eastwards into the steppes of central Asia , soon to re-emerge into the dense networks of people and places in India , China and Japan .
The attraction of Australia ’s coasts is dramatically revealed , while North America appears to adopt a grid system not just for its streets and road networks , but for distribution of the cities themselves .
Cities exercise enormous control over national economies - even the global economy .
They provide jobs , access to the best cultural , educational and health facilities and they act as hubs for communication and transport .
Of course , they also cluster massive demands for energy , generate large quantities of waste , and concentrate pollution as well as social hardship .
Redefining ' urban '
By using travel - time as a unit of measurement , the map of Travel Time to Major Cities represents accessibility through the easily understood concept of “ how long will it take to get there ? ”
Accessibility links people with places , goods with markets and communities to vital services .
Accessibility - whether it is to markets , schools , hospitals or water - is a precondition for the satisfaction of almost any economic need .
Furthermore , accessibility is relevant at all levels , from local development to global trade .
Because of advances in transport systems and networks we are better connected than ever before .
This new map demonstrates how accessible some parts of the world are , indicating increased opportunities for travel , trade , communication and interaction .
This map also serves as a stark reminder that the price of greater connectivity is that there is little wilderness left .
While only 10 % of the world is more than 48 hours from a large city , our wilderness has shrunk to the highest of the mountains , such as the Plateau of Tibet and the extremes of the high latitudes , such as the boreal forests and ice sheets .
Even the deserts and tropical forests are not the inaccessible wild lands they once were .
Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle accepts the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services in an Obama administration .
What does this mean for reproductive and sexual health and rights under President Elect Obama ?
Updated 12:35 pm PST , November 19 , 2008
According to the LA Times , former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle has accepted President - Elect Obama ’s offer to become the new Secretary of Health and Human Services .
Daschle is currently a fellow with the Center for American Progress , a progressive
think tank .
It was originally reported that he would oversee Obama’s
health policy working group but with this appointment , it ’s unclear
what his role will be in that regard .
The former South Dakota senator may please some inside - the - Beltway Democrats , but the reaction of reproductive and sexual health advocates working on the ground will be interesting to gauge .
As I know many of our readers are , in fact , leaders in the community , I ’d love to read comments from some of you below .
Tom Daschle did not win his re-election bid in 2004 — some say for his lack of leadership after 9/11 ; others say for not being " forceful " enough as a Democratic senate leader .

Abortion .

Daschle ’s record on reproductive and sexual health and rights is a mixed one .
NARAL Pro-Choice America rated him 50 % for his support for the ( non-medically termed ) Partial Birth Abortion Ban , and for the Unborn Victims of Violence Act , a bill that allows a perpetrator to be prosecuted for two crimes in a violent crime against a pregnant woman .
Daschle , also , however , opposes the ban on abortion procedures in military hospitals and supports expanding funding embryonic stem cell research .
Nancy Keenan , president of NARAL Pro-Choice America , believes Daschle will be an effective representative for reproductive health access and rights issues in the White House , telling Rewire , “ Sen . Daschle will bring thoughtful progressive leadership to the Department of Health and Human Services .
We appreciate his recent efforts to help defeat two abortion bans in South Dakota .
We had a good working relationship with him during his tenure as Senate leader and look forward to continuing that relationship as he assumes this pivotal role in the Obama administration . "
Daschle has not been in Congress for the last four years of the Bush administration ’s antics related to reproductive and sexual health and rights .
As HHS Secretary he ’ll inherit the Bush administration ’s latest bid to unethically squeeze in ( after the White House ’s own deadline for proposals this year ) an outrageous proposal for regulations for the Department of Health and Human Services .
The proposed HHS regulations would allow federally funded health care providers and health care institutions to refuse to provide contraception for any reason under federal conscience - clause laws .
The proposed regulations , as I ’ve written about many times , incited a tidal wave of protest from public health advocates , health care providers themselves , health care consumers , activists and more – receiving almost 200,000 comments during the public commenting period .
The proposed regulations , if promulgated , could seriously endanger women ’s critical access to reproductive health care .
It is unlikely that if these proposed regulations become HHS policy that Daschle would support them .
But can he be counted on to reverse the regulation quickly ?
Julie Davids of the Community HIV / AIDS Mobilization Project is optimistic , however , about the leadership role Daschle could play in Obama ’s HIV / AIDS plan :
" Tom Daschle is a noted leader in insisting on a United States response in the global epidemic .
Tomorrow , a thousand people with HIV and their supporters are rallying at the White House to support the ambitious Obama / Biden platform to confront the domestic epidemic — and we hope that Daschle ’s acceptance of the HHS post signifies that he will make HIV / AIDS in our own nation a priority of his tenure . "
And James Wagoner with Advocates for Youth sees Obama ’s choice of Daschle for HHS head as " extremely promising .
Thank god we ’ll get the ideologues out of there .
Public health has taken a horrific hit over the last eight years . "
With Daschle at the helm , Wagoner sees brighter days ahead , " Public health can finally breathe again in this country and get back to its evidence base . "
Wagoner takes a political perspective as well , exploring reasons beyond Daschle ’s support for evidence - based public health , " Secondly , Dashle ’s staff when he was in the senate was pretty well regarded by pro-choice advocates .
I think that team is likely to be resurrected to some degree within HHS .
Third , at the macro level it ’s really smart to have a Secretary of HHS that has such deep " hill " [ ed.
note : Capitol Hill ] experience .
The [ health care ] agenda is enormous and it has to move through the U.S. Congress adeptly .
You need a good sherpa to go climbing in the Himalyas and to get through Congress , and Daschle is that sherpa . "
Wagoner does acknowledge that " advocates will still have a challenge .
He wo n’t be able to wave a a magic wand and get all things through .
David Obey [ed .
note : Rep. Obey , House Democrat , pushed to increase funding for abstinence - only funding ] should be a sobering thought as we move forward given his adamant opposition to progress in sex education . "
On a larger health care system scale , Daschle may bring some compelling ideas to the table about the ways in which our health care system needs to be constructed , beginning at the top .
Ezra Klein interviewed Daschle four years ago after the release of Daschle ’s book , Critical : What We Can Do About the Health - Care Crisis , in which the Senator suggested a Federal Health Board made up of constituents who understand what regular American health care consumers need .
Daschle said , " I would like to have people who reflect the common , daily concerns of average working Americans on that board , making sure those consumer voices are heard . "
It is clear that in the coming days the reproductive health and rights community will weigh in with their thoughts on whether or not Daschle represents a beacon of hope as a leader of our next presidential administration ’s health policies .
CPC
Watch , a watchdog organization that seeks to expose crisis pregnancy centers as " fake clinics , " blogged about Daschle ’s appointment from a reproductive and sexual health and rights perspective today and may help set the tone for the discussion within the reproductive health community over the next several days and weeks , asking :

An amateur British archaeologist has discovered almost 300 gold coins dating from the 7th Century at a dig just outside Jerusalem 's Old City .
Birmingham woman Nadine Ross , 34 , found the solid 24 - carat coins under a large rock in a car park .
The coins date back to the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius , before the Persians conquered Jerusalem in 614 .
Ms Ross is being feted for finding one of the largest and most impressive coin hoards ever discovered in Jerusalem .
She had been volunteering at the site for the past month and found the coins in the last week of her stay in the city .
" It 's very , very exciting ... we 've had pottery , we 've had glass , but we 've had nothing like this , " said Ms Ross , who normally works as an engineer for BMW .
Impressive hoard
This is one of the largest and most impressive coin hoards ever discovered in Jerusalem
Israel Antiquities Authority Dr Doron Ben-Ami and Yana Tchekhanovets are the archaeologists who oversaw the dig for the last year .
" This is one of the largest and most impressive coin hoards ever discovered in Jerusalem - certainly the largest and most important of its period , " they said in a joint statement on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority .
" Since no pottery vessel was discovered adjacent to the hoard , we can assume that it was concealed inside a hidden niche in one of the walls of the building , " they said .
Dr Doron Ben - Ami says the coins were probably hidden by someone fleeing the Persian attack on Jerusalem in the early 7th Century .
The coins all show the Roman Emperor Heraclius - one side of the coins features him in uniform , clasping a cross in his hand .
During their attack , the Persians took the wooden cross on which Christians believe Jesus was crucified away from Jerusalem .
Heraclius brought it back to the city 's Church of the Holy Sepulchre at the height of his power in the year 630 , eight years before the Arab Muslim conquest of the city .

This is one of those cute stories you do n't expect much from when you hear about them ( " Oh no , another insufferable kid story with a presidential angle " ) , but this one is different .
From the Chicago NBC affiliate WMAQ :
Watch out Politico and First Read .
Competition is on the horizon , albeit a distant one .
Stanislaw " Stas " Gunkel may soon be a big name in the political blogosphere .
He 's already been recognized by President - elect Barack Obama , who told him in a letter to " make a difference everywhere you go . "
Never mind that Gunkel is 7 years old and wo n't even be able to vote until 2019 .
The Edison Park boy 's blog , planetstas.blogspot.com , has covered such heady topics as alternative energy , the war in Iraq and yes , even Sarah Palin .
Ok , so what does a 7 year old boy think about Sarah Palin ?
From Stas ' blog , Planet Stas :
Here is why I 'm asking grown - ups to vote for Barack Obama .
I am 7 years old so I can't vote ......
My mom told me that I should n't base my election analysis on " feelings " ( I like him / her ) or " beliefs " ( I share his / her beliefs ) but on logical arguments .
She asked me to create my own rational explanations for my support of Obama .
Here is one of my arguments : McCain and Palin are not be qualified to be President / Vice President of the U.S. The President 's job is to do good for the country and the world .
To do good for the country , the President must make smart decisions on important situations .
Governor Palin believes the world is 6000 years old .
This is absurd .
This is not a rational belief .
This is a mistake .
Scientists , experiments and evidence have shown this to be completely false .
Therefore , she is not rational .
If she is not rational , she should not be allowed to be President or Vice President .
Please vote for Barack Obama .

I ’ve successfully switched from Parallels Desktop to VMWare Fusion and early impressions are very good .
Unlike Parallels …
VMWare Fusion does n’t constantly grind the hard disk searching for ever more virtual memory
VMWare Fusion does n’t take 10 minutes to launch and then crash the entire OS
VMWare Fusion does n’t have an incomprehensible support site staffed by ignoramuses who pretend their own customers do n’t exist just because they complained about a £ 30 obligatory upgrade for software they ’ve already paid for twice before that still does n’t work as promised
There ’s also much better networking support in VMWare Fusion .
I can now realistically use Linux to manage and work with files and folders on the Mac side and similarly use Mac OS to access the /home folder in Linux .
Previously , under Parallels , non of the shared networking types ( Bridged , Shared or Host Only ) allowed Samba to “ see ” either the host machine or the shared folders on the virtual machine .
This was a major headache , as non of the Linux support forums I found seemed to suggest this was an outstanding issue with Linux , which only left Parallels as the source of the woes — and the less said about getting an answer from them about the problem the better .
Suffice to say everything looked like it should be working , but it just was n’t .
Under VMWare Fusion , however , the whole sharing process is fairly logical and painless — especially if you ’ve set up a shared network before .
The set - up examples given below assume your virtual machine is Kubuntu 4.10 and your OS X is 10.5 Leopard — but most any modern Linux distribution will have similar procedures and OS X 10.4
Tiger is similar also .
You will also need to install VMWare Tools for Linux , to enable folder sharing and negate the need to ‘ activate ’ the mouse when switching between OS X and Linux .
Since this procedure is very similar to installing Parallels Tools for Linux , which I ’ve already covered here before , we ’ll assume you ’ve already got the necessary add - ons installed .
The process is very straight forward , even if you ’ve never installed anything in Linux using the command prompt before — but if anyone does need a little hint , just leave a comment below .
In Kubuntu open the ‘ adept ’ package manager from the K menu and search for ‘ share ’ .
This will show up , in the ‘ Settings ’ section , two or three packages .
Install all of them ( see screen - shot ) .
In the System > Shared Folders control panel , which is now installed , click ‘ Add ’ and browse for the folder on your Linux partition you would like to share .
Then right click on the folder you ’ve just shared , choose Properties and make sure the permissions to access that folder are set Read and Write ( see screen - shot ) .
In OS X open System Preferences >
Sharing and make sure the ‘ File Sharing ’ service is turned on .
Click ‘ Options ’ and check the box that says ‘ Share Files and Folder using SMB ’ .
You can add and set the sharing permissions for as many nested folders and hard drives as are on your OS X system .
and make sure the ‘ File Sharing ’ service is turned on .
Click ‘ Options ’ and check the box that says ‘ Share Files and Folder using SMB ’ .
You can add and set the sharing permissions for as many nested folders and hard drives as are on your OS X system .
You can now see the shared folders from the Linux side in Finder under the ‘ Shared ’ side - bar tab and in ‘ Network ’ .
You will need to enter the username and password for the account you are sharing , which you can add to your OS X Keychain .
To see your OS X shared folders in Kubuntu Linux , navigate to root / mnt / hgfs / .
If you do n’t see this path , you need to add shared folders using the Virtual Machine > Shared Folders > Add Shared Folders … menu in VMWare Fusion .
That ’s it !
You should now be able to see your Kubuntu shared folders in OS X and your OS X shared folders inside Linux applications and Dolphin navigation folders .
Mohammad Reza Arian , an Iranian military official with the rank of colonel , has defected to Turkey .
Colonel Arian also succeeded in bringing out his wife and two daughters during his escape operation .
This brings the number of senior Iranian military officials who have defected to Turkey over the last number of years to two .
The first was General Ali Reza Asgari , who was considered to be the “ father of Hezbollah . ”
He escaped to Turkey via Syria in early 2007 .
This new development in the intelligence war between Iran and the West was initially reported by the Turkey ’s Hürriyet newspaper on December 13 .
However , the first time it was brought to the attention of Iranians was on December 26 .
The first Iranian Web site to break the news was Tabnak , which is based in Tehran .
In its report Tabnak quotes the article in Hürriyet .
It must be noted that Tabnak is one of the most credible news agencies inside Iran .
According to Tabnak ’s Turkish sources , Colonel Arian escaped because he was against the torturing of Iranian opposition figures inside Iran .
To raise awareness , he subsequently started communicating with international human right agencies via email .
This raised the suspicion of Iran ’s intelligence agency , which installed hidden spy cameras in his office .
Arian ’s life was also threatened , and as a result of this he decided to escape to Turkey with his family .
His first port of call was the United Nations Refugee Agency in the city of Van , near the Iranian border .
Colonel Arian arrived there on August 28 of this year .
This means that he escaped via land , via two possible routes .
One possibility is that he crossed over to Turkey , via northern Iraq .
This is a new route which is being used by smugglers with the help of local Kurds due to the fact that over the last two years extensive security efforts have been made by Iran to stop illegal crossings at the Iranian - Turkish border .
Tehran is not only concerned about Iranians escaping to Turkey , but also fears that Western intelligence agencies may try to use that border to insert equipment and operatives .
The other possibility is that he was smuggled out or managed to cross the Iranian - Turkish border .
What is interesting about this case is that initially , the head of the refugee organization where Arian handed himself over to said that he had gone missing for a month .
This prompted many to believe that the Iranian colonel had followed the same path as Asgari , and had been “ kidnapped ” by the Mossad or the CIA .
However , a day after the initial report the report was corrected and the refugee authorities in the city of Van said that he had been found again .
This new development is likely to lead to a new shake - up in Iran ’s intelligence apparatus .
These defections show that senior officials are not being monitored in an effective manner .
More importantly , they show that the level of dissatisfaction inside military circles is reaching new highs , which means that as well as defections , more people inside Iran may be encouraged to cooperate with Western intelligence agencies .
Iran will have to tread a fine line in this case .
Relations with Turkey are very important for Tehran , both economically and politically .
With Tehran becoming isolated , any damage caused in Tehran - Ankara relations will be to the benefit of the U.S. and Israel .
On the other hand , Turkish authorities seem to be playing host to defectors from Iran , thus making the country a top destination for whoever wants to escape and to cause damage to Iran ’s military apparatus .
And what is even more interesting is that Turkey is not the only neighbor which seems to be playing a double game .
Iranians are concerned about what they see as rise of CIA activity in the republic of Azerbaijan , and in Dubai where hundreds of thousands of Iranians live and work .
This is in addition to an increase in anti-Iran intelligence activities by neutral countries such as Holland , which according to Dutch media has become successful in recruiting agents inside Iran .
This truly is a dangerous phenomenon .
Iranians who are against the government may still have ideological problems working for the U.S. , Israel , or Arab countries , due to historical animosities .
However , a country such as Holland with whom Iran has had no differences could resolve that problem by recruiting the agent , and then sharing intelligence with other countries .
Or worst , American or Israeli agents may recruit Iranian agents by fooling them into believing that they are working for another more “ neutral ” country .
The fact that Barack Obama has offered to talk directly with Iran does not mean that the intelligence war between the two sides is over .
In fact , the opposite is true .
To conduct meaningful negotiations , the U.S. will have to rely on increased volume and quality of intelligence .
The same goes for Tehran .
The Iranian government will most probably be upping the tempo in its efforts to recruit its own agents .
If its successes in Lebanon and Iraq are anything to go by , Western counterintelligence agencies will have their work cut out .
My first upload , I tried to look for it on here already , but not very hard so if it's a repost , my bad !
As far as info , I have no idea who these people are but they are very motivated it seems !
( CNN ) -- Prominent liberal groups and gay rights proponents criticized President - elect Barack Obama Wednesday for choosing evangelical pastor Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at the presidential inauguration next month .
President - elect Barack Obama has chosen pastor Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration .
Warren , one of the most influential religious leaders in the nation , has championed issues such as a reduction of global poverty , human rights abuses and the AIDS epidemic .
But the founder of the Saddleback Church in Lake Forest , California , has also adhered to socially conservative stances -- including his opposition to gay marriage and abortion rights that puts him at odds with many in the Democratic Party , especially the party 's most liberal wing .
" [ It 's ] shrewd politics , but if anyone is under any illusion that Obama is interested in advancing gay equality , they should probably sober up now , " Andrew Sullivan wrote on the Atlantic Web site Wednesday .
People for the American Way President Kathryn Kolbert told CNN she is " deeply disappointed " with the choice of Warren and said the powerful platform at the inauguration should instead have been given to someone who has " consistent mainstream American values . "
iReport.com :
What do you think of the pick ?
" There is no substantive difference between Rick Warren and James Dobson , " Kolbert said .
" The only difference is tone .
His tone is moderate , but his ideas are radical . "
Dobson , a social conservative leader , is founder and chairman of Focus on the Family .
Linda Douglass , a spokeswoman for Obama , defended the choice of Warren , saying , " This is going to be the most inclusive , open , accessible inauguration in American history . "
" The president - elect certainly disagrees with him on [ lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender ] issues , " Douglass said .
" But it has always been his goal to find common ground with people with whom you may disagree on some issues . "
Douglass also noted that Obama and Warren agree on several issues , including advocating on behalf of the poor , the disadvantaged and people who suffer from HIV / AIDS .
Watch CNN 's Anderson Cooper and his panel discuss the selection »
Warren 's support of California 's Proposition 8 , a measure that outlaws same - sex marriage in the state , sparked the ire of many gay rights proponents earlier this fall .
Warren , who has made it a practice not to endorse candidates or political parties , wrote in October that the issue of gay marriage is not a political issue , but instead " a moral issue that God has spoken clearly about . "
" For 5,000 years , every culture and every religion -- not just Christianity -- has defined marriage as a contract between men and women , " Warren wrote in a newsletter to his congregation .
" There is no reason to change the universal , historical definition of marriage to appease 2 percent of our population . "
Warren also stirred controversy earlier this week when he told Beliefnet.com his grounds for opposing same - sex marriage lay primarily on his right of free speech .
" There were all kinds of threats that if [ Proposition 8 ] did not pass , then any pastor could be considered doing hate speech if he shared his views that he did n't think homosexuality was the most natural way for relationships , and that would be hate speech . "
Joe Solmonese , president of the Human Rights campaign , said Wednesday he feels a " deep level of disrespect " over the choice of Warren and is calling on Obama to reconsider the move .
" By inviting Rick Warren to your inauguration , you have tarnished the view that gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender Americans have a place at your table , " Solmonese said in an open letter to Obama that was released by his organization .
In his recent interview with Beliefnet , Warren also sparked outrage among supporters of abortion rights for criticizing those who have said abortion would be " safe and rare . "
" Do n't tell me it should be rare , " he said in the interview .
" That 's like saying on the Holocaust , ' Well , maybe we could save 20 percent of the Jewish people in Poland and Germany and get them out and we should be satisfied with that -- I 'm not satisfied with that .
I want the Holocaust ended . "
But Warren , whose church attracts more than 20,000 people a week , has widely been recognized for his attempts to expand the evangelical movement beyond socially conservative issues .
In the 2008 election , Warren hosted Obama and Sen. John McCain , the Republican presidential nominee , at a candidate forum held in his church .
His book " The Purpose Driven Life " has sold more than 20 million copies since it was first published five years ago , and Time magazine named him one of the 25 most influential evangelicals in 2005 .
" Many believe that Warren ... is the successor to the [ Rev. Billy Graham ] for the role of America 's minister , " Time wrote in 2005 .

With eco-friendly innovations so in demand , it ’s no surprise that the green tech industry is booming .
Intrepid inventors all over the world are putting their best efforts into creating the greenest gadgets , furniture , fuel , fashion and architecture , and some of the stuff they ’ve dreamed up is downright weird technology .
Here are 15 examples of bizarre green technology innovations , from solar powered ‘ personal massagers ’ to walking houses .
Speakers with Built - in Planters
Electronics manufacturer JVC debuted a rather interesting new concept in home audio equipment at the 2008 Tokyo Designer ’s Week .
The speakers , made of eco-plastic ( whatever that means – they did n’t explain ) have little planters built into them for people who are really going for that organic look in their home décor .
The modular speakers can be assembled into various shapes and are said to have a surprisingly high quality sound for the size and design .
The conceptual series is called “ Kirikabu ” .
Grow Your Own Grass Furniture
London - based contemporary design firm Purves & Purves offered a flat - pack DIY cardboard armchair frame along with a package of grass seeds in the summer of 2006 , promising outdoor furniture that blends in perfectly with your lawn .
You assemble the 14 pieces , fill it with soil , sprinkle the grass seeds over it and watch your new Chia Chair grow right before your eyes .
Interesting idea , but mowing it could be a challenge .
Solar - Powered ‘ Personal Massager ’
Here ’s a solar - powered gadget you might not want to leave in your front window : the world ’s first solar - powered vibrator .
It takes about 5 hours of natural sunlight to fully charge , and a single charge powers it for 2.5 hours .
Those without a private sunny space can use a 100 watt light bulb to power the device , but that will add an extra 19 hours to the charge time .
The good news is , you do n’t have to use it outside for it to work .
Biodegradable Coffin Coffee Table
You need a coffee table , and someday , you will also need a coffin .
So , why not kill two birds with one stone with the biodegradable coffin coffee table from Halfway House Design ?
You can even use it to store wine , books and other items until the day comes when it ’s needed to store your body .
A little morbid , sure , but at least it ’s made from sustainable materials .
Fuel from Slaughterhouse Waste
At Changing World Technologies , a rotting pile of disgusting turkey offal – heads , feet , intestines , and lungs swollen with putrid gases – is transformed into over $ 12,000 worth of fuel through a thermal conversion process in about 20 minutes .
The process is still being optimized for commercial viability and has great potential , but NIMBY protests against the smells emitted by the plant have proven to be a tough hurdle to overcome .
Wind - Powered Gadget Charger
The Hymini gadget charger is renewable energy on a ( very ) small scale – it powers small electronics like cell phones and mp3 players with a tiny wind turbine and solar panel array .
The Good Human tested it out , and reports that both the solar panel and the wind turbine were separately able to power his wife ’s cell phone in the same amount of time a plug - in charger takes , noting that attaching the turbine to the handlebars of your bicycle would be an especially efficient way to harness energy while out and about .
Coffee - Fueled Truck
A 1975 GMC pickup modified to run on spent coffee grounds proves that any biomass can be used for gasification .
This truck hack , called the Café Racer , is powered by pyrolysis gas created by heating steel pipes full of coffee grounds in a wood gas generator .
The Café Racer is said by its creators to be carbon - negative , but that has n’t been substantiated .
Still , this kind of technology could play a major role in finding alternatives to fossil fuels in the future .
Edible Shoe Polish
Mmm , shoe polish .
If you ’ve ever polished your shoes and thought to yourself , ‘ This shoe cream looks so tasty , I wish it were edible ’ then you ’re in luck .
Po - Zu , a company that makes eco-friendly footwear , also offers an all - natural edible shoe cream that does n’t just make your shoes shiny – it also can be used for a variety of non-shoe - related purposes like massage oil , lip balm and even a nutritious snack .
They recommend spreading it on toast .
Pollution - Sensitive Dress
Do n’t be caught outside unaware of pollution levels in the air .
The pollution - sensitive ‘ EPA Dress ’ by Stephanie Sandstrom detects pollution in the air and wrinkles accordingly .
That ’s right , this dress – which is actually quite pretty – looks like you pulled it from the bottom of the dirty laundry heap when the air is dirty .
It might protect your health by advising you to stay indoors for the day , but it wo n’t do you any favors if you ’re meeting with clients .
People - Powered mp3 Player
The RollOn mp3 player sort of looks like someone ripped a tire off a child ’s toy truck and attached a wire to it .
But , it ’s far more sophisticated than that .
Give your idle hands something to do by rolling this gadget on any surface , which charges it up .
Other than its unusual power source , the RollOn – which is inspired by bicycles – functions like any other mp3 player .
Cow Poop Power
Slaughterhouse waste and used coffee grounds are n’t the only unusual power sources popping up in the news lately .
Cow manure is being used by dairy farms to produce electricity , and the process has another benefit as well : turning all that ozone - destroying methane gas into something useful .
One “ poop - filled lagoon ” can power an entire dairy operation and feed power into the community grid as well .
Such methane power systems are currently under construction all over the country .
Flowering Energy Monitor
Keep track of your household energy use with a visual indicator .
The FlowerPod is a device that monitors your energy use and provides a graphic representation of how you ’re doing .
If you keep it low , a small green sprout appears and its well - being is determined by the overall energy usage of your home .
Use too much power , and the flower begins to wilt .
It comes with an ‘ information portal ’ , accessible through your computer , that shows your use of electricity , heating , cooling and water with detailed graphs and statistics , and also suggests ways you can improve .
Man-Powered Ferris Wheel
A ferris wheel operator in India at some point realized that he could save some money by paying a handful of locals to manually operate a ferris wheel instead of using electricity .
A group of about five men use their body weight to spin the wheel .
Sure , it ’s zero-emissions , but also more than a little dangerous for the workers .
Getting caught in the bars as the wheel spins would n’t feel too good .
Solar - and Wind - Powered ‘ Walking House ’
This strange little pod on hydraulic legs is n’t just an example of compact modern architecture – it ’s actually a solar - and wind - powered home that can stroll at walking pace across all terrain .
Designed by Copenhagen art collective N55 , the computer - controlled walking house is meant to help people escape rising water levels during floods .
The makers hope to see it become a viable option for low - income people living in flood - prone areas .
Replicating Robot
An open - source robot created by scientists at the University of Bath can create real , robust mechanical parts – including replications of itself – acting as a three - dimensional printer .
The RepRap – short for replicating rapid prototyper – builds parts in layers of plastic as durable as Lego bricks .
It heats up plastic and then squeezes it out into a line , which is built into a form as it solidifies .
Some have noted that it could reduce dependence on China for cheap manufacturing , since it can create everyday objects like door handles , coat hooks , and even sandals .
Considering the pollution China factories emit , that could be a very good thing , although with a RepRap in their homes people might go a little crazy creating plastic junk they do n’t need .

Or that huge mastiff that 's physically capable of kicking me out of your bed ?
How about the cat that 's contemplating using my balls as a scratching post every time I walk around in my boxers ?
I think I 'll exit stage right before the fucker eats my socks again . - I get the biggest kick out of this one .
Why would you be afraid of your own imaginary friend ?

Just keep in mind that Mr. Bond is only 5 '10 .
Japan 's recession - hit gangsters are claiming millions of pounds in unemployment and other benefits despite a ban on members of crime syndicates receiving welfare .
Scores of cases of suspected benefit fraud have been reported since March 2006 , when the health and welfare ministry banned such payments to the estimated 80,000 members of Japan 's mafia , known as the yakuza , the Yomiuri newspaper reported .
Of the estimated 400 m yen ( £ 3 m ) paid out , only a fraction – 15 m yen – has been recovered , although just under half the local governments surveyed by the newspaper said they had ceased payments after learning of the claimants ' underworld origins .
The actual figure could be more than 500 m yen , the Yomiuri said .
Gangsters who have fallen on hard times or simply want to boost their income are using a variety of ruses to receive unemployment , housing and other benefits .
In one case , a claimant presented a fake letter stating he had been expelled from his organisation and was therefore entitled to assistance .
The widespread fraud is taking place against a backdrop of mounting financial pressures on the yakuza as the global financial crisis forces them to compete for dwindling spoils .
The recession has dramatically reduced income from property , construction and the stock market , at the same time as tougher laws have hit more traditional cash cows such as prostitution and loan sharking .
Now that yakuza dons can be sued in court for the misdemeanours of their henchmen , many gangs are conducting purges of more volatile operatives .
While excommunicated mobsters have a legitimate right to claim welfare , active yakuza are well placed to play the system , say experts .
" If they declare no income and pay no taxes , it 's very easy to pretend that they qualify for welfare , " says Jake Adelstein , a leading authority on the Japanese underworld .
" It 's easy if they 're heavily tattooed , but if you 're talking about white - collar yakuza , who turn up in a suit and do n't look shabby , then how are they going to be found out ?
" Some yakuza are having trouble making enough money these days , and few can claim to have a regular income .
The people they used to shake down for protection money can no longer afford to pay up , and money - lending rackets are easier to uncover and come with heavier penalties . "
The welfare ministry admitted it had yet to gauge the true extent of the fraud .
" It 's very difficult to say exactly how big the problem is as we do n't have reliable data , " a ministry official , who asked not to be named , told the Guardian .
" We 've strengthened our cooperation with the police in recent years , but there are no special measures in place .
It is already against the law for gang members to receive welfare , and those that do receive money are legally required to pay it back . "

Oort Cloud objects orbit the Sun in a spherical outer shell shown here , as well as in an inner cloud that might be more disc - like .
If the inner cloud is squashed enough , it could be detected in radiation left over from the big bang ( Illustration : Copyright www.jonlomberg.com)
The cosmic microwave background , the universe ’s oldest light , could harbour evidence of an asymmetric Oort Cloud ( Image : NASA / WMAP Science Team )
A vast reservoir of comets that is too far away to see might be detectable in maps of radiation left over from the big bang , a new study suggests .
Comets that take longer than 200 years to orbit the Sun come from all directions in the sky .
That has long led scientists to believe that they were nudged out of a diffuse halo of icy objects that surrounds the solar system – the Oort Cloud .
Advertisement
The objects probably formed from the same disc of material that gave rise to the planets but were scattered outwards by Jupiter and Saturn a few hundred million years after their birth .
The Oort Cloud is too dim to be seen by telescopes , but astronomers believe it has two components .
Based on observations of long - period comets , an outer portion seems to extend from 20,000 to 200,000 astronomical units from the Sun ( where 1 AU is the Earth - Sun distance ) .
Solar system models also predict the existence of an inner shell that stretches some 3000 to 20,000 AU from the Sun .
But there is less evidence for this shell – most passing stars are too distant to jostle the inner halo and dislodge comets .
Only a few recently spotted objects , such as the icy bodies 2006 SQ372 and Sedna , point to its existence .
Now , a new study suggests that the inner Oort Cloud might be detectable by looking at all - sky surveys of the cosmic microwave background – the first radiation emitted in the universe after the big bang .
The inner Oort Cloud objects are dense enough at their orbital distance to block a significant portion of the cosmic radiation .
And since the icy debris is roughly - 268 °Celsius , about twice as warm as the CMB , it should show up in maps of the radiation .
Passing star
The inner cloud would not be detectable if it formed a perfect sphere , since that would leave the same imprint on the CMB in all directions .
However , if a star passed close enough to the Sun to rearrange objects in the inner cloud , the distortions might be visible in the CMB , say Daniel Babich and Avi Loeb of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
“ A star that passes there would actually kick the cloud , ” say Loeb .
“ In principle , that would leave a signature that is detectable on the CMB . ”
The researchers estimate that about five such stars could have passed within 2000 AU of the Sun during the solar system ’s nearly 5 - billion - year lifetime .
After each event , it might take a billion years or more for the gravitational pull of distant stars and the Milky Way to smooth out evidence of the star ’s passage .
Maps made with the European Space Agency ’s Planck telescope , set to launch in April 2009 , might reveal the signal , which could be used to determine the inner Oort Cloud ’s distance , shape and the distribution of its icy bodies .
Competing signals
“ It ’s an interesting way to look for some sign of the Oort Cloud , which is very hard to do from the Earth , ” says Renu Malhotra of the University of Arizona in Tucson .
Since it ’s unclear how aspherical the inner halo is even when it is not deformed by passing stars , the signal might actually be stronger than the authors estimate , Malhotra adds .
While the most distant icy bodies would have been very vulnerable to gravitational tugs from passing stars , pushing them into a spherical shell that became the outer Oort Cloud , those closer to the Sun might have retained some of their original disc - like distribution .
In principle , Planck could detect the signal , says cosmologist Douglas Scott of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada .
But Scott says it ’s unclear how a signal from the Oort Cloud would compete with the intrinsic signals from the telescope , as well as radiation from the Milky Way and other solar system features , such as the Kuiper Belt , a ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune .
“ What is really needed is a more careful simulation which includes at least the effect of the other likely signals , ” Scott told New Scientist .
Tricky technique
Since the cloud is a relic of the early solar system , pinning down its structure could provide important clues about the formation of the giant planets , Loeb told New Scientist .
For example , the size distribution of objects in the cloud could shed light on the structure of the dusty disc from which the planets formed .
Astronomers might also look for stars that dim when Oort Cloud objects pass between them and ground - based telescopes .
The technique is tricky because the events are fleeting and detecting them requires a perfect alignment of the objects and telescopes .
Researchers are already on the lookout for such “ occultations ” of stars by Kuiper Belt Objects that are too small and dim to detect by other methods .
Extending the search to inner Oort Cloud objects may be 10 to 20 years off , says Luke Dones of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colorado .
Still , finding the signature of the Oort Cloud in the CMB could prove even more challenging .
“ It ’s not something I think can be done in the near future , ” Dones told New Scientist .
“ I suspect these occultation events are going to find Oort Cloud objects sooner . ”

Two men have been found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a 17 - month - old boy .
The child 's mother had already admitted allowing or causing the child 's death .
The trial highlighted a catalogue of missed opportunities to save his life and the case has chilling echoes of the death of Victoria Climbie .
The boy 's mother denied knowing anything about bloodstains
On 2 August 2007 police announced they were dropping an investigation into allegations of child abuse they had launched the previous December .
Baby P's mother was elated and told social workers she would go home to hug her son and bake cakes .
The next morning he was dead .
Baby P , who can not be named for legal reasons , was pronounced dead shortly after midday on 3 August at the North Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton , north London .
But it was already clear when an ambulance arrived at his Tottenham home 45 minutes earlier that he had been dead for some time .
His mother described him in her 999 call as " blue , cold and stiff . "
In his short life he had suffered repeated - and unexplained - injuries .
The post - mortem examination revealed Baby P had suffered : • Eight broken ribs and a broken back , with another area of bleeding around the spine at neck level .
•
Numerous bruises , cuts and abrasions , including a deep tear to his left ear lobe , which had been pulled away from his head .
•
Severe lacerations to the top of his head , including a large gouge which could have been caused by a dog bite .
• Blackened finger - and toenails , with several nails missing ; the middle finger of his right hand was without a nail and its tip was also missing , as if it had been sliced off .
•
A tear to his fraenulum , the strip of skin between the middle of the upper lip and the gum , which had partially healed .
•
One of his front teeth had also been knocked out and was found in his colon .
He had swallowed it .
The jury was not shown photographs of the child 's actual injuries because it would be too upsetting but was shown computer generated images of his injuries .
The jury were shown computer generated images of Baby P's injuries
His mother , who is now 27 , told her GP in September 2006 that her son " bruises easily " and she was worried she might be accused of hurting him .
The following month she returned to see Dr Jerome Iqwueke and explained away bruises on the child , saying he had fallen down the stairs the day before .
On 11 December 2006 Dr Iqwueke saw the child again and noticed more bruises , none of which the mother could adequately explain .
He immediately referred Baby P to paediatric specialists at the Whittington Hospital , where doctors concluded the marks suggested non-accidental injury .
Haringey social services were notified , Baby P was put on the child protection register and a police investigation began .
Five days later he was released into the care of Angela Godfrey , a close friend of the mother .
At the end of January 2007 social services decided to return Baby P to the family home .
Dr Heather Mackinnon , the paediatric consultant in charge of Baby P's care at the Whittington , said she had been unable to attend various case conferences concerning him but had made her report available .
' Systemic failure '
She said she would not have supported returning the child to his family .
She also said she did not receive the minutes of any of the meetings until after Baby P's death eight months later - something she described as " clearly a systemic failure " .
Dr Mackinnon said many of those involved in the case felt sorry for the mother and she said there was " a collective thinking that this was more likely to be neglect rather than deliberate injury - which was not my view " .
The police officer investigating the suspected abuse , Detective Constable Angela Slade , said she had also been opposed to Baby P returning to the family home because her investigation had not been completed .
But she said she was told by social services the mother was working well with them and a delay in returning would affect the re-integration of the family .
Social services had also been given assurances - which proved worthless - that the mother was living alone and there was no man in the house who could have inflicted the injuries .
During the trial the mother admitted this was a lie .
The death of Baby P has chilling echoes of the Victoria Climbie case
The court heard that her 32 - year - old boyfriend , who can not be named for legal reasons , was frequently left in charge of Baby P and the first injuries coincided with his growing involvement in the household .
Baby P was taken to hospital twice more , in April and June 2007 , with unexplained cuts and bruises .
The mother lied to social worker Maria Ward that she was away , which delayed a home visit for another six weeks .
When Ms Ward saw Baby P for the last time , a few days before his death , she found him sitting in his buggy , with a sore ear , a gauze over his finger and chocolate smeared over his face and hands .
Two prosecution witnesses claimed the mother and boyfriend had deliberately spread the chocolate on his face to hide bruises .
Baby P's final two weeks of life were marked by an escalation of the violence against him .
On 25 July Dr Iqwueke received a call from the mother , requesting his help to get social services " off her back " .
When she brought the child in the following day the doctor noticed he was " withdrawn " and avoided contact .
' Miserable and cranky '
The prosecution claimed the child 's back and ribs would have been broken before 1 August , when his mother took him to a child development clinic at St Ann 's Hospital where he was seen by Dr Sabah Al - Zayyat .
In a police interview Dr Al - Zayyat said she had been unable to carry out a full physical examination because he was " miserable and cranky " .
But in court she said Baby P only cried for a minute or so before she began her physical examination and he was in the room with her for over an hour .
Asked why she apparently changed her evidence she replied that the police had not asked her the right question at the time .
Dr Al - Zayyat denied his back could have been broken when she saw him .
It emerged during the trial that the mother had been placed on a parenting course , had been given stair gates , a fireplace guard and , even , shortly before his death , an offer of a seaside holiday .
This is not the first time Haringey social services has come under the spotlight .
In February 2000 eight - year - old Victoria Climbie was killed in Tottenham after a number of failings by Haringey social services and other agencies .
' I feel betrayed '
The public inquiry that followed , headed by Lord Laming , criticised the lack of communication between the different agencies and suggested an overhaul of child protection guidelines .
But Mor Dioum , director of the Victoria Climbie Foundation , says the lessons have not been learned : " I strongly believe this case is worse than Victoria Climbie .
" Personally I do feel betrayed by the agencies .
Given the government 's extensive reforms of the child protection system I never though I 'd live to see another case so similar to Victoria Climbie .
For the sake of public interest we ought to have a wider inquiry into this case to identify the mistakes made . "

In the last two weeks , two very important things have happened that make that especially hard to avoid .
The Bush administration 's chief prosecutor at Gitmo , Susan Crawford , has herself conceded that torture did indeed take place in that camp , and specifically against Qahtani , the prisoner whose torture was personally monitored by Bush , Cheney and Rumsfeld , and whose torture log is in the public domain .
An attorney general presented with clear evidence of torture engaged in by public officials has no choice but to prosecute - or to make a mockery of his office .
It is absurd to ignore the men who have primary responsibility for the crime .
The second big thing is that the perpetrators of war crimes are no longer in power .
I predict that as fear of administrative reprisal ebbs , more and more whistle - blowers will come forward with evidence of what was done under Bush and Cheney , in defiance of domestic and international law .
That Bush and Cheney got hacks to write absurd legal memos saying that , in Bush 's own words , " whatever we wanted to do " was legal will mean nothing .
Yoo and Bybee are the kind of useful , amoral sycophants and apparatchiks that always emerge and flourish in lawless states eager to put up a facade of legalism to defend their power - grabs .
I do not believe in a witch - hunt in the CIA , whose many hard - working officers deserve support not censure .
I do believe in holding responsible those high elected officials who broke the law and violated the Constitution in authorizing war crimes .
It should take as much time as needed for a thorough accounting ; it should be meticulously fair ; it should be geared solely to ensure that the rule of law is no longer in question ; and that only those truly responsible at the top of the chain of command are held liable .
But if we do not hold these men to account , the precedent they set is alarming .
They have , after all , argued that the executive branch can do anything to anyone to defend the nation 's security as defined and measured by that executive branch itself .
They have argued that that power is permanent and not restricted to a discrete length of time .
They have declared the Constitution to be entirely subject to the executive 's will , checked only by a four year " moment of accountability " .
And they are unrepentant - even boastful of their actions .
We cannot leave that precedent in place .
Why ?
I know no better popular expression of the case than that made by Robert Bolt in this imagined conversation between Thomas More and the John Yoo of his day , William Roper :
William Roper :
So , now you give the Devil the benefit of law !
Sir Thomas More : Yes !
What would you do ?
Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil ?
William Roper :
Yes , I 'd cut down every law in England to do that !
Sir Thomas More : Oh ?
And when the last law was down , and the Devil turned ' round on you , where would you hide , Roper , the laws all being flat ?
This country is planted thick with laws , from coast to coast , Man 's laws , not God's !
And if you cut them down , and you 're just the man to do it , do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then ?
Yes , I 'd give the Devil benefit of law , for my own safety 's sake !
Yes , I give prisoners of war , even the demons of al Qaeda , the benefit of the law .
For my own safety 's sake .
And ours ' .

Below is a statement on Iran that I and others are hoping will be adopted in Washington as a way forward .
Any of my readers who has a way of getting this statement to decision - makers in Washington should please do so .
Just Foreign Policy is doing it as a petition .
Also , my blogger colleagues should please comment widely on it .
It was carried by wire services such as Reuters and also the Associated Press .
Gary Kamiya at Salon pointed to it .
Michael Theodolu covered the statement in the Gulf .
Jim Lobe has written about it , under the rubric “ Obama urged to forego Iran threats . ”
The statement follows :
Among the many challenges that will greet President - elect Obama when he takes office , there are few , if any , more urgent and complex than the question of Iran .
There are also few issues more clouded by myths and misconceptions .
In this Joint Experts ’ Statement on Iran , a group of top scholars , experts and diplomats – with years of experience studying and dealing with Iran – have come together to clear away some of the myths that have driven the failed policies of the past and to outline a factually - grounded , five - step strategy for dealing successfully with Iran in the future .
Joint Experts ’ Statement on Iran
Despite recent glimmers of diplomacy , the United States and Iran remain locked in a cycle of threats and defiance that destabilizes the Middle East and weakens U.S. national security .
Today , Iran and the United States are unable to coordinate campaigns against the Taliban and al - Qaeda , their common enemies .
Iran is either withholding help or acting to thwart U.S. interests in Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon , and Gaza .
Within Iran , a looming sense of external threat has empowered hard - liners and given them both motive and pretext to curb civil liberties and further restrict democracy .
On the nuclear front , Iran continues to enrich uranium in spite of binding U.N. resolutions , backed by economic sanctions , calling for it to suspend enrichment .
U.S. efforts to manage Iran through isolation , threats and sanctions have been tried intermittently for more than two decades .
In that time they have not solved any major problem in U.S. - Iran relations , and have made most of them worse .
Faced with the manifest failure of past efforts to isolate or economically coerce Iran , some now advocate escalation of sanctions or even military attack .
But dispassionate analysis shows that an attack would almost certainly backfire , wasting lives , fomenting extremism and damaging the long - term security interests of both the U.S and Israel .
And long experience has shown that prospects for successfully coercing Iran through achievable economic sanctions are remote at best .
Fortunately , we are not forced to choose between a coercive strategy that has clearly failed and a military option that has very little chance of success .
There is another way , one far more likely to succeed :
Open the door to direct , unconditional and comprehensive negotiations at the senior diplomatic level where personal contacts can be developed , intentions tested , and possibilities explored on both sides .
Adopt policies to facilitate unofficial contacts between scholars , professionals , religious leaders , lawmakers and ordinary citizens .
Paradoxical as it may seem amid all the heated media rhetoric , sustained engagement is far more likely to strengthen United States national security at this stage than either escalation to war or continued efforts to threaten , intimidate or coerce Iran .
Here are five key steps the United States should take to implement an effective diplomatic strategy with Iran :
1. Replace calls for regime change with a long - term strategy
Threats are not cowing Iran and the current regime in Tehran is not in imminent peril .
But few leaders will negotiate in good faith with a government they think is trying to subvert them , and that perception may well be the single greatest barrier under U.S. control to meaningful dialogue with Iran .
The United States needs to stop the provocations and take a long - term view with this regime , as it did with the Soviet Union and China .
We might begin by facilitating broad - ranging people - to - people contacts , opening a U.S. interest section in Tehran , and promoting cultural exchanges .
2. Support human rights through effective , international means
While the United States is rightly concerned with Iran ’s worsening record of human rights violations , the best way to address that concern is through supporting recognized international efforts .
Iranian human rights and democracy advocates confirm that American political interference masquerading as “ democracy promotion ” is harming , not helping , the cause of democracy in Iran .
3. Allow Iran a place at the table – alongside other key states – in shaping the future of Iraq , Afghanistan and the region .
This was the recommendation of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group with regard to Iraq .
It may be counter - intuitive in today ’s political climate – but it is sound policy .
Iran has a long - term interest in the stability of its neighbors .
Moreover , the United States and Iran support the same government in Iraq and face common enemies ( the Taliban and al - Qaeda ) in Afghanistan .
Iran has shown it can be a valuable ally when included as a partner , and a troublesome thorn when not .
Offering Iran a place at the table cannot assure cooperation , but it will greatly increase the likelihood of cooperation by giving Iran something it highly values that it can lose by non-cooperation .
The United States might start by appointing a special envoy with broad authority to deal comprehensively and constructively with Iran ( as opposed to trading accusations ) and explore its willingness to work with the United States on issues of common concern .
4 . Address the nuclear issue within the context of a broader U.S. - Iran opening
Nothing is gained by imposing peremptory preconditions on dialogue .
The United States should take an active leadership role in ongoing multilateral talks to resolve the nuclear impasse in the context of wide - ranging dialogue with Iran .
Negotiators should give the nuclear talks a reasonable deadline , and retain the threat of tougher sanctions if negotiations fail .
They should also , however , offer the credible prospect of security assurances and specific , tangible benefits such as the easing of U.S. sanctions in response to positive policy shifts in Iran .
Active U.S. involvement may not cure all , but it certainly will change the equation , particularly if it is part of a broader opening .
5 . Re-energize the Arab - Israeli peace process and act as an honest broker in that process
Israel ’s security lies in making peace with its neighbors .
Any U.S. moves towards mediating the Arab - Israeli crisis in a balanced way would ease tensions in the region , and would be positively received as a step forward for peace .
As a practical matter , however , experience has shown that any long - term solution to Israel ’s problems with the Palestinians and Lebanon probably will require dealing , directly or indirectly , with Hamas and Hezbollah .
Iran supports these organizations , and thus has influence with them .
If properly managed , a U.S. rapprochement with Iran , even an opening of talks , could help in dealing with Arab - Israeli issues , benefiting Israel as well as its neighbors .
***
Long - standing diplomatic practice makes clear that talking directly to a foreign government in no way signals approval of the government , its policies or its actions .
Indeed , there are numerous instances in our history when clear - eyed U.S. diplomacy with regimes we deemed objectionable – e.g. , Soviet Union , China , North Korea , Libya and Iran itself ( cooperating in Afghanistan to topple the Taliban after 9/11 ) – produced positive results in difficult situations .
After many years of mutual hostility , no one should expect that engaging Iran will be easy .
It may prove impossible .
But past policies have not worked , and what has been largely missing from U.S. policy for most of the past three decades is a sustained commitment to real diplomacy with Iran .
The time has come to see what true diplomacy can accomplish .
Annex
Basic Misconceptions about Iran
U.S. policies towards Iran have failed to achieve their objectives .
A key reason for their failure is that they are rooted in fundamental misconceptions about Iran .
This annex addresses eight key misconceptions that have driven U.S. policy in the wrong direction .
Myth # 1 . President Ahmadinejad calls the shots on nuclear and foreign policy .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has grabbed the world ’s attention with his inflammatory and sometimes offensive statements .
But he does not call the shots on Iran ’s nuclear and foreign policy .
The ultimate decision - maker is Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , the commander - in - chief of Iran ’s forces .
Despite his frequently hostile rhetoric aimed at Israel and the West , Khamenei ’s track record reveals a cautious decision - maker who acts after consulting advisors holding a range of views , including views sharply critical of Ahmadinejad .
That said , it is clear that U.S. policies and rhetoric have bolstered hard - liners in Iran , just as Ahmadinejad ’s confrontational rhetoric has bolstered hard - liners here .
Myth #
2 . The political system of the Islamic Republic is frail and ripe for regime change .
In fact , there is currently no significant support within Iran for extra-constitutional regime change .
Yes , there is popular dissatisfaction , but Iranians also recall the aftermath of their own revolution in 1979 : lawlessness , mass executions , and the emigration of over half a million people , followed by a costly war .
They have seen the outcome of U.S. - sponsored regime change in Afghanistan and in Iraq .
They want no part of it .
Regime change may come to Iran , but it would be folly to bet on it happening soon .
Myth #
3 . The Iranian leadership ’s religious beliefs render them undeterrable .
The recent history of Iran makes crystal clear that national self - preservation and regional influence – not some quest for martyrdom in the service of Islam – is Iran ’s main foreign policy goal .
For example :
• In the 1990s , Iran chose a closer relationship with Russia over support for rebellious Chechen Muslims .
• Iran actively supported and helped to finance the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan .
• Iran has ceased its efforts to export the Islamic revolution to other Persian Gulf states , in favor of developing good relations with the governments of those states .
• During the Iran - Iraq War , Iran took the pragmatic step of developing secret ties and trading arms with Israel , even as Iran and Israel denounced each other in public .
Myth #
4 . Iran ’s current leadership is implacably opposed to the United States .
Iran will not accept preconditions for dialogue with the United States , any more than the United States would accept preconditions for talking to Iran .
But Iran is clearly open to broad - ranging dialogue with the United States .
In fact , it has made multiple peace overtures that the United States has rebuffed .
Right after 9/11 , Iran worked with the United States to get rid of the Taliban in Afghanistan , including paying for the Afghan troops serving under U.S. command .
Iran helped establish the U.S. - backed government and then contributed more than $ 750 million to the reconstruction of Afghanistan .
Iran expressed interest in a broader dialogue in 2002 and 2003 .
Instead , it was labeled part of an “ axis of evil . ”
In 2005 , reform - minded President Khatami was replaced by the hardliner , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
But the same Supreme Leader who authorized earlier overtures is still in office today and he acknowledged , as recently as January 2008 , that “ the day that relations with America prove beneficial for the Iranian nation , I will be the first one to approve of that . ”
All this does not prove that Iran will bargain in good faith with us .
But it does disprove the claim that we know for sure they will not .
Myth #
5 . Iran has declared its intention to attack Israel in order to “ wipe Israel off the map . ”
This claim is based largely on a speech by President Ahmadinejad on Oct. 26 , 2005 , quoting a remark by Ayatollah Khomeini made decades ago : “ This regime that is occupying Qods [ Jerusalem ] must be wiped off / eliminated from the pages of history / our times . ”
Both before and since , Ahmadinejad has made numerous other , offensive , insulting and threatening remarks about Israel and other nations – most notably his indefensible denial of the Holocaust .
However , he has been criticized within Iran for these remarks .
Supreme Leader Khamenei himself has “ clarified ” that “ the Islamic Republic has never threatened and will never threaten any country ” and specifically that Iran will not attack Israel unless Iran is attacked first .
Ahmadinejad also has made clear , or been forced to clarify , that he was referring to regime change through demographics ( giving the Palestinians a vote in a unitary state ) , not war .
What we know is that Ahmadinejad ’s recent statements do not appear to have materially altered Iran ’s long - standing policy – which , for decades , has been to deny the legitimacy of Israel ; to arm and aid groups opposing Israel in Lebanon , Gaza and the West Bank ; but also , to promise to accept any deal with Israel that the Palestinians accept .
Myth # 6 . U.S. - sponsored “ democracy promotion ” can help bring about true democracy in Iran .
Instead of fostering democratic elements inside Iran , U.S. - backed “ democracy promotion ” has provided an excuse to stifle them .
That is why champions of human rights and democracy in Iran agree with the dissident who said , “ The best thing the Americans can do for democracy in Iran is not to support it . ”
Myth #
7 . Iran is clearly and firmly committed to developing nuclear weapons .
If Iraq teaches anything , it is the need to be both rigorous and honest when confronted with ambiguous evidence about WMDs .
Yet once again we find proponents of conflict over - stating their case , this time by claiming that Iran has declared an intention to acquire nuclear weapons .
In fact , Iranian leaders have consistently denied any such intention and even said that such weapons are “ against Islam . ”
The issue is not what Iran is saying , but what it is doing , and here the facts are murky .
We know that Iran is openly enriching uranium and learning to do it more efficiently , but claims this is only for peaceful use .
There are detailed but disputed allegations that Iran secretly worked on nuclear weapons design before Ahmadinejad came to power , concerns that such work continues , and certainty that Iran is not cooperating fully with efforts to resolve the allegations .
We also know that Iran has said it will negotiate on its enrichment program – without preconditions – and submit to intrusive inspections as part of a final deal .
Past negotiations between Iran and a group of three European countries plus China and Russia have not gone anywhere , but the United States , Iran ’s chief nemesis , has not been active in those talks .
The facts viewed as a whole give cause for deep concern , but they are not unambiguous and in fact support a variety of interpretations : that Iran views enrichment chiefly as a source of national pride ( akin to our moon landing ) ; that Iran is advancing towards weapons capability but sees this as a bargaining chip to use in broader negotiations with the United States ; that Iran is intent on achieving the capability to build a weapon on short notice as a deterrent to feared U.S. or Israeli attack ; or that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons to support aggressive goals .
The only effective way to illuminate – and constructively alter – Iran ’s intentions is through skillful and careful diplomacy .
History shows that sanctions alone are unlikely to succeed , and a strategy limited to escalating threats or attacking Iran is likely to backfire – creating or hardening a resolve to acquire nuclear weapons while inciting a backlash against us throughout the region .
Myth # 8 . Iran and the United States have no basis for dialogue .
Those who favored refusing Iran ’s offers of dialogue in 2002 and 2003 – when they thought the U.S. position so strong there was no need to talk – now assert that our position is so weak we cannot afford to talk .
Wrong in both cases .
Iran is eager for an end to sanctions and isolation , and needs access to world - class technology to bring new supplies of oil and gas online .
Both countries share an interest in stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan , which border Iran .
Both support the Maliki government in Iraq , and face common enemies ( the Taliban and al - Qaeda ) in Afghanistan .
Both countries share the goal of combating narco - trafficking in the region .
These opportunities exist , and the two governments have pursued them very occasionally in the past , but they have mostly been obscured in the belligerent rhetoric from both sides .

This statement is the product of a large group of experts with diverse knowledge , experience and affiliations .
While all members strongly support the general policy thrust and judgments reflected in this statement , they may not necessarily all concur with every specific assertion or recommendation contained therein .
" Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre last night launched a passionate defence of press freedom . "
So reported the Daily Mail yesterday .
He made a speech attacking what he claimed was a privacy law being introduced by the back door , aiming his steel - toed boots at one particular judge .
Dacre , the nation 's bully - in - chief is , like all bullies , a coward : he refused to go on the Today programme yesterday to argue his case .
He never dares face his critics , happy to fry alive all and sundry , never apologising , never explaining .
There is a good reason for this : the stance his paper takes on just about everything is so internally contradictory and inconsistent that he could never survive even minimal scrutiny .
The Mail 's mishmash of lurid scandal , bitching about women and random moralising zigzags all over the place , dishing out pain and praise often according to who it has succeeded in buying with its limitless chequebook , or who has infuriated it by selling their wares to another bidder .
Dacre was protesting at Mr Justice Eady 's verdict , which found the News of the World had no right to expose the private life of formula one boss Max Mosley .
Delicate Guardian readers may find it hard deciding whether Max Mosley or Paul Dacre is the more unsavoury character .
But there 's no doubt which of them does most harm : Dacre - along with Rupert Murdoch in his different way - probably does more damage to the nation 's happiness and wellbeing than any other single person , stirring up hatred , anger , fear , paranoia and cynicism with his daily images of a nation going to hell in a downward spiral of crime and depravity .
Dacre attacked the judge on these grounds : that he " effectively ruled that it was perfectly acceptable for the multimillionaire head of a multibillion sport , followed by countless young people , to pay five women £ 2,500 to take part in acts of unimaginable sexual depravity with him ...
Most people would consider such activities to be perverted , depraved , the very abrogation of civilised behaviour ...
Would he [ the judge ] feel the same , I wonder , if one of those women had been his wife or daughter ? "
This last thought is an archetypal example of Dacre 's creepy mind and corkscrew logic .
Whatever else Max Mosley may or may not be , he 's no coward .
To bring a case against the News of the World for breaching his rights under what Dacre calls " the wretched human rights act " , was brave .
It guaranteed excruciating public examination of exactly what he got up to in his German - themed spanking session .
But he fought for the good principle that what people do in private is nobody else 's business , unless it 's illegal - or , in rare cases , unless it exposes some gross hypocrisy in a public figure .
Since Mosley does not go about inveighing against prostitution or sadomasochism - and all this has nothing to do with motor racing - it does n't apply to him .
This was a landmark case that may make the media think twice before exposing irrelevant , if fascinating , facts about people 's private proclivities .
Press freedom is precious - but it does n't depend on the right to be prurient .
The right to privacy is precious too : one article can destroy a reputation , and that can never be reclaimed with any puny compensation or apology .
There is no " press freedom " to tell us exactly what everyone does without their clothes on .
Torturers use sexual humiliation because it violates deep instincts : newspapers that expose people administer their own torture .
Who would n't prefer Mr Justice Eady protecting people 's reasonable right to privacy than Judge Paul Dacre waving his chequebook from his tawdry pulpit , deciding who shall be whipped in public for which sins .
A good example of Dacre 's " morality " was last year 's treatment of Faye Turney , the leading seaman captured by the Iranians , who along with the others was permitted by the Ministry of Defence to sell her story .
The Mail was outraged and over pictures of coffins of dead soldiers , filled the front page with the headline , " They wo n't be selling their story , minister " .
But one key element was missing from the paper 's reporting .
The Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday made their own bids for Turney 's story , " with a very substantial sum " , according to the MoD , as they wooed her with money , flowers and sympathy .
When she sold her story elsewhere , they savaged her as an unfit mother , among other things .
So when Dacre in his speech this week boasted of his paper 's " duty to take a moral stand " , while accusing Eady of having " a subjective and highly relativist moral sense " , he knows whereof he speaks .
Dacre rounded off his speech with another hit at the BBC .
His campaign is reaching the edge of hysteria : the Mail on Sunday 's front - page splash , " BBC bungles Sachs apology " was about failing to apologise to other members of the Sachs family .
How barking is that ?
The feeding frenzy against the BBC , spurred on by Dacre and Murdoch , grows ever more threatening .
It matters because politicians are afraid of both men .
More sinister than the trip to Deripaska 's yacht was the less publicised visit by David Cameron to Murdoch 's yacht on that same holiday .
Obligingly , Cameron wrote a piece in the Sun last week joining in the anti-BBC hue and cry .
One reason why it 's easy to despair of Gordon Brown is his incomprehensible and grovelling friendship with Dacre , Labour 's worst enemy .
Where was Brown on the eve of his party 's disastrous Glasgow East byelection ?
He was far away at Stratford - upon - Avon , watching Hamlet with his good friend Dacre .
The Mail plays a curious cat and mouse game with Brown , sometimes praising his moral qualities on inside pages while assaulting Labour on its front page .
Dacre is said to be very close to the Browns - which makes you wonder about the spinning of the PM 's much - vaunted moral compass .
Meanwhile , the scourge of measles is still rising ; it is almost directly attributable to the Mail 's weird campaign against the MMR vaccine - only now finally silent , with no apology .
An inevitable consequence is a fall in vaccination rates .
Couple that with Dacre 's equally bizarre campaign against life - saving speed cameras on behalf of speeding motorists .
These are things a free press will always do .
Sometimes it campaigns for good causes , sometimes for bad ones .
However , the right to strip naked anyone the press chooses is surely one of the most morally dubious abuses of press freedom yet devised .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Cash - strapped consumers might get some welcome news on Thursday when regulators vote to rein in controversial credit card practices .
The proposed rules , which have received overwhelming consumer support , prohibit banks from practices like raising the interest rates on pre-existing credit card balances unless a payment is over 30 days late , and applying payments in a way that maximizes interest penalties .
The Federal Reserve Board , the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration , are all expected to approve the regulation .
The rules are expected to take effect by 2010 .
" It will fundamentally change the relationship between cardholders and banks , " said Peter Garuccio , a spokesman for the American Bankers Association .
If approved , the Fed 's rules will mean an end to double - cycle billing , which averages out the balance from two previous bills .
That means that consumers who carry a balance can get hit with retroactive interest on their previous month 's bill - even if they 've already paid that off .
Consumers would also be given a reasonable amount of time to make payments , and payments would be applied to higher - rate balances first , to reduce interest penalties and fees .
Credit card statements would clearly list the time of day that a payment is due , and any changes to accounts would be in bold or listed separately .
And , finally , no more universal defaults - policy which allows credit card issuers to increase the interest rate on one card if a customer misses a payment on another card .
Trouble keeping up
Consumer advocacy groups say credit - card reform could n't come soon enough .
Travis Plunkett , the legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America said new rules are " essential " at a time when " so many Americans are falling behind on their loans . "
In the midst of a credit crunch , Americans have about $ 976.3 billion in revolving credit and 4.9 % of all credit cards were delinquent in the third quarter , according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve .
" This industry has been mostly deregulated since the 1980s and we 've seen the effects of that , " said , Curtis Arnold , founder of CardRatings.com , a consumer advocacy group .
" It has n't worked . "
Representatives from the banking industry argue that while many of the changes are consumer friendly , there might be a downside to increased regulation that should not go unnoted .
" By limiting the ability of issuers to use risk - based pricing , the result is likely to be higher prices and less available credit , " explained Garuccio , of the American Bankers Association .
Not only would card companies have to impose higher interest rates across the board to offset losses , but low introductory offers and zero - percent balance transfers are likely to be scaled back as well , he said .
Some consumer advocates argue alternatively that these reforms do n't go far enough .
Plunkett , the consumer advocate , said he hopes Congress will pass more sweeping credit - card reforms next year that address a number of other " abusive practices " including " reckless lending to young people and high fees . "
Sen. Christopher Dodd and Rep. Carolyn Maloney have both proposed credit - card legislation that would impose even more constraints on issuers .
Watching the incineration of Elmo made me feel vaguely uncomfortable .
Part of me wanted to laugh , but I also felt sick about what was going on . *
Photo : Mauricio Alejo * During the 20 months that Fisher - Price spent developing the innards and software of its latest animatronic Elmo , engineers gave the project the code name Elmo Live .
And sure enough , they made him more animate than ever :
He moves his mouth in time with the stories he tells , shivers when he gets scared , and has a fit when he sneezes .
When they were finally able to test the doll on children , they were struck by how immediately the kids blocked out all other stimuli in the room and began interacting with Elmo .
" It was as if Elmo were part of their family , " says Gina Sirard , Fisher - Price VP of marketing .
" To a child , he really is alive . "
So the code name stuck , and over the past few months legions of $ 60 Elmo Live dolls have joined families everywhere .
Some are certainly doomed to join previous Elmos in a new pastime : robotic - toy torture .
YouTube is full of videos of idiots dousing Elmo with gas , setting him on fire , and laughing as his red fur turns to charcoal and he writhes in a painful dance .
I 've seen videos of the incineration of T.M.X. Elmo ( short for Tickle Me Extreme ) ; they made me feel vaguely uncomfortable .
Part of me wanted to laugh —
Elmo giggled absurdly through the whole ordeal — but I also felt sick about what was going on .
Why ?
I hardly shed a tear when the printer in Office Space got smashed to bits .
Slamming my refrigerator door never leaves me feeling guilty .
Yet give something a couple of eyes and the hint of lifelike abilities and suddenly some ancient region of my brain starts firing off empathy signals .
And I do n't even like Elmo .
How are kids who grow up with robots as companions going to handle this ?
This question is starting to get debated by robot designers and toymakers .
With advanced robotics becoming cheaper and more commonplace , the challenge is n't how we learn to accept robots — but whether we should care when they 're mistreated .
And if we start caring about robot ethics , might we then go one insane step further and grant them rights ?
First , the science :
The brain is hardwired to assign humanlike qualities to anything that somewhat resembles us .
A 2003 study found that 12 - month - olds would check to see what a football - shaped item was " looking at , " even though the object lacked eyes .
All the researcher had to do was move the item as if it were an animal and the infants would follow its " gaze . "
Adults ?
Same reaction .
The perennial concern about the rise of robots has been how to keep them from , well , killing us .
Isaac Asimov came down from the mountaintop with his Three Laws of Robotics ( to summarize : Robots should n't disobey or hurt humans or themselves ) .
But what are the rules for the humans in this relationship ?
As technology develops animal - like sophistication , finding the thin metallic line between what 's safe to treat as an object and what 's not will be tricky .
" It 's going to be a tougher and tougher argument to say that technology does n't deserve the same protection as animals , " says Clifford Nass , a Stanford professor who directs a program called the Communication Between Humans and Interactive Media Lab .
" One could say life is special — whatever that means .
And so , either we get tougher on technology abuse or it undermines laws about abuse of animals . "
It 's already being considered overseas .
In 2007 , a South Korean politician declared that his country would be the first to draw up legal guidelines on how to treat robots ; the UK has also looked into the area ( though nothing substantial has come of it anywhere ) .
" As our products become more aware , there are things you probably should n't do to them , " says John Sosoka , CTO of Ugobe , which makes the eerily lifelike robot dinosaur Pleo ( also tortured on Web video ) .
" The point is n't whether it 's an issue for the creature .
It 's what does it do to us . "
We live in an age of anxiety — about the economy , the environment , terrorism .
And now even about our toys , which are forcing us to question the boundaries of humanity and compassion .
Back on Sesame Street , Elmo Live 's creators have an answer : Keep soul - searching to a minimum and recognize that you 're buying a product , pure and simple .
" This is a toy , " Fisher - Price 's Sirard says .
" There should n't be any laws about how you use your toys . "
Happy grilling , Elmo !

Food crops , agriculture and biodiversity cannot be separated from one another A sustainable global food system in the 21st Century needs to be built on a series of " new fundamentals " , according to a leading food expert .
Tim Lang warned that the current system , designed in the 1940s , was showing " structural failures " , such as " astronomic " environmental costs .
The new approach needed to address key fundamentals like biodiversity , energy , water and urbanisation , he added .
Professor Lang is a member of the UK government 's newly formed Food Council .
" Essentially , what we are dealing with at the moment is a food system that was laid down in the 1940s , " he told BBC News .
" It followed on from the dust bowl in the US , the collapse of food production in Europe and starvation in Asia .
" At the time , there was clear evidence showing that there was a mismatch between producers and the need of consumers . "
Professor Lang , from City University , London , added that during the post - war period , food scientists and policymakers also thought increasing production would reduce the cost of food , while improving people 's diets and public health .
We all know that waste is everywhere ; it is immoral what is happening in the world of food
Raymond Blanc ,
Chef and food campaigner " But by the 1970s , evidence was beginning to emerge that the public health outcomes were not quite as expected , " he explained .
" Secondly , there were a whole new set of problems associated with the environment . "
Thirty years on and the world was now facing an even more complex situation , he added .
" The level of growth in food production per capita is dropping off , even dropping , and we have got huge problems ahead with an explosion in human population . "
Fussy eaters Professor Lang lists a series of " new fundamentals " , which he outlined during a speech he made as the president - elect of charity Garden Organic , which will shape future food production , including : Oil and energy : " We have an entirely oil - based food economy , and yet oil is running out .
The impact of that on agriculture is one of the drivers of the volatility in the world food commodity markets . "
" We have an entirely oil - based food economy , and yet oil is running out .
The impact of that on agriculture is one of the drivers of the volatility in the world food commodity markets . "
Water scarcity : " One of the key things that I have been pushing is to get the UK government to start auditing food by water , " Professor Lang said , adding that 50 % of the UK 's vegetables are imported , many from water - stressed nations .
" One of the key things that I have been pushing is to get the UK government to start auditing food by water , " Professor Lang said , adding that 50 % of the UK 's vegetables are imported , many from water - stressed nations .
Biodiversity : " Biodiversity must not just be protected , it must be replaced and enhanced ; but that is going to require a very different way growing food and using the land . "
" Biodiversity must not just be protected , it must be replaced and enhanced ; but that is going to require a very different way growing food and using the land . "
Urbanisation : " Probably the most important thing within the social sphere .
More people now live in towns than in the countryside .
In which case , where do they get their food ? "
Professor Lang said that in order to feed a projected nine billion people by 2050 , policymakers and scientists face a fundamental challenge : how can food systems work with the planet and biodiversity , rather than raiding and pillaging it ?
The UK's Environment Secretary , Hilary Benn , recently set up a Council of Food Policy Advisers in order to address the growing concern of food security and rising prices .
The 21st Century is going to have to produce a new diet for people , more sustainably , and in a way that feeds more people more equitably using less land
Professor Tim Lang Mr Benn , speaking at the council 's launch , warned : " Global food production will need to double just to meet demand .
" We have the knowledge and the technology to do this , as things stand , but the perfect storm of climate change , environmental degradation and water and oil scarcity , threatens our ability to succeed . "
Professor Lang , who is a member of the council , offered a suggestion : " We are going to have to get biodiversity into gardens and fields , and then eat it .
" We have to do this rather than saying that biodiversity is what is on the edge of the field or just outside my garden . "
Michelin - starred chef and long - time food campaigner Raymond Blanc agrees with Professor Lang , adding that there is a need for people , especially in the UK , to reconnect with their food .
He is heading a campaign called Dig for Your Dinner , which he hopes will help people reconnect with their food and how , where and when it is grown .
" Food culture is a whole series of steps , " he told BBC News .
" Whatever amount of space you have in your backyard , it is possible to create a fantastic little garden that will allow you to reconnect with the real value of gardening , which is knowing how to grow food .
" And once you know how to grow food , it would be very nice to be able to cook it .
If you are growing food , then it only makes sense that you know how to cook it as well .
" And cooking food will introduce you to the basic knowledge of nutrition .
So you can see how this can slowly reintroduce food back into our culture . "
Waste not ...
Mr Blanc warned that food prices were likely to continue to rise in the future , which was likely to prompt more people to start growing their own food .
Sustainable food helps protect rare breeds and varieties
Raymond Blanc on good food
He was also hopeful that the food sector would become less wasteful .
" We all know that waste is everywhere ; it is immoral what is happening in the world of food .
" In Europe , 30 % of the food grown did not appear on the shelves of the retailers because it was a funny shape or odd colour .
" At least the amendment to European rules means that we can now have some odd - shaped carrots on our shelves .
This is fantastic news , but why was it not done before ? "
He suggested that the problem was down to people choosing food based on sight alone , not smell and touch .
" The way that seeds are selected is about immunity to any known disease ; they have also got to grow big and fast , and have a fantastic shelf life .
" Never mind taste , texture or nutrition , it is all about how it looks .
" The British consumer today has got to understand that when they make a choice , let 's say an apple - either Chinese , French or English one - they are making a political choice , a socio- economic choice , as well as an environmental one .
" They are making a statement about what sort of society and farming they are supporting . "
Growing appetite
The latest estimates from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) show that another 40 million people have been pushed into hunger in 2008 as a result of higher food prices .
This brings the overall number of undernourished people in the world to 963 million , compared to 923 million in 2007 .
The FAO warned that the ongoing financial and economic crisis could tip even more people into hunger and poverty .
" World food prices have dropped since early 2008 , but lower prices have not ended the food crisis in many poor countries , " said FAO assistant director - general Hafez Ghanem at the launch of the agency 's State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008 report .
" The structural problems of hunger , like the lack of access to land , credit and employment , combined with high food prices remain a dire reality , " he added .
Professor Lang outlined the challenges facing the global food supply system : " The 21st Century is going to have to produce a new diet for people , more sustainably , and in a way that feeds more people more equitably using less land . "

MENA , Saudi Arabia ( Reuters ) -
More than two million Muslim pilgrims stoned walls symbolizing the devil in a narrow valley outside Mecca in Saudi Arabia Monday at the most dangerous stage of the haj pilgrimage .
Pilgrims began three days of stoning and celebrated the first day of Eid al - Adha , commemorating the willingness of biblical patriarch Abraham to sacrifice his son for God .
“ It took a long time since they made us go in one line , but it was easy to do , ” said Osama Khashaba , an Egyptian accountant , after throwing stones at the Jamarat Bridge in a ritual that represents rejection of temptation .
The bridge in the valley of Mena just outside Mecca has been the scene of a number of deadly stampedes .
The last was in 2006 when 362 people were crushed to death in the worst haj tragedy since 1990 .
Saudi authorities have made renovations to ease the flow of pilgrims at the bridge , adding an extra level so that they have four platforms from which to throw stones each day .
Authorities also appealed to pilgrims this year to throw their stones at any time of day rather than only in the afternoon , as Saudi clerics had insisted in the past .
Saudi Arabia has not so far reported any glitches in the haj , a challenging logistical feat that has been marred in previous years by deadly fires , hotel collapses , police clashes with protesters and stampedes caused by overcrowding .
“ Let ’s make the accidents at the stoning part of history , may it never return , ” Saudi television said in one program .
Elaborate crowd control measures , involving security forces and a maze of paths marked by barriers , guided pilgrims to the three spots by the bridge in the Mena valley where they threw stones they had collected overnight at a spot called Muzdalifa .
“ This overcrowding is really scary , ” said Umm Mohammad , a Syrian pilgrim .
“ God willing no one will be hurt . ”
Pilgrims say performing haj is far more important than worries about accidents .
“ Praise God , I think this will change me for the better in everything I do after haj , ” said Abdullah .
The government has also been tougher this year in preventing Saudis and foreign residents taking part without official haj permits .
Saudi media put the pilgrim total at a relatively low 2.4 million people , including a record 1.72 million from abroad -- a sign that the crackdown has worked .

SHAVED HEADS
Many pilgrims returned to the Grand Mosque in Mecca after the first round of stoning rituals .
They crowded into the mosque in the early hours of the morning and into the day , circling the Kaaba , a cube - shaped structure toward which Muslims around the world turn in prayer .
Afterwards men had their heads shaved , according to the rules of haj .
“ It will take three minutes a head , ” said a man ushering people into a busy barbershop near the mosque .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
The haj retraces the path of Prophet Mohammad 14 centuries ago after he removed pagan idols from Mecca , his birthplace , and years after he started calling people to the new faith , which is now embraced by more than one billion people worldwide .
Sunday , pilgrims spent the day in prayer at Arafat 15 km ( 10 miles ) east of Mecca at the climax of haj , a duty for every able - bodied Muslim once in a lifetime and one of the largest manifestations of religious devotion in the world today .
Although there have been no disasters , Saudi authorities were not able to stop political activities that pilgrims had been asked to avoid .
Iranian television showed Iranian pilgrims Sunday chanting “ Death to America ” and “ Death to Israel . ”
Ayatollah Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri , head of Iran ’s haj mission , said Islam was now resurgent , despite some Muslims ’ despair “ in the face of Western civilisation ’s onslaught . ”
Entries on the internet encyclopedia Wikipedia may have to be pre-approved after it wrongly claimed that Senator Edward Kennedy had died .
The user - generated site , in which members of the public are encouraged to provide the entries , is to review the rules governing contributions .
It could lead to entries being centrally approved before being published , which would constitute a radical overhaul of the site 's operations .
Calls for a review followed the embarrassing revelation that pages on Senator Robert Byrd and Senator Edward Kennedy , two prominent American politicians , falsely gave the impression that each had died .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Senator Kennedy , who is severely ill with a malignant brain tumour , went into convulsions during an inaugural lunch for President Barack Obama in Washington on 20 January .
But his entry on the site wrongly stated that he had died : " Kennedy suffered a seizure at a luncheon following the Barack Obama presidential inauguration on 20 January 2009 .
He was removed in a wheelchair , and died shortly after . "
News reports said later that , according to his doctors , he was suffering from fatigue .
A similar error was made on the entry for Senator Byrd .
Both mistakes were corrected within minutes , but its founder , Jimmy Wales , now wants a new or unknown user 's changes to be approved by an editor ; some editors say that process would create " backlogs that we will be unable to manage " .
Mr Wales 's proposal , of flagged revisions , has been in place on the German Wikipedia site for almost a year , but critics complain that the labour - intensive process undermines the site 's reputation for speed .
" This nonsense would have been 100 per cent prevented by flagged revisions , " Mr Wales wrote on a user talk page .
" It could also have been prevented by protection or semi-protection , but ... this was a breaking news story and we want people to be able to participate ( so protection is out ) and even to participate in good faith for the first time ever ( so semi- protection is out ) . "
He said a poll showed that 60 per cent of users supported a trial of that scheme .
But there was soon a storm of responses from other editors .
" Kowtowing to bad press seems wrong - headed to me , " one said .
" Our future depends on those ignorant of Wikipedia 's potential stumbling on an article , fixing it , and getting hooked .
Flagged Revs throw a wrench into that process . "
Mr Wales asked those opposed to the changes to make " an alternative proposal within seven days , to be voted upon 14 days after that " .
Che : Benicio Del Toro
A trailer for the upcoming Steven Soderbergh ‘s “ Che ” movie ( The Argentine ) , starring Benicio Del Toro as the famous revolutionary , has been released .
The previous trailers have been aimed at international markets and not included subtitles , but this one remedies the situation quite nicely with a handsome musical accompaniment .
On November 26 , 1956 , Fidel Castro sails to Cuba with eighty rebels .
One of those rebels is Ernesto Che Guevara , an Argentine doctor who shares a common goal with Fidel Castro – to overthrow the corrupt dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista .
Che proves indispensable as a fighter , and quickly grasps the art of guerrilla warfare .
As he throws himself into the struggle , Che is embraced by his comrades and the Cuban people .
The film tracks
Che ’s rise in the Cuban Revolution , from doctor to commander to revolutionary hero .
IFC Films is releasing both films together in limited theaters on December 12th , followed by individual theatrical releases for each film on its own starting in early January 2009 .

Unlike Bush , Obama has been the vocal advocate of gay civil rights he claims to be .
It is over the top to assert , as a gay writer at Time did , that the president - elect is “ a very tolerant , very rational - sounding sort of bigot . ”
Much more to the point is the astute criticism leveled by the gay Democratic congressman Barney Frank , who , in dissenting from the Warren choice , said of Obama , “ I think he overestimates his ability to get people to put aside fundamental differences . ”
That ’s a polite way of describing the Obama cockiness .
It will take more than the force of the new president ’s personality and eloquence to turn our nation into the United States of America he and we all want it to be .
Obama may not only overestimate his ability to bridge some of our fundamental differences but also underestimate how persistent some of those differences are .
The exhilaration of his decisive election victory and the deserved applause that has greeted his mostly glitch - free transition can’t entirely mask the tensions underneath .
Before there is profound social change , there is always high anxiety .
The success of Proposition 8 in California was a serious shock to gay Americans and to all the rest of us who believe that all marriages should be equal under the law .
The roles played by African - Americans ( who voted 70 percent in favor of Proposition 8 ) and by white Mormons ( who were accused of bankrolling the anti-same - sex - marriage campaign ) only added to the morning - after recriminations .
And that was in blue California .
In Arkansas , voters went so far as to approve a measure forbidding gay couples to adopt .
There is comparable anger and fear on the right .
David Brody , a political correspondent with the Christian Broadcasting Network , was flooded with e-mails from religious conservatives chastising Warren for accepting the invitation to the inaugural .
They vilified Obama as “ pro-death ” and worse because of his support for abortion rights .
Stoking this rage , no doubt , is the dawning realization that the old religious right is crumbling  in part because Warren ’s new generation of leaders departs from the Falwell - Robertson brand of zealots who have had a stranglehold on the G.O.P .
It ’s a sign of the old establishment ’s panic that the Rev. Richard Cizik , known for his leadership in addressing global warming , was pushed out of his executive post at the National Association of Evangelicals this month .
Cizik ’s sin was to tell Terry Gross of NPR that he was starting to shift in favor of civil unions for gay couples .

Cizik ’s ouster wo n’t halt the new wave he represents .
As he also told Gross , young evangelicals care less and less about the old wedge issues and are n’t as likely to base their votes on them .
On gay rights in particular , polls show that young evangelicals are moving in Cizik ’s ( and the country ’s ) direction and away from what John McCain once rightly called “ the agents of intolerance . ”
It ’s not a coincidence that Dobson ’s Focus on the Family , which spent more than $ 500,000 promoting Proposition 8 , has now had to lay off 20 percent of its work force in Colorado Springs .

Any regular reader of HE knows of my love for the craft of voice acting and voice over , and my respect for the artists that bring our favorite characters and movie trailers to life .
So it ’s no surprise that the passing of Don LaFontaine has saddened me deeply .
He was a master voice over artist that helped define the movie going experience for multiple generations of film fans .
His unmistakable “ chainsaw through gravel ” baritone could deftly shift from evoking terror to inciting laughter .
He voiced more than 5000 movie trailers over the last 40 years and spawned a slew of sound - alike imitators .
Despite these accomplishments as a VO artist , I find his personal story equally laudable .
This was a guy that could write his own ticket and for that I respect him all the more .
When he got tired of going to the studios ( in his limo ) , he made the studios come to him .
He set up a home studio and took remote cues from directors miles away .
He commanded a million dollars per film , yet remained humble calling himself , “ the luckiest man on earth . ”
In honor of Mr. LaFontaine , I suggest each September 1st be designated “ Talk Like Don Day . ”
When you order your pizza , or check out at the grocery store through in a few “ in a world ’s ” and “ one man ’s ” here and there .
I also suggest we officially coin the phrase “ graveltas ” ( gravel + gravitas ) when referring to the way the man spoke .
Here ’s to you , Don. Godspeed , you fancy bastard .

I love programming .
I really do .
It ’s one of the few things that really gets my brain buzzing .
In my twenties I ’d go to work , program my ass off , then come home and repeat .
Or , when I worked for myself , I ’d just not stop .
But , as I make my way through my thirties I ’ve found that most days I come home and simply do n’t want to look at code anymore .
I code the back ends to web sites you see , and I ’ve been working on web dev. for over twelve years now , and honestly , there ’s not a lot of innovation going on in that area .
Every now and then someone comes out with a sweet new framework like Rails , but after the initial fun of learning it , and trying to convince everyone you know to use it too , you realize that you ’re almost always doing the same damn thing : taking form data and shoving it into a database , then taking crap in a database and shoving it to the screen .
The only difference is which crap you ’re shoving around , and where it happens to be stored .
It seems that the mid-life crisis comes a bit early to coders , as a number of the ones I ’ve talked to have found themselves feeling a bit ground down as they start in on their thirties , wondering if maybe they should n’t open a greenhouse or do something else equally removed from the world of code .
I do n’t blame them .
I ’ve felt the same way , but every now and then the universe reminds me that coding can be an absolute blast .
That no matter how much I might enjoy some other simpler profession , there ’s nothing that ’d get my brain buzzing like this .
John Bender has come up with five simple rules to keep programming fun .
And while they ’re all good , I , like you , look at it a bit differently .
So here are my rules for keeping programming fun .
1. Remember that nothing is more important than living a full life .
When I worked at iPhrase there was this one guy who worked on the back end .
He probably averaged 16 + hour days because he was really into his piece of the project .
It really got his brain going .
But , eventually , he , like everyone else , got laid off .
And I always remember him , because when he looks back on those years of his life , there ’s nothing there .
There was not time for a social life , and IBM now owns ( and has probably mothballed ) all of the code he wrote .
Code is guaranteed to become obsolete .
Pretty much anything you work on will be abandoned sooner or later .
Do n’t get so wrapped up in your code that you forget to spend time with the people who matter to you .
There will always be more code to write .
That weekend getaway with your friends is a little once - in - a - lifetime experience you ca n’t replicate .
Sometimes , it ’s even simpler than that .
When you ’re sitting there coding away and your child , wife , or even pet comes up and asks you to play , or spend time with them , do it .
Finish that function , hit save , and walk away from the computer .
Do not make them wait more than a few minutes .
2 ) Small , self - useful , projects .
John talks about small triumphs , and while those are very important , I ’d take it even further .
I get the most joy out of small projects .
Writing some cool little app for my phone that I ’ll use every day , or some helpful little tool .
While John ’s right that “ You ’re rarely going to write the next big thing , or anything really meaningful in a single day ’s work . ”
To me it ’s so self evident as to be a non issue .
Not only that , if you attempt to write the “ next big thing ” or anything “ really meaningful ” it ’s going to be work , not play .
And I want to look back and think that , while I may have been spending some of my free time coding , I was coding something fun that put a smile on my face .
As such I try and work on very small projects , or very focused features of someone else ’s project .
Making each feature it ’s own little one day project .
Let me give you an example .
I ’ve been hacking on a fork of Photostream because I thought it was a great proof of concept , but one that could use a lot of improvements .
For example , it does n’t support Flickr contacts .
So , while I can add people in manually , I ca n’t say “ load in all the people I ’m following on Flickr . ”
So , one night ’s project was to make it support adding a person , their contacts , or them and their contacts .
A small accomplishment , like John says .
But , I like to , whenever possible , make it so that I could walk away , after a nights work , and have something that would be useful as is , without ever touching it again .
If I was n’t forking the whole project I would have just submitted that change and felt I ’d accomplished something useful , that others could benefit from .
But , as I make my way through the day at work I think “ I wish it would … ” and every couple nights I ’ll boot up Eclipse and hack in another feature .
But , if my dog decides I ’ve been spending too much time at the computer , and too little time with him , I remember rule number one , finish the current thought , or leave myself enough comments to pick it up tomorrow , and go play with him .
But , I ’ve found that it ’s not just about making small goals .
Time and again I ’ve found myself getting the most enjoyment out of the smallest projects .
A tiny Flickr app , an app that hollers if your servers go down , something that graphs the lines of code per package in a Java project , a distributed bug tracking system , or a library that ’ll save me tons of frustration on other projects .
These wo n’t change the world .
They are n’t “ really meaningful ” but they ’ve all been useful to me , and because they ’re never so large as to have any chance of becoming work , they ’re always lots of fun .
Instead of hacking the next great foo , consider adding that feature you always wished that app you use every day had .
It does n’t matter if you never contribute another thing to that project .
It does n’t even matter if you release your code .
What matters is that it ’s a fun little challenge that you ’ll appreciate the results of afterwards , and hopefully learn something interesting along the way .
3 ) It ’s all about you baby .
Never code for anyone else in your free time .
If you do , it ’s work .
Rick Miller left a great example of this in the comments on my art - blog .
He said ,
“ I know from experience that something you love doing can become a pain in the ass when you feel like you have to do it .
For a while , I was making flutes out of any kind of pipe , hose or hollow plant stalks that I could get my hands on .
I used to carry them with me and play them when I had a few spare moments .
Sometimes when someone would make a positive comment or if a child was curious about the flute I would hand it to them and say , “ It ’s yours . ”
Sometimes I ’d give them away just on a whim .
Once I even gave one out through my car window to a girl in another car on the freeway at 60MPH .
Then I agreed to make a flute for a Spanish fellow for $ 20 .
My flutemaking stopped .
When I finally forced myself to make the damned flute , it was nothing to be proud of .
I was glad that my bank could n’t figure out how to draw on a check from the boonies of Galacia because I ’d have felt bad if the guy had actually paid for such a piece of crap . ”
You ’ve never hear of a child “ playing for someone else ” .
Why ?
Because it ’s simply not possible to play for someone else .
You can play by yourself , or with others , but never for others .
4 ) Prioritization .
John says
“ Write whatever you need to put a useful piece of software out , then add on the frills later .
This will let you release earlier , possibly get feedback and , if anyone is interested in your project , maybe even get help . ”
And while that ’s a good plan , it ’s a bit too close to work for me .
I prioritize my personal coding like this :
It ’s only when I ’m about to release a new project that I even begin to consider what anyone else wants , and even then it ’s pretty minimal .
Because it does n’t matter to me if you use my code or not .
I had fun writing it and that ’s the only thing that ’s important .
However , I ’d feel bad if my code caused you misery or frustration , so , before the release of a new project I make sure that I ’ve got all the basics covered .
For example , my Photostream fork is n’t released yet because if you tried to load junku ’s 3,700 + contacts , you ’d almost assuredly run out of ram .
So , I need to add some paging to the list of your buddies .
And , it just would n’t be right to use the same icon , so I need to change that too , but , both of these things are things I want to do for me anyway , and thus they ’ll be fun , but even if they were n’t fun , the knowledge that it would make others unhappy would make me unhappy .
So I ’ll do a little work to avoid sadness , and increase everyone ’s happiness .
5 ) Share freely .
Talking about “ advice ” John says :
“ I find myself afraid of asking questions for fear that someone else will steal my idea or think I ’m an idiot , and this keeps me from heading to the an irc channel when I need help .
The bottom line is , 99 percent of the people who come up with really cool ideas never finish them and most never even start , so if you need to divulge a little in the interest of getting the thing done , do it . ”
I say , screw that .
You ’re doing this for fun right ?
If you ’re playing it so close to the vest that you do n’t want anyone finding out what exactly you ’re doing , then you ’re working not playing .
I remember reading a post by a novelist who talked about how there were all these people with great ideas for a novel who were afraid to mention them for fear some author would steal them .
But professional authors do n’t hesitate to share their ideas because they know that cool ideas are a dime a dozen , and , like John says , executing on one of them is something hardly anyone ever bothers to do .
Even if someone took your idea and ran with it , what they ’d end up with would be radically different from what you would end up with .
Plus , there ’s the fact that all the stories have pretty much been written already .
New novels are just old stories processed through different people ’s imaginings .
As with writing , there are very few new software ideas .
Mostly , we ’re just making iterative improvements to existing ideas .
Personally , I ’ve got notebooks filled with ideas for projects , and about half of them would be profitable businesses , but I ’m not going to implement 99 % of them ( and if any of my geek friends was in need of a business idea they ’re there for the taking ) .
So ask your questions .
Discuss your ideas .
“ Worst ” case scenario someone else does most , or all , of the work for you , and you get that fun app you wanted without having to lift a finger , which leaves you more time to work on that other fun app .
Or maybe they point out that you really are an idiot , but , would n’t it be better to discover that you ’re doing something stupid * before * you spend weeks coding on it ?
Best case scenario , you get free suggestions on how to make your thing better , and if you release it open source then maybe someone will send in a patch with a nifty new feature , or fix that bug you never got around to addressing .
Remember , as soon as you start charging for it , you have responsibilities to the users , and those can very quickly turn into work .
And if you ’re not charging for it there ’s no good reason not to release it as open source .
Plus , every time you get a patch or a bug fix sent in it ’s like a mini-christmas .
Some surprise present , and we all like presents .
In summary , for me , the key to having fun with coding is to focus on the fun , the little bits of joy , and always keep sight of the life that ’s going on around you .
Be part of it , and make sure that when you look back on any part of your life , you ’ve got something to show for it beyond some code that ’ll probably be replaced or abandoned in 5 years .
What is Soar ?
Soar is a general cognitive architecture for developing systems that exhibit intelligent behavior .
Researchers all over the world , both from the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science , are using Soar for a variety of tasks .
It has been in use since 1983 , evolving through many different versions to where it is now Soar , Version 9 .
We intend ultimately to enable the Soar architecture to :
work on the full range of tasks expected of an intelligent agent , from highly routine to extremely difficult , open - ended problems
represent and use appropriate forms of knowledge , such as procedural , semantic , episodic , and iconic
employ the full range of problem solving methods
interact with the outside world , and
learn about all aspects of the tasks and its performance on them .
In other words , our intention is for Soar to support all the capabilities required of a general intelligent agent .
The ultimate in intelligence would be complete rationality which would imply the ability to use all available knowledge for every task that the system encounters .
Unfortunately , the complexity of retrieving relevant knowledge puts this goal out of reach as the body of knowledge increases , the tasks are made more diverse , and the requirements in system response time more stringent .
The best that can be obtained currently is an approximation of complete rationality .
The design of Soar can be seen as an investigation of one such approximation .
Below is the primary principle which is the basis of Soar 's design and which guides its attempt to approximate rational behavior .
All decisions are made through the combination of relevant knowledge at run-time .
In Soar , every decision is based on the current interpretation of sensory data , the contents of working memory created by prior problem solving , and any relevant knowledge retrieved from long - term memory .
Decisions are never precompiled into uninterruptible sequences .
For many years , a secondary principle has been that the number of distinct architectural mechanisms should be minimized .
Through Soar 8 , there has been a single framework for all tasks and subtasks ( problem spaces ) , a single representation of permanent knowledge ( productions ) , a single representation of temporary knowledge ( objects with attributes and values ) , a single mechanism for generating goals ( automatic subgoaling ) , and a single learning mechanism ( chunking ) .
We have revisited this assumption as we attempt to ensure that all available knowledge can be captured at runtime without disrupting task performance .
This is leading to multiple learning mechanisms ( chunking , reinforcement learning , episodic learning , and semantic learning ) , and multiple representations of long - term knowledge ( productions for procedural knowledge , semantic memory , and episodic memory ) .
Two additional principles that guide the design of Soar are functionality and performance .
Functionality involves ensuring that Soar has all of the primitive capabilities necessary to realize the complete suite of cognitive capabilities used by humans , including , but not limited to reactive decision making , situational awareness , deliberate reasoning and comprehension , planning , and all forms of learning .
Performance involves ensuring that there are computationally efficient algorithms for performing the primitive operations in Soar , from retrieving knowledge from long - term memories , to making decisions , to acquiring and storing new knowledge .
For further background on Soar , we recommend The Soar Cognitive Architecture Laird , J. E. ( 2012 ) , The Soar Papers : Readings on Integrated Intelligence , Rosenbloom , Laird , and Newell ( 1993 ) , A Gentle Introduction to Soar : 2006 update , and Unified Theories of Cognition , Newell ( 1990 ) .
Also available are Soar : A Functional Approach to General Intelligence and Soar : A comparison with Rule - Based Systems .
A full list of publications is available on the Soar publications page .
Entries on the Soar Knowledge Base and the older Soar FAQ also provide answers to many common questions about Soar .
We would like to extend a special thank you to DARPA , ONR and AFOSR for their continued support of Soar and projects related to Soar .
Correction to this article
PEDALLING to work each day , I spend most of the journey looking out for London 's deadly , articulated “ bendy buses ” .
The 60 - foot beasts can happily scissor a cyclist while turning , so as I speed along High Holborn I have never given much of a second glance to the buildings that whizz past on each side .
That might be why I have never noticed anything unusual about 39 Furnival Street .
A brick building in a row of offices , its black double - doors are unmarked and unremarkable .
But if you stop for a moment and look up , you might reconsider that judgment .
Above the entrance is an industrial - size cast - iron pulley — odd in a street of legal firms .
Above that , curiouser still : a wide , gaping air vent of the sort that you might see at the top of a mine - shaft .
AFP
It 's a secret building
What lies inside was once subject to the Official Secrets Act .
But now this mysterious property is up for sale , and so I find myself with a few other journalists on the other side of the doors , signing consent forms and handing in my mobile phone ( whose signal had mysteriously vanished as soon as I crossed the threshold ) .
A lift takes us down 100 feet , deeper than the London Underground , which we can hear rumbling above us .
A set of atom - bomb - proof doors are swung open and we step out into the secret of Furnival Street : the Kingsway tunnels , a miniature city beneath a city .
Dug in 1940 as London was blitzed by German bombers , the tunnels were designed as a air - raid shelter for up to 8,000 people , and as a possible last - ditch base for the government in the event of an invasion .
They were never used as a shelter ; instead , towards the end of the war they were taken over by the “ Inter Services Research Bureau ” , a shady outfit that was in fact a front for the research and development arm of MI6 ( perhaps better known as Q branch in the James Bond novels ) .
After the war , the tunnels were passed to the Post Office and then to British Telecom , which hopes to sell the warren for £ 5 m now that it is surplus to requirements .
“ I think it would make a great disco , personally , ” says Ray Gapes , a former switch - maintenance engineer who came to work in the tunnels as an 18 - year - old apprentice and is now showing us around .
During Ray 's time underground in the 1970s , the tunnels were equipped with a restaurant , licensed bar and games room , including two snooker tables and a tank of tropical fish ( piranhas , some say , though that might be James Bond fever taking hold ) .
The fish - tank has gone but the bar is still there , complete with a garish orange and brown 1970s colour scheme and a few dirty dishes .
Next door in the old restaurant , enough letters remain on the menu board to spell out the last dinner served down here : sausage , chips and peas .
It was a strange life : staff would telephone up to the surface for weather reports , to see if they should take an umbrella when they went out for a cigarette .
Decorators did their best to make them feel at home : mirrored walls in the restaurant make it seem less cramped , and there are even “ windows ” looking out onto painted scenes of palm - fringed beaches and mountain lakes .
The tunnels — a mile of them in total , comprising two main drags and four smaller offshoots — have homely , superterranean - sounding names : South Street , Second Avenue and Tea Bar Alley .
The illusion is only broken when you see behind the wood panelling the iron support structure , embossed with the initials of the London Passenger Transport Board , from whom parts of Tube tunnel were borrowed to build the complex .
The tunnels were still in secret use long after the Battle of Britain had given way to the Cold War .
Deep under my bicycle route , technicians maintained the “ hotline ” between Eisenhower and Khrushchev , as well as a basic domestic network for Britain that would keep the country connected in the event of a major strike .
Richard Bamford , a senior technician on the site , describes how during the Cuban missile crisis the tunnels were locked down , fully manned , for a fortnight .
Thanks to an artesian well and an independent generator ( which powered old submarine chillers to keep the air breathable ) , staff could have lived down here for months .
The walls still ooze secrets .
Mr Bamford declines to tell us where we are in relation to the outside world , in case a future buyer wants to keep things down here away from prying eyes ( and shovels ) .
And opposite a particularly Heath Robinson piece of machinery , complete with foot - long levers and dials like the engine room of the Titanic , I spot an old circuit diagram on the wall , mapping out each of Britain 's national newspapers .
Were they being bugged back then ?
Probably .
The question on my mind as we make our way back to the surface is : in which tunnel are the eavesdroppers hiding now ?
Correction :
An earlier version of this article referred to the London Public Transport Board .
The organisation is called the London Passenger Transport Board .
This article was corrected on November 24th 2008 .
At first glance , the sight of a tiny 1960s car inside a bus recalls the finale to movie classic The Italian Job .
But engineer Graham Smith has no intention of dumping his small Fiat 500 over the side of a mountain .
Instead , the 62 - year - old has spent 20 years converting his 1968 Daimler Fleetline double - decker bus into an all mod-cons home away from home .
And , amazingly , Mr Smith even factored in enough room to park his car inside the unique vehicle , known as Harold .
The father - of - four from Sible Hedingham , Essex , said : ' If Cliff Richard did it in his film Summer Holiday why can't we ? '

The children were scared of computers at first Kamal Prasad Sharma , aged 12 , a student at Saraswati Secondary School in a small village not far from Kathmandu , was afraid when he saw a computer for the first time .
He did n't dare enter the room , thinking the computer would harm him .
" I was really scared when I saw the computer , " he says .
" I did n't go near it .
I was worried it might explode and kill me .
" It was only when the teacher called me saying it was harmless that I went into the room , but I still hesitated . "
Things have changed now , he adds .
Games and fun " I 'm feeling much better .
The E - library has helped with my studies .
" We can see the periodic table of science , and also maps and other geography things in a pictorial way that is easy to understand .
It 's not only that - we can also play games and have fun . "
Kamal says his parents were very excited when he told them about the computer and came to watch the very next day .
It was not only Kamal .
His computer teacher , Shankar Prajapati , says all the pupils were afraid .
" They all worried they would catch some virus and fall ill or even die .
But now they are familiar with computers , " he says .
" Even we teachers are gaining knowledge from the E-library .
It 's really helpful for us , too .
" The students can see science experiments carried out on screen and search for whatever they want in the encyclopaedia . "
E-libraries use audio , video and text technology .
Their digital " books " cover various topics of the school syllabus , ranging from social science to literature and from mathematics to science .
Computer awareness
The E-library concept was initiated by Help Nepal Network ( HeNN ) , a non-governmental organisation .
Its goals are to provide literacy and awareness about the use of computer and information technology , and to set up one E- library in each of Nepal 's 75 districts , which range from the high Himalayas to the hot plains .
The Help Nepal Network hopes to reach all 75 districts in time Much of the country is remote and accessible only on foot , and many of its people have never glimpsed a computer , let alone touched one .
Working with other organisations , including Save the Children - Norway , HeNN is setting up the libraries with the use of what is called the Linux Terminal Server Project ( LTSP ) .
This is a free and open - source ( accessible to everyone ) package which connects one powerful central server in the school , using the Linux operating system , to a number of diskless low - end computers .
When linked to the server , each computer receives a full Linux desktop .
LTSP is seen as a cost - effective , power - saving and durable technology , not only in schools but also in other sectors .
What 's more , it is also virtually free of tampering and computer viruses - and the Linux software developed by Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya , a charitable educational library based in Kathmandu , is being provided free of cost .
And its appeal is growing .
In front of the little shops on the rough village streets , men gather to play cards and drink tea .
But even they have developed a fascination for the computer .
So the school has arranged some computer classes for them , too .
" It 's really useful for us to get to know about this technology which we did n't see when we were younger , " says Sahakul Puri , a 35 - year - old farmer .
" Getting to learn and know about it is a great opportunity for our children .
I can't afford to send my child to computer classes an hour 's drive from here .
So we 're grateful for this project . "
Of the books scanned in the E- library , one of the most popular among the villagers is called " where there is no doctor " .
It is like a first - aid manual , giving the information necessary for the treatment of wounds or illnesses  including traditional remedies such as chewing burnt ginger or brewing ginger soup with honey for a cough .
The school has even attracted lots of villagers to its campaign known as " Leave Your Playing Cards - Learn Computers " .
Reaching remote areas I also visited a much more remote school where the E - library project has just been set up .
Villagers and students carried the computers up and down the steep hills and valleys to the Shree Koldung Devi secondary school , nearly two hours ' walk from the main road .
Before this , anyone wanting access to computers or sizeable shops would have to walk two hours and drive two more , so the system has proved highly significant for local pupils .
Most of the places where E - libraries have been set up so far are in the hills .
Sudarshan Shrestha , information and marketing director for Save the Children - Norway , says the system has been very helpful but notes that there are challenges .
He says students tend to get only about two hours ' access per week " because there are not more than 10 computers for several hundred students " .
For the library , Save The Children - Norway has developed awareness materials on subjects such as children 's rights and child abuses .
Roshendra Dhoj Khadka of Help Nepal Network is very optimistic about the E-library project .
" I believe this information and communication technology project is essential .
It may not be a basic requirement , but it 's a tool to uplift the health and education sectors .
And we 're taking it forward .
I hope we 'll be able to cover all 75 districts some day . "
So far it has reached six .

Chief Customer Officer of Catalytic - an AI and Automation company providing Fortune 500 companies with the ability to rapidly reduce the cost of every day business activities while simultaneously increasing quality , employee satisfaction , and customer loyalty .
Microsoft 's responded to the Zune 30 GB failure , blaming a leap - year handling bug .
And they 've provided a fix .
Which is to wait til New Years , when the bug will go away by itself .
Huh .
Early this morning we were alerted by our customers that there was a widespread issue affecting our 2006 model Zune 30 GB devices ( a large number of which are still actively being used ) .
The technical team jumped on the problem immediately and isolated the issue : a bug in the internal clock driver related to the way the device handles a leap year .
That being the case , the issue should be resolved over the next 24 hours as the time change moves to January 1 , 2009 .
We expect the internal clock on the Zune 30 GB devices will automatically reset tomorrow ( noon , GMT ) .
By tomorrow you should allow the battery to fully run out of power before the unit can restart successfully then simply ensure that your device is recharged , then turn it back on .
If you 're a Zune Pass subscriber , you may need to sync your device with your PC to refresh the rights to the subscription content you have downloaded to your device .
Customers can continue to stay informed via the support page on zune .
net ( zune.net / support ) .
We know this has been a big inconvenience to our customers and we are sorry for that , and want to thank them for their patience .
Q : Why is this issue isolated to the Zune 30 device ?
It is a bug in a driver for a part that is only used in the Zune 30 device .
Q : What fixes or patches are you putting in place to resolve this situation ?
This situation should remedy itself over the next 24 hours as the time flips to January 1st .
Q : What 's the timeline on a fix ?
The issue Zune 30 GB customers are experiencing today will self resolve as time changes to January 1 .
Q : Why did this occur at precisely 12:01 a.m. on December 31 , 2008 ?
There is a bug in the internal clock driver causing the 30 GB device to improperly handle the last day of a leap year .
Q : What is Zune doing to fix this issue ?

Forget the culture war , Ann Friedman argues in the latest issue of the American Prospect .
Gay rights are a civil - rights issue .
And that means the fight ca n’t wait around for culture to catch up .
The proof came on November 4th .
Amidst hosannas from progressives celebrating Barack Obama ’s victory , four state ballot initiatives successfully blasted gay rights in California , Florida , Arizona , and Arkansas .
In the wake of those votes , Friedman launches an eloquent call to action :
Culture changes slowly .
This is something I 've heard a lot in the wake of the passage of California 's Proposition 8 , which bans same - sex marriage .
" History is on our side !
Do n't worry , the demographic trends are with us ! "
I 'm sorry , but that 's just not good enough .
These are the kind of conciliatory comments that go part and parcel with the culture - war frame .
Civil - rights era activists knew history was on their side .
But their goal was not to make every white American comfortable with the idea of sharing public spaces and power with people of color .
It was to guarantee people of color those rights , regardless of where the culture stood .
That 's the thing about rights .
You have to claim them .

We wo n't win victories on LGBT rights as long as we see the issue as part of a liberal -- versus - conservative war .
If we 're at war , it 's not with conservatives .
Our enemy is not James Dobson or Sarah Palin .
It is the sadly accepted notion that anti-gay measures are shoo-ins on the ballot , and that same - sex couples just have to sit tight for a decade or two and wait for public opinion to catch up .
Reader Bigmac spots a tuneful SMH graphic : â€ œNotice that the story is about Somali pirates taking control of a ship , â€ writes Big. â€ œYet the eyes of that skull and crossbones sure look musical .
In fact , I 'm sure I 've seen that picture used by Fairfax before ... in an Age column .
Music piracy on the high seas !

UPDATE II .
The new Somalia
Alaska officials are investigating e-mail messages that included racist jokes about President - elect Barack Obama and were circulated on state government accounts by state employees .
Officials say that the messages apparently originated in a private account but that about 10 state employees appear to have “ taken action ” on them , like forwarding them to others .
Bill McAllister , a spokesman for Gov. Sarah Palin , said Thursday that none of the 10 employees worked in the governor ’s office and that to his knowledge no one in the office had received any of the messages , which , he said , Ms. Palin condemns .
“ They violate state policy  at least that ’s the prima facie view of things , ” Mr. McAllister said in a telephone interview .
“ They ’re not state business , and obviously they are offensive , and clearly she does n’t support that .
And she does not support racism , and she does not support attacks on the president - elect . ”
I ’m a lawyer .
The McCain campaign people writing Sarah Palin ’s response to this written interview are also likely lawyers .
We choose our words carefully .
With that in mind , why does Sarah Palin keep responding to this rape kit issue ( the charge that her city charged rape victims for their own rape kits and rape exams ) with an answer talking about “ evidence - gathering tests ” ?
Rape kits and rape exams are n’t just comprised of “ evidence gathering . ”
They also often include administering emergency contraception to make sure the rape victim does n’t have to give birth to her rapist ’s child .
So , while it is interesting to know that Palin does n’t support charging rape victims for “ evidence gathering , ” how does she feel about charging for the non-evidence - gathering aspect of the rape kit and the rape exam – administering the morning after pill ?
She never tells us .
But she always gives a craftily worded answer that makes us THINK she answered the question , when she really has n’t .
So how about some real answers before we make a woman president who would punish rape victims for their crime committed against them ?
ThinkProgress has her latest craftily written non-answer :
If you have read Obama 's memoir , you will immediately understand why he would suspend a national campaign for the most powerful job on earth to be with his grandmother right now .
One gets the impression from Robert Gibbs and from this decision that this might indeed be one of the last chances he gets .
" Toot " was a formative figure - she brought him up with her husband during some critical years .
Her death would be the death of his last parent .
Reading about her again tonight , you can see where Obama 's personal social conservatism comes from .
There 's a lot more Kansas in Obama than most people on the right seem to think .
Prayers for her , her family and the man who now has to deal with this emotional burden at this exposed and intense time .
They are all still human , you know .
It never hurts to remember that .
And we all forget it sometimes .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

In September , Ketzel Levine , a senior correspondent for National Public Radio , came up with an idea for a series about how Americans were handling economic pressure .
Called “ American Moxie : How We Get By , ” it began in early December .
The subjects were people like an Illinois farmer who loved tending to his cows , but was having to sell them .
“ My idea was to look at how we adjust , how we change , what we have to dig deep and find in order to do what it takes to get by , and that ’s where moxie came in , ” Ms. Levine said .
Ms. Levine and her editor did n’t want a series of unconnected stories .
“ We came up with the idea that each person should be connected with the next somehow , and that was the best part for me , ” she said .
“ I ’d go on a story and have absolutely no idea what the next story would be  I ’d have to find it while I was there . ”
But there was an unexpected ending .
Midway through her reporting , Ms. Levine found out that she had been laid off as part of a 64 - employee cut at NPR .

Public buildings in England and Wales are pumping out 11 m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year , more than Kenya 's entire carbon footprint , the Guardian can reveal .
Unpublished findings of an energy efficiency audit of 18,000 buildings including ministerial offices , police stations , museums and art galleries reveal that the 9,000 buildings audited so far produce 5.6 m tonnes of CO2 , with one in six receiving the lowest possible energy efficiency rating .
The carbon dioxide they produce is the equivalent of all the greenhouse gas emissions saved by the UK 's wind power industry .
Ignorance among officials , inefficient equipment and poor energy management have been cited as reasons for the result , which was described as " lamentable " by environmental campaigners .
It comes despite ministerial pledges to slash the carbon footprint of government offices by 30 % over the next 12 years compared with 1999 - 2000 levels .
Officials expect the carbon footprint to double when the audit is completed .
Almost half of those tested so far have received an energy efficiency rating of E , F or G , the lowest possible and the equivalent of a gas guzzling car .
Embarrassingly for Ed Miliband , the energy and climate change secretary , his department 's head office in Whitehall Place is one of the worst offenders .
It pumps out 1,336 tonnes of CO2 a year and received a G rating .
The Houses of Parliament and the Bank of England together consumed enough electricity and gas to emit 21,356 tonnes of CO2 a year , the equivalent of more than 14,000 people flying from London to New York .
Almost 70 % of public offices had a larger carbon footprint than a typical office , as defined by the government , and while only 55 of the 8,849 buildings examined so far received an A ranking , 1,514 scored a G .
The data was released following a request under the Freedom of Information Act .
In response , environmental campaigners and opposition parties called on the government to invest in an urgent programme of refurbishment to reduce the carbon footprint of the public estate , and cut energy bills for the public sector which currently add up to around £ 4bn a year .
" This confirms that the leadership society needs from government on reducing carbon emissions from buildings is n't there , " said Tony Juniper , an independent sustainability campaigner and former director of Friends of the Earth .
" For the UK to have any chance of meeting the 80 % reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 , which is now enshrined in law , there has to be radical change in this area . "
Earlier this year , the government 's own architecture adviser , the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment , said the majority of government departments were " failing to make their new buildings and refurbishments sustainable " and that those operating them had little idea how to improve their efficiency .
" These figures show there is a desperate need to sort out the public building stock , " said Steve Webb , spokesman on energy and climate change for the Lib Dems .
" If business and householders see the public sector is not taking energy efficiency seriously , they will wonder why they should do so themselves .
Instead of making a £ 12bn VAT cut , the government should have spent some of that money making public buildings energy efficient , saving money and carbon in the long term . "
Buildings consume close to half of the electricity and heat produced by the power sector , according to Sir Nicholas Stern 's review of the economics of climate change .
On current trends , Stern predicted CO2 emissions from buildings will rise 140 % by 2050 .
John Alker , public affairs manager of the UK Green Building Council , said : " Many of our public sector offices , schools and hospitals are the building equivalent of gas - guzzling cars .
The government has set a target to cut CO2 by 30 % from its own buildings by 2020 .
Frankly , they should do more because their track record leaves a lot to be desired .
We need a comprehensive programme of green refurbishment in the public sector , which is responsible for about a third of all non-domestic buildings . "
But plans to " green " the Palace of Westminster as an example to the rest of the public sector , have been scaled back , the Guardian has learned .
Designs for wind and tidal turbines and solar panels to produce electricity are now unlikely to come to fruition after calculations that the investment needed would not result in quick - enough savings on energy bills .
A spokesman for the Office of Government Commerce , which has responsibility for the energy performance of public buildings , said it had set up a centre of expertise to help the public sector improve energy efficiency and meet government targets .
" A comprehensive delivery plan has been produced detailing departmental activities to achieve the targets for sustainable operations across Whitehall , and real progress continues to be made , " he said .

I 'm just thankful I found GHC .
Their products have changed my life .
Michael O'Connor is nationally known as the Tribute Artist with the vocal sound and styling that best resembles his idol , Elvis Presley .
At 41 years old O'Connor may sound the part , but his commitment to a healthier lifestyle this year resulted in a weight loss of 60 pounds in just 60 days .
When O'Connor now takes the stage , his fans are delighted with the slimmer , more energetic Elvis he now portrays .
Eight months ago his story was very different .
O'Connor had just been signed to perform a tribute concert in Atlantic City at the House of Blues to commemorate the 31st anniversary of Elvis 's passing .
But , at 290 pounds , he could n't portray the Elvis he wanted fans to see .
He would need to lose the extra weight to give his best performance .
O'Connor explains , " People do n't realize that the suit I wear to perform as Elvis weighs fifteen to twenty pounds , and the belt another five .
To sing and move around the stage under those intense lights , doing sometimes two shows a night takes incredible endurance .
At 290 pounds , I was afraid I might suffer a stroke . "
His dedication to better health led him through Internet research to the Global Healing Center and Dr. Edward .
F. Group III .
He read about Global Healing Center 's Oxy - Powder® , the only colon cleansing product to have its impressive results backed by scientific clinical studies for safety , and effectiveness in dealing with constipation and IBS .
He compared Oxy - Powder 's results with other products advertised as colon cleansers , but found that Oxy - Powder was uniquely formulated to use the power of oxygen to safely aid the body in relieving irritation associated with constipation symptoms .
It was also the only cleansing product that guaranteed results .
O'Connor followed Dr. Group 's instructions for a six - day cleanse using Oxy - Powder® , and enjoyed immediate results .
Besides dropping 60 pounds in just 60 days , he found that he gained more energy , was calmer , and more focused .
" Regular colon cleansing takes you to a higher level of consciousness that clears your mind and allows you to function better .
It definitely changed my outlook and brought peace in my life , " O'Connor said .
In addition to using Oxy - Powder® , he performed Dr. Group 's liver and gallbladder , harmful organism and chemical and heavy metal cleanse .
He 's now a huge fan of body cleansing and has seen the results first hand .
O'Connor credits his achievement to cleansing years of built - up toxins from his body .
O'Connor will turn 42 this year , the same age Elvis was when he died .
Unlike Elvis , who at the end of his life was on a self - destructive path of drugs and alcohol , O'Connor feels better than he ever has in his life .
The results he has achieved through regular colon cleansing and living a healthier lifestyle motivates him everyday to continue on his path to keep toxins out of his system .
" More people need to know about the benefits of Oxy - Powder® and regular colon and body cleansing .
I 'm just thankful I found GHC .
Their products have changed my life . "

Software that make retrieving the data more difficult with Department of Defense ( DoD 5520 .
22 - M ) compliant disk / file wiping
If you ever worked for Government or Defense organization , you may come across a request for Department of Defense ( DoD ) compliant disk wipe program to remove files / disk securely .
There are many programs exists for doing the same job .
One of my favorite program is scrub , which writes patterns on special files ( i.e. raw disk devices ) or regular files to make retrieving the data more difficult .
Scrub implements user - selectable pattern algorithms that are compliant with DoD 5520 .
22 - M or NNSA NAP - 14 .x .
The dod scrub sequence is compliant with the DoD 5220 .
22 - M procedure for sanitizing removeable and non-removeable rigid disks which requires overwriting all address able locations with a character , its complement , then a random character , and verify .

Download scrub
You can download scrub here .
The package is available in both source and binary releases for
=> Redhat Enterprise Linux ( RHEL 4 / 5 )
=> Debian / Ubuntu Linux
=> HP -UX UNIX
=> Mac OS etc
How do I use scrub ?
Scrub operates in one of three modes :
The special file corresponding to an entire disk is scrubbed and all data on it is destroyed .
This mode is selected if file is a character or block special file .
This is the most effective method .
A regular file is scrubbed and only the data in the file ( and optionally its name in the directory entry ) is destroyed .
The file size is rounded up to fill out the last file system block .
This mode is selected if file is a regular file .
file is created , expanded until the file system is full , then scrubbed as in 2 ) .
This mode is selected with the - X option .

Turnips are SO underrated .
Turnips are a root vegetable , and once you take a bite of this dish , you ’ll seriously wonder why turnips have n’t swept more Thanksgiving tables than they have .
Preheat the oven to 375º .
Start by peeling and thinly slicing the turnips and mincing the cloves of garlic .
Grate about 2 cups of Gruyere cheese .
In a large oven - proof skillet , melt 2 - 3 tablespoons of butter over medium - low heat .
Place a single layer of turnips on top of the butter .
Next , sprinkle a little of the garlic on top , then – and this is purely optional and really not all that necessary – add a couple of tablespoons of butter .
Next drizzle a healthy splash of chicken broth over the turnips .
Next , do the same with the cream .
Now add a nice layer of Gruyere – about ½ cup .
Sprinkle a bit of salt , but not much as the cheese is already salty .
Repeat these layers twice more .
Sprinkle on some freshly ground black pepper .
Now pop the whole thing into the over and bake for about 20 minutes or until the top is hot , brown and bubbly .

To check out all my archived Thanksgiving recipes , flip through the PW Thanksgiving Recipe File .
I have all the basics there : turkey , gravy , dressing .
Watch for many more holiday - friendly dishes here in the coming days and weeks .
Before I continue with this unbelievably flavorful and decadent Thanksgiving recipe , let me assuage your fears : I am not trying to kill you .
No , I ’m not .
NO , I ’m not , despite what you might think .
I LOVE you .
I would never try to kill you .
You must believe me , despite all the cream and butter I ’ve used in my recipes lately .
Let ’s talk about turnips .
Oh my goodness gracious sakes alive , people — they are SO underrated .
Turnips are a root vegetable , right along with carrots , celery root , rutabagas , and parsnips , and while they might somewhat resemble potatoes in color , texture , and circumference , once you take a bite of this dish , you ’ll seriously wonder why turnips have n’t swept more Thanksgiving tables than they have .
Not to malign our beautiful lover , The Potato , but I think turnips are just so much more special .
They ’re probably really good for you , too .
But to avoid snickers and jeers from the crowd , I wo n’t EVEN touch that one .
The Cast of Characters : Turnips , Butter , Garlic , Cream , Chicken Broth , Gruyere Cheese , salt , pepper , and whatever herbs you ’d like to use , if any .
This is Gruyere cheese .
It ’s kind of like a cross between Parmesan and Swiss .
Think a hard Swiss … with a rind .
It ’s ten kinds of good , is what it is .
These are turnips .
They ’re kinds of like gigantic radishes , but not really .
If you serve them this Thanksgiving , people will oooh and aaah and be impressed .
Let ’s start by peeling the turnips .
I just use a carrot / vegetable peeler and take off the outer skin as I would an apple .
I always have little contests with myself to see if I can keep the peel in one piece .
And if it drops off and breaks , I ’m a loser .
Do n’t pretend you do n’t do things like that , too .
Now grab as many garlic cloves as you can handle …
Then smash them with the bottom of a glass .
The cloves should pop right out .
Then you can chop ’em up really finely .
I should admit to you right now that I used five garlic cloves .
And * burp* * hiccup * .
It ’s 9:00 on Sunday night and my esophagus is goin ’ crazy .
Now , let ’s grate up the Gruyere .
You know you ’ve always wanted to grate up the Gruyere .
Now .
I will admit that I grated up , like , an obscene amount of Gruyere ; this is about three cups .
You can use two cups if you do n’t want to be like me .
But if you want to be like me , that ’s okay , too .
But only as it relates to Gruyere .
Next , you ’ll want to slice the turnips really thin .
I used a mandoline , but that ’s only because my sharp knives were in the dishwasher and I was too lazy to get them out and wash them by hand .
Yes , I put my knives in the dishwasher .
I also put my crystal , my wooden spoons , and my dog in the dishwasher .
But only when he really needs a bath .
Good grief , I ’m kidding .
But only about the dog .
Once you get all the turnips sliced up thinly , add a couple of tablespoons of butter to the skillet over medium - low heat .
Swirl the skillet to coat , then place a single layer of sliced turnips on top of the butter , overlapping the edges .
Next , sprinkle a little of the garlic on top , then — and this is purely optional and really not all that necessary — add a couple of tablespoons of butter .
Next … see those droplets ?
That ’s chicken broth , and I drizzled a healthy splash over the turnips .
After that , I did the same with the cream .
Then I added a healthy layer of Gruyere — probably about a half a cup .
And “ healthy layer of Gruyere ” could probably be considered a relative term .
I sprinkle on a little salt , but the Gruyere has plenty of salt already in it …so proceed with caution .
I mostly just wanted to show you salt granules mid-air .
I LOVE using my flash !
It opens up a whole new world of frozen action .
Do n’t tell anyone I said that .
At this point , you have a nice layer of turnips , chicken broth , garlic , butter , and cream .
And by now , the bottom should be bubbling nicely .
You want that to continue while you ’re assembling the rest .
Go ahead and add another layer of sliced turnips and garlic …
And splash on a little broth …
Followed by a little cream .
And I mean it when I say “ a little . ”
I ’m NOT trying to kill you , remember ?
Next , add another layer of cheese .
And by the way , you can use ANY cheese — or combination thereof — that you wish .
Gruyere is special and delicious , but white cheddar , Gorgonzola , or any other cheese would work just splendidly .
Let ’s do another layer , just for kicks .
Meanwhile , the pan is bubbling slowly .
A little butter .
Totally optional .
If you do n’t use it , you wo n’t hurt my feelings .
Do n’t forget the splash of broth …
The splash of cream …
And finally , a nice layer of cheese .
And did I mention the cheese ?
Finally , sprinkle on some freshly ground black pepper .
You can also sprinkle on some Paprika , Cayenne Pepper , or whatever else floats your boat .
I actually prefer steering clear of strongly - flavored herbs , because I think the flavor of the turnips shines through more .
Now , the beauty of preparing this in an ovenproof skillet is , you just pop the whole thing in the oven .
That ’s what you call a one - dish Thanksgiving meal .
I do 375 degrees for about twenty minutes , or until the top is hot , brown , and bubbly .
I ’m sorry .
Did someone say “ hot , brown , and bubbly ? ”
Let me encourage you : if you have n’t entered the world of turnips before , make this for Thanksgiving this year .
Unless you live in Canada .
And in that case , you ’ll have to make it for Thanksgiving next year .
I always get sidetracked by the details .
Enjoy !
We ’re deep in an economic crisis unlike any other we ’ve known .
It may last years .
We need new and creative ways to protect working Americans , especially our older working people who have no real pensions to live on .
For years we ’ve heard the doomsayers : " We ca n’t afford Social Security . "
" We ca n’t afford ‘ single - payer ’ national health . "
One thing we all learned from the $ 700 billion bail out :
We ’ve got the money to do all of this and more .
At the moment , the Federal Reserve is literally printing money , to give not billions but trillions to banks and financial firms .
To the people of this District , the banks and others have gotten their money .
Now it ’s your turn .
Here ’s the bailout I will go to Congress to get :
First , I want to expand Social Security , our public pension system , to replace - not overnight but in stages - the private pension system which has collapsed .
Social Security now pays about 38 to 39 percent of your working income .
In other developed countries , it averages 65 percent .
That ’s where our fiscal stimulus should be : a commitment to reach this goal , a public pension that ordinary working people can live on .
Second , we have to move to single payer health care program , at least in phases : we might begin with extending Medicare to children , but the government should ultimately be the single payer for all .
That ’s not because single payer is the only ethical and efficient way to protect us all .
No , it ’s also because it is crucial to making us competitive globally .
Through single payer and expanded Social Security , the goal is to pick up the " non-wage " labor costs that employers now have to pay .
That ’s already how other countries out - compete us : they have the government and not the private employer pick up these non-wage health and pension costs .
Unless we have government pick up the costs of pensions and health care , our companies can’t compete , and we ’ll go on piling up huge trade deficits .
We ’ll have debacles like GM , which has collapsed in part because of the health and pension costs that the federal government should have been paying all along .
For years , the conservatives have said : " We ca n’t do this .
The money is n’t there . "
Well , the money is there .
It was there for the Iraq war , a colossal waste of money - and for the bailout , the first half of which has been a colossal waste as well .
And if we now have the government pick up non-wage labor costs with the use of general revenues , we will in fact make it cheaper and easier for our companies to hire .
This is in fact the best and most realistic approach for a long term recovery .
Additionally , we have to put limits on returns to financial firms .
We should re-enact the usury laws , the interest - rate caps that were in place in America up till the 1970s .
We need to stop the rates of 30 to 35 percent , the hidden fees , the hundreds of ways that banks pull our money out of industry and into gambling and speculation .
In my campaign , I will have a single minded focus on the economic security to working Americans , that 's why I so strongly support the Employee Free Choice Act and other changes in our labor laws .
And that 's why I support policies that will reduce the debt of working Americans .
Overall , the plan I am setting out here will help make our country more competitive .
I ’m a strong supporter of President Obama .
Yes , I strongly support his program to repair our infrastructure .
Even so , we do n’t have to pave the streets with gold .
If not the meltdown then the bail out should have opened our eyes .
The real fiscal stimulus has to be the kind that brings financial security to the middle class .
The message of this campaign is :
We ’re moving beyond the bailout .
Now it ’s your turn .

Steam billows out of a chimney at Syncrude 's oil sands mine in northern Alberta
By Sarah Shenker
BBC News , Fort McMurray , Alberta
In April this year , about 500 migrating ducks on their way north landed in what looked like a large lake in western Canada .
It was not a lake , but a tailings pond - a store for toxic waste from the oil sands extraction process , made up of water , clay , sand , residual bitumen and heavy metals .
Most of the ducks died , killed by the slick of oil on the water 's surface .
" It was horrifying , " says Ruth Kleinbub , a field naturalist in nearby Fort McMurray , the city at the heart of the industry in the province of Alberta .

" In the spring , the open water would be such an invitation for the ducks , and the second they hit , they would have just drowned . "
A government investigation of the incident has been handed over to Alberta 's Department of Justice , which will decide whether or not to prosecute or fine the company involved , Syncrude .
The incident was an embarrassment for Syncrude , which says its usual bird deterrent system was turned off because of the unseasonably cold weather .
It was a public relations nightmare for the Alberta government , which has been trying to convince national and international public opinion that its oil sands industry is environmentally responsible .
Environmental laggard ?
It is an argument that environmentalists say the government has lost .
" When we are looking at the tar sands , we are looking at a project that is the largest capital investment project on the face of the planet , the largest industrial project on the planet , and the ecological implications are just as great , " says Mike Hudema , an Edmonton - based climate and energy campaigner with Greenpeace Canada .

Oil sands production , which requires large amounts of energy and water to extract the bitumen from the sand , is said to produce on average at least three times the greenhouse gas emissions of conventional oil extraction .
Environmentalists say the oil sands are Canada 's fastest growing source of carbon dioxide , leading some to dub them " dirty oil " .
Output is expected to triple by 2020 .
The oil sands are single - handedly preventing Canada from meeting any of its Kyoto obligations , Mr Hudema says .
Under the UN climate agreement , Canada was to have reduced its emissions to 20 % below 2006 levels by 2020 .
The federal government has said it will not even attempt to meet those targets .
See how the industry is projected to grow Ron Stevens , the conservative deputy premier of Alberta , denies the oil sands are responsible .
He says " dirty oil " is a tag that people have developed " to smear the oil industry " .
If you take into account the lifecycle of the oil , including refining and transportation , he says , " the CO2 emissions become very comparable to oil from a number of other countries , including Venezuela " .
Even on that " well - to - wheels " basis , oil from the oil sands produces about 15 % more emissions than conventional oil .
There has been some debate as to whether US reliance on Canadian oil ( Canada is the largest oil exporter to the US ) could make it difficult for California to meet its new Low - Carbon Fuel Standard .
Steam rises from a tailings pond in northern Alberta , Canada
During the US election campaign , President - elect Barack Obama 's team talked of breaking the US 's addiction to " dirty , dwindling " oil - seen by many as a direct reference to the oil sands .
In recognition of the growing concern , the Alberta government announced a C$ 2bn ( $ 1.6bn ; £ 1.1 bn ) plan to fund a number of carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) projects , which by 2015 could be sequestering 5 m tons of CO2 annually .
It has also imposed legislation that requires all industries to cut emissions by 12 % or face fines of C$ 15 a tonne .
A Calgary - based environmental think tank , the Pembina Institute , is sceptical that the projects will do much to mitigate emissions , which are predicted to rise to 141m tonnes of CO2 by 2020 .
" I think we 're overselling this as a solution , " says its oil sands programme director Simon Dyer .
' Too much money ' Earlier this year , the Pembina Institute withdrew from a government - sponsored advisory body , the Cumulative Environmental Management Association ( Cema ) , saying the government was failing to impose recommended limits to protect the environment .
The Fort McMurray Environmental Association , which manages air monitoring stations throughout the region , left Cema at the same time over what it described as a lack of planning to deal with the long - term effects of large - scale development .
" It 's full speed ahead when it comes to the oil sands , that 's the government 's mentality , " says association president Ann Dort - McLean .
" This is northern Alberta .
It 's absolutely gorgeous up here , and that beauty needs to be protected , " she says .
Ms Dort -McLean is not alone .
A poll commissioned by the Pembina Institute in 2007 suggested that 71 % of Albertans felt that oil sands development should be slowed down or stopped until infrastructure and environmental management issues were addressed .
I 'm concerned about any community and any ecosystem downstream or downwind
Kevin Timoney
Environmental scientist
For their part , oil sands companies say they have to deal with some of the world 's strictest environmental regulations when it comes to reclamation and water use .
The industry uses regulated amounts of water from the Athabasca River to separate bitumen from the sand .
The water leftover from the extraction process , known as tailings , contains arsenic , mercury , napthenic acids and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) .
Much of the water is reused , but the industry is producing 1.8 m litres of tailings a day which need to be contained in large earthen dams .
As of March this year , tailings covered 130 sq km .
Industry and government are adamant that no tailings ever leak back into the river , or into deep aquifers .
It has been widely reported in the Canadian media that oil sands company Suncor admitted to a leak of 1,600 sq m from its Tar Island Pond 1 tailings pond in 1997 , although a current spokesman for Suncor says he does not have any information about the incident .
Environmental scientist Kevin Timoney says he has seen data that suggest elevated levels of PAHs downstream of the plants , which he says could only be attributable to oil sands production .
" I think eventually , when all the studies are complete , we should be able to conclude that the tar sands industry is creating an environmental catastrophe , " Mr Timoney says .
Reclamation or restoration ?
The tailings ponds , and the mine sites , which currently cover 420 sq km , will eventually have to be reclaimed to " equivalent land use " .
" The industry is applying a lot of technology to minimising the impact of tailings ponds , " says Martyn Griggs of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers .
Syncrude even have a herd of bison living on reclaimed land
Syncrude says it has reclaimed 47 sq km since 1978 , including its Gateway Hill site , covering just over one sq km , in March this year .
Steve Gaudet , Syncrude 's environmental manager , says reclamation is slow by its very nature , and often takes at least 20 years .
However , the Pembina Institute 's Mr Dyer says Gateway Hill is " completely unrepresentative of the challenges the industry faces " .
The site was not a former mine , but a low - lying wetland used to store earth moved to make way for a mine elsewhere .
It is now a forested hill with walking trails .
" The industry talks a lot about potential technological solutions , but you 'll notice they always talk about solutions in the future tense , " Mr Dyer says .
The Pembina Institute and Greenpeace have both called for a halt to new oil sands developments .
Greenpeace 's Mr Hudema says what happening with the oil sands is fundamentally changing people 's perception of Canada as an environmentally progressive country .
" What we are doing in Alberta is simply beyond imagination and beyond belief , " he says .

WHOOPS … It was just a slip !
Joe Biden and wife Jill appeared on Oprah Winfrey yesterday .
The show was live from Washington in celebration of the Presidential inauguration today .
During the interview Jill Biden had a little slip of the tongue when she said : “ that he had his pick of being Barack Obama ’s running mate or the secretary of state nomination that eventually went to Hillary Rodham Clinton ” a slip that the vice president - elect immediately tried to shush .
Everyone seemed to laugh it off .
Lets just hope she does n’t get wind of any top secret information … that could be really bad !

This is at least the 20th drone strike on Pakistani soil since the start of August .
But it 's the " first since Petraeus assumed leadership of the U.S. Central Command , " the Long War Journal observes .
And Petraeus shows no sign of calling off the unmanned attacks .

Debunking Domestic Violence Statistics
The following is a copy of a letter written by Eeva Sodhi in response to a Globe and Mail article , 2002 02 23 : The Globe and Mail : Child - welfare time lost on paperwork , report says
By SIMON COOPER INVESTIGATIONS UNIT
[ A summary of the article is appended  WHS ]
Sir , The problem is not that there are insufficient numbers of social workers .
Rather , it is the allocation of those resources .
What is needed is to re-educate social workers and reassign their priorities .
It is of grave concern that the entire , and I mean entire , emphasis now is on the so - called family / domestic , etc. violence , which in the social worker lingo means " violence against women " .
Children are linked as appendices to women and only receive attention when they can be used as propaganda tools .
Though the scientific community now has to admit that females are at least as violent as males , even if they may express it in a slightly different manner , often perpetrating their acts of aggression by proxy , all counselling is based on William Glasser 's Reality Therapy .
Men 's therapy groups - to stop the violence that exists in relationships between men and women .
Therapists use a discussion format to explore men's violence in relationships and to propose non-violent alternatives for solving problems .
Responsibility for one 's actions and consequence of choice are emphasized .
Women 's therapy groups - to increase women 's understanding of violence between partners and to provide them with strategies for protecting themselves against that violence .
Therapists encourage open and frank discussion about past violence and explore methods of avoiding violence in the future .
The Ontario government spends $ 145 million in direct contributions to combat violence against women , yet there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that we are in the grips of an all out epidemic of wife beatings and homicides .
Rather , all the available data point to the other direction : women are the aggressors , not the aggrieved , especially when it comes to child abuse , often fatal .
Health Canada is currently compiling ER data on injury admissions .
The South Fraser ( B.C. ) Regional Injury Report is the first pilot project of its kind available in Canada .
South Fraser Regional Report Period 1 http://www.injuryresearch.bc.ca/SFHR_RegionalReport1.pdf
When questioned , Kate Turcotte , representing the project , replied : For the Inflicted Injuries , the numbers are 359 for males and 117 for females .
Unfortunately , due to issues around small numbers , we are not able to provide more data regarding the cross tabulations .
Certainly , in future , we will be able to produce these tables in greater detail , and separately for males and females .
Our system is coded using the International Classification of Disease system ( ICD - 10 CA ) .
Any injuries resulting from domestic violence , and identified as such in the Emergency Department , will be identifiable in our database .
Of the Inflicted Injuries reported , a subsample of these will be family violence .
As the numbers for domestic violence will be fairly small for our first 3 - month time period , I believe that it would be beneficial to you if we put together a report on Intentional Injury once we have received our full year of data .
We are expecting to have received all of the Fiscal year 2001 / 2002 data by the end of June .
At that time we will be able to provide a more detailed breakdown of Intentional Injuries , included domestic violence by sex , and we will also be able to do a comparison of our three regions .
I hope that this helps for now ,
Kate Turcotte and in another message : Included at the bottom of this message are the ICD - 10 CA codes that relate to violence , including domestic violence .
However , in ICD - 10 there are also many other codes that could be selected concerning Inflicted Injury , which do not identify who inflicted the injury .
Assault ( X85 - Y09 )
Includes : homicide
injuries inflicted by another person with intent to injure or kill ,
by any means

The FBI in the U.S.A. has been collecting data on family violence .
Their intake data are sex specific for both alleged perpetrators and victims .
Yet , these data are selectively disseminated either as sex specific or sex neutral so as to make it appear that female family members are the victims and males the perpetrators .
See : NIBRS paper " The Structure of Family Violence : an Analysis of Selected Incidents " URL http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/nibrs/famvio21.pdf
The paper " The Structure of Family Violence : an Analysis of Selected Incidents " gives the sex of the victims , the offender statistics are gender neutral .
On page 11 , for example , you find the following information : " ... However , in family situations , these children represent 62 percent of all victims .
Juveniles aged 12 - 17 comprise 29 percent overall offenses and 26 percent in family in family occurences .
Females are frequent victims of these offenses , comprising 75 percent of the victims of both family and overall offenses " [ end quote ]
Table 29 .
Percent Distribution of Victims by Age , Sex , and Race , Other Offenses , 1995 ( The other tables are formulated by the same principle )
The definitions in the data include spouse , parent , sibling , step - parent , stepchild , in - law , grandchild , grandparent , common - law spouse , other family member , etc .
Based on that , the offender is not always a male .
The reader is left to wonder what are the numbers in the following categories : Female offender / female victim ; female offender / male victim ; male offender / male victim ; male offender / female victim , as well as victim / offender and offender / victim relationship , by sex and age ( i.e. child , juvenile , young adult , elderly , biological parent , stepparent , etc. ) .
Without that information , there are no means to establish the sex ratio as it applies to the offenders .

" Gender Differences in Patterns of Relationship Violence in Alberta " .
Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science , Vol. 31 , No. 3 , July 1999 . pp. 150-160 ) http://www.mensrights.com.au/page13ae.htm report : Gender differences in patterns of relationship violence were investigated in a representative sample of adult men ( N=356 ) and women ( N=351 ) .
Results : Gender patterns in violence reports :
A smaller proportion of women reported male only violence ( 13 % ) compared to female only violence ( 35 % ) , and fewer women reported male initiation of violence ( 26 % ) than female initiation of violence ( 67 % ) .
Patterns of relationship violence : Only 3 of the 52 women who reported receiving any violence in the year prior to the survey fit the batterer / victim pattern of clearly asymmetrical violence .
The majority of violence reported by respondents was equally perpetrated by men and by women , relatively minor and infrequent , and did not result in serious injury .
( p. 157 ) Conclusions : Consistent with research outside Canada , men and women reported similar rates of violence perpetration and victimization .
And , while more comprehensive study is needed , it appears that a substantial proportion of womens violence cannot be explained as acts of self - defense .
( p.158 ) Nevertheless , those women who did report using violence in intimate relationships , 73.4 % said they struck the first blow , women physically abuse children more than men do and that only minor differences exist between male and female aggression .
Stets and Straus found the female - severe / male - minor pattern to be significantly more prevalent violence pattern than male - severe / female - minor .
For dating couples , 12.5 % reported the female - severe pattern and 4.8 % reported the male - severe pattern ; 1.2 % of cohabiting couples reported the male - severe pattern compared to 6.1 % reporting female - severe ; 2.4 % of married couples reported male - severe and 7.1 % reported female - severe .
With these data , the use of severe violence by females was not in reaction to male violence or as a preemptive strike , since the female partner in each couple reported only minor violence from her male partner despite using severe violence herself .
Similarly , couples where only the female was violent were significantly more common ( 39.4 % of dating couples , 26.9 % of cohabiting couples , 28.6 % of married couples ) than couples where only the male was violent ( 10.5 % of dating couples , 20.7 % of cohabiting couples , 23.2 % of married couples ) .
What is experienced , especially in intimate relationships , is the power advantage women appear to have in their ability to introspect , analyze and describe feelings and process .
Hence , assaultive males report feeling powerless in respect to their intimate partners .

BJS report NCJ - 151658 notes that there are 2 rapes or attempted rapes reported per 1,000 US citizens , which is 530,000 reports of rape per year .
There are 15,000 rape convictions annually .
Based on new DNA tests , a third of those convictions are now found to be false .
Therefore , there are potentially 520,000 false rape allegations a year .
Sentencing : Advocacy information : Nearly 90 % of spouse murderers receive a prison sentence , with an average sentence of thirteen years .
Convicted spouse murderers were less likely to receive a severe sentence ( 12.7 % received a life sentence and 9.3 % received probation ) compared to non-family murder convicts ( 16 % received a life sentence and 2.7 % received probation ) .
( Federal Bureau of Investigation , 1994 ) Actual statistics : Nearly 13 percent of wives accused of killing husbands were acquitted , compared with 1.4 percent of husbands accused of killing their wives .
Of those convicted , 16 percent of the women had received probation instead of prison , ten times the rate for men .
The average prison sentence for women convicted of intimate homicide was six years , compared to 17 for men .
Of the 25 women pardoned by Governor Richard Celeste ( Ohio ) in 1990 , 15 said they had not been physically abused .
Six had discussed killing their husbands beforehand , and two had tracked down their estranged spouses to kill them .
One Maryland woman who had been freed had hired a hit man and collected on her husband 's insurance policy .
The data are limitless , yet we still rely on the innovative feminist documentation of non existing " facts " , based on such phrases as " some researchers believe " , or " it is believed that ... "
In the meantime , tens of thousands of Canadian children suffer incredible torture in the hands of their parents , mainly mothers , and we only hear of some of them who die such horrible death as Randal Dooley in Toronto .
It is up to the media to become informed and to begin to disseminate facts rather than promote the goals of a destructive ideology .
First step in the right direction would be to demand that all women 's studies departments in their present form be dismantled .

The Globe and Mail article : Child - welfare time lost on paperwork , report says
By SIMON COOPER
INVESTIGATIONS UNIT
Saturday , February 23 , 2002  Print Edition , Page A1
Summary :
An internal report of the Ontario Children 's Aid Society , obtained by the Globe and Mail claims that Social workers in charge of children 's welfare spend most of their time ( 85 % ) " with paperwork and bureaucracy rather than providing frontline care . "
The report comes in the wake of the deaths of several children in care , including that of Jordan Heikamp , an infant who starved to death in 1997 while in the care of a children 's aid society in Toronto .
Ontario experienced a 100 % increase , with some agencies , during the past three years in the number of children coming into care of Ontario's 55 children 's aids societies ( CAS ) .
[ In the opinion of many people familiar with the failings of the system , the increase is more likely due to CASs becoming far more intrusive and far more powerful than they used to be .
That follwing paragraph , quoted from the article , supports that . ]
In Ontario , new procedures for assessing risk to children , brought in through recent changes to the child - welfare system , have been pinpointed as one of the root causes for the diversion of social workers away from frontline work .
The article quotes a number of social workers that indicate that the problem of increasing entanglement of social service aganecies in bureaucratic work is all - pervasive throughout Canada , and that in Ontario alone , the amount of unpaid overtime work equates to 650 full - time social worker positions , and quotes from the report that although , " ' significant accomplishments have been realized , ' ... the cumbersome nature of some of the new procedures has resulted in ' unintended negative consequences ' for the quality of social work . "
Aside from identifying the plight of the poor over - worked social workers that have to spend between 70 and 85 percent of their working hours wading through a morass of bureaucratic procedures rather than actually helping children in need of their help , the article states that , " Other issues of concern outlined in the report include :
Too little time for staff to thoroughly investigate and assess new cases ;
Senior social workers prevented from supervising and training younger workers because of growing administrative burdens ;
Increased risk to children because social workers do not have the time to properly get to know them or their family 's problems .
The article concludes with the following : The Children 's Aid Society of Metro Toronto , which has experienced a 27 - per-cent increase in cases since 1997 , has been introducing its own reforms to help free up social workers .
These include hiring special support staff to do paperwork , recruiting legal clerks to handle more of the court - related bureaucracy and improving computer software used for case management .
More than 2,000 new social workers have also been trained in the past two years .
Investigations@globeandmail.ca
Although the article makes it quite clear how enormous an industry CASs have become and that they 'll without any doubt grow to astounding and cancerous proportions , it is odd that the article did n't express the slightest bit of curiosity about the fact that fewer and fewer children are being born in Canada every year , and yet , that problems affecting children and requiring intervention by social workers increase to massively .
What seems to be at work is a classical case of Parkinson 's Law : in any bureaucracy , " Work expands to use up available time . "
To which should be added that work will also expand to consume all other resources that will be made available .
After all , CASs are organizations in search of problems .
That does n't mean that they do n't attempt to solve the problems they find , but it does mean that they will not solve them necessarily to everyone 's satisfaction , nor does it mean that they do n't create problems where none exist , [* ] or that they find all of the problems they should find .

Mark Felt admitted he was Deep Throat in 2005 Mark Felt , the former FBI official who revealed himself to be Deep Throat , the source that exposed the Nixon - era Watergate scandal , has died .
His family say he died at a hospice near his home in California , aged 95 .
Deep Throat helped reporters from the Washington Post newspaper uncover abuses of presidential powers in the Nixon White House .
The scandal ultimately led President Richard Nixon to resign in disgrace in August 1974 .
I 'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat
Mark Felt in 2005
Obituary : Mark Felt Mr Felt 's daughter Joan told the Washington Post that her father " slipped away " in his sleep .
According to the newspaper , he had suffered two strokes in recent years , and his memory of the Watergate era had almost completely vanished because of Alzheimer 's disease .
Political cover-ups Mystery surrounded the identity of Deep Throat - named after a popular pornographic movie of the time - for decades , until Mark Felt admitted being the source in 2005 .
" I 'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat , " he told the US magazine Vanity Fair in an article that revealed his secret .
Until then , the Washington Post had refused to confirm his identity .
Reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein had said they would only break their silence after his death .
He secretly guided the journalists as they investigated a burglary at the Democratic National Committee HQ in Washington 's Watergate complex in June 1972 .

Advertisement Further inquiries unearthed a web of political spying , sabotage and bribery that led all the way to the White House and , eventually , President Nixon 's resignation .
It is not known exactly why Mr Felt decided to leak damaging secrets but the Washington Post said he detested the Nixon administration 's attempts to subvert the FBI 's investigations into the crimes and cover ups .
According to the Post , Mr Felt had insisted on remaining completely anonymous , or on " deep background " .
He was dubbed Deep Throat by a newspaper editor .
Mr Felt is said to have struggled for many years with the consequences of his actions , fearing he betrayed his FBI badge by disclosing government secrets .
Critics called him a traitor for betraying the Commander - in - Chief .
His supporters insist Felt was a hero for blowing the whistle on a corrupt administration .

Footage filmed in the village of Khoza 'a , east of Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip , shows an unidentified incendiary substance found next to a burnt - out home
ATLANTA ( Reuters ) - Republicans in Congress may be playing a high - risk game by flexing their muscles and snubbing a popular new U.S. president who very publicly sought their support .
They denied President Barack Obama , a Democrat , even one vote for a more - than - $ 800 - billion economic stimulus plan in the U.S. House of Representatives , urging him to cut both government spending and people ’s taxes .
The plan passed the House on Wednesday and another bill will likely pass the Senate next week before lawmakers hammer out a joint bill likely to clear both Democratic - controlled houses by mid-February .
Hewing a tough conservative line may please Republican supporters outside Washington for the moment but the strategy could backfire in the long term if perceived as an obstacle to economic recovery .
“ The minority party is ... searching for ways to be relevant and maybe this is a way for them to do it , ” said Phil Smith , political director of the Concord Coalition , a non-partisan organization that promotes fiscal responsibility .
In doing so , they acknowledge a short - term risk .
Obama ’s popularity is high and a Pew Research Center poll shows the economy is the dominant issue for voters .
Republicans want to show they are the party of low taxes and small government -- and resisting Obama ’s package is a way to prove it .
But Obama is n’t giving up .
He has sought their support and will keep on trying , the White House says .
RISKS FOR REPUBLICANS
It ’s a risk .
If the package revives the economy , Republicans could face elections for Congress in 2010 saddled with the burden of having opposed crucial legislation .

Complicating matters is a feeling among some conservatives they squandered their reputation for being careful with public finances under President George W. Bush , Obama ’s predecessor for eight years that ended on January 20 .
Many Republicans believe that although Bush cut taxes , he violated the twin party goals of small government and restrained spending .
Democrats are quick to say Republican lawmakers played a leading role in the shift to big spending since after all they controlled Congress for six of the eight years Bush held office .
“ Republicans failed to stick to their principles while in office , ” said Kelly McCutchen , vice president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation , an independent think tank that promotes limited government and economic freedom .
Conservatives argue their hard line on the economic stimulus bill is an opportunity to return to the principles that underpinned their electoral success .
Republicans are further struggling with how to position themselves as winners , having lost control of Congress in 2006 and the presidency in November when Obama defeated Republican Senator John McCain .
NEW LEADERSHIP
Elections this week for a new chairman of the Republican National Committee should go some way toward giving the party a high - profile national spokesman .
Political science professor Cal Jillson said the party was in a state of “ ideological confusion ” .
“ There is a debate about whether their future is in returning to the principles of small government , low taxes and military strength ... or to try to reconfigure the party for the coming decades ... ( as ) a more moderate party , ” said Jillson of Southern Methodist University in Texas .
As evidence , he cited the range of opinions among Republican governors over the economic stimulus plans .
Governor Mark Sanford of South Carolina , the chairman of the Republican Governors Association , leads a group deeply suspicious of the package .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger says his state could use the improvements an economic recovery plan might offer for education , environment , health , infrastructure and jobs .
Even if Republicans reposition themselves as a party of low taxes that opposes increased government spending , a larger question emerges : is the ideology an election winner ?
Jillson said he had his doubts .
“ This ( low taxes ) is a signature Republican position but they have ridden it to defeat in 2006 and 2008 , ” he said .
In the end , some Republicans may well buy in to Obama ’s appeal for their support , putting forward ideas and backing a final version of the economic stimulus plan that takes into account some of their concerns .
BATTLE , England ( CNN ) -- Townsfolk in England have delivered their explosive verdict on Sarah Palin , stuffing a giant effigy of the U.S. Republican vice presidential nominee with fireworks and blowing her up to raucous cheers .
Sarah Palin was depicted holding a machine gun , flanked by a moose and Barack Obama .
The unusual display was the climax of an annual bonfire celebration Saturday in the southern town of Battle , where political figures are a favorite target of a local tradition that sees a different icon destroyed each year .
This year 's creation was a rather unflattering depiction of the self - declared " hockey mom , " a machine gun brandished in her muscular arms , bright red lipstick surrounding a grimacing smile and a moose at her side .
Daubed beneath her was the slogan : " Too hot to handle . "
The caricature of the Alaskan governor was flanked by a smaller effigy of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama , wearing a military - style helmet .

Organizers of the event , which saw a procession of flaming torches march through the historic town before igniting a bonfire and detonating the effigy , say the politically - themed pyrotechnics were not meant to cause offense .
" We just felt she was one of the most interesting characters in the American elections , " Matt Southam told the Rye and Battle Observer .
" It 's tongue - in - cheek and she 's getting more attention that the other two , so she seemed like an ideal candidate . "
The event , believed to date back to 1646 , has seen British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his predecessor Tony Blair go up in smoke in recent years .
Despite heavy rain , Palin 's likeness went up in seconds -- a shower of sparks followed by an giant bang , and an amused round of applause .

Hours after Prime Minister Ehud Olmert declared victory in the Gaza Strip , the hawkish contender to succeed him paid a visit to wounded soldiers and insisted that the enemy had not been defeated .
“ We have a strong people and a strong military that dealt a harsh blow to Hamas , but unfortunately the work is still not done , ” Benjamin Netanyahu said before television cameras outside a hospital last week .
“ Hamas still controls Gaza . ”
That was only the warmup .
“ We cannot show weakness against Hamas and its Iranian supporters , ” the opposition leader added .
“ We need a strong , unwavering , persistent hand until the threat is eliminated . ”

Israel ’s election campaign , placed on hold during the 22 - day military assault , is back in full swing .
And despite a wartime popularity boost for the center - left government ’s senior ministers , Netanyahu has emerged with his front - runner status intact -- and with new ammunition for his bid to unseat them .
The Feb. 10 elections offer a stark contrast of scenarios as the Obama administration considers how to forge a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians .
That task starts this week with a visit to the region by its new Middle East envoy , former Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell .
Netanyahu , a former prime minister , is manifestly less interested in negotiating an agreement on Palestinian statehood than is either of his main rivals .
His closest opponent , Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , has led Israel ’s talks with the U.S. - backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank for more than a year and wants to continue them .
During that time , Israelis became more skeptical of peace as Hamas , the Islamic militant group running Gaza , stepped up rocket fire into southern Israel .
And that has helped Netanyahu hold a consistent lead in voter surveys before and since the Gaza offensive .
Advertisement
The intense heat of battle in Gaza , halted Jan. 18 by Israel ’s unilateral cease - fire , has pushed the Israeli electorate even more to the right .
Voters think more about protecting their nation from Palestinians , including the minority who are citizens of Israel , than about giving them an independent state .
“ It ’s a paradox that , throughout Israel ’s history , whenever the left fights a successful war , the right gains politically , ” said Maya Yaakov , a close campaign aide to Livni .
“ We are a very nationalist people , and war brings our nationalist passions to the fore . ”
In the race for 120 seats in parliament , polls conducted in the last week gave Netanyahu ’s Likud Party a lead of three to 12 seats over Livni ’s centrist Kadima party , headed by Olmert until corruption scandals forced him to call elections a year ahead of schedule .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak ’s left - leaning Labor Party , a junior partner in the governing coalition , is far back in the polls , even though the Gaza offensive helped Barak , as well as Livni , gain sharply higher personal approval ratings .
Advertisement
Although the standing of the three leading parties has changed little since the offensive , the extreme right - wing Israel Is Our Home party has gained , pulling even with Labor in third place .
Avigdor Lieberman , the rightist party ’s leader , has denounced the cease - fire as “ a firetrap . ”
He also engineered a vote in parliament , widely supported in opinion surveys but blocked by the Supreme Court , to disqualify two Israeli Arab parties from the election .
He said their leaders “ should be dealt with like Hamas . ”
The latest polls indicate that Likud , Our Home and other right - wing parties could together win a slim majority in parliament , allowing Netanyahu to govern without watering down his hard - line agenda .
Israel invaded Gaza with the declared aim of crippling Hamas ’ ability and will to fire rockets into Israel .
The decision was both a risk and an opportunity for Livni and Barak , who worked with Olmert in deciding Israel ’s every military and diplomatic move .
Advertisement
Conventional wisdom held that an Israeli victory would help both candidates , at Netanyahu ’s expense , and that a long , inconclusive stalemate would hurt them .
But although Hamas ’ paramilitary forces suffered a clear setback , Netanyahu has tried to shape Israelis ’ perception of the outcome as something less than mission accomplished .
He and other Likud candidates are praising the military ’s bravery while criticizing the political leadership for halting the operation and missing a chance to overthrow the Hamas government .
That message has a receptive audience .
Although Israelis firmly supported the assault on Hamas , polling last week showed them divided evenly on whether the military should have withdrawn from Gaza , as it did Wednesday , or taken control of the seaside enclave .
The shortened election campaign is being waged partly along that fault line as Netanyahu ’s challengers defend the decision to implement a cease - fire two days before President Obama ’s inauguration .
Advertisement
Livni is taking credit for securing U.S. and European support for an international agreement on steps to choke off Hamas ’ weapons pipeline through Egypt .
After that , “ there was a public call to continue more and more , ” she told students at a management school Tuesday , “ but when I felt we had won and achieved our goals , ” the operation ended .
Barak , speaking in Tel Aviv to an industrialists group Thursday , said Hamas was surprised by the intensity of the military campaign and now has “ very little appetite ” to keep fighting .
“ We can expect a very limited recurrence of shooting for a long period of time , ” he said .
Advertisement
Seizing on its leader ’s wartime popularity , the Labor Party has launched a new campaign under the slogan “ At the Moment of Truth -- Barak . ”
But Barak is given little chance of regaining the prime minister ’s job , which he held for 20 months from 1999 to 2001 .
The race is considered a duel between Netanyahu and Livni , with Barak angling to keep the defense minister ’s job no matter who wins .
Livni is trying to cut Netanyahu ’s lead by attacking his credibility , his turbulent three years as prime minister in the 1990s and the policies that unfettered Israel ’s financial markets , widening the gap between rich and poor , when he was finance minister five years ago .
To a scandal - weary electorate , Livni is touting the fact that she , unlike Olmert and her two main opponents , has never been investigated by the police for alleged financial irregularities .
And she is trying to marshal the admiration Israelis felt for Obama ’s presidential run by portraying herself as Israel ’s candidate of youth , hope , integrity and change .
At 50 , she is nine years younger than Netanyahu and 16 younger than Barak , and would be the first woman to lead Israel in nearly four decades .
Advertisement
Her campaign is handing out T - shirts across Israel with the slogan “ Believni . ”
But the fighting in Gaza has helped Netanyahu neutralize Livni ’s campaign , his supporters say , by allowing him to emphasize his security experience as a former prime minister .
It has also let him say , “ I told you so , ” reminding voters that he opposed Israel ’s unilateral withdrawal of military bases and settlements from Gaza in 2005 .
During the recent offensive , Netanyahu suspended his election campaign to volunteer as a spin doctor for Israel ’s cause on international television networks .
( And to be sure it was noticed at home , he arranged for Israel ’s Channel 2 to document his public relations blitz . )
His campaign has unveiled a new slogan , “ Netanyahu : Strong on security , strong on the economy , ” hoping Gaza will eclipse the credibility and corruption issues raised by Livni .

“ The more you ’re talking about big issues facing the country , I think the stronger position he ’s in , ” said Ron Dermer , a senior campaign aide .

Flame thrown :
Boy hurled through window when toilet exploded after he sprayed air freshener then sparked a lighter
A German schoolboy was blown out of his toilet and through a window when the lavatory exploded into a fireball after he sparked a lighter just moments after spraying the room with air freshener .
The toilet turned into an orange fireball when Dennis Bueller , 13 , began playing with a lighter after he sprayed the downstairs WC in his home .
' I sprayed the toilet because it smelled , ' said Dennis .
' Then I began fiddling with a lighter my dad left in there and suddenly there was this big orange whoosh ! of flame .
I woke up outside with my clothes burned off me and smelling like a barbecue . '
Dennis Bueller 's toilet exploded after he sparked a lighter just moments after spraying some air freshener
The tin of Purple Rose air freshener stated that it was not to be used near naked flame but Dennis admitted he had n’t read the instructions .
The boy from Recklinghausen was rushed to hospital but later transferred to a specialist burns unit .
He has suffered burns over his face , arms , legs and upper body and will need months of treatment .
His father Artur Bueller said ; ' Poor Dennis .
When the doctors have to change his bandages he has to be knocked out , the pain is so great .
' He said the downstairs loo smelled but I think he realises he was a bit dim in playing with a lighter . '
Greetings , fellow SkyWatchers !
Are you ready for another weekend under the stars ?
Then get out your telescopes and let ’s go globular as we hunt down Messier Object 79 .
Polar weather got you down ?
Then let ’s take a look at the pole stars both north and south and check into what Sir William Herschel was doing at this time of year .
Then learn your history and I ’ll meet you outside in the dark … .
Friday , January 16 , 2009 –
In 1978 on this date , NASA named 35 candidates for space shuttle missions , including Sally Ride as the first female U.S. astronaut and Guion Bluford , Jr. , as the first black .
In 1973 , the Lunokhod 2 mission was beginning its robotic lunar expedition , and in 1969 Soyuz 4 and 5 became the first vehicles to dock in space and exchange cosmonauts .
The year 1730 saw the birth of Jean Bochart – publisher of LaPlace ’s planet / ecliptic theory .
Although eventually beheaded for his politics , Bochart put together Europe ’s largest collection of astronomical instruments and was renowned for his calculations of cometary orbits , made jointly with long - time friend and co-observer Charles Messier .
Tonight , venture into Lepus for a faint , round , fuzzy object that might easily be mistaken for a comet in a small telescope or binoculars — Messier Object 79 ( RA 05 24 10 Dec +24 31 27 ) .
The true beauty of this object is revealed in large telescopes .
Behold a globular cluster , one of many densely packed balls of stars that mainly congregate near our galactic center .
Discovered by Pierre Mechain and cataloged by Messier in 1780 , M79 is on the opposite side of our galaxy , and about 4,200 light - years away .
Spanning 118 light - years , this starry sphere may not be an original member of our galaxy at all but an import .
Although we ca n’t see it happening , the Canis Major Dwarf galaxy is slowly being incorporated into our own system , and M79 might very well be a product of this union !
Thanks to Mechain and Messier ’s careful notes , William Herschel later recovered M79 and resolved its stars .
Although the practice of maintaining an astronomy diary is n’t for everyone , keeping simple records is very rewarding .
Make note of the object ’s appearance , equipment used , and sky conditions .
Observing diaries just like those of Messier and Mechain have led countless astronomers along the road of discovery to all the deep - sky objects we know today !
Saturday , January 17 , 2009 – Celebrate the 1723 birthday of Johann Tobias Mayer , the German astronomer who created the first lunar tables for determining longitudes at sea .
His calculations were accurate to within a half degree !
If you ’re up before sunrise , look at the Moon now nearing third quarter .
How many lunar seas can you still identify ?
Can you navigate to Spica nearby ?
Tonight let ’s go from one navigational extreme to another as viewers in the Northern Hemisphere try their hand ( and eye ) at 390 light - year distant Polaris .
Its fame as a ‘‘ fixed star ’ ’ is a bit undeserved , because it is approaching us at 25 kilometers per second .
Only its sky position closest to the north celestial pole makes Polaris appear to ‘‘ stand still ’’ while the other stars revolve around it .
Ranked the 49th brightest star , Alpha Ursa Minoris may look ordinary but is not .
Polaris is a Cepheid variable , a star that expands and contracts on a regular basis , changing its brightness slightly .
Modern
interferometry has revealed it as slightly irregular — an ‘‘ overtone pulsator ’’— and a multiple one at that .
Polaris ’ triple system took the resolving power of the Hubble Space Telescope to reveal its spectroscopic component , but even a small telescope can spot its gravitationally bound blue companion !
The Southern Hemisphere also has a near - pole star — Sigma Octanis — but at magnitude 5 ( 300 times fainter than Polaris ) , it does n’t make a good guide star .
Ancient navigators found better success with the constellation Crux , better known as the Southern Cross .
Its two brightest stars , Gacrux and acrux , are oriented north–south and point across the pole to brilliant Archenar .
Splitting the distance between Gacrux and Archenar lands you within 2 degrees of the south celestial pole .
A southern double star comparable to Polaris in appearance is Lambda Centauri .
The difference in magnitude between components and separation are about the same !
Sunday , January 18 , 2009 – ‘‘ I have looked farther into space than ever a human being did before me , ’’ writes Sir William Herschel , discoverer of thousands of deep - sky objects .
While 400 of these make up a popular observing list , many more deserve attention .
This night in 1784 , Herschel aimed his telescope toward Orion ’s stars , and he found two new sky gems !
Starting with binoculars , aim about 2 degrees northwest of the northernmost star in Orion ’s ‘‘ bow ’’ ( Pi1 Orionis ) to view NGC 1662 ( RA 04 48 24 Dec +10 56 00 ) .
With a combined magnitude of 6 , this small galactic cluster will show as a slight compression of the starfield , a challenging binocular deep - sky object .
A small telescope at modest magnification will resolve NGC 1662 into a jewel - like chain of blue and gold stars .
Astronomers have studied it extensively to refine its members ’ proper motions , and it may have once contained more stars during its 300 - million - year evolution !
Now return to M42 and go slightly north ( RA 05 35 15 Dec - 04 53 12 ) to examine NGC 1977 ) .
Also discovered on this night by Herschel , seasoned sky veterans know this area by its nickname ‘‘ the Running Man ’ ’ .
Consisting of three separate areas of emission and reflection nebulae that seem to be visually connected , 1,500 - light - year - distant NGC 1977/1975/1973 complex would be spectacular on its own if were n’t so close to M42 !
The conjoining nebula is whispery soft , its dark lanes created by interstellar dust and fine needle - like shards of carbon .
Illuminating the gases is its fueling source , the multiple star 42 Orionis — a prized double on many lists .
Through a telescope , this lovely triangle of bright nebulae and its several enshrouded stars make a wonderful region for exploration .
Can you see the Running Man within ?
Until next week ?
Dreams really do come true …
When you keep on reaching for the stars !

There is loads of discussion about Python 3 right now , with people lovin‘ and people hatin‘ .
Mostly lovin‘ it has to be said .
And just to clear some things up right now :
Firstly , unless you are the maintainer of a python library , there is no , I repeat no , reason for you to port to Python 3 right now except that you probably will like it better .
That ’s it .
Python 3 is a amazing language , but Python 2 is still great !
If you are happy with Python 2 , you can ignore Python 3 and continue as normal .
It will take some time before even most Linux distros come with Python 3 , dot - zero releases always have bugs , etc , etc .
There will come a time where there are more reasons .
I ’d expect that in a year or so we ’ll start getting Python 3 only libraries and stuff .
But right now , there is no reason .
Secondly , porting to Python 3 is not so painful as you might be led to believe som from the discussion .
2to3 works fine .
I did some testing by runnig a highly complex and magical piece of software through 2to3 in august , namely setuptools .
Sure , it did n’t work straight out of the box , but I did get it working .
The big problem was that setuptools mixes binary and string data in it ’s filehandling .
It opens files without either a text or a binary flag , because in python 2.x that flag doens’t actually do anything , and then looks to see if it ’s binary or string data by looking at the start of the file .
That part needs to be rewritten .
I got it , and buildout , running it ’s tests and seemingly working with a couple of hours of quick and dirty fixes .
Other than that , it worked .
99 % of Python software will require that level or lower of TLC after conversion , and converting to Python 3 will for a software project of typical sizes be about a days work , I guess .
And the people that needs to port early is going to write documentation for you to help you .
So do n’t worry .
The problem is if you need to support Python 2.5 and Python 3 from the same codebase , because then you will want to modify your 2.5 code so that the 2to3 conversion works without you needing to make any changes to the code afterwards .
That ’s a bit more work .
Thirdly , it ’s perfectly possible to write code that works under both 2.6 and 3.0 without conversion .
Yes , I know the whatsnew document does n’t recommend that , but that document is seriously outdated , and for example claims that you ca n’t use print .
This is incorrect , there if since a long time ago a future import that deals with that in 2.6 .
And before you need to port to 3.0 there will probably be a 2.7 out , with even more forward compatibility .
Most software projects out there does n’t need to support more than one Python version at a time .
Those who do , that is libraries and framework plugins , can for the most part move to 3.0 gradually and support two Python versions at the same time .
So , the conclusion is , Python 3 is not scary , it ’s not so incompatible as you think , and I do not think it ’s going to split the community .
That was a serious worry two years ago , but those who raised that worry , like me and Martijn Faassen , was listened to , and 2.6 has serious amounts of backwards compatibility .
So take it easy , it ’s going to be fine !
Fun with Ruby ’s Abstract Syntax Trees
By Peter Cooper
Whenever you run a Ruby program , Ruby 's parser processes the code and turns it into an " abstract syntax tree " ( an AST ) which can then be either turned into bytecode for YARV ( on Ruby 1.9 ) or be interpreted immediately ( as with Ruby 1.8 ) .
While a programming language allows programmers to represent the logic of a program in a way that 's both suitable for developers and computers to easily understand , abstract syntax trees act as a low - level tree representation of the program 's mechanics .
Given that ASTs are typically simple data structures , it 's possible to use them to convert one language to another , to semantically analyze what a program is going to do , to detect repetition , or to optimize how the final program will run .
Ilya Grigorik has written Ruby AST for Fun and Profit , a fun blog post where he looks at interacting with Ruby ASTs .
He links to some interesting libraries ( including the excellent Parsetree ) , a talk by Marc Chung , and his own app , Ruby2 Lolz , that can convert Ruby into LOLCODE ( a scary and esoteric joke programming language that reads like COBOL on LSD ) .
NEW YORK ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Former Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice has made a key step in her post - Bush administration career : The William Morris Agency announced Wednesday that it has signed her as a client .

The former professor and Stanford University provost has been in the Bush administration since its beginning , first as national security adviser and then as secretary of state .
Her appointment ended Tuesday afternoon , after Barack Obama was sworn in as president .
Although most other members of the Bush administration , save Karl Rove , might have trouble finding such a wide - ranging deal , Rice found a strong market among talent agencies .
“ It was certainly a competitive situation , ” said Jim Wiatt , chairman and CEO of the William Morris Agency .
“ She was very thorough about the process and who she would feel most comfortable with and who would be speaking on her behalf . ”
It ’s unlikely that Rice will turn up as a talking head on television , however .
The deal includes William Morris representation for books , lecture appearances and philanthropic initiatives , as well as business initiatives in media , sports and communications .
WMA co-chief operating officer Wayne Kabak said that the agency was struck not only by Rice ’s well - rounded resume .
In addition to her political career , Rice is an accomplished concert pianist as well as a big - time National Football League fan .
“ It ’s more than just books , it ’s much more than just lectures , ” Kaback said .
“ We ’re here to help her create and enhance an agenda that is very important to her in her post - government career . ”
That agenda will include philanthropic efforts involving classical music and college educations for disadvantaged students , as well as initiatives to help U.S. children become global citizens .
In support of those efforts , Rice might appear on camera , but she wo n’t be traveling the well - worn path as a news or policy analyst .
“ She ’s not interested in being a shadow secretary of state , ” Kabeck said .
“ It ’s not her goal to go on morning talk shows the day after something happens .
That ’s not what she wants to do . ”

Barack Obama can , and must , close " the infamous prison at Guantánamo Bay " as soon as he takes office , said Britain 's The Independent in an editorial .
The detention camp on America 's naval base in Cuba , where about 250 terrorist suspects are still being held today , has " done much to besmirch the reputation of the U.S. around the world . "
Obama 's plan to release some of the prisoners and bring the rest to the U.S. mainland wo n't be easy , but it 's the only way to close this " sad chapter . "
The Obama transition team is already mulling the options , said Kelli Arena in CNN online .
Obama can try some Guantánamo inmates in existing federal courts , or set up a special national security court to handle cases involving sensitive intelligence information .
President Bush 's controversial military commissions will be eliminated either way .
Obama is naive if he thinks trying terrorists in civilian courts wo n't compromise national security , said The Washington Times in an editorial .
Testimony in the court trial of the suspects in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing tipped off Osama bin Laden that the U.S. was " on his trail , " and the prosecutors ' list of 200 unindicted conspirators told al Qaida exactly which of its agents had been found out .
Obama should at least be aware that closing Gitmo wo n't be a " cost - free exercise . "

But investors may be celebrating too soon .
Analysts gave a thumbs - up to the new Palm Pre smartphone and webOS operating system , but said it was too early to conclude that the long - awaited new products can rescue Palm , which has lost both market share and cachet to Apple Inc 's AAPL.O iPhone and Research In Motion 's RIM .
TO BlackBerry .
They said important questions remain unanswered , including price , how quickly Palm can bring the device to market , and how long the phone would be exclusive to subscribers of Sprint Nextel Corp S.N , the weakest of the top three U.S. mobile services .
“ Palm remains a ‘ show - me ’ story in our view , with its turnaround dependent upon execution and financial performance beyond webOS and Pre ’s initial debut , ” said Mike Abramsky , RBC analyst who reiterated his “ sector perform . ”
At 4.8 ounces , the Pre is light in the hand and smooth to the touch , with a slight curvature to its frame once its slide - out keyboard is deployed .
Its black plastic case has only one button , like the iPhone , beneath a big , 3.1 - inch touch screen .
The Pre ’s sleek back has a lens for its 3 - megapixel camera , and a hidden tab on the side reveals a USB slot for music , charging and other data .
Users can access a full keyboard by gently sliding up the phone ’s face .
The phone ’s unveiling drew cheers from a packed auditorium in Las Vegas [ ID : nN08111363 ] , but the device was not on the CES exhibit floor as Palm is still putting finishing touches on the phone .
Palm Chief Executive Ed Colligan and Jon Rubenstein , a former Apple executive who helped create the iPod , described how users will be able to keep multiple applications open , such as email , maps , photos , and move between them .
Pre perceives applications as “ activity cards ” that users can flip through on the touch screen , Palm said .

Rubenstein was brought to Palm by private equity firm Elevation Partners , which bought a 25 percent stake in the company for $ 325 million in June 2007 .
The phone was developed under his watch , and analysts said it looked strong enough to challenge the iPhone , BlackBerry and handsets using Google Inc's GOOG .O Android operating system .
PAST FAILURES
Shares of Palm jumped to as high as $ 6.58 on Friday , from $ 3.30 before the announcement on Thursday .
RBC ’s Abramsky had raised his price target to $ 3.50 from $ 2.00 after the news .
CL King analyst Lawrence Harris said Palm ’s share vault was due to short covering , as well as excitement over what he called an “ intriguing device . ”
But he also had questions about Pre .
“ Apple is not going to be staying in one place .
Neither will Google .
Neither will Research In Motion , ” he said , adding that it was unknown how well Pre would compete with a new iPhone he expects Apple to bring out around mid-year .
Harris said
Pre ’s high quality suggested it could command a high price , but Palm would need to stick as close as it can to the iPhone ’s $ 200 price tag , which set a benchmark for U.S. smartphones when it came out last July .
Analysts also wondered if Palm would deliver the Pre efficiently , after a history of missteps that have haunted the company in recent years , including delayed delivery of its Treo 750 phone for AT&T T.N and Treo 755e for Verizon Wireless .
The Pre comes about a year and a half after Palm famously pulled the plug on its last big technology idea , the Foleo .
A public relations nightmare , the Foleo was a much - hyped portable computer that was harshly criticized when it was unveiled in May 2007 and abruptly canceled in September , just weeks before it was to expected to ship .
Palm sought to assuage these concerns , saying on Thursday that the Pre was the beginning of a long future of sophisticated smartphones based on webOS .
“ Palm webOS is something we can innovate around for a long time to come .
The platform is going to support a whole line of products and there are other products in the pipeline , ” said Brodie Keast , Palm ’s senior vice president of marketing .
Palm has long supported touch screens , multimedia , and access to online services , but the operating system in its current Centro phones is seen as antiquated .
Analysts said the new software could make Palm a more attractive takeover target for other companies in the phone industry that might not want to develop their own technology .
GOING GLOBAL ?
Palm said the Pre will be available on Sprint ’s network in the first half of 2009 .
Analysts said they were anxious to know if an overseas version would follow , and wondered about the duration of Palm ’s U.S. exclusivity agreement with Sprint , which has been engaged in a long struggle to stem customer losses .
" Larger carriers -- those who have displayed an ability to grow subscribers -- would be more advantageous , " said CL King 's Harris , naming AT&T and Verizon Wireless , owned by Verizon Communications VZ.N and Vodafone Group Plc VOD.L .
Harris said Palm should diversify beyond Sprint , which by his estimates generated 41 percent of its sales in fiscal 2008 .

One of the best tests for determining whether a financial columnist or a professional economist is a Keynesian is to examine his views on personal spending .
If he favors an increase of personal spending as a means to stimulate the economy , he is a Keynesian .
He may not call himself a Keynesian , but he is a Keynesian .
John Maynard Keynes believed that an economy could become a self - reinforcing economic depression because the general public saved too much money .
He believed that the key to economic growth is not productivity , but rather spending .
He did not believe that the price system is a reliable system of resource allocation .
For example , he did not believe that the interest rate is a price that allocates investments and savings .
He believed that it is possible that many people in the economy can save money by hoarding currency — not depositing it in a bank , where it is immediately lent .
This , he said , undermined the interest rate ’s role in equating savings and investments .
First , this observation is irrelevant in a world in which almost all currency is either deposited in a bank account or sent abroad , where it functions as a currency for black markets .
Second , hoarding currency pressures sellers to reduce prices .
This acts as an incentive for people to buy more goods and services with their currency .
The supposed excess of supply then disappears .
Holding currency is a means of thrift .
This thrift produces a positive result : lower prices and therefore greater purchasing power for the currency .
This process was disparaged by Keynes as a liquidity trap .
It was no trap .
It was a benefit for holders of currency .
Keynes and his disciples had a solution to the liquidity trap : increased government spending and monetary inflation .
This debases the currency , forcing hoarders to spend .
The process by which this was accomplished , worldwide , was World War II .
In the name of the war effort , every nation authorized its central bank to inflate .
This is what they are all doing again , in our Keynesian world , in which hardly anyone in the West hoards currency .
Central banks are inflating .
Governments are running huge deficits .
GOVERNMENT SPENDING
The Keynesian assumes that in a recession , the world is no longer suffering from scarcity .
He believes that there are no remaining opportunities for profit in serving future consumers .
The Keynesian believes that the central government must intervene and spend money in order to stimulate the economy .
Expected private demand for future goods is insufficient to persuade entrepreneurs to invest money to meet this demand .
The expected return on capital is zero .
The Keynesian economist believes that the government gets money from lenders , and that by spending this money , the government can increase demand by consumers .
This increased demand stimulates the economy .
There will be economic growth , and therefore the government will reap a positive rate of return on its investments .
This is what politicians are promising .
“ The government will be repaid . ”
It is a fantasy , but even if it comes true , this will benefit the government , not taxpayers .
Keynes was quite clear on one point : it does not matter what the government invests in .
It does not matter if the government spends every dime on building pyramids .
Or the government can bury paper money in jars , and hide these jars around the community .
This way , individuals will have an incentive to go out and dig up jars of money , and therefore this will stimulate the economy .
You might think I am exaggerating here , but this is specifically what Keynes taught in his supposedly magnum opus , The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money ( 1936 ) .
If someone believes anything as silly as the Keynesian economic system , he is likely to believe that consumer spending , in and of itself , will create such demand that the economy will be reversed from its recessionary condition .
He believes that if he can just persuade enough people to go out and spend money , no matter what they spend it on , the economy will revive .
The problem is , the only way that people can go out and spend money is to spend money that would have been used for saving and investment in producer goods .
Or else the individual can borrow money to buy consumer goods , therefore redirecting save the money from an investment to consumption .
One of the reasons consumers are so successful in reallocating money from investment to consumption is that they are willing to pay preposterously high rates of interest in order to continue spending .
An entrepreneur is not likely to pay 18 % or 24 % per annum in order to invest in some project .
A consumer is quite likely to do this , and millions of consumers do this every week .
They pay outrageous rates of interest in order to buy goods that are worth half of what they paid retail if they try to sell these goods in the used goods market a month later .
They are so present - oriented that they do not care much about the future .
They want immediate consumption .
You might think that relying on consumers to bail out the economy is to place one ’s hope in people with extremely poor economic judgment .
These people are present - oriented .
They are burdened with what Ludwig von Mises called high time preference .
The Keynesian believes that the key to long - term economic prosperity is spending , and if this requires deficit spending , so be it .
It does not matter to the Keynesian whether a consumer with poor economic judgment goes out and spends his money , or whether a government bureaucrat with even worse economic judgment goes out and spends the government ’s money on poorly conceived economic projects .
The Keynesian is convinced that both of these individuals , despite their poor economic judgment , are capable of producing economic prosperity simply by spending money on what ever they find amusing .
Former Senator Fred Thompson has produced a low - budget guerrilla video parodying Keynesian economics .
Someone without an extensive understanding of the actual writings of Keynesian economists might find Thompson ’s performance absurd .
He would conclude that no one in his right mind would believe such nonsense .
This conclusion is incorrect .
Academic economists believe it , and so do the majority of people elected to Congress .
They are going to prove just how much they believe in this theory over the next year .
They have done so since September 7 , and they are going to accelerate the amount of deficit spending in order to get the economy rolling again .
This is straight Keynesian theory .
Keynes did not believe that individuals would respond favorably to encouragement that they spend more money during a recession or a depression .
This is why he believed that the national government must intervene and run a deficit in order to stimulate the economy .
He believed , correctly , that politicians and bureaucrats have much less restraint on spending other people ’s money than individuals have with respect to their own money .
This is why Keynes appealed to politicians to increase deficits in order to increase spending .
RECOVERING KEYNESIANS
FALL OFF THE WAGON
All around us , there are individuals who once proclaimed something remotely resembling economic sanity who are now proclaiming modified Keynesian doctrine .
They are “ spend now ” Keynesians — not the real thing .
One of the most flagrant examples of a turnaround in this regard is a video editorial by Ben Stein on the CBS news program , Sunday Morning .
He said :
We are in a recession .
People are being laid off right and left .
Homes are being foreclosed in huge numbers .
Detroit is teetering on the brink of disaster .
There is a wild , palpable fear running amok in the nation .
. . .
People are planning not to spend .
They ’re not spending .
This is not a good idea .
For those of us who still have our jobs , who still have a few nickels to rub together , we should be buying like mad .
Stein then cited the source of his seemingly revolutionary idea : John Maynard Keynes .
Look , we ’re faced with John Maynard Keynes called “ the paradox of thrift . ”
If everyone is cheap and thrifty and does n’t spend , the economy slumps and everyone is poorer , not richer .
This really is n’t rocket science .
It ’s part of what caused the Great Depression .
No , this was not what caused the Great Depression .
Federal Reserve expansionary monetary policy in the 1924 — 29 period caused it .
This was intensified by nations ’ passing tariffs in 1930 that reduced world trade and shrank the division of labor .
On this point , see Ben Stein ’s high school teacher in Ferris Bueller ’s Day Off .
The script writer had it right .
Stein does not .
So , for those of us who can still pay our mortgages , let ’s tip the doorman double , get cashmere sweaters and flat screen TV ’s for our kids , and trips to Palm Springs for our wives .
If we as a group ( those of us who are still employed and have some money put aside ) buy a lot this season , we could just kick - start this economy into a higher gear .
Stein distinguishes himself from the common- variety Keynesians , who in fact are the real thing .
That would be a lot faster than the public works projects that Mr. Obama is talking about .
We , our own little selves , could keep big retail chains in business and provide a lot of employment for sales clerks , just for starters .
. . .
If we can afford it , now is not the time to zip up the wallet .
Now is the time to get out there and buy something and keep our fellow Americans employed and our beloved animals fed .
If we wait for the bureaucrats to do it , it will take too darned long .
If we do it ourselves , it will get done .
There was a time when Stein was a great defender of personal thrift .
I clearly remember an article he wrote , probably 20 years ago , about how much he saved every month .
He was forced to do this , he said , because he derived his income from selling articles and appearing as a character actor in movies .
He had no way of predicting what his income would be in the future , so he said he was almost maniacal about saving money each month , just in case his income would fall in subsequent months .
He published this personal testimony as an article in the tabloid , The American Spectator .
Stein was also a great proponent of investing in no -load stock mutual funds .
For years , he insisted that the best thing that a person could do to save for the future was to buy a no - load mutual stock funds in a stock market indexes .
He continued to recommend this through the year 2007 .
In another recent video editorial , he admitted that this advice had been wrong , and that anyone who followed it had lost a great deal of money .
His only consolation was that professional investors had also lost a lot of money , and they had been paid far more money than he ever was .
His most recent editorial , on going out and spending money , is a consistent extension of his errors in the past .
He never understood that the United States stock market is a gigantic Ponzi scheme .
He did not understand that the increase in stock prices from 1982 to the year 2000 was based on a false premise , namely , that increased American productivity was sufficient to enable companies to repay investors handsomely in the future .
He ignored the obvious : dividends were generally low for the entire period .
An individual could barely pay the supposedly low fees of their no -load mutual funds with the dividends he received .
Profits were low for the entire period , leading to a very high price / earnings ratio of 40 in 2000 — 200 for the NASDAQ .
It should have been obvious from this that the system was a Ponzi scheme .
It relied on a greater fool buying your stocks at a higher price in the future .
Those who got in early would profit ; those who got in late would lose their shirts .
From March of 2000 , this Ponzi scheme began to self - destruct .
The stock indexes peaked in 2000 , and if you discount for price inflation , all of the indexes are lower today than they were in March of 2000 .
That was the month in which I told my subscribers to get out of the stock market and stay out .
It was obvious to me that the peak had taken place .
It was clear to me that a 200 to 1 price earnings ratio for the NASDAQ could not be sustained .
It was going to crash .
It did : by 80 % .
But the perma-bulls would not change their song and dance .
They kept telling the lemmings to buy and hold an index fund of the United States stocks .
This was suicidal advice in 2000 , and it was even more suicidal advice in 2007 .
But the lemmings liked the story , so Keynesians kept preaching it , along with the Supply - Siders and Chicago School economists .
Ponzi schemes eventually break down .
This is why the stock market is down today .
Every system of investing that does not rely on the actual increase in productivity of the businesses being invested in to pay off all debts — whether bonds , certificates of deposit , or retirement dreams of long - term holders of the company ’s stock — is a Ponzi scheme .
It can be a government Ponzi scheme , such as Social Security or Medicare .
It can be a Ponzi scheme by a state or local government , which promises enormous retirement benefits to state employees .
It can also be a no - load mutual stock index fund .
Ponzi schemes all have the same thing in common : future productivity will not repay the investors with sufficient money of constant or increasing purchasing power for the investors to achieve their goals .
The investors have retirement goals which will be impossible to achieve by means of the investment strategies recommended by the experts .
Investors believe the nonsense , and apparently their advisers believe it , too .
Politicians get elected in terms of this nonsense .
But it is nonetheless nonsense .
WEALTH THROUGH THRIFT
To tell American consumers that they can improve the productivity of the economy merely by going out and spending money is Keynesianism .
It is utter nonsense .
The only way to increase the productivity of the economy is through thrift .
The money generated by this thrift must then be invested wisely , in terms of future conditions , so that the company or fund making the investment can reap a profit .
If economy cannot do this through increased productivity , it will eventually find itself incapable of raising additional capital .
Without additional capital , there can be no increase in productivity .
Economists are supposed to know this , but ever since the Great Depression and the publication of Keynes ’s magnum opus , most economists have not believed this .
They believe that we really can spend ourselves into prosperity , either through personal spending or through government spending .
The Keynesian system is opposed to investing during recessions .
I can remember the slogan that was promoted by the government in 1958 : “ you auto buy now . ”
It was preposterous then , and it is preposterous now .
The government today is lending money to Chrysler and General Motors because American consumers are not buying the output of those two companies .
The government understands that it cannot afford to give every citizen enough money to go out and buy a new General Motors or Chrysler car , so it uses tax dollars to offer below - market loans to companies that would otherwise go bankrupt .
This is the government ’s alternative to relying on the general public to go out and spend money in a way approved by politicians .
The fact that professional economists have returned to Keynesianism — in the words of the Bible , like a dog to its vomit — should not surprise anyone .
Professional economists cannot shake their faith in big government .
They can not shake their faith in deficit spending .
They also cannot shake their faith in the power of government to increase productivity merely by spending money on boondoggles .
They believe in government , and in government boondoggles , with the same kind of commitment that theologians in the Middle Ages believed in scholastic theology .
They can not think outside the box .
The box is labeled : “ Spend ! ”
The government is determined to thwart all attempts of individuals to save more money and therefore increase productivity .
It is committed to the idea that the individual is unreliable in his commitment to deficit spending .
There was even a slight uptick in the second quarter of 2008 in household savings .
It rose by a little under 3 % per annum .
This was a reversal of recent years , when most American households did not increase savings at all .
In fact , they actually borrowed a in order to maintain their spending habits .
Politicians and government economists look at this slight uptick in the rate of savings , and they are horrified .
They want the government to intervene immediately , so as to counteract these economically rational decisions of American consumers to reduce their consumption and increase the rate of savings .
No matter how little this increased rate of savings is , Keynesian economists and politicians are determined to offset this rate of savings by increasing government spending .
Where will the government get the money ?
Through taxes , through investors in government bonds , and through debt sold to the Federal Reserve system , which will create the money out of nothing .
Despite the fact that Treasury bill rates actually reached zero this month , government economists and academic economists generally say that the government should run massive deficits in order to spend this money into circulation .
Despite the fact that investors are getting nothing for their money , this is not enough to persuade government economists and politicians to let the economy alone .
They want the government to spend even more .
Supposedly , thrift destroys wealth .
“ What we need is more spending . ”
The government is going to give us more spending .
It is going to undermine investments in the private sector .
It is going to move primary spending away from investing in into increased personal spending .
The result is going to be accelerating price inflation .
While professional economists are wringing their hands in fear over price deflation , the Federal Reserve System has been increasing the monetary base .
The government is waiting for banks to start winning the money to the general public instead of depositing the money with the Federal Reserve System .
With the Federal funds rate target at zero , banks will soon start lending again .
The money supply will increase , prices will increase , and we will be back in the clutches of price inflation by the end of 2009 .
From that point on , price inflation is going to be the major problem in American economic life .
The Keynesians will get their wish : spending without investing .
There will be more money chasing a restricted supply of goods and services .
The supply of goods and services will be restricted precisely because the government has intervened in the credit markets in order to stimulate consumption .
This is why the recession is going to last much longer than normal .
It is going to be an inflationary recession .
It is going to result in what was once called stagflation .
This is what Keynesianism always produces .
It is hostile to thrift ; it is hostile to investing ; and it is favorable to government deficits .
The productivity that is needed to get us out of this recession will be restricted by policies of government spending .
The lemmings will not be convinced to spend more money until they see the prices are rising so fast that if they do not get rid of the money , they will be losers .
That day is coming .
It is not here today .
This is why you can still buy bargains .
It is still a buyer ’s market .
CONCLUSION
Save now .
Buy later .
Buy assets that will rise in price because of increased monetary inflation .

Paula Abdul Fan Found Dead Outside Her Home
Last night a dead body was found in a car just a few houses away from the home of American Idol judge .
The deceased woman was said to be a " big fan " of Paula , according to her parents .
The cause of death is currently being reported by the police as a possible drug overdose / suicide .
Whether the woman killed herself because of some fixation for Abdul is unknown .
Her proximity to Paula 's home is being looked at as more than a mere coincidence .
LAPD reportedly received a call from Ventura County Sheriff 's Department last night , alerting them to the possibility of a body in a car on Abdul 's street .
No word on how they received the tip .
The woman 's identity has not yet been made public and word is that Paula was not home at the time .
We will update this story as more information is released .

I took the suitcase with me to our log cabin in the woods of Maine , and there , one night , began to read letter after letter .
They had come from all over Canton , from out - of - work upholsterers , painters , bricklayers , day laborers , insurance salesmen and , yes , former executives  some of whom , I later learned , my grandfather had known personally .
One , written Dec. 19 , 1933 , begins , “ I hate to write this letter ... it seems too much like begging .
Anyway , here goes .
I will be honest , my husband does n’t know I ’m writing this letter ... .
He is working but not making enough to hardly feed his family .
We are going to do everything in our power to hold on to our house . ”
Three years behind in taxes and out of credit at the grocery store , the writer closed with , “ Even if you do n’t think we ’re worthy of help , I hope you receive a great blessing for your kindness . ”

Another letter came from a 38 - year - old steel worker , out of a job and stricken with tuberculosis , who wrote of his inability to pay the hospital bills for his son , whose skull had been fractured after he was struck by a car .
One man wrote : “ For one like me who for a lifetime has earned a fine living , charity by force of distressed circumstances is an abomination and a headache .
However , your offer carries with it a spirit so far removed from those who offer help for their own glorification , you remove so much of the sting and pain of forced charity that I venture to tell you my story . ”
The writer , once a prominent businessman , was now 65 and destitute , his life insurance policy cashed in and gone , his furniture “ mortgaged , ” his clothes threadbare , his hope of paying the electric and gas bills pinned to the intervention of his children .

The trailer for the highly anticipated superhero movie “ Watchmen ” promises intense on - screen action , larger - than - life characters and scathing social commentary .
But lately the movie has become better known for its courtroom drama , with 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros.
continuing to clash over interests in the film .
Fox is trying to block Warner ’s scheduled March 6 release , claiming that it controls the rights to the movie through a series of deals it made with the producer , Lawrence Gordon .
In a ruling last week , U.S. District Court Judge Gary Allen Feess agreed with Fox , stating that “ Fox owns a copyright interest consisting of , at the very least , the right to distribute the ‘ Watchmen ’ motion picture . “

The judge also encouraged the parties to forgo the trial and instead focus their attention on negotiating a resolution or preparing an appeal .
But the sides remained at loggerheads during a status conference in court Monday .
With a trial set for Jan. 20 and no settlement in sight , the release of the film could be indefinitely delayed .
Based on the award - winning graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons , “ Watchmen ” was produced by Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures ( with Paramount distributing the movie overseas ) .
Over the last 20 years , several Hollywood studios , including Fox , have attempted to develop a cinematic adaptation .
According to the Associated Press , an attorney for Fox said the studio would continue to seek an order delaying the release of the movie directed by Zach Snyder ( “ 300 " ) .

Fox attorney Randy Kender did not return a phone call from The Times .
A
Fox spokesman declined to comment except to issue a statement : “ We are gratified by the recognition of our rights in the judge ’s order , which speaks for itself . ”
The January trial will address the remaining issues in the case .
Fox ’s suit also accuses Warner of interference with contract and breach of contract .
Warner Bros. said in a statement : “ We respectfully but vigorously disagree with the court ’s ruling and are exploring all of our appellate options .
We continue to believe that Fox ’s claims have no merit and that we will ultimately prevail , whether at trial or in the Court of Appeals .
We have no plans to move the release date of the film . ”
After its long Hollywood odyssey and with the esteemed reputation of its source material , “ Watchmen ” has inspired anticipation among comic - book fans that has n’t been seen since Tim Burton ’s “ Batman ” in 1989 .

The fans are not the only ones watching the current corporate duel with bated breath .
The filmmakers and cast are hungry for updates as well .
“ I do n’t know anything more than you do , ” Jackie Earl Haley , who portrays the grim - masked vigilante Rorschach , said last week when asked about “ Watchmen ’s ” future .
“ We ’re all hoping for the best , but I do n’t think anyone really knows what ’s going to happen . ”

The Nobel laureate Harold Pinter , one of the greatest playwrights of his generation , has died .
Pinter , who was suffering from cancer , died yesterday aged 78 .
His second wife , Lady Antonia Fraser , said in a statement to the Guardian : " He was a great man , and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years .
He will never be forgotten . "
Pinter had a number of awards bestowed on him during a long and distinguished career , including the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005 .
In its citation , the Nobel academy said Pinter was " generally seen as the foremost representative of British drama in the second half of the 20th century " and declared him to be an author " who in his plays uncovers the precipice under everyday prattle and forces entry into oppression 's closed rooms " .
Pinter was best know for his plays , including his 1960 breakthrough production The Caretaker , The Dumb Waiter and The Birthday Party .
But he was also a screenwriter , actor and director and in recent years a vociferous campaigner against human rights abuses , including the occupation of Iraq by western armed forces .
He joined other artists such as Blur and Ken Loach in sending a letter to Downing Street opposing the 2003 invasion .
In 2004 he received the Wilfred Owen award for poetry for a collection of work criticising the war in Iraq .
His screenplays for film and television , included the 1981 movie The French Lieutenant 's Woman based on John Fowles ' novel .
He also wrote the screenplay for The Comfort of Strangers ( 1989 ) , adapted from Ian McEwan 's novel , and adapted many of his own stage plays for radio and television .
He was awarded a CBE in 1966 , the German Shakespeare Prize in 1970 , the Austrian State Prize for European Literature in 1973 and the David Cohen British Literature Prize in 1995 .
He was also awarded a number of honorary degrees .
Pinter was born into a Jewish family in the London borough of Hackney .
His grandparents had fled persecution in Poland and Odessa .
He was attracted to acting from an early age and his political activism was evident when in 1948 he refused , as a conscientious objector , to do National Service .
After two spells at drama school he joined he joined Anew McMaster 's Shakespearean Irish touring company in 1951 and wrote his first play , The Room , for Bristol University 's recently established drama department in 1957 .
His agent said a private funeral would be held and a memorial service open to all .

Phoenix resident Guadalupe Garcia has lived in the United States for nearly 35 years , but she still does n't speak English well .
The 65 - year - old seamstress from Mexico spoke only Spanish at home to her children and held jobs where she did n't need much English .
It 's people such as her who fuel perceptions that recent waves of Spanish - speaking immigrants , unlike earlier waves of immigrants , are reluctant to learn English .
But new research turns that assumption on its head .
Joseph Salmons , a researcher at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , has done a study that indicates that many German immigrants who arrived in the 1800s did n't learn English and that their children and grandchildren often did n't learn English , either .
The findings probably apply to other waves of immigrant groups of the late 1800s and early 1900s , Salmons said .
Other research shows that Latino immigrants in more recent decades are learning English quickly and that , by the third generation , speak only English .
" A lot of the stereotypes apply much better to German immigrants of the 19th century than they do to the Mexican immigrants in the Southwest today , " said Salmons , a German professor .
The research is particularly relevant in states like Arizona , where a surge of Spanish speakers has spurred a backlash in the form of ballot measures banning bilingual education and declaring English the state 's official language .
Salmons said his research shows the public need not worry about an erosion of English .
" People should turn down the level of panic , " Salmons said .
" The English issue will resolve itself . "
However , Rep. Russell Pearce , R - Mesa , doubts the validity of Salmons ' study .
" I think it 's a fabrication , " he said .
Pearce was the main backer of Proposition 103 , which voters approved in 2006 to make English the state 's official language for all government business , except emergencies .
He said he believes a surge of Spanish - speaking immigrants threatens to turn Arizona into a bilingual state .
" It 's absolutely bad for America , " he said .
" We are an English - speaking nation , and we need to encourage everyone to speak English . "
German immigrants
Salmons began his study because he was struck by comments he often heard or read from descendants of German immigrants .
" When my great - grandfather came , he did n't expect any help from anybody .
He learned English right away , " was a typical pronouncement , Salmons said .
He pored over U.S. census data , court records , newspaper articles , books and literature dating from the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s related to the 300,000 German immigrants who settled in Wisconsin during that period .
Salmons found that not only had many German immigrants failed to learn English decades after arriving in the U.S. , many of their U.S. - born offspring had n't learned English , either .
" The full range of evidence shows that , into the 20th century , many immigrants , their children and sometimes their grandchildren remained functionally monolingual ( German speakers ) many decades after immigrations into their communities had ceased , " Salmons wrote in his report , published this fall by the American Dialect Society .
The reason , Salmons said , is that the immigrants clustered together in communities where their native language was commonly spoken .
Back then , public schools also taught children in German , pastors conducted services in German and daily newspapers published in German , he said .
Many teachers , principals and church pastors spoke only German , which indicated that not speaking English did little to inhibit social mobility .
Today 's immigrants
A 2006 study by researchers at the University of California - Irvine and Princeton University indicated that Hispanics quickly lose Spanish with each generation and that the grandchildren of immigrants are likely to speak only English .
" Today , you are almost trapped in low - wage , low - skilled jobs until you learn English , " Salmons said .
" In the 19th century , that was emphatically not the case . "
Garcia , the Mexican immigrant who has lived in the U.S. for 35 years , is now taking classes to learn English .
" Learning English is essential , " she said .
" I will be learning until the day I die . "

At Chapter 13 in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , Lavender Brown squeals excitedly :
' Oh , Professor , look !
I think I 've got an unaspected planet !
Oooh , which one 's that , Professor ? '
Professor Trelawney peers down at her chart and says :
' It is Uranus , my dear . '
Unable to resist the opportunity , Ron pipes up :
' Can I have a look at Uranus , too , Lavender ? '
Professor Trelawney is less than amused at Ron 's little comment , and it is this , perhaps , what makes her give them a large amount of homework at the end of class .
The reason for Professor Trelawney 's displeasure is clear only if you understand that Ron 's seemingly innocent request conceals a vulgar schoolboy joke .
As any English - speaking schoolchild knows , ' Uranus ' is pronounced exactly the same as ' your anus ' .
Like some of Rowling 's more sophisticated puns , this exploits the fact that two different expressions have similar pronunciations .
This is difficult to convey in foreign languages because the equivalent expressions are unlikely to have identical pronunciations .
So how do the translators fare ?
Simplified Chinese ( China )
1. “ 是天王星，亲爱的 。 ”
2. “ 可以把天王星也让我看一眼吗，拉文德 ？ ” 1 . " Shì Tiān - wáng - xīng , qīn-aì de . "
2. " Kěyǐ bǎ Tiānwáng - xīng yě ràng wǒ kàn yī- yǎn ma , Lāwéndé ? " 1 . It 's Uranus , dear one .
2 . Can you also give me a look at Uranus , Lavender ?
This translation completely bypasses the pun .
Tiānwáng -xīng ( literally the ' Heavenly King Star ' ) is in no way related to the Chinese word for ' anus ' or any other vulgar or witty expression .
Traditional Chinese ( Taiwan )
1. 『這是天王星，親愛的。』
2. 『那能不能讓我也見識一下那顆天王星呀，文妲？』
1 . " Zhè shì Tiā - wáng - xīng , qīn-aì de . "
2 . " Na néng bù néng ràng wǒ yě jiànshi yī - xià nà - kē Tiān - wáng - xīng yā , Wéndá ? "
1 . This is Uranus , dear one .
2 . Well , can you let me also widen my knowledge of that Uranus a bit , Lavender ?
This translation also bypasses the pun .
The only concession to the English is the rather roundabout way that Ron asks to have a look at Uranus .
While hinting at mischievous intent , it does n't in any way intimate the vulgar suggestion implied by the English .
Japanese
1. 「 冥王星、最後尾の惑星ですわ 」
2. 「 ドンケツの星か ......ラベンダー、僕に君のドンケツ、ちょっと見せてくれる？ 」
1 . " Meiōsei , saikōbi no wakusei desu wa "
2 . " Donketsu no hoshi ka ..... Rabendā , boku ni kimi no donketsu , chotto misete kureru ? "
1 . It 's Pluto , the tail - end planet .
2. Aah , the planet bringing up the rear .
Lavender , can you let me have a look at your rear ?
The Japanese translator has gone out of her way to accommodate the pun .
First , she substitutes ' Pluto ' for ' Uranus ' .
She then has Professor Trelawney describe Pluto as the 最後尾の惑星 saikōbi planet .
Saikōbi literally means ' most back tail ' and is used for items at the very end of a line , etc .
planet .
literally means ' most back tail ' and is used for items at the very end of a line , etc .
This gives
Ron the opportunity to substitute the word ドンケツ , a rather colloquial expression meaning ' the lowest ranking , the last ' .
Since don- ketsu also means ' arse ' , Ron proceeds to ask if he can look at Lavender 's don-ketsu .
Just in case the pun is missed , the Japanese translator draws attention to ketsu , also by itself meaning ' arse ' , by putting emphasis marks ( two dots ) above it .
To drive the point home even further , the next sentence points out that ' Ron 's vulgar wordplay unfortunately reached the ears of Professor Trelawney ' .
While both in - your - face and forced , this translation at least conveys the intent of the original and why Ron 's remark incurred Professor Trelawney 's displeasure .
Vietnamese
1 . That 's the planet Uranus , my dear .
2 . Can you give me a peep at the planet Uranus ?
The Vietnamese also bypasses the pun .
Rather mysteriously , the translator uses the borrowed word sao Uranus rather than the Vietnamese name for the planet , which is .
This is even more surprising given that a reference to Neptune on the page before is correctly translated as .
Of the four translations , only the Japanese makes an attempt to render the pun in the English .
The others quietly pass the matter by , leaving the reader slightly puzzled over Professor Trelawney 's frosty attitude .
Although somewhat marred by being so forced , the Japanese rendition is quite ingenious .
Colliers , January 30 , 1926
The life of the bee will be the life of our race , says Nikola Tesla , world - famed scientist .
A NEW sex order is coming -- with the female as superior .
You will communicate instantly by simple vest - pocket equipment .
Aircraft will travel the skies , unmanned , driven and guided by radio .
Enormous power will be transmitted great distances without wires .
Earthquakes will become more and more frequent .
Temperate zones will turn frigid or torrid .
And some of these awe - inspiring developments , says Tesla , are not so very far off .
A T SIXTY - EIGHT years of age Nikola Tesla sits quietly in his study , reviewing the world that he has helped to change , foreseeing other changes that must come in the onward stride of the human race .
He is a tall , thin , ascetic man who wears somber clothes and looks out at life with steady , deep - set eyes .
In the midst of luxury he lives meagerly , selecting his diet with a precision almost extreme .
He abstains from all beverages save water and milk and has never indulged in tobacco since early manhood .
He is an engineer , an inventor and , above these as well as basic to them , a philosopher .
And , despite his obsession with the practical application of what a gifted mind may learn in books , he has never removed his gaze from the drama of life .
This world , amazed many times during the last throbbing century , will rub its eyes and stand breathless before greater wonders than even the past few generations have seen ; and fifty years from now the world will differ more from the present - day than our world now differs from the world of fifty years ago .
Nikola Tesla came to America in early manhood , and his inventive genius found quick recognition .
When fortune was his through his revolutionary power - transmission machines he established plants , first in New York , then Colorado , later on Long Island , where his innumerable experiments resulted in all manner of important and minor advances in electrical science .
Lord Kelvin said of him ( before he was forty ) that he had contributed more than any other man to the study of electricity .
" From the inception of the wireless system , " he says , " I saw that this new art of applied electricity would be of greater benefit to the human race than any other scientific discovery , for it virtually eliminates distance .
The majority of the ills from which humanity suffers are due to the immense extent of the terrestrial globe and the inability of individuals and nations to come into close contact .
" Wireless will achieve the closer contact through transmission of intelligence , transport of our bodies and materials and conveyance of energy .
" When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain , which in fact it is , all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole .
We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly , irrespective of distance .
Not only this , but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face , despite intervening distances of thousands of miles ; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do his will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone .
A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket .
" We shall be able to witness and hear events -- the inauguration of a President , the playing of a world series game , the havoc of an earthquake or the terror of a battle -- just as though we were present .
" When the wireless transmission of power is made commercial , transport and transmission will be revolutionized .
Already motion pictures have been transmitted by wireless over a short distance .
Later the distance will be illimitable , and by later I mean only a few years hence .
Pictures are transmitted over wires -- they were telegraphed successfully through the point system thirty years ago .
When wireless transmission of power becomes general , these methods will be as crude as is the steam locomotive compared with the electric train .
Woman -- Free and Regal
ALL railroads will be electrified , and if there are enough museums to hold them the steam locomotives will be grotesque antiques for our immediate posterity .
" Perhaps the most valuable application of wireless energy will be the propulsion of flying machines , which will carry no fuel and will be free from any limitations of the present airplanes and dirigibles .
We shall ride from New York to Europe in a few hours .
International boundaries will be largely obliterated and a great step will be made toward the unification and harmonious existence of the various races inhabiting the globe .
Wireless will not only make possible the supply of energy to region , however inaccessible , but it will be effective politically by harmonizing international interests ; it will create understanding instead of differences .
" Modern systems of power transmission will become antiquated .
Compact relay stations one half or one quarter the size of our modern power plants will be the basis of operation -- in the air and under the sea , for water will effect small loss in conveying energy by wireless . "
Mr. Tesla foresees great changes in our daily life .
" Present wireless receiving apparatus , " says he , " will be scrapped for much simpler machines ; static and all forms of interference will be eliminated , so that innumerable transmitters and receivers may be operated without interference .
It is more than probable that the household 's daily newspaper will be printed ' wirelessly ' in the home during the night .
Domestic management -- the problems of heat , light and household mechanics -- will be freed from all labor through beneficent wireless power .
" I foresee the development of the flying machine exceeding that of the automobile , and I expect Mr. Ford to make large contributions toward this progress .
The problem of parking automobiles and furnishing separate roads for commercial and pleasure traffic will be solved .
Belted parking towers will arise in our large cities , and the roads will be multiplied through sheer necessity , or finally rendered unnecessary when civilization exchanges wheels for wings .
The world 's internal reservoirs of heat , indicated by frequent volcanic eruptions , will be tapped for industrial purposes .
In an article I wrote twenty years ago I defined a process for continuously converting to human use part of the heat received from the sun by the atmosphere .
Experts have jumped to the conclusion that I am attempting to realize a perpetual - motion scheme .
But my process has been carefully worked out .
It is rational . "
Mr. Tesla regards the emergence of woman as one of the most profound portents for the future .
" It is clear to any trained observer , " he says , " and even to the sociologically untrained , that a new attitude toward sex discrimination has come over the world through the centuries , receiving an abrupt stimulus just before and after the World War .
" This struggle of the human female toward sex equality will end in a new sex order , with the female as superior .
The modern woman , who anticipates in merely superficial phenomena the advancement of her sex , is but a surface symptom of something deeper and more potent fermenting in the bosom of the race .
" It is not in the shallow physical imitation of men that women will assert first their equality and later their superiority , but in the awakening of the intellect of women .
" Through countless generations , from the very beginning , the social subservience of women resulted naturally in the partial atrophy or at least the hereditary suspension of mental qualities which we now know the female sex to be endowed with no less than men .
The Queen is the Center of Life
" BUT the female mind has demonstrated a capacity for all the mental acquirements and achievements of men , and as generations ensue that capacity will be expanded ; the average woman will be as well educated as the average man , and then better educated , for the dormant faculties of her brain will be stimulated to an activity that will be all the more intense and powerful because of centuries of repose .
Woman will ignore precedent and startle civilization with their progress .
" The acquisition of new fields of endeavor by women , their gradual usurpation of leadership , will dull and finally dissipate feminine sensibilities , will choke the maternal instinct , so that marriage and motherhood may become abhorrent and human civilization draw closer and closer to the perfect civilization of the bee . "
The significance of this lies in the principle dominating the economy of the bee -- the most highly organized and intelligently coordinated system of any form of nonrational animal life -- the all - governing supremacy of the instinct for immortality which makes divinity out of motherhood .
The center of all bee life is the queen .
She dominates the hive , not through hereditary right , for any egg may be hatched into a reigning queen , but because she is the womb of this insect race .
We Can Only Sit and Wonder
THERE are the vast , desexualized armies of workers whose sole aim and happiness in life is hard work .
It is the perfection of communism , of socialized , cooperative life wherein all things , including the young , are the property and concern of all .
Then there are the virgin bees , the princess bees , the females which are selected from the eggs of the queen when they are hatched and preserved in case an unfruitful queen should bring disappointment to the hive .
And there are the male bees , few in number , unclean of habit , tolerated only because they are necessary to mate with the queen .
When the time is ripe for the queen to take her nuptial flight the male bees are drilled and regimented .
The queen passes the drones which guard the gate of the hive , and the male bees follow her in rustling array .
Strongest of all the inhabitants of the hive , more powerful than any of her subjects , the queen launches into the air , spiraling upward and upward , the male bees following .
Some of the pursuers weaken and fail , drop out of the nuptial chase , but the queen wings higher and higher until a point is reached in the far ether where but one of the male bees remains .
By the inflexible law of natural selection he is the strongest , and he mates with the queen .
At the moment of marriage his body splits asunder and he perishes .
The queen returns to the hive , impregnated , carrying with her tens of thousands of eggs -- a future city of bees , and then begins the cycle of reproduction , the concentration of the teeming life of the hive in unceasing work for the birth of a new generation .
Imagination falters at the prospect of human analogy to this mysterious and superbly dedicated civilization of the bee ; but when we consider how the human instinct for race perpetuation dominates life in its normal and exaggerated and perverse manifestations , there is ironic justice in the possibility that this instinct , with the continuing intellectual advance of women , may be finally expressed after the manner of the bee , though it will take centuries to break down the habits and customs of peoples that bar the way to such a simiply and scientifically ordered civilization .
We have seen a beginning of this in the United States .
In Wisconsin the sterilization of confirmed criminals and pre-marriage examination of males is required by law , while the doctrine of eugenics is now boldly preached where a few decades ago its advocacy was a statutory offense .
Old men have dreamed dreams and young men have seen visions from the beginning of time .
We of today can only sit and wonder when a scientist has his say .
As Torch readers know , each month FIRE singles out a particularly reprehensible speech code for our Speech Code of the Month award .
While all twelve Speech Codes of the Month in 2008 flagrantly violated students ’ right to free expression , three were so egregious that they deserve special mention as 2008 ’s Speech Codes of the Year .
University of the Pacific :
The university ’s policy on Harassment , Coercion , and Discrimination prohibits any conduct " that undermines the emotional , physical , or ethical integrity of any community member , " including any expression , " intentional or unintentional , " that " has the effect of demeaning , ridiculing , defaming , stigmatizing , intimidating , slandering or impeding the work or movement of a person or persons or conduct that supports or parodies the oppression of others . "
Examples of explicitly prohibited expression include " insults , " " jokes , " " teasing , " and " derogatory comments . "
As long as this policy is in force , no controversial expression is safe from censorship at the University of the Pacific .

Jackson State University : Jackson
State ’s incomprehensible harassment policy defines harassment as " language to physical acts which degrades , insult , taunt , or challenges another person by any means of communication , verbal , so as to provoke a violent response , communication of threat , defamation of character , use of profanity , verbal assaults , derogatory comments or remarks , sexist remarks , racist remarks or any behavior that places another member of the University community in a state of fear or anxiety . "
This policy not only forbids a great deal of constitutionally protected expression ( including " sexist remarks " and " use of profanity " ) , but the grammar is also so poor that its full scope is impossible to determine , rendering it impermissibly vague as well .

Texas Southern University :
The university ’s Student Code of Conduct prohibits " intentional mental or physical harm , " which it defines as " [ k ] nowingly or recklessly causing or attempting to cause by acts and / or threats , emotional , mental , physical or verbal harm to another person …
This includes intimidation , emotional force , embarrassing , degrading or damaging information , assumptions , implications , remarks , or fear for one ’s safety . "
Like Jackson
State ’s harassment policy , this policy is both overbroad ( in that it bans a lot of protected expression , such as the communication of " embarrassing information " ) and vague ( in that it prohibits things that escape definition , such as causing " emotional harm " or using " emotional force . " )
Since FIRE ’s Speech Code of the Month became a regular feature in June 2005 , twelve universities have fully revised the policies that earned them the dubious distinction .
It is our hope that in 2008 , more universities — including those named here — will make the changes necessary to give their students the freedom they deserve .
Happy holidays , and look for 2009 ’s first Speech Code of the Month in January !
One which this increasingly repressive and authoritarian , yet morally weak , Labour government , has failed to get right .
Balancing these individual and collective rights has always been a key responsibility of government .
Today I 'd like to address one of the most pressing questions we face as a modern society - how we secure our rights and liberties as individuals , at the same time as ensuring the wider protection of all in our society against terrorism , crime and disorder .
Apologies for the length of this blog article fisking of this speech , but she uttered a lot of weasel words which need to be challenged :
Unfortunately these weasel worded soundbites , which touch on several topics about which Spy Blog regularly comments on , are the current Government 's substitute for detailed , practical , cost effective policies :
From now on , all of Home Secretary Jacqui Smith 's policy statements will be analysed with these categories in mind .
We suspect that she will be found wanting in all of them .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , like her Labour party fellow travellers , seems to be spewing Orwellian doublethink and newspeak , where normal sounding English words , have their meanings utterly reversed , without displaying any sense of shame , or pang of conscience , at their perversion .
What is your definition of a " surveillance society " ?
It is probably not the same as Home Secretary Jacqui Smith 's still secret definition .
And in an era of rapid technological change , it is right that we should constantly satisfy ourselves that we have got the balance right .
Labour Ministers and bureaucrats are always self satisfied that they have done nothing wrong , no matter how severe the incompetence or unfairness which their policies create .
Their first principle seems to be to " shoot the messenger " , and to lay off any blame onto some Quango or NDPB or junior official .
.
What they need to do is to satisfy us , the innocent members of the public , that the balance is in our individual favour , not in favour of the vested interests of the State and its secret or commercial lobbyists , nor in favour of real criminals ..
Looking back over the year , we 've seen the question raised in some new - and it's fair to say , peculiar - ways .
In June , the MP for Haltemprice and Howden booked himself a footnote in the history books by resigning from parliament and the Conservative front - bench , only to return to the Commons a month later .
Note how she could not actually bring herself to use the name of David Davis MP - remember this is not a speech given on the floor of the Chamber of the House of Commons , where the convention is to refer to Parliamentary Constituencies rather than the names of actual Members of Parliament , this was a speech to Intellect , the UK trade body which represents most of the Information technology consulting , hardware and software suppliers who have a symbiotic relationship with out of control , multi-billion pound Government IT projects .
David Davis offered to debate all of the issues mentioned further on in this speech during his successful re-election campaign , but the Labour party politicians and propagandists refused to put up an official Labour party candidate against him , whilst plotting to try to con victims of terrorism or crime into standing against him by proxy .
Remember that when Jacqui Smith talks about " public debate " or " engagement " later on in this speech .
And one night in April - less than a mile from here , just off Oxford Street - the artist Banksy left his calling card , with a piece of 30 foot high graffiti that proclaimed ' ONE NATION UNDER CCTV ' .
Eight months later , it 's still there - with a CCTV camera watching over it .
The CCTV cameras were there before the wall art graffiti was painted , and did nothing to prevent or deter this " crime " .
See our photos : Banksy " One Nation Under CCTV " - tourists and beggars
We were a nation under surveillance back in April , and are even more so now in December .
And while it 's probably done wonders for the value of that gable wall , we 're entitled to ask how much this effort , and others like them , have hit the right target .
A nation under CCTV ?
Are we , really , a nation under CCTV ?
Do we , today , live in what critics call a surveillance society ?
I do n't believe so , not for one moment .
But I welcome the debate .
If Jacqui Smith does not believe , " not for one moment " , that we live in " a surveillance society " , then why does she avoid any direct debate with , for example , David Davis MP , or with the NO2ID Campaign or Privacy International or the Open Rights Group or Liberty Human Rights , or ordinary members of the public ?
And while not condoning graffiti per se , I understand the need to keep revisiting these issues in an open and democratic society .
We are - all of us , as citizens , consumers , businesses and government - now presented with a host of new ways to capture , analyse and use data .
And there are clear benefits : * retailers , banks , and insurance companies delivering more personalised and efficient services
There is nothing " efficient " about retailers , banks and insurance companies , except their ability to lose billions of pounds and thousands of their customer 's personal data records on a regular basis .
Only the Government is worse at safeguarding our private personal data and our money .
* nurseries using online webcams to reassure parents that their children are in good hands
Not all parents are re-assured by such snooping !
These systems have weak security , if any , and are Ideal for kidnappers , stalkers and child molesters with administrator access at the nursery school , their IT suppliers or at any of the internet service providers between the school and the parents .
Unlike people actually working at the nursery school , none of the people installing or delivering or administering such child surveillance systems need to have even the fig leaf of a Criminal Records Bureau check .
Some of them will be able to access such images of your children from foreign countries .
Why should one set of parents be able to snoop , in secret , on other people 's children , without explicit prior permission ?
* sat nav technology making people 's everyday lives easier , whether it 's working out the route of a journey or accessing information from your mobile phone
Most mobile phones in the UK do not yet have " sat nav " technology .
The combination of a GPS sat nav chip and a mobile phone is what makes up most of a mobile " electronic tag " , used so ineffectively by the Home Office and its sub -contractors to tag criminals on bail , and , controversially , instead of part of a prison sentence , even for violent or dangerous criminals .
* strengthening the frontline against crime , with handheld computers and mobile fingerprint devices meaning the police can spend more time out of the station
None of these examples have anything to with CCTV mass surveillance systems i.e. " A nation under CCTV ? "
In the space of a century , we have moved from setting up the first fingerprint branch in Scotland Yard in 1901 to the regular use of DNA today to extend and backdate the ability to investigate crime .
To put it another way , we have seen elementary policing progress from the deductions of Sherlock Holmes and his dear sidekick right through to the forensic use of the discoveries of Francis Crick and Dr Watson 's namesake .
These developments have brought opportunities and challenges in their wake .
DNA profiling was developed by Professor Alec Jeffreys , who has expressed serious concerns about the way in which his techniques have been applied by the UK Government and Police , especially the retention of innocent people 's DNA samples and profiles .
In some cases , like with DNA or the use of covert surveillance powers , it means rethinking our regulations and ensuring high standards of safeguards .
Such " standards of safeguards " e.g. for DNA retention of innocent people 's data or for the planting of electronic bugging devices intrusively ( i.e. by breaking into people 's home or vehicles ) were routinely ignored in practice , then declared illegal by the European Court of Human Rights .
This Labour Government has rubber stamped Acts of Parliament to make such practices legal , retrospectively , without any of their politicians having the honour to take the blame for the illegal actions of their subordinates , and resign .
In other cases , as with the rapid growth of online communications , new technology demands that we find new ways to maintain the protections we currently rely on for the public good .
Early in the new year , we will consult on how to best continue tracking information relating to serious and organised crime and terrorism in this new environment .
Will the Government again deliberately delay the the latest Annual Report of the Interception Commissioner , and of the Intelligence Services Commissioner , which should , according the the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 , be " laid before Parliament " before the end of this calendar year i.e. this Wednesday or Thursday , as they have in the past ?
Will this be a crude attempt to conceal the latest , albeit inadequately detailed figures about the extent of such Communications Data use by the state ?
As today 's verdict in the trial for the murder of Rhys Jones has shown , communications data can form an important part of prosecution evidence .
And indeed this information - on the fact that communication has taken place , but not on its content - plays a role in some 95 % of all really serious criminal cases , such as murder , drugs trafficking , and child sex abuse .
If this capability is n't to be lost due to the growth of online communications , it 's clear that we need to respond and adapt to technological change .
As always , of course , new technology presents opportunity gaps for criminals as well - a set of early adopters if ever there was one , always on the look - out for new ways to exploit weaknesses .
Identity fraudsters , child pornographers , and international terrorists - all have made extensive use of the internet .
And , our response - working with industry on the responsible use of social networking sites , for example , or to develop filtering software - has had to adapt constantly to stay ahead of the game .
All of the sorts of people existed before the internet was invented , and the Government 's efforts at internet censorship have been technologically and administratively inept .
The same " Great Firewall of Britain " infrastructure used to censor such websites or other internet traffic can also be used against innocent political opponents as well - no dictorship or repressive regime ever admits to political censorship of the media or of the internet - they always pretend that it is for the purposes of " national security or crime " etc .
One thing is clear .
The eager take - up of innovation in the consumer sector does not mean that government itself can proceed without caution , or without robust safeguards in place .
Common sense guidelines
The public expect us to make use of technology to protect them - and that is a clear priority for me .
We would be failing in our duty to do otherwise .
When we talk about fingerprints ... CCTV cameras ... DNA swabs ... or scanning machines at airports ... I think that people instinctively understand that these technologies , used properly , are vital tools against crime , terrorism and illegal immigration .
But I also recognise the absolute necessity of getting the balance on privacy right .
And so today I want to set out some basic tests , and set out the direction of travel for some of our key policies .
Are there appropriate safeguards in place - to keep data secure , for example , and to provide independent oversight where appropriate - as we have progressively built into how the National Identity Scheme operates ?
Are we being as transparent as possible
No !
Jacqui Smith has lapsed into Orwellian newspeak again here " transparency " seems to mean , in practice , secrecy and costly delays and legal appeals at public expense , to suppress the publication of information which might even help to strengthen the alleged aims of the Government 's own policies .
Why does the Home Office refuse to make public even the barest details about the times and locations where the supposedly very temporary and extraordinary Terrorism Act 2000 section 44 stop and search without reasonable suspicionpowers are currently in force ?
How can these powers be a deterrent , if they are kept so secret ?
See HO Terrorism Act 2000 s44 Authorisations
Why is it nearly 4 years since our Freedom of Information
Act request for the early , and now very out of date , Gateway Reviews of the Home Office 's Identity Cards Programme ?
See OGC Gateway Reviews of the Identity Cards Programme
- and as with ID cards , how do we provide individual citizens with the right level of choice and control ?
What does she mean " as with ID Cards " ?
The Government , even after all these years , have not dared to publish any detailed procedures about " citizen 's choice and control " over the National Identity Scheme !
The Government have stated many times that they intend there to be no effective choice i.e. that the registration scheme is to be compulsory .
There are no published control procedures or effective methods for correcting the Government 's inevitable errors and cockups .
All the risk and blame is shifted onto the individual citizens , and not onto Ministers or their sub- contractors , even if they are the ones who make the errors .
That is not the " right level of choice and control " for individual citizens , neither for the National Identity Scheme nor for any of the other Surveillance State Databases which this Government has already or is planning to inflict on us .
Where surveillance powers are used , are they kept in proportion to the damage and the threat they are seeking to prevent ?
No they are not , especially not by Local Councils , nor by the Metropolitan Police Service acting in its Counter Terrorism role .
And perhaps the toughest question of all - does it stand up to the test of common sense ?
Safeguards , openness , proportionality and common sense .
For the public to have confidence that we will protect them and protect their rights , it is our responsibility as a government to ensure that these standards apply even as technology evolves .
The Government has been utterly , criminally , hopeless at using existing , available off the shelf , tried and tested technology e.g. encryption , to protect our data from espionage , theft or accidental loss , on a massive scale .
They have also ignored the fundamental common sense principle of Data Minimisation i.e. not collecting far more information than strictly needed for the task at hand .e.g. if you need to ascertain that someone is an adult or a child , you do not need to ask for , record , store and transfer on multiple times , their exact date of birth details - you only need to know whether they are older than 18 or not .
Both HMRC and the Ministry of Defence and HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office and the National Health Service etc. all claim to treat data security and privacy " verty seriously " and give it the " utmost importance " and have the " highest standards " .
All of these have been shown to be spectacular failures in the past couple of years or so. , so why should we believe that the centralised national biometric database and tracking system the National Identity Scheme , be any different ?
Other countries have shown that it is possible to have a national identity card , even one with biometrics , which does not rely on a vulnerable , oppressive centralised databases , and which , unlike the UK scheme , can actually be used to help verify your internet or mobile phone transactions through the use of digital certificates .
RIPA consultation
Ten days ago , on a trip to Tower Hamlets , I saw how an entire neighbourhood had had their daily lives made a misery for months by the behaviour of people in one particular flat - until the local council and the police got a premises closure order and boarded it up .
That order was only made possible because covert CCTV had helped capture the evidence of anti-social behaviour and crime .
Such a narrow , targeted use of CCTV surveillance may be justifiable , but those examples do not make the case for the mass surveillance via CCTV which millions of us innocent people suffer from every day .
Was this " premises closure order " really only obtained entirely through the use of CCTV surveillance evidence , and without any complaints or witness statements by the neighbours ?
There are literally hundreds of cases like this , where the police and local authorities access investigatory powers like covert surveillance and communications data under RIPA - the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act - and use these powers fairly and squarely to help law - abiding people to hit back against the yobs and bring criminals to book .
But even as we recognise the usefulness of RIPA , we have to be sure that it is being used properly .
Even with the clear safeguards that RIPA requires for the use of communications data and covert surveillance , I am concerned at the level of misunderstanding there is about what these powers are , who has access to them , and what they can be used for .
Let 's be clear .
RIPA is not anti-terror legislation , as is sometimes suggested .
RIPA limits the use of investigatory powers , and makes sure they are used properly and proportionately .
The legislation provides for oversight by independent commissioners and routes for individuals to complain if they feel the use of these powers has been unjustified .
While most of the investigations local authorities carry out are important - like protecting the public from dodgy traders , trapping fly tippers who dump tonnes of rubbish on an industrial scale across the countryside , or tackling the misery caused by noisy and disruptive neighbours - there are clearly cases where these powers should not be used .
I do n't want to see them being used to target people for putting their bins out on the wrong day , for dog fouling offences , or to check whether paper boys are carrying sacks that are too heavy .
Local council requests amount to a tiny proportion of the overall numbers - but nonetheless , it 's essential to make sure we 've got the balance right .
And it 's these tales of ' dustbin Stasi ' and examples of excessive intrusion that give the responsible and respectable use of the powers a bad name .
Early next year , we will consult on a number of proposed changes to RIPA - and we will look at : • revisions to the Codes of Practice that come under the Act ;
• which public authorities can use RIPA powers ; and
• raising the bar for how those powers are authorised , and who authorises their use .
One question I will be asking of local authorities is whether the powers are authorised at a high enough level .
Would it reinforce public confidence , and avoid frivolous use of the powers , if they could only be done with the consent of a senior executive , and subject to a form of oversight from elected councillors ?
Local Authorities and other Quangos , or NDPBs should lose their ability to self authorise Intrusive or Directed Surveillance under RIPA entirely .
Only the Police and Intelligence Agencies should have these powers .
Local Authorities only use these powers on relatively few occasions .
When an investigation has reached such a stage , as to involve serious organised crime , then there should be a joint investigation with the Police or with the Serious Organised Crime Agency , and they should handle all the RIPA authorisations and audit trails and management of confidential human or technical resources etc. , not the inexperienced Local Authority staff .
I am determined to maintain robust powers to tackle crime and disorder .
But to allay public fears of excessive intrusion , and to keep people 's trust and confidence in the wider necessity of these powers to tackle disorder , crime and terrorism , I am equally clear that we have to measure these efforts against our standards for safeguards , openness , proportionality and common sense .
DNA
The same principles apply to DNA evidence .
Having looked at this area particularly closely over the past year , I 've found there are few areas where the balance between rights and protections comes into such stark relief as on DNA .
The recent European Court judgement in the S and Marper case has put the issue back in the spotlight .
We wonder if Jacqui Smith and her senior civil servants and political apparatchiki have actually bothered to read the damning unanimous judgment by the 17 judges of the European Court of Human Rights .
They highlighted lots of areas of policy where this Labour Government is wrong and is acting illegally , with regard to both DNA cellular tissue samples , DNA profiles and also Fingerprints .
See ECHR judgment on the Marper case - rules that UK Government and Police indefinite retention of innocent people 's tissue samples , DNA profiles and fingerprints is illegal
Many of you will have seen the response of victims ' families to the recent ruling - notably the family of Sally Ann Bowman , whose killer was convicted as a result of DNA taken after he was arrested following a pub brawl and subsequently acquitted .
I have real sympathy for all those with concerns that any move could undermine a system that helped trap Sally Ann 's killer .
And I want to reassure Sally Ann 's father that I will not let that happen .
In this and other cases , we 've seen convictions for serious crimes of culprits who had had their DNA taken and retained for a previous crime where they were arrested , but not convicted .
In May 2002 , Kensley Larrier was arrested for the possession of an offensive weapon .
His DNA was taken and loaded to the DNA database , although the proceedings were then discontinued .
Two years later , DNA from a rape investigation was speculatively searched against the database and matched his sample .
This was the only evidence in the case , and when found guilty Larrier received a 5 year custodial sentence and was entered on the sex offenders register for life .
These cases and others tell me that the DNA database is crucial to public protection .
It not only helps to lead to the guilty .
It helps to prove innocence and to rule people out as suspects .
The Home Office has claimed , purely as a statistical guesstimate , that there are over 100 such cases , but has refused to provide details of more than a tiny handful of them .
That argument was made to the ECHR and , rightly rejected by them , as being disproportionate .
Keeping innocent people 's DNA data on a database does not help to " prove innocence " or to " rule people out as suspects " , that is what the direct comparison of the DNA of a suspect against the DNA samples from the crime scene does .
Once it has been shown that there is no match , that data should be destroyed .
There is more we can do to strengthen the dividing line between guilt and innocence .
For those who have committed a serious offence , our retention policies need to be as tough as possible .
Only for people actually convicted of serious offences , not simply those falsely accused , or arrested or even charged with such offences ..
But for others , including children , I am convinced that we need to be more flexible in our approach .
The DNA of children under 10 - the age of criminal responsibility - should no longer be held on the database .
There are around 70 such cases , and we will take immediate steps to take them off .
It will be interesting to see just how long " immediate " actually takes in practice .
For those under the age of 18 , I think we need to strike the right balance between protecting the public and being fair to the individual .
There 's a big difference between a 12 year old having their DNA taken for a minor misdemeanour and a 17 year old convicted of a violent offence , and next year I will set out in a White Paper on Forensics how we ensure that that difference is captured in the arrangements for DNA retention .
Why were these issues and procedures not debated and codified at the start of the National DNA Database ?
We will consult on bringing greater flexibility and fairness into the system by stepping down some individuals over time - a differentiated approach , possibly based on age , or on risk , or on the nature of the offences involved .
That may mean letting the 12 year old I mentioned come off the database once they reach adulthood .
And it could mean limiting how long the profiles of those who have been arrested but not convicted of an offence could be retained .
We are also re-examining retention arrangements for samples .
Physical samples of hair and saliva swabs that represent people 's actual DNA are much more sensitive than the DNA profile that is kept on the database - which only uses a small part of non-coding DNA .
This was a key point flagged up when we set up the Ethics Group under the National DNA Database Strategy Board , and we will pursue improvements to the safeguards around the handling of samples .
The ECHR judgment suggests that you should destroy those samples of innocent people , as they contain even more sensitive familial information , including medical data , than mere DNA profiles do .
These changes will see some people coming off the system .
But as I said , we need to strengthen the dividing lines between innocence and guilt - and so I want to do more to ensure we get the right people onto the system as well .
The supposed error correction mechanism is currently a deliberate bureaucratic obstacle course , far beyond the resources of most ordinary people .
This must be immediatel

Still running from one thing to another today , so only the briefest coverage here for now , on two very important points ( and even victories ! ) today ...
Obama Fights Back Against the GOP's ACORN " Voter Fraud " Fraud !
He 's finally stepped up and pushed back today , as his general counsel held a press conference call , to announce a 7 - page letter to AG Mukasey calling for the special counsel looking into the U.S. Attorney Purge ( of which the phony ACORN " Voter Fraud " Fraud was at the heart , btw , as discussed in my piece last night ) and the use of federal law enforcement apparatus to create " an unholy alliance of law enforcement and the ugliest form of partisan politics , " as Obama counsel Bob Bauer described it today during the call .
See TPMMucks 's coverage here ...
The BRAD BLOG's " GOP ACORN ' Voter Fraud ' Lie " special coverage page has much more here : BradBlog.com/ACORN ...
Good to see the Dems finally standing up for themselves and the voters .
A little .
Now if Obama would just publicly pledge to not concede the election until every vote is counted , counted accurately , and all election challenges resolved , we'd be in business .
The pledge is right here , Mr. Obama ( and Mr. McCain , you 're welcome to sign it to if you actually give a damn about the voters ! ) .
Oh ... and it would n't hurt to demand there be enough paper ballots for every voter this year , including in PA where the Dem SoS there recently said paper ballots only need to be given out if every machine in a precinct breaks down .
Are you kidding ?
Stand up for the voters , Mr. Obama !
Today 's events prove you know how , so please do it !
OH 's SoS Jennifer Brunner Wins One for the Voters in the Buckeye State !
She fought it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court , and won !
Another Dem has pushed back , for a change , against anti-voter GOP bullying !
In this case , they were trying to force a last minute second cross-check against state and federal databases for hundreds of thousands of voters , despite the state already having done that .
As many as 200,000 voters could have been knocked off the rolls at the last minute , or forced to vote provisionally ( such ballots are frequently thrown out entirely ) .
Ironically enough , under the restrictions the GOP was calling for , even " Joe the Plumber " would have been knocked off the rolls .
That same " exact match " standard , however , is still being used in Florida ( as also discussed last night ) and many other states , where Democrats ought to be standing up and raising holy hell .
As far as I know , they still are n't .
Brunner 's statement , released after the victory today , follows in full below ...
For Immediate Release US SUPREME COURT BACKS BRUNNER ;
PROTECTS OHIO VOTERS Oct. 17 , 2008 For Immediate Release COLUMBUS , Ohio ---
The United States Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner was correct in protecting an estimated 200,000 Ohioans from being disenfranchised in this historic election .
Because of the Ohio Republican Party lawsuit , eligible Ohio voters could have been forced to use provisional ballots if a lower court 's divided decision stands .
Provisional ballots are not counted until 10 days after Election Day and are subject to partisan wrangling and legal fights .
" Our nation 's highest court has protected the voting rights of all Ohioans , allowing our bipartisan elections officials to continue preparing for a successful November election .
We filed this appeal to protect all Ohio voters from illegal challenges and barriers that unfairly silence the votes of some to the advantage of others , " Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner said .
As Secretary Brunner noted on Thursday , she appealed a lower court ruling to the US Supreme Court because no eligible Ohio voter should be forced to use a provisional ballot , which is subject to partisan attacks and legal wrangling after Election Day .
Ohioans who have followed the law and simply want to exercise their right to vote should not be penalized because of federal government red tape , database matching errors and computer glitches , " according to the Secretary .
" Now that the nation 's highest court has ruled in favor of Ohio voters , I encourage everyone to support the bipartisan system of elections administration in our state .
I ask all involved to stop the legal maneuvers that unnecessarily shake public confidence .
We will continue to work with our local election officials to successfully prepare for an unprecedented turnout and a fair election process , " Secretary Brunner commented .

Similarly , in September 2000 then - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak , smarting from the failed Camp David negotiations and behind Sharon in the polls , determined that a disproportionate show of force , including deploying Apache helicopters to fire on residential areas , would squelch the fledgling second Palestinian intifada .
Known as Israel ’s most decorated soldier , Barak ’s ego far outstretches his diminutive stature , and his ambitions were similarly oversized .
He believed that he could force concessions on the late Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat at the negotiating table and ensure his victory in the upcoming election .
Instead , the intifada increased in intensity and Barak and the Labor Party were left to wander the wilderness of Israeli politics .
Now hoping to return to political relevance , Barak has masterminded a massive assault on Gaza that builds upon a crippling 18 - month - long siege and is designed to dramatically weaken Hamas and reassert Israel ’s “ deterrence factor ” in the region . [ 2 ]
His counterpart in this effort is Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , who has political ambitions of her own , namely to be elected prime minister in the upcoming Israeli elections .
Like Condoleezza Rice , her American counterpart and friend , Livni likes to claim that Hamas has prevented the achievement of Palestinian rights , while at the same time pursuing and implementing policies which are designed to ensure precisely that result .
Like a number of her predecessors , Livni believes that a high Palestinian body count translates into victory at the Israeli polls .
For over a year Israeli politicians and generals have been threatening a massive bombing strike against Iran in attempt to reverse its nuclear program .
They have also been saber rattling toward Hizballah in Lebanon , stating that should the militia attack Israel in response to the assassination of its military commander Imad Mughniyah ( who was killed by a car bomb in Damascus in February ) , it would unleash “ immense damage and destruction ” across the country similar to its bombing of the Dahiya suburb of Beirut and infrastructure all over the country during the July 2006 War . [ 3 ]
After all of the ominous threats in the international press , overt “ military exercises ” and an actual strike on a Syrian “ nuclear installation , ” Israel chose a much easier and softer target in Gaza — a densely packed but well mapped territory thoroughly infiltrated by informers and collaborators with no air force or anti-aircraft defenses and limited offensive weaponry that can be attacked around the clock by air with impunity .
Yet , the US and Israel would be unable to achieve their goals in the region without the complicity of corrupt and feckless Arab leaders , of which there is no dearth .
The shocking images from Gaza the past 48 hours would be enough to spur action from most quarters , except apparently from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
Since Hamas ’ election victory in 2006 , Abbas has never missed an opportunity to insult his own people in Gaza .
Last year after Hamas breached the Rafah border wall and Gazans poured into neighboring Egyptian towns for supplies and a break from Israel ’s siege , he referred to it as a “ Palestinian occupation ” of Sinai .
As Israel tightened its siege of the Strip , Abbas has either refused to meet with his counterparts from Hamas or has constantly delayed and undermined negotiations by his representatives .
When boats from the Free Gaza Movement attempted to breach the Israeli blockade , he referred to it is a “ ridiculous game . ”
Now that Israel is pounding Gaza , Abbas has not cut short his travels abroad and predictably has blamed Hamas for the violence . [ 4 ]
Meanwhile , unnamed sources close to Abbas have been leaking to The Jerusalem Post that if the Hamas government in Gaza falls , PA forces could step into the breach . [ 5 ]
These are the same forces which the Post revealed earlier this month were “ taught over and over again ” that they were not being trained to “ learn to fight against the Israeli occupation . ”
Rather , according to US Lieutenant General Keith Dayton , who is overseeing the training of the new PA security forces , it was to focus on “ the lawless elements within Palestinian society ” ( i.e. , Hamas ) . [ 6 ]
This revelation is hardly surprising and confirms reports over the past year in the US , Israeli , and Arab press of complicity between PA forces with Israel , the US , and the governments of Egypt , Jordan , the United Arab Emirates , and Saudi Arabia to topple the Hamas government and destroy its militia .
It is also consistent with the actions of these forces in the PA - ruled West Bank , where Hamas members have been rounded up and arrested with frequent accusations of torture and at least one reported death in custody .
Abbas ’s decisions , like those of Bush , Livni , and Barak , are also driven by a political calendar .
His term as President of the Palestinian Authority expires on 9 January 2009 .
Hamas representatives have made it clear that they will not recognize Abbas ’s legitimacy after that date .
Since Hamas seized control of Gaza in June 2007 from forces loyal to Abbas ’s Fatah party , the PA President and his “ emergency government , ” led by appointed Prime Minister Salam Fayyad , have systematically been rewriting Palestinian laws through presidential decrees . [ 7 ]
In an absurd attempt to validate the extension of his rule beyond next month , the Palestine Liberation Organization , the remnants of which exist largely on paper and in decrepit offices scattered around the world and populated by hacks and sycophants loyal to Abbas , recently declared him “ President of the state of Palestine , ” a title formerly held by Arafat . [ 8 ]
Yet , Abbas has clearly not stopped to consider exactly what the “ state of Palestine ” will look like should it require Israeli force to overthrow Hamas and impose a Fatah government in Gaza and ensure its rule in the West Bank .
Or perhaps he already has , and seeks to emulate his allies and patrons in Egypt , Jordan and the Gulf states .
Egypt has not only been complicit in the siege of Gaza , it has benefited from the economic distress and shortages of the imprisoned and impoverished 1.5 million Palestinians in the territory .
Egyptian goods , typically of poor quality , are smuggled into Gaza and sold at inflated prices through an extensive tunnel network situated near the southern city of Rafah .
The tunnel trade is well documented and clearly exists with the approval of the highest Egyptian government and military authorities , who benefit financially from its existence while they threaten , ridicule and blame the Palestinians in Gaza for their plight .
At the same time , Egypt actively colludes with Israel , the US and the PA to ensure that the situation in Gaza does not and will not improve .
Meanwhile , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak cynically uses the issue of Palestine and the siege of Gaza to distract his people from his incompetent rule and disastrous economic policies .
While Gaza has teetered on the brink of societal collapse and a full - blown humanitarian catastrophe for more than 18 months , it was revealed last week that Jordan and Saudi Arabia had showered lavish gifts on Secretary of State Rice . [ 9 ]
Coming soon after Iraqi journalist Muntadar al - Zeidi threw his shoes at Bush , becoming an instant hero , this stark disparity of responses to American political leaders was further evidence that while US policies may not be popular on the proverbial “ Arab street , ” there will always be Arab rulers willing to lick the boots of successive US administrations that help sustain their unpopular regimes .
In the wake of Saturday ’s bombing of Gaza , the Arab League led by Qatar announced an emergency session would convene … at the end of the week !
Qatar , which has emerged as a power broker in the region after resolving fighting in Lebanon between the government and opposition parties in May , clearly does not believe that more than 300 dead and at least 1,400 wounded requires immediate action .
Or perhaps they recognize what everyone else does : that the Arab League is an empty vessel whose emergency meetings and pronouncements are utterly worthless .
This is the company that Abbas keeps and this will be the future of Palestine unless Palestinians take steps to reclaim their national movement and adopt a leadership worthy of their cause and their sacrifices .
Nor has Hamas offered a viable alternative for most Palestinians and they are not blameless in this murderous assault .
Their rule of Gaza bears all the hallmarks of their Fatah predecessors : long on rhetoric and short on achievement .
Moreover , Hamas has behaved precisely as Fatah did in Gaza during the Oslo period and as it currently does in the West Bank , including arresting and torturing political opponents .
Indeed , Hamas has been saved from its own myopia by the ruthlessness of those aligned against it , as the siege has provided the movement with a convenient excuse for its shortcomings .
In an interview with Al Jazeera on Saturday , Hamas ’ exiled leader Khaled Meshaal called for a “ third intifada . ”
As has been demonstrated repeatedly in Palestinian history an intifada without a unified leadership or a strategy is doomed to fail with dire consequences for the future .
Merely calling for an intifada is not the same as planning and preparing for one .
If Hamas is to be a viable alternative to Abbas , it must decide if it will continue to adopt the policies and rhetoric of past Palestinian leaders where every failure is an achievement and every disastrous defeat a victory .
Otherwise , they have similarly sacrificed their people on the rocks and shoals of tired slogans and empty promises .
Caught between this collection of madmen , criminals and fools are the people of Gaza , who have suffered for far too long and have paid an unbelievable price for simply being Palestinian .
After more then 30 months of sanctions and siege , many have become desperately poor , living a daily reality of constant terror and deprivation that few can imagine .
Yet , in the face of overwhelming cruelty and a conspiracy of silence and indifference they persevere .
That they must do so is an indictment of us all .

Over the last two weeks I ’ve been overwhelmed in a lot of ways .
With the traveling and ...
China 's currency is not freely convertible but its use is spreading China has said it is to allow some trade with its neighbours to be settled with its currency , the yuan .
The pilot scheme was announced in a package of measures designed to help exporters hit by the global downturn .
It means if the two parties to a trade have yuan available , they need not enter world exchange markets to pay .
Most of China 's foreign trade is settled in US dollars or the euro , leaving exporters vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations .
The yuan is not yet a freely convertible currency .
Officials did not say when the trial scheme would start .
When it does , the yuan could be used to settle trade between parts of eastern China ( Guangdong and the Yangtze River delta ) and the territories of Hong Kong and Macau , and between south - west China ( Guangxi and Yunnan ) and the Asean group of countries ( Brunei , Burma , Cambodia , Indonesia , Laos , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam ) .
Spreading yuan Analysts told Chinese media that the yuan was already being used in some South East Asian countries and that China was happy to see such use extended .
They also agreed that the measure was intended to help companies cope with the global financial meltdown , even though buying and selling the currency requires the presentation of legitimate trade documents to banks .
The latest measure follows Beijing 's announcement earlier this month of a 30 - point directive in which it vowed to " support the development of yuan business in Hong Kong " and expand the use of the currency to settle trade with neighbouring countries .
Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan was quoted by the South China Morning Post as saying : " The US dollar is unlikely to be stable next year and later .
" And the likelihood of the United States issuing more money in the near future adds to the depreciation risk in US - dollar - denominated assets and trade settlements . "
He also reportedly said that Guangxi , a province in southern China , had already been settling trade with Vietnam in yuan for some time .
Spurs to spend A document released after a meeting of China 's State Council on Wednesday announced more measures to stimulate domestic consumption .
These include subsidies to rural households for the purchase of household appliances and other goods , and the setting up of new stores and distribution centres in rural areas .
The document called for the renovation of urban food markets , the provision of more variety of goods on sale , the setting up of more second - hand markets , incentives for distribution companies to merge and consolidate , and support of small and medium - sized enterprises .
The state news agency Xinhua said the government intended to raise export tax rebates for high - technology products , to encourage foreign investment , extend customs and inspections services , lower inspection fee for exports and strengthen trade relations in emerging markets .
Analysts said the ideas , though vague , indicated growing concern among China 's policy makers about the domestic impact of the current global financial turmoil .
Powered by exports , China 's economy has grown by double digits in recent years .
In November , official figures showed a 2.2 percent drop in exports , the first decline in more than seven years .

Today Israel dropped bombs and leaflets on Gaza , pounding suspected rocket sites and tunnels used by Hamas militants and warning of a wider offensive despite frantic diplomacy to end the bloodshed .
It is clear this conflict is nowhere near to the end ( Full )
Rejecting Friday 's UN Security Council resolution that called for an immediate and durable cease - fire , Israel and Hamas continued to fight .

In the Zaytun neighborhood of Gaza City , ICRC workers found four small children next to their dead mothers in one of the houses .
They were too weak to stand up on their own .
One man was also found alive , too weak to stand up .
ICRC stated " The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded . " ( Full )

On Thursday a aidworker was killed after a UN relief agency convoy came under fire from Israeli forces .
The attack took place as the lorries travelled to the Erez border crossing to pick up supplies .
The incident happened during an Israel approved three hour seize fire aimed at allowing humanitarian aid to move into Gaza .
This eventually caused UNRWA , the main UN agency providing aid to the Palestinians , to suspend all food aid .

Similar incidents were singled out by Navi Pillay , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights .
She called for independent investigations into possible war crimes committed by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip .
" I am concerned with violations of international law .
Incidents such as this must be investigated because they display elements of what could constitute war crimes , " Pillay told the press .

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert opened his weekly Cabinet meeting on Sunday with sharp words for Jewish settlers who opened fire on Palestinians last week , saying their actions constituted a " pogrom . "
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert spoke about the " pogrom " during his weekly Cabinet Meeting .
" We are the children of a people whose historic ethos is built on the memory of pogroms , " Olmert said .
" The sight of Jews firing at innocent Palestinians has no other name than pogrom .
Even when Jews do this , it is a pogrom .
" As a Jew , I am ashamed that Jews could do such a thing . "
He was addressing the riots last week in which Jewish settlers -- angry over the forced evacuation of a contested house in Hebron -- attacked Palestinians , setting fire to their houses .
In a statement released by his office , Olmert told the Cabinet that he chose the term " pogrom " -- a Yiddish word meaning an organized massacre , usually referring to such attacks against Jews -- " after much thought . "
" I formulate these words with the greatest care that I can , " the prime minister said .
Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said two settlers -- who were captured on video firing near a group of Palestinians -- have turned themselves in and will be remanded before a judge on Sunday .
Two Palestinians moderately wounded in the shooting are still hospitalized , he said .
Israeli police and military on Thursday forcibly removed a group of settlers from a disputed home in the West Bank city of Hebron .
The settlers inside the residence had ignored court orders to vacate the house , which a Palestinian man claims belongs to him .
The situation had led to recent clashes between Jewish settlers and Palestinian residents in Hebron , one of the most contested cities in the West Bank , with a Palestinian section and a Jewish settler enclave .
It is home to about 160,000 Palestinians and 500 Israelis .

Three million jobs could be lost in a year if America 's so called ' Big Three ' carmakers - General Motors , Ford and Chrysler - are allowed to collapse , an expert predicts .
David Cole , head of the Centre for Automotive Research ( CAR ) , an influential Detroit think - tank , said that so many US businesses depended on the Big Three for survival that allowing even one of the carmakers to fail would lead to tens of thousands of jobs losses nationwide .
' The immediate shock to the economy would be felt well beyond the Detroit companies , negatively impacting the US operations of international manufacturers and suppliers as well .
Nearly three million jobs would be lost in the first year if there was a 100 per cent reduction in Big Three US operations , ' Cole said .
His grim prediction came as US politicians continue to debate whether the government should extend financial relief to the carmakers by allowing them access to a portion of the $ 700 bn ( £ 382 bn ) bail out offered to the nation 's banks .
A bill to rescue GM , Chrysler and Ford with $ 25bn in emergency loans will be taken up in the Senate tomorrow , but its passage is far from guaranteed as many Republican senators object to government intervention in industry .
Even if it is passed , many experts fear that tens of thousands of job losses can not be avoided .
Patrick Anderson , chief executive of the Anderson Economic Group , a US consultancy , believes that at least 35,000 jobs will be lost if the government intervenes to save the industry .
' The necessary restructuring to take capacity out of the market would lead to between 30,000 and 40,000 job losses nationwide , ' he said .
He said the failure of one carmaker would lead to between 60,000 and 80,000 job losses nationwide .
Cole said : ' The likelihood of one or two of the Big Three ending operations is very real . '
Job losses among suppliers of car parts and car sales companies , as well as those on the production lines , would be compounded by a massive drop in taxes and consumer spending power that would further cripple the already hobbled American economy .
' Our model estimates that a complete shutdown of Detroit three US production would have a major impact on the US economy in terms of lost wages , reductions in social security receipts , personal income taxes paid , and an increase in transfer payments , ' said Sean McAlinden , CAR 's chief economist .
' The government stands to lose $ 60bn in the first year alone , and the three - year total is well over $ 156bn . '
• This article was amended on Wednesday November 19 2008 .
We meant to say 80,000 job losses , not 80,0000 job losses , in the seventh paragraph .
This has been corrected .
World leaders have called for more action to tackle piracy China will send two navy destroyers and a supply vessel to the Gulf of Aden to protect merchant ships from attacks by Somali pirates , state media have said .
Chinese defence ministry spokesman Hu Changming told the Xinhua news agency that the three ships would set sail from the port of Sanya on 26 December .
Several countries have sent forces to combat the pirates , who have attacked more than 100 ships this year .
Among those still held is a Saudi oil tanker and a Ukrainian ship with tanks .
They are among 15 vessels the pirates hold for ransom .
Co-operation
The three Chinese ships , part of the country 's South Sea Fleet , will leave Sanya on Friday for the Gulf of Aden and the waters off Somalia , Mr Hu said .
Their main mission would be to protect the safety of Chinese vessels and their crews in the region , as well as protecting vessels delivering humanitarian aid international organisations , he added .
The defence ministry spokesman said the ships would abide strictly to the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and international law , and would be willing to co-operate with other convoy protection ships from concerned countries .
They will also participate in humanitarian assistance missions .
At a news conference on Thursday , foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said 20 % of Chinese ships passing through the region between January and November this year had been attacked by Somali pirates .
Correspondents say the deployment will be the first of its kind for a country that has traditionally followed a doctrine of non-interference in other nations ' affairs .
But world leaders have called for greater action to deal with the problem and last week , the UN approved a resolution allowing foreign troops to pursue pirates on land in Somalia .
The Chinese taskforce will join warships from the EU , US , India , Russia , Malaysia and others which are already patrolling in the area .
Earlier , an Iranian warship began patrolling in the gulf , where two Iranian vessels have been hijacked recently , state radio reported .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran has documents to prove the United States and Britain , the Islamic Republic ’s two Western arch foes , back a group that killed 16 abducted Iranian police officers , state radio reported on Saturday .
Shi’ite - dominated Iran said this month the Sunni group Jundollah ( God ’s Soldiers ) had killed 16 police hostages who were abducted from a checkpoint in the southeastern Sistan - Baluchestan province in June .
Tehran , which often accuses Britain and the United States of trying to destabilize the Islamic Republic , has said Jundollah ’s head , Abdolmalek Rigi , is part of the Sunni Islamist al Qaeda network .
“ There are documents that show that Britain and America are supporting Rigi ’s terrorist group with arms and information , ” the radio quoted Ebrahim Raisi , first deputy to Iran ’s judiciary chief , as saying .
“ The Iranian nation will avenge the blood of the border post soldiers powerfully , ” it added , without providing further details on the documents .
Osama bin Laden ’s al Qaeda is blamed for numerous attacks on the United States , including the September 2001 assaults on New York and Washington that killed some 3,000 people .
Jundollah operates mostly in Sistan - Baluchestan , a volatile region near the border with Pakistan , home to Iran ’s mostly Sunni ethnic Baluchis .
The area is notorious for clashes between security forces and heavily armed bandits and drug smugglers .
“ All forces -- police , security and the judiciary branch -- are determined to deal very strongly with the soldiers of the devil , ” Raisi said , referring to Jundollah .
Similar comments about action against the group ’s attacks were made by Ahmad Khatami , a senior Iranian cleric , during a sermon to worshippers on Friday in Tehran .
Iran has blamed Jundollah for other abductions and in 2007 the group claimed responsibility for an attack on a bus carrying Iranian Revolutionary Guards that killed 11 people .
Iran has not had diplomatic ties with the United States since 1980 .
Britain has an embassy in Tehran but relations have often been strained over the years , mainly because of Britain ’s involvement in Iranian politics when it was an imperial power .
The virus behind cold sores is a major cause of the insoluble protein plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer 's disease sufferers , University of Manchester researchers have revealed .
They believe the herpes simplex virus is a significant factor in developing the debilitating disease and could be treated by antiviral agents such as acyclovir , which is already used to treat cold sores and other diseases caused by the herpes virus .
Another future possibility is vaccination against the virus to prevent the development of the disease in the first place .
Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) is characterised by progressive memory loss and severe cognitive impairment .
It affects over 20 million people world - wide , and the numbers will rise with increasing longevity .
However , despite enormous investment into research on the characteristic abnormalities of AD brain - amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles - the underlying causes are unknown and current treatments are ineffectual .
Professor Ruth Itzhaki and her team at the University 's Faculty of Life Sciences have investigated the role of herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV1 ) in AD , publishing their very recent , highly significant findings in the Journal of Pathology .
Most people are infected with this virus , which then remains life - long in the peripheral nervous system , and in 20 - 40 % of those infected it causes cold sores .
Evidence of a viral role in AD would point to the use of antiviral agents to stop progression of the disease .
The team discovered that the HSV1 DNA is located very specifically in amyloid plaques : 90 % of plaques in Alzheimer 's disease sufferers ' brains contain HSV1 DNA , and most of the viral DNA is located within amyloid plaques .
The team had previously shown that HSV1 infection of nerve - type cells induces deposition of the main component , beta amyloid , of amyloid plaques .
Together , these findings strongly implicate HSV1 as a major factor in the formation of amyloid deposits and plaques , abnormalities thought by many in the field to be major contributors to Alzheimer 's disease .
The team had discovered much earlier that the virus is present in brains of many elderly people and that in those people with a specific genetic factor , there is a high risk of developing Alzheimer 's disease .
The team 's data strongly suggest that HSV1 has a major role in Alzheimer 's disease and point to the usage of antiviral agents for treating the disease , and in fact in preliminary experiments they have shown that acyclovir reduces the amyloid deposition and reduces also certain other feature of the disease which they have found are caused by HSV1 infection .
Professor Itzhaki explains :
" We suggest that HSV1 enters the brain in the elderly as their immune systems decline and then establishes a dormant infection from which it is repeatedly activated by events such as stress , immunosuppression , and various infections .
" The ensuing active HSV1 infection causes severe damage in brain cells , most of which die and then disintegrate , thereby releasing amyloid aggregates which develop into amyloid plaques after other components of dying cells are deposited on them . "
Her colleague Dr Matthew Wozniak adds : " Antiviral agents would inhibit the harmful consequences of HSV1 action ; in other words , inhibit a likely major cause of the disease irrespective of the actual damaging processes involved , whereas current treatments at best merely inhibit some of the symptoms of the disease . "
The team now hopes to obtain funding in order to take their work further , enabling them to investigate in detail the effect of antiviral agents on the Alzheimer 's disease - associated changes that occur during HSV1 infection , as well as the nature of the processes and the role of the genetic factor .
They very much hope also that clinical trials will be set up to test the effect of antiviral agents on Alzheimer 's disease patients .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Bush administration on Wednesday largely abandoned its plan to buy up toxic mortgage assets and said it will focus its $ 700 billion financial bailout fund on making direct investments in financial institutions and shoring up consumer credit markets .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson speaks during a news conference at the Treasury Building in Washington November 12 , 2008 .
Paulson on Wednesday said he was backing away from buying troubled mortgage assets using a $ 700 billion bailout fund , instead favoring a second round of capital injections into financial institutions that would match private funds .
REUTERS / Mitch Dumke
The U.S. Treasury Department initially promoted the financial rescue package approved by Congress last month as a vehicle to buy illiquid mortgage assets from banks and other institutions to spur fresh lending .
However , that plan never got off the ground and U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told a news conference asset purchases were not the most effective use of the funds .
“ This is not going to be the focus , ” he said .
Paulson added , however , that the Treasury would continue to examine the usefulness of “ targeted ” purchases .
Treasury has already tapped the fund to inject capital into banks and ailing insurer American International Group AIG.N. Paulson said he was considering a second round of preferred share purchases in both banks and non -bank institutions which , in a fresh twist , would match privately raised funds .
He also said the Treasury was working with the Federal Reserve on a plan to help restore credit flows to U.S. households by using financial rescue funds to lure investors back to markets for securitized debt , such as car loans , student loans and credit cards .
The administration 's shifting focus disappointed Wall Street and U.S. stock prices tumbled sharply .
The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed down 408 points , or 4.7 percent .
“ This has n’t done the Treasury ’s credibility a world of good , ” said Alan Ruskin , chief international strategist at RBS Global Banking and Markets in New York .
“ Basically , they found that the market would applaud direct capital injections more readily than understanding the complexities of reverse auctions to buy assets , so it ’s a pragmatic choice . ”
Paulson was unapologetic , saying that by the time the rescue bill was passed on October 3 , it was clear the asset purchase plan would take too long and would not be sufficient to calm roiling markets .
“ I will never apologize for changing a strategy or an approach if the facts change , ” he said .
COOL TO CALLS FOR HELP
The $ 700 billion financial sector bailout is the United States ’ marquee effort to combat a credit crisis spawned by rising U.S. mortgage defaults that is now wreaking economic damage worldwide .
To help ease the crisis , the U.S. Treasury and bank regulators on Wednesday issued “ guidance ” for banks encouraging them to lend and to rein in any compensation plans that might lead executives to take excessive risks .
Earlier on Wednesday , Canada announced a plan to buy up another $ 41 billion in insured mortgages and other steps to try to free - up credit .
Paulson said the U.S. Treasury was duty - bound to help prevent mortgage foreclosures , but he warned that further aid would likely mean a significant government subsidy , signaling a lack of support for a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. proposal for more aggressive aid to borrowers .
The regulator for the two largest U.S. mortgage finance companies -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- unveiled a plan on Tuesday to cut payments for hundreds of thousands of homeowners behind on their payments .
That plan , however , would not touch the many loans held by mortgage investors .
Paulson sidestepped questions on whether the Treasury would use bailout funds to help struggling Detroit automakers , as the industry and some lawmakers have called for .
While he said the industry was a “ critical ” one for the United States , he said the purpose of the program was to provide financial system stability .
He said one option would be to amend legislation to allow $ 25 billion already approved for efficient vehicle production to be made available more quickly .
So far , the Treasury has focused on providing capital to federally regulated banks and thrifts , but Paulson said it was looking to broaden the effort to cover financial institutions that do not have a federal bank or thrift charter .
“ Although the financial system has stabilized , both banks and non-banks may well need more capital given their troubled asset holdings , projections for continued high rates of foreclosures and stagnant U.S. and world economic conditions , ” he said .
$ 700 BILLION STILL ENOUGH ?
The Treasury has allocated $ 250 billion of the bailout funds to inject capital into banks and thrifts and it has earmarked another $ 40 billion to shore up AIG , leaving just $ 60 billion to dole out before it would have to ask Congress to release the final $ 350 billion .
Paulson said he had no timeline for that request , which means the decision could be left to the incoming administration of President - elect Barack Obama , who takes office on January 20 .
He also signaled he would not seek to increase the overall size of the bailout fund .
“ I still am comfortable that , with $ 700 billion , we have what we need , ” he said .
With an aim to restoring credit for households , Paulson said the Treasury and Fed were considering setting up a program to increase liquidity for top- rated asset - backed securities , but he provided few details .
“ The initial shock of abandoning TARP is hitting stocks , but the support for consumer - level lending may be a silver lining as it goes to the root of what ’s ailing the economy , namely personal consumption , ” said Brian Dolan , chief currency strategist at FOREX.com in Bedminster , New Jersey .
Nineteen states — including New York , Ohio , Indiana , and North Carolina — are in danger of running out of money to pay unemployment benefits .
Michigan already has drained its state fund and is $ 340 million in debt .
Unemployment benefits are paid from a tax charged to businesses .
But so many people currently are unemployed that benefits payments exceed employer contributions .
During the 2001 recession , the federal government gave $ 8 billion to replenish state unemployment accounts nationwide .
But many states used the money to lower taxes instead .
Now they may have to reduce benefits , redefine who is eligible , or require that recipients do a certain number of job searches or be out of work for a set number of weeks before they get any money .
“ The financial picture is looking pretty dismal , ” says Sujit CanagaRetna of the Council of State Governments .
“ Perhaps states will learn this time that they need to replenish funds during strong economic years to have enough cash on hand to cope with a downturn . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Democrats hold a strong majority in Congress , but with power comes a power struggle , and a potential headache for President Obama .
Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid have made it clear that they do n't agree with President Obama on everything .
Just two days into his term , the president is already facing pushback from leaders of his own party .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have made it clear -- it 's not their job to answer to Obama .
To a certain degree , the president - Congress tension is simply politics at play -- something that happens every time a new president comes in .
But this time , the Democrats have even more power than they did before the election , meaning Pelosi and Reid both have huge majorities in their respective houses .
Pelosi's biggest problem with the president 's agenda is the silence she 's hearing when President Obama is asked about former President Bush 's tax cuts .
During the campaign season , Obama proposed repealing the Bush tax cuts on those making at least $ 250,000 , but now it 's more likely that the president will delay any tax increases on the wealthy until 2011 , when the tax cuts expire .
The Obama team says that in the middle of a recession you do n't , in effect , raise people 's taxes .
Pelosi , however , does n't buy that argument .
She wants to see them rolled back now .
" We had campaigned in saying what the Republican Congressional Budget Office told us : Nothing contributed more to the budget deficit than the tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America , " Pelosi said in an interview Sunday with Fox News .
A spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called Pelosi 's statement " false , " and cited a recent fact check by the St. Petersburg Times disputing the House Speaker 's claim that tax cuts for the wealthy are the biggest contributor to the budget deficit .
Pelosi said she would not seek to block the president 's proposed stimulus plan over its lack of tax hikes for the rich , but she urged Obama not to simply let the tax cuts expire in two years .
" [ Tax cuts on the wealthy ] have to prove their worth to me as to how they grow the economy , how they create jobs , " she said .
Pelosi is also pushing for an investigation into the Bush administration 's handling of the Justice Department , while Obama and his aides say there are other priorities besides focusing on the administration they are succeeding .
" I think that we have to learn from the past , and we cannot let the politicizing of , for example , the Justice Department , go unreviewed , " Pelosi said last weekend .
" Past is prologue . "
Before becoming president , Obama made it clear that investigating the Bush administration was n't a priority .
Over in the Senate , Reid has taken a similar stance to Pelosi's .
In an interview with The Hill earlier this month , the Democrat said , " I do n't believe in the executive power trumping everything .
... I believe in our Constitution , three separate but equal branches of government . "
" If Obama steps over the bounds , I will tell him .
... I do not work for Barack Obama .
I work with him , " he said .
Obama , however , has made clear he's not letting any pushback slow him down .
Even before his inauguration , he threatened to veto any attempts to block his access to the remaining bailout funds .
As the Obama administration gets settled in , one can expect the tug and pull between the White House and Congress to continue :
It 's that balance of power getting into balance under new circumstances .

" There is a privacy about it which no other season gives you ....
In spring , summer and fall people sort of have an open season on each other ;
only in the winter , in the country , can you have longer , quiet stretches when you can savor belonging to yourself . "

There were 100 lots in the auction including furniture
Memorabilia owned by the late Spike Milligan has fetched £ 73,000 at a London auction .
Fans packed out Bonhams for the chance to own some of the comedian 's personal possessions , including original Goon Show recordings and his scripts .
The top lot was a collection of seven Christmas cards that ex-Beatle George Harrison sent to Milligan , which sold for £ 7,200 .
The comic 's widow put the items up for sale because she is moving house .
The Beatles , who all knew Milligan , featured prominently in the auction .
One card from Harrison reads : " Spike - I told you - you should have joined the Beatles ! "
A Christmas gift from the musician also fetched £ 3,360 .
A poem and cartoon created by Sir Paul McCartney entitled The Poet Of Dumbwoman 's Lane , went for £ 6,000 and a copy of Arthur Janov 's The Primal Scream given to Milligan and signed by John Lennon sold for £ 4,200 .
' Jam - packed '
A misspelt director 's chair sold for £ 696 .
A collection of handwritten notices that Milligan used to leave around his house , including one reading " no smoking , we are trying to give up lung cancer " , sold for £ 5,040 inclusive of buyer 's premium - far higher than its original £ 100 - £ 150 estimate .
An archive of Milligan 's wartime diaries were snapped up for £ 6,000 and 40 of the original Goon Show recordings on quarter - inch tape made £ 1,560 .
" It was a very different set of people in the auction room today and it was absolutely jam - packed , " said Bonhams spokeswoman Michelle Gonsalves .
" I could n't get through the door .
Some of the lots were very fiercely battled between phone bidders and people in the room . "
The sale sparked controversy last week when a statement released on behalf of Milligan 's four children said they were " deeply distressed " they had not been consulted over the auction .
The comedian shot to fame in the 1950s , writing and staring in the Goon Show alongside Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe .
He died in 2002 , aged 83 .
This is going to be another one of those " I thought the game was kind of ' meh , ' but my kids really got into it " reviews .
The game is Lost in Blue : Shipwrecked , the first foray of the existing handheld series onto a full - fledged game platform .
The idea is simple , but imaginative : you 're the good - natured , Goku - haired son of a wealthy CEO shipwrecked on a tropical island with your trusty pet monkey ( so , you know , just the kind of everyman character we can all identify with ) , and you have to survive .
No , the Dharma Initiative does n't have anything to do with it , but there may be some " Others " on a nearby island , and not everything is as it seems .
But you delve into that later in the game .
First , you have to survive , and on a Wii title , that means mini -games .
The first mini - games will give everyone a little pause as they wonder " hey , did I accidentally put Cooking Mama in by accident ? "
You wander about your little island collecting fruit , coconuts , seaweed , and even digging up clams ( itself a mini- game ) .
Then you sit down and do a little chopping with your handy knife .
If you chop your ingredients just right , the meal comes out tastier and satisfies your hunger better .
Easy as pie .
As the game goes on , you 'll go through more mini - games to build a raft and get to the bigger nearby island , start fires , build spear - fishing rigs , and so on .
On the other island , you 'll find Lucy ( who looks like a Manga - zed Cindy Vortex from Jimmy Neutron ) and her pet dog ( no , this is n't Golden Compass ) , some other folks who may or may not have been on the ship too , and other mysteries , all the while managing thirst , hunger , and stamina in a rather RPG manner .
So here 's where the difficult dichotomy of reviewing titles with your kids comes into play .
My overall impression of the game was on the poor side of the coin .
The grapics did little to tax the Wii's powerhourse ( cough , hack ) capabilities .
The dubbing was erratic to the point of confusion ; there 's plenty of that traditional Japanese on - screen dialogue , but one - in - seven words or phrases was actually dubbed in English as well .
The problem is , there was no rhyme or reason as to what words or phrases are dubbed .
Sometimes it's a whole statement , sometimes just one word out of a speech bubble , often nothing .
Bizarre .
And after a while , managing your characters ' stats via mini - game became like managing your cities in Civilization , just without the depth , creativity , and fun .
The trouble with all that being : my kids were totally enjoying themselves playing the game .
Indeed , my older son came running to me with a goofy grin on his face when he figured out how to make a spear and catch the freshwater fish .
So what do I know ?
The bottome line , then ?
If you were a fan of the DS title , love mini - games for the sake of mini-games , or have younger kids who will get into the story , this could be a good title for you .
Otherwise , you 'll be bored and unimpressed .
Wired : Imaginative setting and incorporation of mini-games .
Tired : Lousy graphics , bizarre dubbing .

Ah , December , the time to look back and evaluate the past year .
For guy movies at least , 2008 seemed like a strong year , both in terms of depth and top - end quality .
We saw the return of a few favorites , the introduction of some new stars , and one of the best movies released in recent years .
We at Gunaxin want to take a look back at the year ’s biggest hits and some of the films that may have been overlooked .
You ’ve probably seen some of the movies on this list , or at least remember them coming out in theaters .
That ’s a great start .
For those that you do n’t recognize , hopefully we can alert you to something you might have otherwise overlooked .
With the Christmas season upon us , these movies can also make a fine gift .
We ’re going to go twenty deep on this list , trying to hit not only the major blockbusters , but some titles a little less known .
Obviously any one person is not expected to like every film on this list .
It ’s great if you do , but each person is an individual , and what may appeal to one may not appeal to another .
This is a compilation that is meant to appeal to men as a whole .
And if you like this list , you may want to check out our Top 50 Guys Movies of the 1990s .
So without further ado , let ’s get on with the rankings :
Director : Paul W. S. Anderson
Stars : Jason Statham , Joan Allen , Tyrese Gibson , Ian McShane
Who needs a plot when there ’s explosion and mayhem ?
In a nutshell , Statham plays a former race car driver who ’s framed for the murder of his wife and sent to prison .
There he is forced by the warden to compete in a gladiator style sport that ’s made for television : a car race in which inmates must brutalize and kill one another on the road to victory .
Win enough and you become a free man .
Think Running Man , but with cars or the game Twisted Metal come to life .
The movie is fun , very loud , ridiculously violent , and really enjoyable .
Despite its flaws , it does n’t take itself seriously and is simply a fun ride .
Director : David Ayer
Stars : Keanu Reeves , Forest Whitaker , Hugh Laurie , Chris Evans
This is a gritty story of a rogue cop who is pushed past his limits by corruption , greed , and violence .
Reeves plays a dirty cop , but one who ’s dirty in the name of justice .
His boss does n’t care as long as he gets results .
When his ex-partner is murdered after potentially ratting him out , he ’s both a suspect and out for vengeance to find the killers .
This thriller is littered with gunfire , constant drinking , and is a real throwback to the 1970s cop films because of its violence , profanity , and political incorrectness .
Reeves is no great shakes as the lead , but he holds his own quite competently .
Whitaker ’s right in his wheelhouse playing Keanu ’s boss , and the end result is a crime drama full of tension .
18 . Role Models
Director : David Wain
Stars : Paul Rudd , Seann William Scott , Christopher Mintz - Plasse , Bobb’e J. Thompson
From the director of Wet Hot American Summer and co-written by star Paul Rudd , comes this comedy about two hyper - caffeinated beverage salesmen who crash a tow truck into a statue in front of a local high school .
In order to avoid jail time , they choose to serve 150 hours of a community service with a mentoring or Big Brother type program .
Role Models works because of Rudd and Scott .
Their polarizing styles compliment each other , with Rudd being the sarcastic understated smart ass and Scott the goofy party animal .
Yes , the movie follows the predictible path of selfish jerks learning lesson and transforming into compassionate paternal figures .
That ’s not exactly a spoiler for this kind of movie .
The fun is not in the destination , but the laughs along the way .
Director : Neil Marshall
Stars : Rhona Mitra , Bob Hoskins , Malcolm McDowell
If you enjoyed Mad Max : Beyond Thunderdome or Escape from New York , this might be the film for you .
From writer / director Neil Marshall comes the British science fiction action film filled with a tongue in cheek splatter fest homage to the great John Carpenter movies of the 80s .
Gratuitous blood geysers ?
Check .
Insane , post - apocalyptic punks ?
Check .
Buff , beautiful , uber - bad - ass heroine that can kill without a moment ’s hesitation but still possesses superior morals to those that command her ?
Check .
Ego-maniacal bad guy played by Malcolm McDowell ?

Ticking clock to doomsday ?
Check .
Starring the beautiful Rhona Mitra , she is sent into a quarantined zone to find the cure to a deadly virus .
The only hitch ?
The zone is a completely lawless land abandoned by modern society .
If that ’s your kind of thing , check out this fun gorefest .
Director : Sean Anders
Stars : Josh Zuckerman , Clark Duke , Amanda Crew , James Marsden
Ah , the R - Rated teen comedy , always a fun genre .
Sex Drive is about a high school senior who goes on a cross-country road trip to hook up with a girl he met online .
At least he hopes it ’s a girl , you never known who ’s on the other end online .
This movie may be one of the filthiest and mean - spirited mainstream comedies in the past few years , but it also might be one of the smartest .
Yes , the plot is very clichéd , but the set - up of the comedy is genius .
A constant barrage of jokes are thrown at the audience , most of them sticking .
And that ’s where the joy lies , in the laughs .
From the same basic concepts as American Pie and Road Trip , if you enjoyed those movies , you should enjoy this one .
Director : Louis Leterrier
Stars : Edward Norton , Liv Tyler , Tim Roth , William Hurt
A follow - up to Ang Lee ’s 2003
Hulk film , the producers of this film had their work cut out for them after the critical thrashing the original film received .
Although plagued by some disagreement between its star , Norton , and its director , the final product works well as comic adaptation .
I ’ll admit I ’ve never been a huge Hulk fan , being drawn more to the likes of X - Men , Spiderman , and Batman .
Maybe its because the Hulk is more of an uncontrolled beast than strict superhero .
And yet this movie is a great way to portray the Hulk and Bruce Banner as the hero .
Playing essentially a cat - and - mouse game , Bruce Banner is hiding abroad from General Ross and the U.S. Government until his location is discovered .
It prompts Banner to return to the U.S. in a last - ditch effort to find a cure for his “ disease . ”
Littered with great special effects and action sequences , at the end of the day the Incredible Hulk is an entertaining summer blockbuster .
Director : Timur Bekmambetov
Stars : James McAvoy , Morgan Freeman , Angelina Jolie
Wanted is an odd film .
It ’s overly stylish , saturated with absurdity , and directed by a guy making his Hollywood debut .
On the surface this looks like something that could come from Rob Cohen .
Except that it stars three high profile quality actors .
Freeman and Jolie have won Oscars , and McAvoy has won many critic awards for his roles in the dramas The Last King of Scotland and Atonement .
It ’s an odd mish mash .
McAvoy is the action hero here , and he makes an unlikely kind of hero .
In Matrix - like fashion , he turns from nobody into somebody pretty fast .
The explanation for how everything is possible in this movie is never fully fleshed out , but the movie features extreme action , an array of visual adrenaline , and some dark humor through out .
And it has Angelina Jolie looking pretty good .
Overall that ’s a win .
Director : Kevin Smith
Stars : Seth Rogen , Elizabeth Banks , Craig Robinson
Take Kevin Smith ’s already crude sense of humor , mix in porno , and voilà , you have this movie .
The title pretty much describes the plot .
Two lifelong friends run out of money and decide to make a porno to pay the bills .
If you ’re looking for a real porno film , you ’ll be disappointed .
For nearly being rated NC - 17 the sex is not terribly gratuitous , although the language is a hard R .
Even without gratuitous sex , this movie can be controversial and borderline wrong in some parts , but it ’s ultimately a feel good story .
Basically , this is vintage Kevin Smith , blending the cheerily offensive with heartfelt sentimentality , and while its nothing groundbreaking , its a successful comedy .
Director : Guillermo del Toro
Stars : Ron Perlman , Selma Blair , Doug Jones , Jeffrey Tambor
Sony wanted no part of a Hellboy sequel , luckily Universal stepped in to finance a continuation of the 2004 cult hit .
And Director Guillermo del
Toro delievers a solid follow - up to the original which should please Hellboy fans and maybe capture a few new ones .
Del Toro is known for his visual panache and enriching vision , and its certainly on display here with an overdose of dazzling visuals , seen in bizarre yet beautiful monsters and set design .
But the heart of the movie is Ron Perlman and his portrayal of the titular character .
Here we see him battle a vengeful Prince while dealing with some domestic issues back home .
As always , we see a hilarious dose of self - aware humor mixed in with some thrilling action pieces .
I ’d still prefer the original personally , but I feel both movies are successes that many can enjoy .
Director : Nicholas Stoller
Stars : Jason Segel , Kristen Bell , Mila Kunis , Russell Brand
One can certainly debate whether Forgetting Sarah Marshall qualifies as a guy movie .
It ’s basically a break up movie , maybe something comparable along the lines of Swingers .
And I ’d include Swingers as a guy movie , so I think we can include Forgetting Sarah Marshall .
It also does n’t hurt that this comes from the Apatow camp , the guy who brought us Superbad and Knocked Up .
Starring Jason Segel , who also wrote the screenplay , it features a guy who ’s dumped by his TV star girlfriend and tries to overcome the sorrow .
We see TV regulars Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis in major roles , plus a number of cameos by Apatow usuals .
The most memorable character , however , is Russell Brand , who plays the over - conscious over - sexed rock star Aldous Snow .
The movie is amusing and sometimes awkward , but brings the laughs as the writing flows with well - timed jokes , apathetic digs , and shockingly vulgar humor .
This film could even be rated higher on this list , but loses points for featuring full frontal male nudity .
10 . Quantum of Solace
Director : Marc Forster
Stars : Daniel Craig , Olga Kurylenko , Mathieu Amalric
I ’ll get the obvious out of the way , no this is not as good as Casino Royale .
That said , Casino Royale set a pretty lofty standard to hold any movie up to .
While not achieving that level of success this Bond installment succeeds in its own way .
Playing as a direct sequel , Quantum of Solace begins almost exactly where Casino Royale left off .
Bond is seeking revenge of the death of Vesper Lynd and is mixed up with some powerful unknown super criminal organization .
A modern day Legion of Doom , except these guys all seem like escaped members of a Clue game ( Mr. Greene , Mr. White , etc… ) .
the action is non-stop , and while you are missing some Bond staples , the movie works as a second act of Casino Royale .
Ultimately , Bond does show a quantum of solace at the end of the movie , allowing his character to begin anew in the next installment .
Director : Pierre Morel
Stars : Liam Neeson , Famke Janssen , Maggie Grace
If you live in the United States , you ’ll have to get creative to see this one .
Despite being filmed largely in English and being released in Europe almost a year ago , the film remains undistributed in the United States .
To top it off , the rumored U.S. release will be edited down to a PG - 13 rating .
Disappointing .
There are DVD and Blu - Ray releases in some countries , so imports are available as well as other less than legal means to obtain the flick .
As to the movie itself , it stars Liam Nesson in a commanding performance of a father who ’s daughter is kidnapped .
Neeson plays the action hero here , and if that sounds a bit odd to you do not fret as he pulls it off .
If you want to compare it to something you ’re more familiar with , think Bourne trilogy or 24 .
Director : Guy Ritchie
Stars : Gerard Butler , Tom Wilkinson , Thandie Newton
In his heart , Guy Ritchie is a guy ’s filmmaker ( his name is Guy after all ) .
This is a man who brought us Snatch and Lock , Stock , and Two Smoking Barrels .
I think we can forgive him for his Madonna diversions and whatever Swept Away was supposed to be .
At least we can forgive now that he ’s in his post - Madonna era .
RocknRolla is a return to form for Ritchie , even if he does n’t hit the heights of his previous work .
You ’ll see the traditional Ritchie staples here : fast pace , witty dialogue , complex interwoven story lines , and a stylish piece of work bristling with energy .
The basic storyline here is simple : when a Russian mobster sets up a real estate scam that generates millions of pounds , various members of London ’s criminal underworld pursue their share of the fortune .
Let the games begin !
Director : David Gordon Green
Stars : Seth Rogen , James Franco , Gary Cole
This is a movie rated R for “ pervasive language , drug use , sexual references , and violence . ”
That ’s a good start to any guy movie .
A bizarre choice for artsy director David Gordon Green , Pineapple Express is a mixing of various genres , including action , but at its heart is all about the laughs .
And the laughs are certainly here , with just about every scene featuring some great dialogue , acting , or some sort of incredible sight gag .
James Franco rejoins the Apatow clan after his work with Freaks and Geeks , and its him and not Rogen that ’s the highlight of this film .
This movie is another fine entry into the stoner film genre , hearkening back to the good ole days of Cheech and Chong .
Director : Roger Donaldson
Stars : Jason Statham , Saffron Burrows
Based on the 1971 Baker Street robbery in central London , the Bank Job features a group of petty criminals that rip off a bank vault with plenty of unintended consequences .
The amount of truth in what you see up on screen is for you to decide , as the depiction claims to be true .
Though you see Jason Statham ’s name as the lead , this is hardly a typical Statham picture .
It ’s a straight caper movie , and a grittier one than normal Hollywood standards .
A word of warning , the picture starts with a number of seemingly unconnected characters and stories that can come across as confusing or at least complex .
But stick with it , the slow build leads to a payoff of excitement and excellence toward the end as everything comes together .
Director : Sylvester Stallone
Stars : Sylvester Stallone , Julie Benz , Matthew Marsden
Sylvester Stallone is back .
Well at least in reprising one of his old characters , something he experienced success with two years ago in resurrecting Rocky Balboa .
The fourth installment of the Rambo franchise , and twenty years since the last film , John Rambo is back in action .
The plot here is pretty simple and more or less a vehicle to setup the action sequences .
And its the action sequences you ’ll remember , as there are a reported 236 kills in this one ( individual body counts may vary ) .
But it ’s not just sheer body counts , the action is also visceral and downright gory at times .
Think of the scenes on Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan , or in other words you may not want to watch if you have a weak stomach .
One can complain about the excessive gore , violence , and general lack of story , but I think that ’s the exact reason people are attracted to a movie like this .
Well either that or nostalgia .
Director : Ben Stiller
Stars : Ben Stiller , Robert Downey Jr. , Jack Black
The movie starts with a few fake trailers mocking the clichés of Hollywood , including some of its personalities , films , and business tactics .
Then it barrels full force into a feature that ’s a unique blend of satire , action , and comedy .
Although littered with comedy heavyweights like Ben Stiller and Jack Black , the scene stealer in this one is actually Tom Cruise , playing the ruthless and obscenity laced studio executive Les Grossman .
Of course that ’s not meant to take away from the rest of the ensemble cast , which together form a hilarious bunch .
Of the names on the poster , Robert Downey Jr. has the best part , playing a Russell Crowe like superstar actor that gets deeply involved in his roles .
As he would say , “ I know what dude I am .
I ’m the dude playin ’ the dude , disguised as another dude ! ”
Director : Martin McDonagh
Stars : Colin Farrell , Brendan Gleeson , Ralph Fiennes
In Bruges is from the mind of writer / director Martin McDonagh , who won an Oscar last year for his short film Six Shooter .
This movie is about two hitmen that badly botch a hit and are sent to Belgium by their boss to lay low for awhile .
Despite the subject matter , the film works best as a comedy , with some action and violence mixed in .
Ralph Fiennes plays the boss , seemingly mimicking Ben Kingsley ’s foul mouthed bad ass from Sexy Beast .
The film has an overall European feel , and plays as something more than a simply action comedy .
Still , even though it may be deeper than some films , it ’s no overly artsy .
I mean there ’s a running joke about midgets throughout the picture .
Director : Jon Favreau
Stars : Robert Downey Jr. , Gwyneth Paltrow , Jeff Bridges , Terrence Howard
Favreau got his starts as an actor , but has started to make a name for himself behind the camera with enjoyable fare like Zathura and Elf.
Iron Man is his best effort to date , and it tells the story of billionaire industrialist , genius inventor , and consummate playboy Tony Stark .
What guy would n’t want to be that ?
In another year , this movie could have easily topped this list .
We see Tony Stark become Iron Man , an ordinary man that becomes extraordinary through the use of a self - designed high - tech suit .
Robert Downey Jr. is perfect casting for Iron Man , and the movie delivers by mixing action , comedy , and drama in the right proportions .
Do n’t forget to say after the credits for a bonus .
Director : Christopher Nolan
Stars : Christian Bale , Michael Caine , Heath Ledger , Gary Oldman , Aaron Eckhart
Did you really expect anything else ?
Loved by critics and audiences , there ’s a good chance that this film garners a nod for Best Picture when the Oscar nominations come out next year .
The follow - up to Nolan ’s reboot Batman Begins , this time we are introduced to Batman ’s arch - nemesis The Joker .
Heath Ledger gives a commanding performance of the psychotic killer , in a version much more faithful to the comics than Tim Burton ’s Batman .
The Joker is undoubtedly Batman ’s most nefarious foe and ideal nemesis , and we get to see to what lengths he pushes him in this picture .
This great movie does not give a single frame to breathe , filling each second with action and intrigue .
It ’s an ode to chaos and anarchy , depicting a real Gotham City that is dominated by fear while clamouring for a hero .
The Dark Knight is simply a stunning masterpiece and the best comic adaptation to date .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. congressional Republicans predicted on Friday that legislation to boost the sagging economy would pass by mid-February , but pressed President Barack Obama to support more tax cuts in the plan .
Republicans complain that $ 550 billion of the Democrats ’ $ 825 billion stimulus package was government spending , with only $ 275 billion in tax cuts , which they say would better spur job growth and pull the economy out of a yearlong recession .
Both sides said on Friday they expected to get a stimulus package for Obama to sign by his mid-February deadline .
But they continued to disagree on details , with Republicans saying their attempts to make changes have been thwarted .
Amid Republican complaints that it would take years to spend a large portion of the funding , the Obama administration released a letter that said they wanted at least 75 percent of the money spent by September 30 , 2010 .
“ Everybody believes that government ’s action is necessary , ” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a speech to the National Press Club .
“ It will happen and I think it will happen before the anticipated week off in February . ”
He questioned whether their ideas would be adopted in the Democratically controlled Senate and House , but said he believed Obama was open to them .
“ We will see , as we go along , how many of them are incorporated . ”
Republicans handed their alternatives to Obama at a bipartisan White House meeting and planned to press their ideas when the package comes to a House vote on Wednesday .
Obama will visit Capitol Hill again next week to push for the package .
TAX BREAKS
The Democratic tax cut plan would direct benefits more toward lower - income workers , even those who do not pay income taxes , while the Republicans would help all taxpayers .
The Republicans do not know yet the cost of their plan .
Republicans have so far failed to significantly change the legislation despite offering amendments to boost tax cuts and slash government spending .
The Republican proposals include cutting the lowest two income tax brackets , from 15 percent to 10 percent and from 10 percent to 5 percent , while also offering small businesses a tax deduction equal to 20 percent of their income .
Democrats have proposed a tax cut of $ 500 for individuals earning up to $ 75,000 and $ 1,000 for families earning up to $ 150,000 .
Republicans said their plan would give families an average of $ 1,700 in savings .
The Republicans also proposed helping those who have lost their jobs by eliminating taxes on unemployment benefits .
They also urged that the legislation bar higher taxes to pay for the anticipated increased spending .
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus unveiled the Democrats ’ draft of their tax stimulus bill to be considered next week .
Totaling $ 275 billion in tax breaks and incentives , it had many similar elements to the House package and included $ 30 billion in tax cuts and incentives for the energy sector .
The top Republican on the panel , Sen. Chuck Grassley , said he would try to include a fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax , which was designed to ensure wealthy people did not take advantage of so many tax breaks that they paid no taxes .
But more middle income families are being hit by it .
The state will suspend tax refunds , welfare checks , student grants and other payments owed to Californians starting Feb.
1 , Controller John Chiang announced Friday .
Chiang said he had no choice but to stop making some $ 3.7 billion in payments in the absence of action by the governor and lawmakers to close the state ’s nearly $ 42 - billion budget deficit .
More than half of those payments are tax refunds .
The controller said the suspended payments could be rolled into IOUs if California still lacks sufficient cash to pay its bills come March or April .
“ It pains me to pull this trigger , ” Chiang said at a news conference in his office .
“ But it is an action that is critically necessary . ”

The payments to be frozen include nearly $ 2 billion in tax refunds ; $ 300 million in cash grants for needy families and the elderly , blind and disabled ; and $ 13 million in grants for college students .
Even if a budget agreement is reached by the end of this month , tax refunds and other payments could remain temporarily frozen .
Chiang said a budget deal may not generate cash quickly enough to resume them immediately .
Not all payments will stop Feb .
1 . Most school and healthcare programs will be paid , as required by state and federal law .
The state will continue to pay more than $ 6.6 billion in such bills .
And Los Angeles County officials said they would cover welfare payments to more than 500,000 local recipients -- for now .
Advertisement
But California is projected to be $ 346 million short of the funds it needs to pay all its bills in February .
By March , the state would be so far in the red that even continuing to suspend payments would not cover the shortfall .
California would be insolvent , making the issuance of IOUs likely .
State officials have already designed an IOU template , Chiang said , and have been negotiating with banks over whether taxpayers could cash or deposit them if they are issued .
The state could be forced to pay as much as 5 % interest on delayed tax refunds if they are not paid by the end of May , Chiang said .
The last time the state issued such IOUs -- the only time since the Great Depression -- was in 1992 .
The suspension of payments is the latest radical move by officials to help keep the state from running out of cash as Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Legislature battle over how to avoid insolvency .

Schwarzenegger , who hopes to speed up public - works projects to stimulate the economy , wants tax increases , spending cuts and legislation to relax some environmental rules and allow private companies to do some government construction .
Democrats are seeking tax increases as well , but fewer spending cuts .
Republican lawmakers would only pare spending and have been blocking any tax hikes .
Meanwhile , Schwarzenegger has ordered that most state workers take two days off per month without pay -- equivalent to about a 10 % pay cut .
The governor also ordered most state offices -- including all DMV field offices -- to close on those two days .
The order is being challenged in court by labor unions .
The state has also halted payments of bond money for more than 5,300 public - works projects .

On Friday , the state Department of Finance temporarily exempted 276 of the projects from the freeze , reasoning that because they are nearly complete , it could cost the state more to shut them down than to finish them .
The exemption , through Feb. 1 , will allow the continuation of school construction by the Inglewood Unified School District and the construction of a new Court of Appeal facility in Santa Ana .
Work on new rail tracks at L.A. 's Union Station and road projects involving Irwindale Avenue , Martin Luther King Boulevard and Imperial Highway in Los Angeles County will also be able to continue .
Some projects were exempted because the state is under court order to do the jobs .
Others would threaten public safety if left uncompleted , according to Mike Genest , Schwarzenegger ’s finance director .
“ We ’re going to take the risk of allowing them to continue a little longer because we are very hopeful will have a budget by Feb. 1 , ” Genest said .

Contractors lined up at a meeting of state finance officials to warn of the consequences of stopping the bulk of the public - works money .
They said shutting down projects already underway would ultimately cost the state significantly .
According to Caltrans Director Will Kempton , the state would have to pay $ 350 million in legal costs , claims for contract breaches and expenses for securing sites that go dormant .
“ The bulk of those dollars are lost . . . to the taxpayers , ” Kempton said .
“ You ca n’t just walk away from a construction project .
You have to make sure it is buttoned up . ”
It is not just the state that would take a hit .
Some school districts relying on state funds do not have the reserves in place to cover the payments they will owe builders if work stops .
Counties are also feeling the pinch .
They process the welfare payments scheduled to be halted by the controller ’s office Feb .
1 . The state is freezing those payments , along with millions of dollars in salaries to county workers who run the programs .

Some county officials say they do n’t have reserves in place to cover the state until the budget crisis is resolved .
“ We simply do n’t have the cash , ” said Pat Leary , assistant administrator for Yolo County .
“ We are in critically bad times . ”
About a third of all state welfare payments go to Los Angeles County , where officials said they can shift money around to keep the payments flowing in the short term .
“ The million - dollar question is how long this will last , ” said L.A. County Chief Executive William T Fujioka .
“ We can not sustain a huge and very long hit . ”

A mother and child sit among the ruins of their home in Rafah , southern Gaza , one of 4,000 homes destroyed in the war
The rebuilding of Gaza after the Israeli bombardment already faces unique problems and is likely to be the most difficult reconstruction project in the world .
This is because of the sheer scale of the devastation , the economic siege of the Palestinian enclave by Israel and Egypt , and the attempt to exclude Hamas , the elected rulers of Gaza , from any role in the rebuilding .
The difficulties are all the greater because of the destruction of much of the tunnel system linking Gaza to Egypt .
Israeli and European leaders talk of the tunnel system – by one estimate there are 1,100 of them – as if it was exclusively devoted to supplying weapons and ammunition to Hamas .
In reality , " the tunnel economy " has been the way in which food , fuel and everything else has reached Gaza since Israel and Egypt sealed off the Strip 18 months ago , when Hamas drove out the rival Palestinian faction Fatah in 2007 .
Military supplies were always a very small part of Gaza 's imports through the tunnels .
" Everything from Viagra to diesel entered Gaza through the tunnels , " said one source .
At one point before the Israeli attack , the price of petrol went down in Gaza because a pipeline had been threaded through one of the tunnels , all of which are privately dug and owned .
Cooking - gas bottles are in short supply because they previously came in through tunnels that are now closed .
" I know middle - class families in Gaza cutting up their furniture to build fires so they can cook their food , " said an aid official yesterday .
Spare parts are desperately needed for generators .
The Palestinian tunnels and the Israeli - Egyptian border closure were two issues at the centre of the war and their future is still unresolved .
Until Gaza has continual access to the outside world , any real reconstruction will be impossible .
A senior EU official said no aid would be spent rebuilding buildings and infrastructure while Hamas remained in control .
Israel says that it will have withdrawn all its troops from the Gaza Strip by the time Barack Obama is inaugurated today .
A first priority forthe UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) will be to bring in foodstuffs and medicines and rebuild its supply system stretching from the Israeli port of Ashdod to the Gaza Strip .
Then it will try to restore the electricity , water and sewage systems wrecked by Israeli bombs and shells .
Amnesty International yesterday accused Israel of war crimes , saying its use of white phosphorus munitions in densely populated areas of Gaza was indiscriminate and illegal .
UNRWA will probably carry out the preliminary assessment of damage and initial repairs because Israel , Egypt , the US and the Europeans are boycotting Hamas , although UNRWA is nervous of acting as a substitute government of Gaza .
One Palestinian estimate suggests that the cost of rebuilding will be $ 1.4bn ( £ 970 m ) .
Saudi Arabia has already pledged $ 1bn but promises on aid are seldom kept in full .
Rebuilding will take place in a 139 - square - mile enclave that is packed with 1.5 million Palestinians , of whom 70 per cent are from refugee families expelled from Israel during the creation of the state .
More than a million are already receiving UN food supplies .
The initial assessment is that 20,000 homes lived in by 120,000 people have been somewhat damaged and can be patched up so they are habitable again .
The 4,000 homes that have been destroyed cannot be rebuilt because Israel is refusing to let construction materials cross the border into Gaza .
Israel , the US and their European allies are eager to prevent Hamas taking charge of reconstruction because this might add to its political standing among Palestinians .
They recall that after the Israeli attack on Lebanon in 2006 , many Lebanese at first blamed Hizbollah for provoking the assault .
But Hizbollah took charge of rebuilding and Iran reportedly gave $ 14,000 to every family which had lost its home , money that was channelled to grateful recipients through Hizbollah .
The major potential donors for Gaza will try to get aid distributed through the Palestinian Authority of President Mahmoud Abbas .
But he is , if anything , more discredited in the eyes of Palestinians and the Arab world as an Israeli and American stooge than he was before war in Gaza .
Hamas , which won the heavily - monitored Palestinian election of 2006 , will not want to dilute its power but there will be international pressure on Palestinians to form a government that is acceptable to donors .
If Gaza is to be restored even to the miserable condition it was in before 27 December , then the economic siege has to be lifted .
But Israeli leaders like the Foreign Minister , Tzipi Livni , and the Defence Minister , Ehud Barak have claimed success in the war .
If the blockade is raised , then Hamas will say it won the war – and the election of Benjamin Netanyahu as the next Prime Minister of Israel in the election on 10 February will become even more certain .
So were there any winners or losers ?
What was Hamas 's aim ?
Rocket attacks intended to force Israel to end blockade that has trapped 1.5 m Palestinians inside Gaza Strip since Hamas takeover .
Hamas also seeking recognition by West
What happened ?
Security arrangements are to be imposed on Hamas and no ceasefire agreement has been signed with the Islamists
Did they succeed ?
No .
What was Israel 's aim ?
Gaza offensive launched to " teach Hamas a lesson " .
Some Israeli politicians called for overthrow of Hamas , while contenders in next month 's election sought improved ratings
What happened ?
The majority of the estimated 20,000 Hamas fighters escaped with their lives .
Hamas rockets were still being fired at the end of Israeli offensive when Israel declared unilateral ceasefire
Did they succeed ?
No .
What was Egypt 's aim ?
To secure end to offensive through ceasefire agreement leading to truce , border security , reopening of crossings , Israeli troop withdrawal and Palestinian reconciliation
What happened ?
US negotiated separate deal with Israel on arms smuggling .
Hamas set its own truce conditions and refused reconciliation with Fatah .
Egyptian mediation deepened split between moderate Arab states and others
Did they succeed ?
No .
What was the EU 's aim ?
To profit from power vacuum in US and play lead negotiating role .
To map out road to peace and promise support for Palestinian leadership afterwards
What happened ?
Plethora of negotiators undermined EU credibility as did the incompetence of Czech EU presidency
Did they succeed ?
No .

Turkey 's prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , arrived home to a tumultuous reception of cheering crowds early today after storming out of a debate in Davos over Israel 's recent offensive in Gaza .
Hours after clashing with the Israeli president , Shimon Peres , in angry scenes at the normally sedate world economic forum , he was welcomed at Istanbul 's Ataturk airport by thousands of supporters waving Turkish and Palestinian flags and chanting " Turkey is proud of you " .
Sympathisers also left bouquets of flowers at his official residence .
The outpouring of support displayed the domestic political capital Erdogan gained from his performance at the Swiss resort , where he told Peres : " When it comes to killing , you know very well how to kill . "
He then walked off the stage , declaring that he would never return to Davos , after claiming he had not been allowed to speak by the debate moderator , the Washington Post columnist David Ignatius .
Erdogan also accused Peres of raising his voice and claimed the Israeli statesman had been allowed more speaking time than himself and the panel discussion 's two other participants , the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon , and Amr Moussa , secretary general of the Arab League .
Peres had earlier made an impassioned defence of Israeli actions in Gaza , asking Erdogan : " What would you do if you were to have in Istanbul every night a hundred rockets ? "
Erdogan responded by saying : " President Peres , you are older than me and your voice is very loud .
The reason for you raising your voice is the psychology of guilt … I know very well how you hit and killed children on the beaches . "
The prime minister 's wife , Emine – who this month organised a Women For Peace
In Palestine lunch for the wives of Islamic dignitaries – also became involved , bursting into tears after telling reporters that " everything Peres said was a lie " .
Erdogan 's outburst was his most high - profile in a series of outspoken attacks on Israel 's Gaza operations .
He had previously called the offensive – in which around 1,300 Palestinians died – a " crime against humanity " and demanded Israel 's expulsion from the UN .
His stance has shocked Israeli officials — used to considering Turkey as their closest regional ally — but played to the pro-Palestinian sentiments of the overwhelmingly Muslim Turkish public .
Mass demonstrations in favour of Hamas have been staged in Istanbul and other cities .
Such sympathies have prompted suggestions that Erdogan 's rhetoric has been mainly for domestic political consumption and aimed at wooing voters at forthcoming municipal elections in March .
Jewish groups have also voiced fears that the government 's fierce anti-Israeli criticism is fuelling antisemitism
The row with Peres overshadowed a dispute between the government and the International Montetary Fund that had seen Erdgoan accuse the fund of setting unacceptable conditions , after negotiations were suspended over a proposed loan to help Turkey weather the economic recession .
On arriving at Ataturk airport , he depicted his Davos walk - out in nationalist terms , telling journalists : " This was a matter of the esteem and prestige of my country .
I could not have allowed anyone to poison the prestige and in particular the honour of my country . "
He also denied his comments were aimed at the Israeli people or Jews in general .
A world economic forum spokesman said Peres spoke with Erdogan on the phone after the debate and expressed his respect for Turkey .
However , some observers believe Erdogan has sacrificed Turkish foreign policy , especially Turkey 's self - appointed role as a regional mediator .
Before the Gaza hostilities Turkey had been mediating in negotiations between Israel and Syria .
There are also fears that the pro-Israel lobby in the US will back moves to recognise the massacres of Armenians by Ottoman forces in the first world war as genocide , a move Turkey vehemently opposes .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Food stamps , the main U.S. antihunger program which helps the needy buy food , set a record in September as more than 31.5 million Americans used the program -- up 17 percent from a year ago , according to government data .
The number of people using food stamps in September surpassed the previous peak of 29.85 million seen in November 2005 when victims of hurricanes Katrina , Rita and Wilma received emergency benefits , said Jean Daniel of the USDA ’s Food and Nutrition Service .
September ’s tally -- the latest month available -- was also boosted by hurricane and flood aid , Daniel said on Wednesday .
But anti-hunger groups said the economic downturn is the main reason behind the higher figures .
“ It ’s a disturbing trend , ” said Ellen Vollinger , legal director with the Food Research and Action Center .
She said she expects more people will turn to food stamps as unemployment figures rise and the economy remains weak .
One in 10 Americans were participating in the food stamp program as of September , said Dottie Rosenbaum , analyst with Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a think tank .
That ’s approaching the all - time high of 10.5 percent of the population that used the program in 1994 , and is similar to levels seen in the early 1980s , she said .
States that have seen a drop in job numbers and increase in home foreclosures such as Florida and Nevada also have seen a marked increase in food stamp use , Rosenbaum said .
Food banks are struggling to meet increased requests for food , said Maura Daly of Feeding America , a network of food banks .
“ The tough economic time that our nation is facing is having a tremendous impact on the level of food assistance needed across the country , ” Daly said .
On average , people who used food stamps received $ 100 per month in benefits in September .
That increased slightly in October to account for higher food prices , but hunger groups said the benefits still do n’t go far enough at a time of high food prices and home heating costs .
Last month , the USDA said 36.2 million Americans or 11 percent of households struggle to get enough food to eat , and one - third of them had to sometimes skip or cut back on meals .
Hunger groups want Congress and the new administration to increase food stamp benefits as part of an economic stimulus package they hope will come in early 2009 .
The benefits go directly to people who spend it at local grocery stores , supporting businesses and jobs , said Vollinger of the Food Research and Action Center .
“ They ( the benefits ) do n’t sit in a pocket , ” she said , pointing to USDA estimates that $ 5 in food stamp spending generates $ 9 in economic activity .

The House of Lords forced another climb - down by the government yesterday by voting to amend the rules for the DNA database to allow innocent people to have their DNA samples destroyed and removed from the database .
The Lords heard that existing guidelines made it all but impossible to get off the database once you were on it .
The rules say that standard practice should be to reject out of hand first requests :
“ In the first instance applicants should be sent a letter informing them that the samples and the associated PNC record are lawfully held and that their request for deletion / destruction is refused . ”
Chief Police officers get the final say in deleting records but the rules remind them that this would only be in exceptional cases .
The example provided in guidelines is if everyone in a building is arrested and has DNA forcibly taken after the discovery of a body .
If this body subsequently turns out to have died of natural causes there might be an argument for deleting those people 's DNA records .
Baroness Hanham summed up the amendment : " The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that anyone who is on the database has access to guidelines that will tell them how to get off the database ...
Those who are innocent should not be on any database .
They should not be under the eye of the law of this country .
They are innocent .
They have no truck with the law and their DNA should not passed to Europe for whatever reason . "
What is needed instead is a clear , publicly available summary of rules for taking and storing DNA samples .
Hanham said : " Regulations laying out the guidelines on the whys , wherefores and means of DNA and other samples being either retained on or removed from the police national computer that are clear , explicit and user - friendly are long overdue .
Changes to the whole system during the passage of the Criminal Justice Act in 2001 , which turned the assumption of the destruction of DNA at the end of a case into the assumption of retention , upset the presumption of innocence .
The balance at present is not in favour of the innocent .
" Endless justifications may be put forward by those who believe that the current use of the database is too restricted and should be widened into one that is universal .
However , it is perhaps now time to listen to the voices of those in favour of the current situation , and of those who are frankly appalled by the possibility of having their identifying materials held indefinitely by the police . "
The amendment was passed by 161 votes in favour versus 150 against .
Hansard 's transcript of the debate is here . ®
While most everyone was watching the attempted bipartisanship on Capitol Hill this week , some of it broke out successfully in an unlikely place elsewhere .
It seems that Alaska Republican Gov. Sarah Palin , the unsuccessful GOP VP nominee , was worried that the Army was going to cut off pensions to the state 's old - timers long - retired from the Alaska Territorial Guard .
So she sat down and wrote a letter to the new big guy himself , Democrat ic President Barack Obama , who 's vowed to take extra special care of veterans .
And the largest state 's small congressional delegation got involved too .
And , what do you know ?
According to the ever - vigiliant Sarah Palin for President blog , the Army suddenly decided it did n't really need to cut off those payments after all
It found a special fund to pay them , while Sens. Lisa Murkowski , a Republican , and Mark Begich , a Democrat , together shepherd the proper authorizing legislation through Congress .
Amazing when it works .
And speaking of Sarah and Barack , this weekend they 're both attending the off - the - record black tie dinner of the Alfalfa Club , one of those fraternity - like get - togethers that Washingtonians schedule throughout the year to convince themselves of their eliteness .
Palin , who as The Ticket reported , formed her own SarahPAC this week , says she 's attending to pitch the interests of Alaska .
And ?
According to Paul Bedard over at Washington Whispers , Palin 's presence in D.C. has sparked an interview bidding war between CNN's Larry King , who 's had seven wives and almost as many heart attacks , and ABC's George Stephanopoulos , who has n't .

Attorney General Michael
Mukasey thinks there 's no need for pardons for government lawyers who approved President Bush 's wiretapping and torture programs , but powerful House lawmakers chastised his remarks , saying the nation 's top lawyer should n't be prejudging investigations .
Mukasey told reporters on Wednesday that there 's no indication lawyers approving counterterrorism efforts skirted their duty to uphold the law or operated in bad faith .
“ In those circumstances , there is no occasion to consider prosecution , and there is no occasion to consider pardon , ” Mukasey said , according to The New York Times .
On Thursday , powerful Democrats Jerrold Nadler and John Conyers wrote the attorney general , asking him to explain his conclusions in light of multiple ongoing investigations into both programs .
The duo invited him to retract his comments .
Michigan 's Conyers heads the powerful Judiciary committee , while New York 's Nadler runs a subcommittee on the Constitution .
The spat highlights a looming question for President Bush : Should he give preemptive pardons to government employees who could be prosecuted for torture or illegal wiretapping or do such pardons equate an admission of guilt ?
Nadler and Conyers ' letter
(.pdf ) telegraphs that their interest in lifting the veil of secrecy on the Administration 's conduct in the so - called " War on Terror " is not going to be completely sidelined by the nation 's economic crisis .
Prior to the fall 's economic calamity , many civil libertarians hoped that investigations and new privacy protections would be high on
President - elect Barack Obama 's agenda .
In the letter , the lawmakers point to the wiretapping showdown at the bedside of then - Attorney General John Ashcroft , when top White
House officials tried to browbeat a sick man into approving a wiretapping program that Justice Department lawyers had found to be illegal .
The much discussed effort by then White
House counsel Alberto Gonzales and other to circumvent Mr. Comey ’s authority as Acting Attorney General by confronting John Ashcroft in his hospital bed also indicates serious ethical and legal disagreement within the Department and the Administration on these matters , and leaves room for an ultimate conclusion that some individuals may well have understood that they were circumventing legal or ethical requirements .
Current investigations into the wiretapping program include one that is examining whether the lawyers acted ethically , a Justice Department inspector general inquiry into whether Gonzales lied to Congress about the wiretap program , and a congressionally mandated joint investigation into the program by the inspectors general at the nation 's intelligence agencies .

While England is very soon to begin the interesting experiment of sending people to jail for possession of dangerous pictures , the Scottish Government is only just getting its act together on the subject .
Not to be outdone , their proposed new Law goes significantly further than the English one , creating the very real possibility that travellers could depart London with nothing but legal pictures on their laptop – and pull into Edinburgh Waverley facing arrest for their hard - drive smut .
Meanwhile , as protesters against the Law collide with over - zealous Scottish filtering , a senior Scottish politician - no less than Conservative MSP Bill Aitken , the convener of the Justice Committee - has expressed doubts about the proposed legislation .
Let ’s start with the Scottish proposal .
The English Law criminalises the possession of material that depicts various sexual acts – in essence , those of an extreme and violent nature .
As that law has moved on to the statute books , the pro-censorship lobby have regularly expressed surprise to discover that the depiction of rape is not explicitly included .
In fact , this is not quite the omission it is made out to be .
In order to demonstrate that the crime of rape took place , prosecution must show that the perpetrator lacked a reasonable belief that consent was present .
Recent amendments to the law have made it easier to argue the absence of reasonable belief from the facts of a case – such as where the victim was asleep or drugged .
In general , though , it would be very difficult to prove the state of mind of a perpetrator on the basis of a picture or even a set of pictures .
Of course , in many cases where the sex act is accompanied by violence , it is arguable that the English Law would already apply .
This , however , is not good enough for the Scots , who have proposed that their new legislation will include " rape and other non-consensual penetrative sexual activity , whether violent or otherwise " .
The Scottish proposal also includes a far milder test for " extreme " violence .
The mind boggles !
This has either not been thought through – or is targeted at video depictions of the crime .
If the latter , then unless the Scottish legislation includes an exemption for mainstream film , similar to those in the English Law , then they could soon be on a collision course with the British Board of Film Classification , which tends not to draw the line at rape .
For a country that is seen by many as much more puritan than its southern neighbour , Scotland appears capable of having a debate on the issue that is already far more grown - up and wide - ranging than took place in England .
A significant article in the Scotsman set out the proposals in detail , and carried arguments for and against the Law .
This included comment from Clare McGlynn , Professor of Law at Durham University ( pro ) and Becky Dwyer , Spokeswoman for Consenting Adult Action Network , Scotland ( anti ) .
More significant were the concerns of Conservative MSP Bill Aitken over how the proposed new law might work .
Pointing out that Shakespeare was just one dramatist well - known for the creation of violent imagery , he said : " While I would prefer that they were not too explicit , any proposal to make the watching of such scenes illegal could be seen as an attack on artistic freedom and an illiberal move . "
Aitken ’s comments are important , because , as convener of the Justice Committee , he will be directly involved in scrutinising the Criminal Justice and Licensing Bill , which contains these proposals , once it has been published .
Another unlikely bedfellow in the alliance against this legislation is the right - wing Freedom Association .
They criticised the law for setting a dangerous precedent , in turn , drawing rebuttal from the government , that " there is already a definition over what extreme pornography is " in Scottish Law .
If this reflects the Government ’s intent , then it is likely to introduce yet further confusion into the picture , as that definition is not the same as the definition now used in the English Act .
Meanwhile , leading Scottish QC Paul McBride weighed in .
He said : " There 's a danger that a huge number of people who watch normal adult pornography may end up as convicted sex offenders . "
While high profile objectors have been getting their message across , those wishing to join the debate have been finding it more difficult .
When Becky Dwyer attempted to send her response to the consultation on the matter , she found her email initially blocked by filtering software that took exception to the word " pornography " .
Much the same happened with the initial consultation three years ago , which suggests that the Scottish Government ’s IT is slow to learn .
Meanwhile , a CAAN supporter who attempted to back up a comment on the Scotsman article with our favourite picture ( NSFW ) of the Satanic Sluts found their post was blocked .
The Scotsman ’s automated moderators do n’t like " sluts " .
We asked our own government ’s tireless regulators what might be bounced by their software .
The Home Office responded with a po-faced " We do not discuss our IT security systems . "
However , the Cabinet Office were far more forthcoming .
They owned up to using Blue Coat with a Websense plug - in to filter websites , " mostly for porn , gambling , and anything else considered inappropriate " .
Email is scanned with MessageLabs software , with checks run for images , spam and viruses - but not bad language .
They added : " Sending death threats wo n't automatically lead to a knock on the door from the police , but procedures exist to report threatening emails as appropriate , so it 's probably best not to risk it . " ®
January 29 , 2009 Eugene , Oregon - 14,000 years ago , the last Ice Age was ending at the close of the Pleistocene .
The Earth was warming up , forests began to grow back and large animals such as the Irish Elk and the Woolly Mammoth flourished in Europe and North America .
In fact , temperatures were even warmer than they are today .
North America was teeming with very large animals such as giant sloths , American lions and camels , saber - toothed tigers , mammoths and mastodons .

When Barack Obama took to the stage on election night , he was careful to court the dog lovers of the world by telling them he'd be buying his daughters a puppy .
What he neglected to mention was the gift that he'd be giving his wife , Michelle .
How , you might well have wondered , does a President - elect reward his first lady for putting up with two years of non-stop campaigning , and at least another four in the White House ?
Well , now we know : he does it with a £ 20,000 piece of jewellery , crafted from the world 's most expensive metal : rhodium .
Rhodium ?
The " Harmony " ring that Obama has ordered for his wife has been designed by the A - list Italian jewellery designer Giovanni Bosco , who 's now busy knocking the thing into shape and encrusting it with diamonds before Inauguration Day rolls around on 20 January .
Even dearer than those diamonds , however , will be the rhodium ring itself .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A hard metal from the platinum family , rhodium is mostly mined in South Africa and Russia , though only 25 tons of the stuff are extracted each year , most of which is put to work in aircraft spark plugs , precision optical instruments , LCD television screens and catalytic converters .
Its typical worth is around £ 5,000 per ounce , hence the ring 's estimated £ 20,000 price tag .
Historically , when silver , gold and platinum simply did n't say " I love you " , " Congratulations " , or " I 'm loaded " loud enough , rhodium has done the trick .
Used in the world 's most expensive pens and , indeed , to plate the Queen 's crown jewels , rhodium was also the only metal sufficient to mark Paul McCartney 's lifelong contribution to music .
In 1979 , the former Beatle was awarded a rhodium - plated disc by GuinnessWorld Records for being the bestselling songwriter and recording artist of all time .
The Harmony ring , which Bosco 's spokespeople call the company 's " top of the range piece " , is so sumptuous that even the jeweller will not disclose its true cost .
President - elect Obama 's tastes are relatively restrained – he wears a functional watch , a simple wedding ring and sleek but unremarkable suits .
His wife 's sartorial success on the campaign trail was n't achieved by spending big .
In fact , her outfits are a solid mix of designer and off - the - rack , many found not on Fifth Avenue , but online at Jcrew.com .
Not for Michelle the $ 70,000 outfits of Cindy McCain , nor the $ 150,000 shopping bills of Sarah Palin .
On the other hand , the First - Lady - in - waiting is not averse to a bit of bling , and has frequently been compared to that other White House style icon , Jackie Kennedy , whose jewellery continues to inspire knock - off collections to this day .
( Fancy the look of a Jacqueline Kennedy Wedding Bracelet featuring 18 Simulated Pearls , 25 Swarovski Crystals and platinum plating ?
That 'll be $ 99 , thank you very much ) .
Michelle has occasionally invoked the style of Jackie with a string of faux pearls , made her distinctive brooches a staple of her public appearances and , on election night , complemented her controversial Narciso Rodriguez dress with diamond drop earrings and glittering silver bangles .
The rhodium ring , a gift truly fit for a First Lady , will make an impressive addition to her jewellery box .

Nick Clegg , lend us your ear
Some PR advice for Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg : when describing your faith , do n't fudge with " I am not an active believer " , having previously replied to the unambiguous question , " Do you believe in God ? " , with the single word " No " .
Avoid discussing your personal life on the record with Piers Morgan .
When asked how many sexual partners you have had – now , that 's the time to deploy ambiguity .
Do not say : " No more than 30 . "
And when slagging off your front - bench team ( " He 's a problem .
I ca n't stand the man " ) , avoid doing so on a Flybe budget airline flight from London to Inverness .

He has been off radar for four years , but the real Slim Shady is back .
Having suffered the fatal shooting of his best friend , written his memoirs , battled against sleeping - pill addiction and piled on the pounds after rehab , US rapper Eminem is due to return with a new album in January .
Relapse – his first since Encore in 2004 – will feature the second part to his hit " Stan " , plus collaborations with hip - hop heavyweights Dr Dre and 50 Cent .
His producer , Swizz Beatz , has hailed " Stan 2 " as " genius " .
Perhaps it 's thanks to the macrobiotic diet Marshall Bruce Mathers III ( Eminem 's real name ) is rumoured to have adopted ...

The land where they really kill for a bargain
If you were n't already aware of the apocalyptically bad downside to capitalism , check out this cheery news .
Bargain - hunters in America have become so frenzied in their quest to pick up cut - price gifts in the run-up to Christmas that they have started murdering each other .
Two men died in a Toys ' R ' Us in Palm Desert , 120 miles east of Los Angeles , last Friday , the day after Thanksgiving , known as " Black Friday " .
It is one of the busiest shopping days of the year in the US , so called because it is when American retailers ' profits move into " the black " .
The fracas happened after two women began scrapping and Juan Meza , 28 , who was with one of them , pulled a gun .
Alejandro Moreno , 39 , then produced his own weapon and chased Meza .
The two men exchanged fire and their bodies were found near the front of the store .
The same day , a Long Island Wal - Mart employee was crushed to death by a stampeding crowd that surged in at 5 am , eager to pick up bargains .
Wal - Mart had erected barricades and brought in extra security , but to no avail .
" Despite all of our precautions , this unfortunate event occurred , " said a Wal - Mart spokesman , with magnificent understatement .
The end is indeed nigh .

If you have quit drinking but are still struggling with the negative and destructive attitudes and feelings you did during active addiction , you may be dealing with what 's called dry drunk syndrome .
Originally coined by the creators of Alcoholic Anonymous , dry drunk syndrome can have a negative impact on the process of giving up drinking both physically and mentally .﻿﻿
While dry drunk syndrome is most common among people who quit alcohol without the support of addiction professionals , anyone can become a dry drunk , especially during the emotionally charged first year of sobriety .
Learning the symptoms of dry drunk syndrome as well as a few strategies to better cope can help you or someone you love to move past this stumbling block toward lasting recovery .
What It Looks and Feels Like
Dry drunk syndrome is part of the phenomenon known as post- acute withdrawal syndrome ( PAWS ) .
When a heavy drinker quits drinking , his brain must adjust to the chemical damage that alcohol has caused .
This process can last for weeks , months , sometimes even years .﻿﻿
Symptoms of PAWS include dizziness , slow reflexes , and problems with balance and coordination .﻿﻿
A person dealing with side effects of PAWS actually may look like he 's intoxicated even though he 's been totally abstinent ( which explains where the term " dry drunk " may come from ) .
Emotionally , a person dealing with PAWS may have mood swings and become depressed , making him tough to be around — maybe even as unpleasant as he might have been when he was drinking .
Alcohol used to provide temporary relief from such feelings , but you can't rely on that anymore .
Symptoms
Dry drunk syndrome does n't happen overnight .
Instead , the following symptoms can develop slowly over time , especially during the first year of recovery .
Self - centered or superior attitude ( in 12 - step circles , this is known as " terminal uniqueness )
Poor impulse control
Sour , impatient , or complacent in your recovery
Anger and negativity about recovery
Resentment toward loved ones
Isolating yourself from your support network
Increasing anxiety and depression
Fear of relapse
Jealousy of sober friends or those not dealing with addiction
Romanticizing of drinking days
Cross-addiction or abuse of other behavioral addictions ( sex , food , internet use ) ﻿ ﻿
Coping With Dry Drunk Syndrome
Recovery from an alcohol use disorder means more than quitting alcohol .
Even after you no longer crave alcohol , you need to deal with the psychological and behavioral issues that contributed to your addiction in order to prevent relapse .
You may still be dealing with the stages of denial , anger , bargaining , and depression before finally reaching the point of accepting the absence of alcohol in your life .
Some people truly experience sobriety as a kind of death and have to accept the loss and learn and grow from the experience before they can move on .
Dry drunk syndrome interferes with this process and , although challenging , with the right support , it 's not insurmountable .
You may greatly benefit from the encouragement you can find at a support group meeting like Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA ) .
You can also contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA ) National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP
( 4357 ) for referrals for treatment and support groups .﻿﻿
There are also a few steps you can take on your own to start enjoying your new sober life as you work toward lasting recovery .
They may seem simple and unsurprising , but they do work for many people .
Find a Hobby
Take up gardening , start collecting an item you 're truly interested in or fascinated by , learn how to build things and focus on the creative project .
The goal is to fill the time you once spent drinking with activities that are enjoyable and engrossing .
Get Healthy
There 's no question years of drinking can take a toll on the body .
A big part of recovery and your new sober life is making your physical health a priority .
Try healthful recipes , join a gym , take up a sport , try yoga ( which can have mental benefits as well as physical ones ) .
If you love dogs and do n't have one , this is a great time to adopt a stray or volunteer to walk dogs at your local shelter .
Try Something New
Now that you 're no longer drinking , you have a chance to embrace your sober life and redefine your passions .
Now is the time to pursue those things you 've always wanted to learn .
Audit a class at a local university or college , or commit to reading every book you can get your hands on about a topic you 're interested in .
Lean on Your Loved Ones
No one expects you to recover from an alcohol use disorder alone — nor should you .
Even the people who you alienated before you quit drinking may welcome the opportunity to spend time with you .
Ask your partner out for regular date nights , get more involved with your grandkids , find fun activities to do with friends that do n't involve drinking .
A Word From Verywell
The best way to prevent and / or cope with the physical and mental symptoms of dry drunk syndrome is to stay steadfast in your recovery .
Now is n't the time to isolate yourself or become complacent in your sobriety , but to surround yourself with family , friends , and professionals who can support you as you work to build a sober and fulfilling life for yourself .

I graduated a few months ago from The Evergreen State College in Olympia , Washington with a B.A. degree emphasizing environmental policy .
My studies in college pertained to social and political solutions to environmental problems , particularly global warming .
I was part of a group that documented our school ’s entire carbon footprint , which is , to my knowledge , the most comprehensive study of a college campus ’s footprint to date .
I then produced a nearly carbon - free economic policy for Washington ’s Thurston County before concluding my studies with a mix of energy policy , political ecology and sustainable business courses.[ social_buttons ]
But I had no idea what to do after I graduated .
News about the burgeoning green economy made me think that my education and skills would be put to best use in the green business sector , but I was not certain .
I decided to travel for a couple months to clear my mind and perhaps find a job somewhere along the way .
I left Olympia the day after my classes wrapped up .
I stopped early on in Denver for the Democratic National Convention protests .
Despite my somewhat radical leanings , I found myself having mixed feelings on the effectiveness of the protests and the purpose behind the actions .
While out on the streets , I spoke to the media on several occasions about my internal conflicts about the protests .
However , being at the convention protests did reenergize my faith in taking direct and indirect action against injustice .
After playing it calm during the DNC , I decided to be a more active participant at the Republican National Convention the following week .
At that convention I was arrested for “ unlawful use of public property , ” a gross misdemeanor with a maximum ( though unlikely ) penalty of one year in prison .
After those intense weeks of protest and traveling , I arbitrarily decided to stay in Chicago and began looking for jobs .
The idea of getting into “ green capitalism ” was made sour by weeks of radical action paired with the economy sinking deeper by the day .
So instead , I ’ve decided to look for a job in the non-profit sector .
I ’ve barely got my feet off the ground in this job search , but I ’ve already realized that I am sorely lacking in on - the - job experience .
So , for my first …
Green Job Search Tip of the Week :
Take at least one internship position in college !
Do n’t let uncertainty about your career path get in your way .
I was unsure whether I wanted to be in political work or green business , and so I interned with neither sector .
A nonprofit internship would still have boosted an eco-entrepreneur resume , and vise versa .
There is absolutely no way that taking an internship for college credit in even a semi-related field would not seriously help your job prospects .
I plan to publish weekly updates on my quest for a green job here on Planetsave , so remember to check back every Tuesday .
And of course , best of luck to anyone else out there looking for a green job .
The word “ redeem ” means “ buy back . ”
It is used in Christian theology to describe what Jesus did for mankind in general ( common grace ) and individuals ( special grace ) .
It was used during the era of the gold standard to describe the right of a holder of paper money to redeem this money for gold coins at a fixed price .
The debt of the United States government is now beyond redemption .
The only way for this debt to be redeemed officially is through mass inflation .
If this is the way of redemption , then the economy is beyond redemption .
There will be a great default .
The question is when , not if .
SLIDING DOWN LAFFER’S CURVE
Arthur Laffer is famous for his famous curve , which shows that tax revenues rise when tax rates are cut . . . if the tax rates are too high .
He and I disagree on tax policy .
He prefers taxes to be cut until government revenues are maximized .
I advocate even further reductions until taxes are barely a factor in the economy — “ not worth talking about , ” as they say .
He made his reputation with the top half of the Laffer curve .
Nobody ever talks about the bottom half , where tax revenues fall .
That would be politically incorrect .
As for me , I like sliding down the bottom half .
When it comes to tax cuts , I am a “ slippery slope ” guy .
I just ca n’t get enough of them .
He and I first met at a conference sponsored by Pepperdine University in 1975 .
It was on taxes and economic growth .
It was in the middle of the terrible ‘ seventies .
Inflation was rising , people were being pushed into higher income tax brackets , there were large Federal deficits , and there was a major recession in progress .
Here we go again !
He is an effective communicator .
I know this because of a shared experience we each had ( and probably no one else ) over two decades ago .
As far as I know , we are the only two economists ever invited to speak to the assembled junior and senior classes at Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach , California .
We did this separately .
Keeping 1,000 highschoolers awake for 45 minutes is no easy task .
Neither is avoiding the low rumble of bored teenagers .
It was the toughest speech I ever had to deliver .
Recently , Dr. Laffer published an article in the Wall Street Journal .
It had a shocking title : “ The Age of Prosperity Is Over . ”
It is a summary of his latest book , The End of Prosperity .
Dr. Laffer is a good marketer .
He knows that to put “ The End of ” in a book title will sell more copies than “ The Slowdown of ” or “ Really Bad News for . ”
We both appreciate the power of an attention - grabbing headline .
But it ’s not good to be grabbed by it two or three years later , when conditions have changed and the headline looks silly .
Is his headline an exaggeration ?
Yes .
This is not the end of prosperity .
It is surely the beginning of the end of many of the false dreams associated with Greenspan ’s era of continual monetary expansion .
It is also Keynesianism ’s last stand .
WINNERS AND LOSERS
He begins with a premise — one that is not shared by Wall Street , Congress , or Presidents .
Financial panics , if left alone , rarely cause much damage to the real economy , output , employment or production .
Asset values fall sharply and wipe out those who borrowed and lent too much , thereby redistributing wealth from the foolish to the prudent .
Every system of economics has a system of wealth redistribution .
The questions are : “ Who wins ?
Who loses ?
Why ? ”
We now know who wins .
Most obviously , financial industry CEO ’s who milked the system during the boom .
They had their firms borrow short , lend long , and make a fortune in commissions .
Then they took their bonuses for five years and then were fired with multi-million - dollar severance packages .
Others who are winning big are bankers whose banks got loans and capital injections from the government and the Federal Reserve System .
They are buying up smaller , underfunded banks that have gone bust .
The FDIC absorbs the losses , and the large banks gobble up the assets at pennies on the dollar .
Think “ J. P. Morgan / Washington Mutual . ” Think “ Wells Fargo / Wachovia . ”
Who loses ?
Officially , taxpayers .
But for how long ?
Not indefinitely .
Not alone .
In the textbook world , where governments are restrained , the following is true .
Good decisions should be rewarded and bad decisions should be punished .
The market does just that with its profits and losses .
It is not true for the biggest of the New York City banks .
It has not been ever since 1914 , when the Federal Reserve started operations .
Since that time , the dollar has depreciated by 95 % .
There is a pattern here .
In today ’s bailout economy , the textbook account of profit and loss do not apply , he says .
Now enter the government and the prospects of a kinder and gentler economy .
To alleviate the obvious hardships to both homeowners and banks , the government commits to buy mortgages and injects capital into banks , which on the face of it seems like a very nice thing to do .
But unfortunately in this world there is no tooth fairy .
And the government does n’t create anything ; it just redistributes .
Whenever the government bails someone out of trouble , they always put someone into trouble , plus of course a toll for the troll .
Every $ 100 billion in bailout requires at least $ 130 billion in taxes , where the $ 30 billion extra is the cost of getting government involved .
He is sensitive to high marginal tax rates and regulation .
He is also sensitive to deficits as sources of future tax increases .
He is much less sensitive to Federal Reserve monetary inflation .
But that is a different issue , for a different article .
He sees what is coming : a Federal government power - grab on an unprecedented scale in the post — World War II era .
Its visible symbol is the increase in the Federal deficit .
Just 14 months ago , the official projection for 2008 was 0.6 % of GDP .
( Anyone who believed that forecast was dangerously naïve . )
It has turned out to be 3.2 % .
It is headed in fiscal 2009 toward 3.8 %
The net national debt in 2001 was at a 20 - year low of about 35 % of GDP , and today it stands at 50 % of GDP .
But this 50 % number makes no allowance for anything resulting from the over $ 5.2 trillion guarantee of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac assets , or the $ 700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) .
Nor does the 50 % number include any of the asset swaps done by the Federal Reserve when they bailed out Bear Stearns , AIG and others .
Now there is talk of another $ 300 billion stimulus package early next year .
There is no more restraint on spending .
THE STOCK MARKET
He sees the stock market as a forecasting tool .
The increase in government spending will have negative effects in the real economy , contrary to Keynesians .
It will retard economic growth .
He recounts the experience of the 1970’s .
First Nixon , then Ford , then Carter ran large deficits .
It was a bad era for stocks .
The consequences of these actions were disastrous .
Just look at the stock market from the post - Kennedy high in early 1966 to the pre-Reagan low in August of 1982 .
The average annual real return for U.S. assets compounded annually was — 6 % per year for 16 years .
That , ladies and gentlemen , is a bear market .
And it is something that you may well experience again .
Yikes !
He adds that this Bush Administration was bad — a true disaster .
Twenty - five years down the line , what this administration and Congress have done will be viewed in much the same light as what Herbert Hoover did in the years 1929 through 1932 .
Whenever people make decisions when they are panicked , the consequences are rarely pretty .
We are now witnessing the end of prosperity .
Laffer reminds us that “ bad economics will sink any economy no matter how much they believe this time things are different .
They are n’t . ”
Bad economics have escalated since September 7 , when Secretary of the Treasury Paulson nationalized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a Sunday .
The precedent has been set .
It will escalate for the next four years .
PASSING THE LOSSES TO OTHERS
The game of politics has always been two - fold : ( 1 ) to redirect tax revenues and power to your group ; ( 2 ) to pass costs to other groups .
This will never change .
We have seen how losses have been passed on to taxpayers .
Anyway that is where politicians assume .
But I am not so sure .
Losses will also be passed along to holders of U.S. government debt .
How ?
Through rising interest rates , which push down the market price of government bonds .
Through increasing prices , which are the result of monetary expansion .
Through cutting off Medicare and Social Security benefits by raising the retirement age and cutting payouts .
Once the on - budget , official debt increases , the pool of IOUs does not distinguish one debt from another .
Supposedly , the Treasury could make a profit on the bailout .
Taxpayers will not see a dime in refunds .
The Treasury will spend every dime of profit , and then borrow a dime more against future earnings .
The grand game of politics in the next Administration will be to redirect the flow of funds to new constituencies .
But there are limited funds at stake .
Most of the money is already spoken for .
Existing programs will absorb all of the revenue and then some .
New programs will have to be funded by increased debt .
The grand game of the Administration elected in 2012 will be to avoid the bills that will be coming due .
That will be the grand game of every Administration thereafter .
CONCLUSION
I do not think we are facing the end of prosperity .
We are facing a recession .
The dreams of millions of Americans will be smashed in this recession .
A big smashed dream is retirement in comfort .
That one is statistically doomed .
But it always has been .
It was a fantasy dream .
It has been exposed as a dream for those few Americans who have vested pensions .
The majority have always relied on the promise of Social Security , which was a statistical fraud from day one .
Over the past 200 years , the American economy has grown at 2 % per year on average , despite wars , recessions , boondoggles , and politicians .
I think this will not change .
But there will be a hiatus for a few years .
Millions of people whose dreams rested on faith in 7 % economic growth per annum will come to naught .
Reality will intrude .
Be ready for this intrusion .

The Nikkei Index has rallied sharply this week ( although it was down today ) .
But it ’s still near its twenty - five - year low , and , in nominal terms , its value is less than a fourth of what it was in 1989 , at the peak of Japan ’s stock - market bubble .
In the last couple of weeks , both Felix Salmon and Matt Yglesias have suggested that Japan ’s experience should make us reconsider the assumption that stocks are a good investment because they go up in value over the long run .
More specifically , Felix argues that Japan ’s experience should make U.S.investors wary of buying stocks now ( well , he was writing on October 17th , when the S. & P. 500 was ten per cent cheaper , but presumably he ’d say his argument is even more applicable now , after stocks have jumped a bit ) because “ the lesson of Japan is that even cheap stocks can continue to decline for decades . ”
Actually , that ’s not the lesson of Japan .
The lesson of Japan is that a country ’s stock market is not going to rise over time if , over time , its companies fail to create economic value for their shareholders .
Felix says that “ Japanese companies are well - run . ”
But , in fact , they ’re not well run , at least by the standards that are relevant to shareholders — return on equity , profitability , growth , and managing cash flow in a shareholder - friendly way .
By these standards , Japanese companies have historically been run badly , and while they ’ve improved some in recent years , they ’re still far behind American firms on all of these metrics .
In the 1990s , the average return on equity for the Nikkei was around four per cent , and in the second half of that decade and into the early years of this one it fell below two per cent .
( In the U.S. , the average R.O.E. is closer to eleven to twelve per cent . )
According to this report , between 1998 and 2003 , of all large - cap Japanese companies , only eight had an R.O.E. above ten per cent , which is a completely ordinary performance by U.S. standards .
And even now , Japan ’s average R.O.E. is by far the lowest of any major economy .
What this means is that for much of the past two decades , Japanese companies have been destroying economic value for shareholders , using far more capital than they ’re generating .
Japanese firms ’ profit growth is also well below what American companies would consider acceptable .
And on softer metrics , too , Japanese companies do n’t look like good investments : they ’re still concentrated in capital - intensive industries , and are surprisingly weak in industries where immense profits can be reaped after small investments , like , most notably , software .
Obviously , there are important exceptions — companies like Nintendo , Toyota , and Honda ( although even the latter two require tremendous amounts of capital to keep growing ) .
But they really do prove the rule .
None of this is too surprising — historically , Japanese companies have been disdainful of the idea of shareholder value and of traditional profit metrics .
In 1998 , the chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries famously said , “ I openly brag that I do n’t cater to shareholders , ” and , even more amazingly , “ We do n’t give a hoot about things like return on equity . ”
In part , this is because companies ’ heavy reliance on debt financing and interlocking relationships meant that they felt they did n’t need shareholders .
It ’s also because many companies saw themselves as fulfilling a social role .
In any case , the consequence was that Japanese companies tended to spend money in ways that were beneficial for managers and employees , not shareholders .
( Dividend yields in Japan have finally started to climb some , but as of 2006 , they were just 0.85 per cent , because the idea of returning cash to shareholders was not something Japanese executives thought was important . )
You can , if you ’d like , argue that having companies reject the idea of shareholder value is not a bad thing from the perspective of society .
But it ’s undeniably a bad thing from the perspective of investors .
And this is n’t even to mention the effects of the massive debt overhang from their real - estate bubble , the effect of deflation ( which is a bad environment in which to own stocks ) , and so on .
What the experience of Japan teaches us , in other words , is that when companies are not profitable ( in an economic sense ) , their stocks will not go up .
It also teaches us that bubbles exist , and they can lead to assets being crazily overvalued .
But unless you think that we are still in a stock - market bubble ( which is pretty much an impossible case to make ) , or unless you think that , over the next fifteen years , U.S. companies are going to earn historically low returns on equity , have historically low rates of profitability and profit growth , and are going to stop caring about shareholder value , then the Japanese experience is not in any way a reason to be skeptical about buying American stocks now .
NOVEMBER 13--Michael
Vick , who now earns 12 cents an hour for prison work , has just filed detailed reports and ledgers showing how his financial condition imploded in tandem with his football career .
Vick , who declared bankruptcy in July , yesterday filed a statement of financial affairs charting how he spent $ 17.7 million in the two years preceding his Chapter 11 petition ( keep in mind , of course , that he has been imprisoned since November 2007 ) .
The two - page statement lists the former football star 's payments to lawyers , relatives , and the mothers of his children .
Lousy investments , security , cars , a boat , $ 3.5 million in ' miscellaneous ' transfers , and $ 1.1 million in checks made out to ' Cash ' are also memorialized in the ledger .
One indication of Vick's , um , unorthodox financial controls can be found in the recording of a $ 1000 check cut to his mother Brenda Boddie in October 2006 .
At the time , Vick gave a brief description of the payment : ' chump change . '
Vick's U.S. District Court filings also included a list of the nine cars he owns : a $ 73,000 Land Rover is driven by his fiancee , the woman 's mother uses a 2007 Cadillac Escalade , and Vick 's brother Marcus drives a 2007 Land Rover .
A 2007 Infinity is even kept in Leavenworth , Kansas -- where Vick is imprisoned -- for use by his fiancee , Kijafa Frink , when she visits the federal lockup .
The court records also describe Vick 's financial interest in about five horses .
But considering that the ex-quarterback is behind bars for dog fighting and knew that his cronies killed underperforming pit bulls , Vick might have offered a more assuring statement on the well - being of the horses than , ' Upon information and belief , these horses are being fed and cared for by an individual , unknown to the Debtor , who is not being paid or compensated for his services . '

Tony Blair , the Middle East envoy , reckons that a ceasefire in Gaza could be negotiated very soon , provided that the tunnels from Egypt that provide the territory with , among other things , smuggled weapons , are closed off .
It 's a shame that he did not express his ambitions in another way .
Perhaps a ceasefire could be negotiated very soon if legitimate channels for the import of all goods except arms into Gaza were opened up .
Such a suggestion , however , might be seen as critical of Israel 's own perceived position as a reluctant aggressor and defensive state .
The international community has completely accepted Israel 's justification for its attack on Gaza , so much so that all of its spokespeople are careful not to refer to any Israeli action that can be viewed as provocative , such as its suffocating 18 - month long blockade on that tiny , overpopulated strip of land .
Supporters of Israel 's action are fond of reiterating Israel 's narrow justification for its action .
Who else would put up with regular rocket attacks from a neighbour , it asks ?
No one suggests that they would be happy to .
It is accepted that Israel has the right to defend itself , and so it should be .
Yet few would acquiesce without protest to a swingeing two - year blockade by a neighbour either , though no Western leader ever seems seriously to ask that highly pertinent question .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
On the contrary , Blair implies that in order to obtain a ceasefire , Gaza 's Hamas leadership must prove itself willing to comply proactively with the blockade against it , as well as refraining from actually firing weapons .
Yet Hamas does not only import arms through Egypt 's tunnels .
It also imports everything from livestock to medical supplies – about 90 per cent of all goods entering the area .
Politically Hamas is popular not only because of its refusal to abandon armed struggle and accept the state of Israel , but also because it organises social support more efficiently than other groups .
Even during the siege it has found some ways to mitigate the effects of Israeli policy on Gazans .
The blockade is viewed by many as " collective punishment " , because it exists to discomfort ordinary citizens and thereby undermine the ability of Hamas to govern .
The idea of the blockade was to turn Palestinians away from the group that it had democratically elected .
Yet Blair 's peace plan considers that the blockade should be extended , with the ability of the Israelis to control the flow of goods into Gaza further strengthened .
So the long - standing humanitarian crisis that is the result of the blockade would actually be augmented in order that the more extreme and immediate horror of warfare could be curtailed .
Increasingly , the international community concerns itself mainly with crisis management in Israel - Palestine , and this plan of Blair 's is a perfect example .
Being seen as one of the brokers of a ceasefire is a fine thing .
But a willingness to accept and refine a system that keeps 1.5 million people effectively imprisoned in order to achieve one , is not a strategy exactly guaranteed to foster long - term stability , or even hope .
The Israeli fight is against Hamas in general , not just Hamas rockets , and the attack and the blockade are intimately linked .
Certainly , the ideological position of Hamas is abhorrent , as is the organisation 's inability to comprehend the absurdity of its own propaganda .
Its leadership insists that Israel should view its rocket - fire as " symbolic " , and simply put up with it in order to preserve a fig - leaf of dignity for the Palestinians as " people of resistance " .
In believing this , Hamas acknowledges the importance of symbolism .
But it fails to understand that Israel cannot then accept what its rocket fire symbolises .
This , of course , is the impossible ambition that Hamas will not relinquish – the imposition of an Islamist state covering all of the Israeli and Palestinian territories .
Hamas wants Israel to accept that this is what Hamas wants , but to be relaxed about it , because all parties know it cannot be obtained ( at least for a while ) .
Herein lies the paradox of " disproportionality " .
Hamas refuses to stop fighting because this would be an acknowledgement that it cannot win against its far more powerful enemy .
Yet because it will not disengage from " symbolic " armed struggle , it offers Israel the international justification it needs in order to stay engaged , and with much more deadly effect .
Blair , elbow - deep as he is in the rhetoric of the " war on terror " , is as keen to isolate Gaza because of the ideological rhetoric of its leadership as the Israelis are .
His line is that a two - state solution can only be achieved if " Palestinian unity " is delivered first .
He would not , of course , approve of the sort of Palestinian unity that would be delivered were the Palestinians on the West Bank to vote Hamas as well .
Like Israel , he has a certain type of Palestinian unity in mind .
Yet in this respect he is making the same insane demand on Hamas as Hamas makes on Israel .
He wishes for Hamas - led Gaza to dissolve itself in order that his problem can be solved .
Blair , to his credit , understands at least that the present military action and the long - standing blockade are linked , even if he is wary of making any links that portray Israel as aggressive .
Yet he actually signs up to that aggression because he is interested only in challenging the blockade in ways that will damage Hamas .
He believes that a peace process cannot be pursued unless Gaza becomes more like the West Bank .
Yet one easy way of doing this would be to accord the same rights of governance to Hamas as are accorded to the Palestinian Authority , as long as a ceasefire is respected .
The blockade , therefore , has to be dismantled , except with regard to the import of weapons .
Under a ceasefire , there is simply no moral justification for the continued siege against Gaza , the cutting of its water supplies , its electricity , its medical aid , its fuel and its food .
Yet Israel continued to do this during the six - month ceasefire that Hamas delivered , because it wishes to disrupt the ability of Hamas to govern the Palestinians who voted for it , not just the ability of Hamas to fire its " symbolic " rockets .
It is unreasonable to attack Gaza because it does not respect a cease - fire that brings it no benefit , but only further pain .
It is unreasonable to undermine the democratic choices its people have made , because we do not approve of them .
It is unreasonable to sabotage Hamas in its social work as a region 's selected administrator , because we fear this may also burnish its popularity as an anti-Zionist group .
Yes , the rockets must stop .
But so must the siege .

Does n't mean you do n't want it
Update : As of December 10 , the bailout package approved by the U.S. House of Representatives ( but stalled with the Senate ) no longer contains provisions stipulating that U.S. automakers must drop their opposition to state greenhouse emissions standards .
Legislators took out this provision at the behest of the Bush administration .
If this provision does n’t get reintroduced into the bill by the Senate , automakers will continue their legal opposition to fuel economy increases beyond those already signed into law .
If California and joining states win the suit , these massive increases still could be possible .
In addition to the new CAFE national fuel - economy regulations mandating automakers achieve a fleet average of 35 mpg across all vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2020 , pending legislation in California would essentially impose even higher fuel - economy standards on vehicles sold in the state by restricting greenhouse - gas emissions .
The amount of carbon dioxide a vehicle emits is directly proportional to the fuel it consumes , meaning that a vehicle cannot reduce its CO2 emissions without increasing its fuel economy .
If passed , the proposed legislation would have a grave impact on the U.S. auto market .
It would essentially create two zones of sales in the U.S. : California ( and the other states adopting its standards ) , and the rest of the states .
Since a high percentage of the country 's sports cars are sold in California , it has been suggested that many exotic car companies — Ferrari , Lamborghini , and Porsche , for example — would simply withdraw from the U.S.
Other automakers could be forced to pull out of the restricted market in order to continue selling trucks and SUVs .
Even mid-size and large cars would be unable to meet the California standards without expensive alternative propulsion systems .
GM ’s own Chevrolet Volt would be one of the few cars that could meet California standards , but it likely will cost more than $ 40,000 , and it is a compact .
The legislation would artificially create stricter fuel - economy standards while the automakers are already struggling current federally mandated increases .
A consortium of automakers , including the Detroit Three , is suing California to block the legislation from being passed .
This lawsuit is now tangled up in the fight over the bridge loans needed by General Motors and Chrysler to ease them through their current financial crisis .
Senator Barbara Boxer ( D - California ) has inserted language into the " bailout " legislation that effectively prohibits General Motors , Chrysler LLC , and Ford from participating in the ongoing lawsuit .
Environmental groups also have been demanding the domestic carmakers drop the lawsuit in return for accepting public assistance .
The domestic carmakers , which desperately need the money , do n't have much option but to give in to the demands , says one Detroit - based public - relations consultant .
The negotiators for Detroit 's carmakers had even suggested at one point during the discussion a higher gasoline tax to help promote conservation , but were flatly told that that was a " non-starter , " according to one industry source familiar with the negotiations .
" When your backs are against the wall , you are focused on survival , " says Jason Vines , who over the years has headed the public relations effort at Nissan , Ford , and Chrysler .
Going forward , other carmakers will decide whether to pursue the lawsuit , Vines notes .
Kim Custer , spokesman for the Washington D.C. - based Association of International Automobile Manufacturers , says his association , which counts companies such as Toyota , BMW , and Volkswagen among its members , will continue to support the California litigation because it believes that the nation needs single fuel - economy standards .
California 's Greenhouse Gas Law , which has been copied by more than a dozen different states , has led to an unwieldy proliferation of regulations , he says .
" We think there has to be one standard , " he says .
Otherwise carmakers would wind up restricting sales of some vehicles in different states to meet the different regulations .

The year is 1983 and as an art school student me and my buds are convinced that the era we were in was a low point for animation — except for Anime !
Even though a generation has grown up loving He - Man we tested the dude , because his D&D routine was n’t half as cool as Star Blazers or Mobile Suit Gundam .
Looking back I still stand by my thesis of the lack of quality in Filmation productions , but now I can see how a generation of kids could look fondly back on this stuff .
The point of He - Man & The Masters Of The Universe was n’t to appeal to a broader audience on multiple levels — it was designed to it very specific demographic of boys .
There are some shows that manage to transcend their audience , be it Bugs Bunny cartoons or episodes of Pee Wee Herman — but He - Man never wanted to go there .
But I think half the pleasure of the show for the audience was the toys themselves :
So in a sense the animated series was only a back story for the interactive medium for the goodies that Mattel was producing .
In fact the commercial sort of proves my point looking back at it — the ability for Trap Jaw to fly in on a string and then change arms is much cooler than the G.I .
Joe action figures of an earlier era .
While Joe did have all sorts of accessories , he was very grounded in reality .
On the other hand He - Man is pushing the limits in terms of toy design :
In fact the other thing that I noticed watching this spot was that the Trap Jaw is much more interesting than He - Man himself — which is what a great villain should be !
The commercial emphasizes this by only showing poor He - Man at the end of the spot .
By the way you can tell how much the toys did inspire some kids — the model on the right side of the photo is a modern version of Trap Jaw aimed at elder fanboys .
What ’s amazing is how true the design is to the original toy well over twenty five years later .

OpenSolaris Coming to Toshiba Laptops -- Continuing a Trend
by Ostatic Staff - Dec. 18 , 2008

Slowly but surely , major laptop vendors are taking to the idea of shipping systems with pre-loaded open source operating systems .
The latest case in point is Toshiba - - one of the longest - standing players in the market for portable computers -- and its new plan to pre-install Sun Microsystems ' OpenSolaris on its laptops .
The machines are supposed to ship in early 2009 , and will join several new Linux - based systems that Dell is shipping , and many Linux - based netbooks arriving from various hardware manufacturers .
Will this trend continue ?
As I see it , a huge part of the trend toward open source operating systems on portable computers is extreme price - consciousness among buyers .
For only a little more than you pay for a Linux netbook , you can get a laptop with more hardware resources running Windows .
But the fact is , the machines running open source software are cheaper -- and cheaper is cheaper in this economic environment .
I 'm not so sure how popular laptops running OpenSolaris are going to be .
Sun has struggled to gain adoption for the operating system .
But one of the reasons Linux - based netbooks are selling so well is that they come pre-installed with lots of useful open source software applications .
That 's the key one - two punch in the eyes of the buyer : " I save money on the hardware running the open source operating system , and I pay no money for useful applications . "
Lenovo and other hardware manufacturers are n't buying into this trend as quickly as others , but as long as people stay so careful with their pennies , market share for portable computers running open source software is going to increase .
eWeek has some interesting corroboration of the trend , coming from IBM .
The next shoe that is likely to drop will be the availability of more offers like the Acer Aspire One netbooks now available at Radioshack for $ 99 .
These require you to sign a monthly broadband contract with AT&T for $ 60 a month , but the buy - in price for the hardware is low .
The Acers run Windows XP , but I wo n't be surprised to see Linux - based systems offered at rock - bottom prices with these types of contracts as well .
The country 's largest retail trade association asked President - elect Barack Obama Tuesday to add a series of sales tax - exempt shopping days to a coming economic stimulus package in an effort to revive consumer confidence and spur spending .
The National Retail Federation called for three periods of sales tax - free shopping that would last 10 days each in March , July and October 2009 .
The trade group estimates that it would save consumers about $ 20 billion , or $ 175 per family .

PLANS to buy 52 trains and 50 trams for Melbourne , as well as 20 trains for regional Victoria , will be unveiled today as John Brumby seeks to lay claim to the title of " the public transport Premier " .
The $ 4.2 billion buy - up of rolling stock will be accompanied by a promise to build Melbourne 's first metro-style underground suburban rail line — a 17 kilometre cross-city tunnel from Caulfield to Footscray via St Kilda Road and inner Melbourne — as well as a new surface rail line through the rapidly growing western suburbs and a long - awaited extension of the Epping line in the north .
Premier John Brumby will today outline plans for more than 70 new trains and 50 trams .

The Age believes the Government 's transport blueprint , to be revealed today , will involve nearly $ 40 billion of purchases and projects .
Mr Brumby will claim the plan will create tens of thousands of jobs and transform Victoria 's road network and public transport system into Australia 's best .

When you get down to scales of a billionth of a metre , even the simplest , best - known materials can take on surprising new properties .
Strength , adhesion and absorption can all be multiplied manyfold if you just find the right nanoscale structure .
And , in 2008 , many engineers did .
Tangled manganese - oxide nanowires were shaped into a kind of paper tissue that guzzles up oil spills without absorbing a drop of water .
While a different nano - textured pattern that can be applied to any fabric proved able to make cloth unwettable , even emerging dry after two months underwater ( see image , right ) .
A material that mimics nanostructures found on that marvel of stickiness – a gecko’s foot – is so successful it is up to 10 times as adhesive as the real thing .
See an image of the material side by side with a real gecko’s foot .
Energy answers
Novel nanotech ideas were also harnessed in the search for alternatives to existing energy sources in 2008 .
A novel mixture of gold - filled carbon nanotubes and lithium hydride proved capable of converting radiation directly into electricity and may provide a new way to power spacecraft with long missions .
Carbon nanotubes were also part of a plan to create a new kind of artificial photosynthesis .
The tubes act as a temporary store for electrons harvested from light by dye molecules , before the electrons are used to drive chemical reactions that remove CO 2 from the atmosphere .
It could even be possible to transform the greenhouse gas into fuel .
Turning to more established green technologies , the hunt for a better battery to unlock the potential of electric cars also depends on nanoscale advances , that pack more powerful chemistry into a smaller volume .
Electric appeal
Silicon chip designers have been venturing into the nanoscale for years – the latest chips have features as small as 45 nanometres .
But as silicon comes close to being unable to shrink further , nanocomponents could offer improved performance at similar scales .
A material called graphene – a sheet of carbon just a single atom thick – is one contender .
This year it was discovered to be capable of smashing the conductivity record for a material at room temperature , something that sets a speed limit on computation .
Borrowing one of nature ’s nanostructures – DNA fibres which measure just 2 nm across – to create a kind of tiny fibre - optic cable could provide a way to connect up the components of future computers that send data with light not electricity .
Safety controls
But nanotechnology is not just about neat new discoveries .
Just as when any exotic new class of materials comes along , the safety of nanomaterials must be assessed .
The extent to which we have already started releasing nanoparticles into the environment is essentially unknown , but the process is certainly under way .
The silver nanoparticles commonly added to clothing such as socks to kill off bacteria were found to easily leak into waste water during washing .
There are likely more findings like this to come .
Some everyday products like cleaners and sun cream already contain nanoparticles , and nanoscale structures are increasingly used in industry .
Lab - based investigations of the health effects of nanoparticles also produced worrying results .
One study found that mice that inhaled nanotubes suffered effects similar to those caused by asbestos .
Another showed that earthworms that eat nanotubes suffer a reduced reproductive rate .
Yet very few such studies have taken place , leading the UK ’s Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution to declare that “ urgent ” work is needed to asses the effects of nanoscale objects on health and the environment .
However , defaulting to a position of declaring all artificial nanostructures bad is not the answer .
Nature works on the nanoscale too , and as our editorial pointed out there ’s no reason to assume that man-made nanoparticles are automatically better or worse than the many natural ones .

Development -----------
If you 're interesting in contributing to the development of EMGM or just in playing with the code , there are some useful things to know .
### Source ###
The source can be checked out from its repository using [ Subversion ] .
svn checkout https://svn.cs.uu.nl:12443/repos/dgp-haskell/EMGM
You can also [ view the files online ] .
[ Subversion ] : http://subversion.tigris.org/
[ view the files online ] : https://svn.cs.uu.nl:12443/viewvc/dgp-haskell/EMGM/
### Requirements ###
In addition to the requirements for using the library , EMGM has the following requirements for development : * Cabal library 1.4.0.1 or later - This is preferred for uploading to HackageDB .
Some issues were encountered with the current flags setup in emgm.cabal that gave errors in an older version of Cabal .
* [ QuickCheck ] 2.1 - Required for testing .
* [ HUnit ]
1.2 - Required for testing .
[ Quick Check ] : http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/QuickCheck [ HUnit ] : http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HUnit ### Configuring ###
If you 've been changing many files or the `emgm.cabal` file , you should clean this distribution and build files .
runghc Setup.lhs clean
In order to test the library , configure it with the following options : runghc Setup.lhs configure - ftest - fnolib
This enables building the test executable ( while reducing the optimization level to speed up the build ) and disables building the library ( thus also speeding up the build ) .
`nolib` is optional in case you actually do want to build the library .
To enable program coverage , add the `hpc` flag .
This adds coverage only on the test executable , so the `test` flag is required .
runghc Setup.lhs configure - ftest - fnolib - fhpc ### Testing ###
After configuring with the `test` flag and building , you can run the test suite .
runghc Setup.lhs test
You will see some output from both QuickCheck and HUnit .
It should all work !
### Program coverage ###
If you have configured the library for HPC ( see above ) , then you can get the program coverage using the included script after running the test suite .
This uses the `hpc` command in your path and passes a number of flags excluding modules that should be ignored for coverage purposes .
Run the script from the top - level directory to see its usage .
runghc util / hpc.lhs
To get a simple report of the coverage , use the `report` option .
runghc util / hpc.lhs report
To get a set of HTML files with code coverage indications , use the `markup` option .
runghc util / hpc.lhs markup
At the end of this run , the command tells you where to find the HTML files .
In part 2 , I showed how to produce a part - of - speech tagger using Ngram tagging in combination with Affix and Regex tagging , with accuracy approaching 90 % .
In part 3 , I ’ll use the BrillTagger to get the accuracy up to and over 90 % .
Brill Tagging
The BrillTagger is different than the previous taggers .
For one , it ’s not a SequentialBackoffTagger , though it does use an initial tagger , which in our case will be the raubt_tagger from part 2 .
The BrillTagger uses the initial tagger to produce initial tags , then corrects those tags based on transformational rules .
These rules are learned by training with the FastBrillTaggerTrainer and rules templates .
Here ’s an example , with templates copied from the demo ( ) function in nltk.tag.brill.py .
Refer to part 1 for the backoff_tagger function and the train_sents , and part 2 for the word_patterns .
import nltk.tag from nltk.tag import brill raubt_tagger = backoff_tagger ( train_sents , [ nltk.tag .
AffixTagger , nltk.tag.UnigramTagger , nltk.tag.BigramTagger , nltk.tag.TrigramTagger ] , backoff=nltk.tag.RegexpTagger(word_patterns ) ) templates = [ brill .
SymmetricProximateTokensTemplate( brill.ProximateTagsRule , ( 1,1 ) ) , brill .
SymmetricProximateTokensTemplate( brill.ProximateTagsRule , ( 2,2 ) ) , brill .
SymmetricProximateTokensTemplate( brill.ProximateTagsRule , ( 1,2 ) ) , brill .
SymmetricProximateTokensTemplate( brill.ProximateTagsRule , ( 1,3 ) ) , brill .
SymmetricProximateTokensTemplate( brill.ProximateWordsRule , ( 1,1 ) ) , brill .
SymmetricProximateTokensTemplate( brill.ProximateWordsRule , ( 2,2 ) ) , brill .
SymmetricProximateTokensTemplate( brill.ProximateWordsRule , ( 1,2 ) ) , brill .
SymmetricProximateTokensTemplate( brill.ProximateWordsRule , ( 1,3 ) ) , brill .
ProximateTokensTemplate ( brill.ProximateTagsRule , ( - 1 , - 1 ) , ( 1,1 ) ) , brill .
ProximateTokensTemplate ( brill.ProximateWordsRule , ( - 1 , - 1 ) , ( 1,1 ) ) ] trainer = brill .
FastBrillTaggerTrainer( raubt_tagger , templates ) braubt_tagger = trainer.train ( train_sents , max_rules=100 , min_score=3 )
Brill Tagging Accuracy
So now we have a braubt_tagger .
You can tweak the max_rules and min_score params , but be careful , as increasing the values will exponentially increase the training time without significantly increasing accuracy .
In fact , I found that increasing the min_score tended to decrease the accuracy by a percent or 2 .
So here ’s how the braubt_tagger fares against the other taggers .
Conclusion
There ’s certainly more you can do for part - of - speech tagging with nltk , but the braubt_tagger should be good enough for many purposes .
The most important component of part - of - speech tagging is using the correct training data .
If you want your tagger to be accurate , you need to train it on a corpus similar to the text you ’ll be tagging .
The brown , conll2000 , and treebank corpora are what they are , and you should n’t assume that a tagger trained on them will be accurate on a different corpus .
For example , a tagger trained on one part of the brown corpus may be 90 % accurate on other parts of the brown corpus , but only 50 % accurate on the conll2000 corpus .
But a tagger trained on the conll2000 corpus will be accurate for the treebank corpus , and vice versa , because conll2000 and treebank are quite similar .
So make sure you choose your training data carefully .
GETTYSBURG , Pa. , Dec. 23 ( UPI ) --
Sports drinks with a carbohydrate - protein mix are better than carb - only drinks in aiding cyclists ' recovery from exercise , U.S. and Canadian researchers said .
John Berardi of Precision Nutrition weight - loss program worked with researchers from Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania and The University of Western Ontario to study which energy drinks are best at helping cyclists recover after a strenuous ride , BioMed Central , an open - access medical publisher that published the study , said Tuesday in a news release .

" Liquid carbohydrate and protein supplements given early during a six hour post - exercise recovery period helped subjects better maintain subsequent time trial performance and power output , compared to supplements with carbohydrate alone , " Berardi said .
In the study , cyclists rode exercise bikes that allowed them to compete against a virtual competitor .
After a morning session , they rested for six hours and given either the protein - carbohydrate sports drink or the carbohydrate - only version .
After their rest , the athletes did another virtual cycle race .
While both groups showed a reduced performance level in the afternoon session , the cyclists who drank the protein - carb drinks performed better than those who drank the carb - only drinks .
" These findings may be important considering that most endurance athletes concern themselves primarily with carbohydrate intake and often fail to recognize the potential benefits of protein with respect to performance recovery , " Berardi said .
Liu Changliang , 46 , a former businessman who also signed Charter 08 , said it was easy to see police brutality .
" The Shanghai government petition office opens every Wednesday morning at 10.30 am .
Hundreds of petitioners go to complain about their situation .
In front of them all , the police beat up one or two every morning , despite their age or sex , as an example , " he said .
His claim was verified independently by a number of other observers .
Marxism and Science : An addendum to “ The Frankfurt School vs. Marxism ”
By Ann Talbot and Chris Talbot
28 October 2008
David North has already ably dealt with many of the questions arising from both Alex Steiner 's lecture " Dialectics and the Crisis of Science " and his polemic " Marxism without Its Head or Heart , " but he asked us to provide an addendum supplementing some of the points he has made .
( See David North 's essay )
At the outset some background will be useful .
We first encountered Steiner when we read the text of the lecture he gave to party members and supporters in Berlin in 2002 .
Both of us were concerned at his treatment of science and its history in the Renaissance and Enlightenment .
Steiner had recently written a useful article on Heidegger , but his approach here was very different .
The lecture was ill informed , thoroughly non-materialist and anti-dialectical .
The history of science is a complex subject and we assumed that Steiner had stumbled into an area of which he knew little and needed to do more work to develop an adequate analysis .
We met informally for dinner while Steiner was on holiday in the UK and discussed some of the issues arising from the lecture in friendly terms .
Later , Chris Talbot wrote to him suggesting some reading .
Our patience was rewarded with the reply that North has already discussed .
It was a 37 - page diatribe reasserting and expanding on the points he made in the original lecture and article .
Neither Steiner 's lecture nor his reply have been posted on his web site , which is perhaps not surprising considering what poor pieces of work both of them are .
But Steiner has taken a sentence from Chris Talbot 's letter out of context to demonstrate the supposed " vulgar materialist " and " empiricist " mode of thought indulged in by members of the International Committee .
Ann Talbot 's articles on the Enlightenment and bourgeois revolution have also come in for criticism from Steiner .
He regards them as examples of the uncritical attitude of the WSWS towards Enlightenment values and democratic rights and compares them to the comments of Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris , or even the Bush administration , which claims to be exporting democratic values to Iraq .
We shall therefore take this opportunity to reply jointly to the attacks on both of us and to examine the questions of science and its history that he raises .
These are wide - ranging topics , but Steiner 's attacks in both areas are closely related methodologically .
We will begin by looking at Steiner 's misconceived view of String Theory before examining his conception of the Enlightenment and the bourgeois revolution .
Steiner 's view of modern physics
North has already pointed out that Steiner 's approach to science is highly idealist and fundamentally opposed to materialism , and has shown how Steiner 's idealism is reflected in his attraction to the theories of Dame Francis Yates and Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs .
The same idealist direction is expressed in Steiner 's conception of the development of modern physics from Relativity to String Theory .
In his Berlin lecture , Steiner claims :
The first major challenge to Newtonian mechanics comes , interestingly enough , not from physics , but from the geometric theories of a German mathematician named George Bernhard Riemann .
The beginning of the end of Newtonian physics takes place on June 10 , 1854 .
That was the day when Riemann gave a public lecture in which he presented a geometric system that was an alternative to the Euclidean geometry upon whose shoulders Newtonian mechanics rested .
Riemann 's geometry postulated a space composed of higher dimensions than the normal three of Euclidean geometry .
He postulated a space that was curved , much like the walls of the inside of a sphere are curved .
Within this geometric system , all the axioms of Euclidean geometry are suddenly no longer obvious .
For instance , in curved space parallel lines will meet .
This was a radical mathematical theory , for no one had ever questioned Euclidean geometry before .
After all , its small number of assumptions , such as the principle that parallel lines never meet , seem in the light of day - to - day common sense experience to be obvious .
Steiner places an extraordinary degree of emphasis on Riemannian geometry , which he regards as producing a sensation among physicists , writers , artists and psychics in the later years of the 19th century .
Physicists tried to provide physical evidence of a fourth dimension , Steiner says , writers wrote novels about it , artists tried to visualize it and psychics claimed to be in communication with it .
All this is drawn from Michio Kaku 's book Hyperspace , [ 1 ] a popular account of String Theory for the layman , a work that provides a lively introduction to the subject for the non-specialist .
But not even Kaku , a serious String Theorist himself , would pretend that his little book could be the basis for developing a new philosophy of science .
Yet this is the only book that Steiner cites .
No scientist could take him seriously and no Marxist could take him seriously .
Yet Steiner concludes :
The physical interpretation of the fourth dimension finally begins in 1905 with Einstein 's theory of special relativity .
According to Steiner , Riemann 's multidimensional geometry led directly to Einstein 's theory of relativity .
But this is simply not true .
We have here another of those instances that North refers to when Steiner , for all his repeated invocations of " dialectics , " demonstrates that he is a common or garden empiricist at heart .
Here are two facts : 1854 , Riemannian geometry ; 1905 , Einstein 's Theory of Relativity ; one fact precedes the other , therefore we have a causative relationship : Riemannian geometry gives rise to the Theory of Relativity .
This is an entirely idealist theory and , what is more , it is false and unfounded in reality .
The relationship between Riemann 's geometry and Einstein 's theory of relativity is immeasurably more complex than that , and of an intellectual complexity that far outstrips Steiner 's impoverished and schematic conception .
Reading Steiner 's account of the development of modern physics is like being put on a diet of bread and water when there is a banquet set out in front of you .
Riemann was undoubtedly a mathematical genius who , in his short life , permanently altered the course of mathematics , but he did not pluck his conception of geometry out of the air .
He developed his ideas while working with the experimental physicist Wilhelm Weber trying to develop a mathematical theory that would embrace electricity , magnetism , gravity and light .
In other words , he was working on the same problem that Einstein was later to solve .
He died in 1866 at the age of only 39 before many of the developments in electromagnetism that led to Einstein 's theory .
One biographer comments that " it is quite possible that had he been granted twenty or thirty more years of life he would have become the Newton or Einstein of the nineteenth century . " [ 2 ]
We cannot , therefore , divorce physics from experimentalism and root its advances in an ideal world of pure mathematical thought , as Steiner would wish to do .
It is true that mathematics follows its own technical rules that are internal to the discipline and even to a specific area of mathematics .
Such is the degree of the division of labour in intellectual life that pure mathematicians may pursue those specialist areas for centuries without ever considering how they might be applied .
Number theory , for example , was known to the followers of Pythagoras , but has only recently been applied in cryptography .
Complex numbers were developed during the Renaissance and remained a rarefied branch of pure mathematics until they were found to be significant for modern electrical engineering .
Viewed in an idealist manner , the history of mathematics might seem to refute a materialist analysis of the development of human thought .
Mathematics appears to exist in an ideal world .
Many of its most brilliant exponents would maintain that to be the case .
Yet if we pursue the history of mathematics with a little more tenacity and trace the discipline to its beginnings in the ancient civilisations of Egypt and Babylon , we find that mathematics develops in response to the material problems that confronted human beings in their attempt to make a living in the Nile valley or Iraq .
Only at a later date did mathematics take on the abstract , generalised character with which we now associate it .
This happened among the ancient Greeks in the course of the sixth century BC , when there was an attempt to understand the world scientifically , which is associated with the name of Thales of Miletus .
Thales is said to have introduced geometry from Egypt and used it to predict a solar eclipse in 585 BC .
Thales and his successors were essentially materialists , but at the same time there developed an idealist school of philosophy among the followers of Pythagoras who regarded numbers as the real basis of a transitory , material world .
In the course of the fifth century BC as philosophy developed in Athens it became sharply polarised between idealists and materialists .
Plato characterised this struggle as a battle of gods and giants and , as is made clear in The Sophist , he was entirely on the side of the gods and opposed to the giants , the materialists , who wanted to drag everything down to the level of body .
For those who believe , with Alfred North Whitehead , that the whole of the Western philosophical tradition is no more than a series of footnotes to Plato , Plato 's rejection of the materialism of Democritus and other ancient atomists provides the basis of their understanding of mathematics , science and philosophy .
For them , mathematical ideas originate in the ideal world of Plato 's forms and pass from there to the sordid material world of physics and engineering , becoming in the process less perfect and less beautiful .
It is this anti-materialist and unhistorical view that Steiner has adopted .
The richness and , in a genuine sense , dialectical complexity of the relationship between mathematics and physics is denied in Steiner 's conception of a simple mechanical process in which one development in mathematics triggers a new direction in physics .
Physics is certainly a mathematical discipline , but it is not possible to tie a development in humanity 's understanding of the physical nature of the universe to an isolated advance in mathematics .
Steiner is entirely blind to the manifold interconnections of social thought that produce a new development in physics or any other area of human endeavour .
Einstein 's annus mirabilis in 1905 , when he published the papers that were to revolutionize physics , were an integral part of the other epochal events of that memorable year .
This was the year of the first Russian Revolution , in which Leon Trotsky played a leading role , and the year in which he published his theory of Permanent Revolution .
In their own way , Einstein's and Trotsky 's theories define the 20th century and continue to define the issues that confront the 21st in politics and science .
It can be said with some justice that
Trotsky 's approach represented an astonishing theoretical breakthrough .
As Einstein 's relativity theory — another gift of 1905 to mankind — fundamentally and irrevocably altered the conceptual framework within which man viewed the universe and provided a means of tackling problems for which no answers could be found within the straitjacket of classical Newtonian physics , Trotsky 's theory of Permanent Revolution fundamentally shifted the analytical perspective from which revolutionary processes were viewed . [ 3 ]
Born in the same year , Trotsky and Einstein were driven to make fundamental theoretical breakthroughs by the political , intellectual and cultural ferment in Europe at that time .
North 's insight was taken up in an article by Peter Symonds . [ 4 ] who points out that Einstein cannot be understood apart from the times in which he lived , a period of rapid industrial expansion that had profoundly altered the character of science .
" Capitalism drove technical innovation which , " as Symonds writes , " in turn , provoked new scientific questions and provided new apparatus for their resolution . "
Symonds outlines all the physical phenomena that had been found to be incompatible with Newton 's equations and which were calling the old certainties into question .
Henrich Hertz had confirmed the existence of radio waves in the 1880s ; in 1895 , Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X - rays , which were later found to be high - frequency electromagnetic waves ; in 1890 , J.J. Thomson discovered the electron , the first subatomic particle to be identified ; Henri Becquerel and Pierre and Marie Curie were investigating radium in the same period and discovered that it had an ability to radiate energy that appeared to contradict the law of the conservation of energy .
North 's lecture and Symonds ' article offer a far more profound analysis of what gave rise to the Theory of Relativity than Steiner can provide and they express a genuinely dialectical and materialist historical consciousness .
They reveal the intellectual depth of the WSWS and the seriousness with which its writers approach questions of science and culture in general .
No writer for the WSWS would presume to base a theoretical article or lecture on one popular book .
But to return to Einstein , all this experimental work and the new phenomena observed by physicists in the latter part of the 19th century contributed to the problem that Einstein set himself to solve and to its resolution .
The Special Theory of Relativity arose from contradictions between Newton 's mechanics and the theory of Electricity and Magnetism developed by Faraday , Maxwell and others .
Newton 's theory depended on a traditional separation of time and Euclidean space that formed the background to the motion of corpuscular bodies or particles .
Electromagnetism , which now included light , radio waves and X - rays , was found to be inexplicable in terms of an " aether " made up of tiny particles governed by Newtonian physics .
Eventually , Einstein resolved the issue by developing a new type of mechanics that would incorporate Electromagnetism as well as Newton 's corpuscular particles , and a new unified theory of space and time .
It is true that when Einstein in 1915 extended his Special Theory of Relativity to include gravity with his General Theory of Relativity , he eventually used Riemannian geometry .
As with the earlier theory , his genius was that he established certain physical principles on which the new theory needed to be based , in this case the " Principle of Equivalence " that identified the environment inside an accelerating spacecraft with the environment inside the same spacecraft in a gravitational field .
There should be no distinction between the physical laws that hold in either situation .
Struggling with the difficult mathematics and with the help of his mathematician friend Marcel Grossmann , Einstein used one particular version of Riemann 's geometry with a particular set of mathematical rules that he himself discovered -- the Einstein field equations .
Gravity was no longer the mysterious force " acting at a distance " of Newton , but could be understood as the warping or distortion of space and time .
Riemannian geometry was one of numerous developments in geometry , algebra and other branches of mathematics that were applied to great effect in science and technology over the next century and a half , often feeding back into mathematics and stimulating new work there .
Kaku naturally stresses Riemannian geometry because he is a String Theorist and these theorists have turned to higher dimensional geometry in their search for a new fundamental " Theory of Everything . "
But had Steiner read Kaku with an eye less prejudiced against experiment and materialism , he would have found that Kaku also refers to the experimental work that called Newtonian physics into question and that he anticipates significant results for String Theory from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN .
Ultimately , physics depends on experimental results .
This is illustrated by the story of the mathematician Herman Weyl , who attempted to develop Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity on the basis of Riemannian geometry .
In 1918 , he seemed to have developed a theory that would unify gravitation and electromagnetism , but unfortunately it was disproved by the experimental results .
Einstein , who greatly admired the elegance of Weyl 's equations , wrote to him commiserating .
" Apart from the [ lack of ] agreement with reality , " Einstein wrote , " it is in any case a superb intellectual performance . " [ 5 ]
A superb intellectual performance alone could not stand up against the evidence of experimental results .
Steiner might wish to call that empiricism , but it is the method of science .
North has already cited the famous anecdote about Einstein 's reaction to Eddington 's experimental confirmation in 1919 of his prediction that light was bent by gravity .
Einstein was responding , with a certain amount of irony , to the excitement that Eddington 's work had generated in the press , but to use this remark , as Steiner does , to suggest that Einstein did not take experimental results seriously is simply unfounded and intellectually irresponsible .
The way in which Steiner seizes on this incident tells us more about Steiner 's attitude to science than it does about Einstein's .
What Steiner is suggesting is that if science can be said to be based on experimental results , then one negative experimental result would of necessity sink an entire theory .
This is a conception worthy of Karl Popper himself .
Science does not blunder from one experiment to another .
Scientists have built up a body of knowledge over many centuries that underpins every experiment and every theory .
They do not experiment blindly , nor do they accept the results of experiments uncritically .
The objective character of science is not confirmed by individual experiments any more than the objectivity of nature is confirmed by individual sensory experience .
Knowledge of the real world is built up over many generations as a series of approximations that become part of social consciousness .
The " crisis of science "
Anyone glancing at the title of Steiner 's lecture could be forgiven for assuming that his reference to the " crisis of science " referred to the period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , when the new developments were being made that led up to Einstein 's work .
Many historians of science would be familiar with this concept from Henri Poincaré , who suggested that science was on the eve of a crisis in 1905 .
Many Marxists will be familiar with the idea of a crisis in physics from Lenin 's Materialism and Empirio - Criticism ( 1908 ) . [ 6 ]
When a Marxist presents a lecture to other Marxists about the " crisis of science , " it would be reasonable to assume it was about the crisis in fundamental physics in the later 19th and early 20th centuries , or perhaps the problems that have arisen with the attempts to develop a " Theory of Everything . "
But Steiner is not talking about that crisis of science .
Far from it , he is referring to another much longer - running and much deeper crisis .
In passing , it is worth mentioning that this is an example of the rhetorical sleight of hand by which Steiner habitually avoids stating his positions clearly .
He does not say openly that he is opposed to materialism , to dialectics and to science , but he aims to sow doubt and confusion and to sway his audience with an insidious and dishonest method of argument .
But to return to the crisis of science .
One might speak about a certain crisis of science today , but Steiner explicitly excludes at the beginning of his lecture any of the issues that could legitimately be considered part of that crisis .
For Steiner , the crisis of science does not arise from the way in which scientific research and the technological application of science is distorted by the profit drive .
Nor does the crisis of science lie in the all - too - apparent gap between the immense productive capacity of modern capitalism and the social conditions in which the majority of the earth 's population live .
No , in proposing to examine the " crisis of science " Steiner was alluding to something quite different when he gave his Berlin lecture .
He tells us :
What we have in mind instead is an investigation into the manner and degree to which science as such has strayed from its original goals .
Those original goals , Steiner says , were laid down in Ancient Greece where we see " the codification of the purpose of science " :
In its beginnings , there was no sharp distinction between science and philosophy .
In fact , the sharp distinction between the two that we now take for granted was only introduced in the last two or three centuries .
Up to the Renaissance the close and unbreakable relationship between science and philosophy was a given .
Now , however , Steiner complains , " Science is split off from philosophy and each go their separate ways . "
Here lies the " crisis of science " for Steiner because
It is this separation of science from philosophy that provides us with a first approximation of what I refer to as the crisis of contemporary science .
Note however that the modern sensibility does not consider this a crisis at all , but , on the contrary , we celebrate what we consider the liberation of science from the constraints of metaphysics .
For reasons that will become clear , we have elevated the sciences at the expense of philosophy .
In fact , the very legitimacy of philosophy , of a systematic inquiry into the totality of what is , is automatically suspected of being a form of mysticism , if not worse .
Steiner 's contention is that Aristotle 's First Philosophy was rejected in the course of the Renaissance and early modern period , when there was a shift from the philosophy of Aristotle to that of Plato .
North has already discussed this material so we will not repeat it here .
[ 7 ]
We will concentrate on what it means for Steiner 's conception of the " crisis of science . "
Steiner maintains that , by breaking from Aristotle 's understanding of the First Philosophy , Renaissance and modern science left themselves unable to comprehend the whole and could only examine the separate parts of nature .
But excising philosophy from the sciences has certain detrimental consequences , as I hope to demonstrate .
If we return to the original conception of Aristotle , the relation of First Philosophy to a particular science is an example of a Whole to Part relationship .
Any one who has spent any time reading Steiner 's material will know that " the Whole and the Part " is his repeated mantra .
For Steiner , this is the summit of all wisdom .
Aristotle 's First Philosophy allows us to comprehend the whole and the part , according to Steiner , and this is where science has gone astray .
We have now arrived at what I think is characteristic of science throughout all the phases of its history , and that is the necessity to find a principle of order , to unify , to explain the particular through the universal principle of organization .
This was the founding principle , the charter so to speak , that originally motivated Aristotle , and from which contemporary philosophy , in the form of its dominant mode of empiricism , has strayed .
It is the reason for having a First Philosophy alongside the particular sciences .
Let us leave aside for the moment the fact that this is an untenable theory on so many grounds — historical , scientific and philosophical — and consider what it implies .
Steiner is contending that science has been in a crisis for over 300 years .
Galileo died in 1642 .
If Steiner is right in his identification of a crisis of science that began in the 17th century , then it would mean that all science from Galileo onwards is flawed and in some way suspect because it lacks the metaphysical foundations that Aristotle thought essential to it .
Newton 's work and that of the Enlightenment scientists would be part of the same crisis .
More recent science would be equally dubious , since modern scientists have , according to Steiner , inherited from the Enlightenment the same unfortunate tendency to belittle Aristotle and lack any regard for his First Philosophy .
If the crisis of science goes back to the Renaissance and continues unabated to this day , then it would mean that both Lenin 's efforts to provide a philosophical resolution of the early 20th century crisis and Einstein 's attempt to put physics on a new footing were equally fruitless .
Steiner 's " crisis of science " is a pretty thin disguise for an attack on science .
He expresses intense dissatisfaction with modern science , which he condemns as " reductionist , " " atomistic " and " empirical . "
For any one with even a passing acquaintance with the writings of the Frankfurt School , particularly Adorno , Horkheimer and Marcuse , it is clear that Steiner 's complaints against science are of a piece with the familiar anti-Enlightenment , anti-scientific litany of that school , which has become well established in the postmodern schools of thought that have developed among the radical intelligentsia hostile to Marxism .
Steiner 's claim that there is a " crisis of science " because it has strayed from its original objectives is , in reality , an attack on objective scientific thought .
Biochemistry , the area of science that has made the most dramatic developments in the course of the second half of the 20th century since the discovery of DNA , evokes a hysterical response from Steiner .
The painstaking work of cognitive science on brain - damaged patients , the development of brain chemistry and the analogies that have been drawn between the brain and the computer send him into a frenzy .
The work of Richard Dawkins and other evolutionary biologists , and the philosopher Daniel Dennett , give him a fit of apoplexy .
Steiner writes :
We can no longer talk about our feeling of love , for instance , without discussing neuro - transmitters and serotonin levels .
And we can no longer discuss the aesthetic qualities of a painting without reference to the experience of our ancestors millions of years ago on the African savannah .
Steiner seems to be a man unhappy in the corporeality of his own material , biological condition .
When Chris Talbot suggested that postmodernism was a serious matter , Steiner responded that the influence of postmodernism in universities was negligible in comparison to that of the scientists and engineers who are empiricists .
[ 8 ]
He continued :
But the intellectual climate at the universities is only one barometer of intellectual trends .
Perhaps an even more important one is the state of popular culture .
Just take a look at the topics highlighted in magazines and newspapers and you will find that the public is being inundated not with the intellectual fantasies of Jacques Derrida , but with the ethos of consumerism and a naïve worship of technology .
There have been numerous accounts in the mass media propounding the views of biological determinism .
For instance , at the time that the human genome project was completed , most accounts of its significance equated it with the discovery of human nature .
There are hundreds of television nature shows -- presenting a vulgarized adaptation of socio- biology — contend ( sic ) that the aggressive behavior exhibited by animals ( often posed and encouraged for the camera to begin with ) are correlates to the problems faced in human society .
And every day hundreds of ads are run extolling the virtues of modern chemistry which allows you to reconstruct your consciousness simply by taking a pill .
We have in fact become addicted to the quick and easy technological fix for virtually all our problems .
I do n't see much evidence of the postmodernists ' antipathy to science in popular culture .
This incontinent rant against science and the mass of the population who expect to receive medical treatment for their ill - health and to use new technology in their daily lives , and who like to watch nature documentaries on television , reveals both Steiner 's antipathy to science and his contempt for the working class .
The Enlightenment and the bourgeois revolution
The same " crisis of science " that Steiner detects in the Renaissance must have run right through the Enlightenment .
His knowledge of the science of the period is rudimentary .
His knowledge of Newton seems to have been derived from historians with a neo -Platonic slant , who have focused their attention on Newton 's alchemy and millenarianism rather than his work on optics and his theory of gravity .
Steiner numbers Newton among the neo-Platonists .
In his lecture he declared :
[ T ]he creators of the new science , men such as Bruno , Galileo , Newton , did not think of themselves as experimenters who then derived generalizations based on their experiments .
They thought of themselves as Platonists who sought to discover the mathematical laws that governed nature .
Whether Newton thought of himself as a neo -Platonist is questionable , whether he was a neo -Platonist is even more doubtful .
All we can say with certainty is that he knew some neo-Platonists , but guilt by association is not a good principle of justice or history .
What distinguishes Newton , far more than any putative neo-Platonism , is that he was an outstanding mathematician .
Steiner 's identification of neo-Platonism with mathematics is too crude .
Some neo-Platonists were mathematicians , but not all mathematicians were neo-Platonists .
The reason for Steiner 's insistence that Newton was a neo -Platonist becomes clearer in his reply to Chris Talbot .
When citing Dobbs on Newton , Steiner crowed gleefully :
It turns out that Newton spent more time on alchemical experiments than on physics and his physical science was conceived by him as an expression of his mystical religious beliefs . [ 9 ]
Newton did indeed spend more time on alchemy than he did writing the Principia .
The reason for that was very simple , concrete and all too material for Steiner .
Newton did not succeed in turning lead into gold , but he did succeed in discovering the law of gravity .
The project of the alchemists was to discover the natural process that had created the elements such as lead and gold , to reproduce that process and to harness it for the benefit of mankind .
Given the technology available to Newton , this was an impractical objective , but it took him two decades to find that out .
There was , however , nothing " unscientific " or " mystical " about the objective .
Alchemy was no more inherently mystical than algebra , which , as its name suggests , came from the same Arabic source .
History has its own history , and by relying on Yates and Dobbs , Steiner is taking a position in a long - running polemic that can be traced back to 1931 and the Second International Congress of the History of Science and Technology in London .
At that conference , the Soviet historian of science Boris Hessen gave a paper in which he set out for the first time a historical materialist analysis of Newton 's life and work , including his alchemy and religious ideas . [ 10 ]
In an article written in 2000 , Ann Talbot explained :
Hessen showed that Newton 's scientific work had a material basis in the technological developments and economic imperatives of the time .
He established what he called the " earthy core " of Newton 's Principia that underlay its abstract mathematical form .
Hessen 's lecture was a seminal influence on many of the historians and scientists present , inspiring them to set the history of science in its wider social context rather than considering its development as though it had taken place in a vacuum .
For others , Hessen 's paper , whether acknowledged or not , became the target of their attempts to deny that Newton had any connection with economics or technology . [ 11 ]
Yates 's work on Newton belongs very much to the latter category .
She was a conservative , High Anglican neo-Platonist .
Anglican neo-Platonism can be traced back to the 17th century at least , when it was developed by the Cambridge Platonists as an antidote to materialism , but its postwar manifestation has more to do with the anxiety felt about communism and the strength of the working class .
In the 20th century , neo -Platonism became a significant trend of thought among conservative intellectuals who were gripped by a morbid fascination with phenomenology and were alarmed by Marxism .
Yates was associated with the Warburg Institute in London , where Ernest Gombrich , a stalwart anti-Marxist , was the director .
Born in 1899 , she remained active until her death in 1981 .
In the latter part of the 20th century , Yates 's conservative idealism seems to have met up with postmodern trends in both the United States and Britain , which gave a fresh lease on life to her works at a time when the new developments in Renaissance and early modern scholarship might have been expected to render her , admittedly pioneering , work outmoded .
Steiner is placing himself firmly in the idealist camp by relying on Yates .
The materialism to which Steiner evinces such a rooted opposition is essential to the process that we , following Kant , call the Enlightenment .
Hegel was in a constant dialogue with the shade of Spinoza , as so many philosophers of the period were .
Yet for Steiner , materialism is a dirty word .
Virtually every mention of materialism in Steiner 's article and lecture is prefaced with the adjective " mechanical " or " vulgar . "
He claims that the mechanical materialists of the Enlightenment period justified their atomistic view of the world by claiming it originated with classical thinkers like Democritus and that this was a false claim repeated by 19th and 20th century positivists .
Steiner cannot resist adding , " Likewise , many vulgar Marxists , particularly from the Stalinist camp , adopted this historical genealogy . "
We will have to number Karl Marx and Frederick Engels among Steiner 's " mechanical materialists " and " vulgar Marxists , " since they stress the importance of the classical materialist tradition .
They identify the 17th century French natural philosopher Gassendi as " the restorer of Epicurean materialism . "
Gassendi was , incidentally , one of Galileo 's correspondents .
Marx and Engels go on to declare Francis Bacon to be " the real progenitor of English materialism and all modern experimental science , " who often quotes " Democritus and his atoms " as his authority . [ 12 ]
Engels refers to the " newly - discovered Greek philosophy " that " prepared the way for the materialism of the 18th century . " [ 13 ]
Marx and Engels associate the adjective " great " with the French materialists , in contrast to Steiner 's consistent use of the terms " mechanical " and " vulgar . "
If Steiner wants to denigrate this view of history and Marxism as Stalinist it merely shows he is not a Marxist .
Steiner cannot go over to a complete and open rejection of the Enlightenment in the manner of postmodernism because he hopes to influence Marxists , but he objects to what he calls the " uncritical enthusiasm over the Enlightenment " of the WSWS .
" Icons of bourgeois liberalism such as Hobbes , Locke and Jefferson , " Steiner complains , " have been elevated at the expense of the historical ancestors of modern communism , Winstanley , Munzer or Babeuf . "
He criticises Ann Talbot 's obituary of the historian Christopher Hill for failing to follow Hill in his " spirited defense of one of the great precursors of the communist movement [ Winstanley ] while at the same time providing a critique of the misanthropic bourgeois philosopher Thomas Hobbes . "
He follows the historian Jonathan Israel in identifying a Moderate Enlightenment and a Radical Enlightenment .
" The figures of the Radical Enlightenment were not satisfied with toleration and compromise , the watchwords of the Moderate Enlightenment of Montesquieu and Locke , " Steiner writes , " but sought to base society on Reason and equality . "
One can only suppose that Steiner has never read Locke , whose Two Treatises of Government is an extended study of reason and equality and the foundational role they play in a just society .
As for Jefferson , who took whole phrases from Locke 's works in drafting the Declaration of Independence , it is difficult to see why a Marxist should write less favourably of him than Marx did of Abraham Lincoln .
On the occasion of his re-election Marx wrote to Lincoln :
From the commencement of the titanic American strife the workingmen of Europe felt instinctively that the star - spangled banner carried the destiny of their class . [ 14 ]
Jefferson failed to abolish slavery as he would have wished , but he set in motion that revolution which Lincoln ultimately concluded .
For the artisans and dispossessed , not yet a working class , of Europe , the American War of Independence and the French Revolution challenged the long - established ancien regimes based on hereditary privilege .
To suggest that Marxists should pay attention only to the plebeian elements within those revolutions is to miss the full historical significance of epochal events .
Ann Talbot 's obituary of Hill was an article about a historian of the 17th century .
There was no reason why it should have included a discussion of Thomas Münzer ( ca. 1488 -1525 ) or Gracchus Babeuf ( 1760 - 1797 ) .
Certainly , Christopher Hill was too good a historian to do so .
Steiner 's injunction that they should have been included indicates that he regards them as figures from a heroic pantheon rather than flesh and blood beings that lived and struggled in definite historical periods .
This is very much in keeping with his utopian conceptions of socialism .
It is worth examining how Marx and Engels discussed Babeuf in the Communist Manifesto :
We do not here refer to that literature which , in every great modern revolution , has always given voice to the demands of the proletariat , such as the writings of Babeuf and others .
The first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends , made in times of universal excitement , when feudal society was being overthrown , necessarily failed , owing to the then undeveloped state of the proletariat , as well as to the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation , conditions that had yet to be produced , and could be produced by the impending bourgeois epoch alone .
The revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character .
It inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form . [ 15 ]
Marx and Engels acknowledge their debt to Babeuf as they had done in The Holy Family , where they placed Babeuf among those who " gave rise to the communist idea , " [ 16 ] but their assessment of Babeuf 's uprising and other similar early proletarian movements is a thoroughly historical materialist one .
They stress that the conditions had not yet been produced by the development of capitalist society for such a movement to succeed and that its literature was necessarily reactionary and crude .
Marxism is not based on crude , levelling ideas .
It is based on the highest achievements of the Enlightenment .
One could equally well apply Marx and Engels ' words to Winstanley .
But Hill was labouring under the burden of the Stalinist Popular Front theory of People 's History , which sought to find national revolutionary heroes in every country .
In an obituary , a writer must emphasise the best in the subject 's life while not ignoring what was weakest .
Hill 's best work by far was his biography of Oliver Cromwell , who was a difficult figure for Hill to write about , but one who embodied the revolutionary impulse of his class .
Steiner 's discovery of the Radical Enlightenment is a response to North 's charge that he shared the hostility of the Frankfurt School to the Enlightenment and it does not substantially alter any of his earlier attacks on the Enlightenment .
For Steiner , the Enlightenment requires to be " dialectically sublated " before Marxism can emerge because
Even the Radical Enlightenment does not provide us with an uninterrupted line of continuity between the 18th century and the revolutionary outlook of Marxism .
Here again we see an example of Steiner 's rhetorical sleight of hand .
Anyone who has read Lenin would assume that this was a reference to the combination of classical German philosophy , British political economy and French socialism out of which Marxism grew .
But this is not the case .
In his reply to Chris Talbot , Steiner takes Talbot to task for suggesting that the Enlightenment should be defended :
An even more important point to note is the notion you implicitly put forward that every historical - philosophical discussion is obliged to defend the Enlightenment against the attacks of postmodernists .
I certainly agree that Marxists should defend the Enlightenment against its irrationalist detractors .
But do n't you think Marxists also have an obligation to defend dialectics against some of the progeny of the Enlightenment , the atomists and empiricists ?
Why does one need to undermine the other ?
Remember that when you say that the Enlightenment is the historical precursor of socialism and Marxism that it is just as true to say that it is also the precursor of liberalism and the bourgeoisie .
The heritage of the Enlightenment is not an all or nothing proposition .
Marxism comes into its own by way of a critique of the Enlightenment .
Just take a look at the Theses on Feuerbach !
Practically each one of the theses is directed at some doctrine or other of the Enlightenment .
But " critique " does not mean " rejection . "
Marxism represents a genuine Hegelian aufheben of the Enlightenment .
The Enlightenment is at once preserved and overcome .
The Theses on Feuerbach consists of 11 statements ; all of them on philosophy .
They are not " directed at some doctrine or other of the Enlightenment . "
They are directed very specifically at Feuerbach 's conception of materialism , which is a mechanical one .
Engels extracted them from the then - unpublished German Ideology that he and Marx had written in 1845 - 46 .
The Theses on Feuerbach were a crucial part of the process by which Marx developed historical materialism , not a critique of a jumble of Enlightenment ideas .
There are no references to liberalism or the bourgeoisie .
They are , as Engels says , " the brilliant germ of the new world outlook . "
With his insistence that Marxism emerged from the Enlightenment by a process of " sublation " or " aufheben , " Steiner is suggesting that Marx and Engels rejected the conception of equality that had been developed in the course of the Enlightenment , advanced in the English Revolution and made a principle of the bourgeois revolution in America and France .
He follows a path well trodden by radical and Stalinist opponents of Marxism in doing so .
It takes him inevitably to On the Jewish Question , an early work that Marx wrote in 1843 , well before his own philosophy had matured .
It was a polemic written against the left Hegelian Bruno Bauer , who rejected the demand for Jewish political emancipation in 19th century Germany .
Bauer maintained that emancipation was not possible as long as people remained religious , so the Jews could not be emancipated until they ceased to be Jews .
Marx pointed out that political emancipation never amounted to complete human emancipation .
It certainly had not done so in America , which remained the " land of religiosity par excellence . "
Nevertheless , he maintained ,
Political emancipation is certainly a big step forward .
It may not be the last form of human emancipation , but it is the last form of human emancipation within the prevailing scheme of things .
Needless to say , we are here speaking of real , practical emancipation . [ 17 ]
This is as clear a statement as one could wish that Marx supported real , practical , political emancipation , but On the Jewish Question has become one of the regular references for those who wish to claim that Marx rejected the Enlightenment demand for equality .
Steiner is no exception .
He claims that Marx
takes on one of the themes beloved of the Enlightenment , that the solution of the problems faced in trying to create a liberal nation state is to offer national minorities , such as the Jews in much of Europe , equal political rights under the law .
Marx considered that remedy inadequate because it did not address the problem posed by their isolation from world culture though the institutionalization of ghettoized minorities .
If this were true , then no Marxist could campaign for the political rights of any oppressed minority , or even of the members of the working class who continue to hold religious ideas .
There would be no point in demanding the right to vote , the right of assembly , free speech or habeas corpus in case those who benefited from those rights had not thrown off their religious ideas .
One could immediately forget about building a socialist movement in America .
Marx was consistent in his defence of democratic rights .
Universal suffrage was the second demand in the pamphlet that the Communist League issued in 1848 , as revolution broke out in Germany .
The first was for a republic .
The separation of church and state was a central demand . [ 18 ]
Marx edited the Neue Rheinische Zeitung , which carried on its masthead the slogan Organ of Democracy .
He and Engels worked closely with British Chartists such as Julian Harney and Ernest Jones in their campaign for universal suffrage .
They also defended the Irish Fenians in their struggle against British rule .
All these are democratic questions .
Marx and Engels were critical of the high - flown abstractions of the French revolutionary slogan Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , particularly when it was used hypocritically by the bourgeoisie as they were shooting down workers in 1848 .
But they always took to task socialists who did not treat democratic questions seriously .
For them , democratic rights were a concrete matter .
As Engels pointed out to the Lassalleans :
The bourgeoisie cannot gain political supremacy and express this in the form of a constitution without , at the same time , arming the proletariat .
On its banner it must inscribe human rights in place of the old system of social position based on birth ....
Therefore , for consistency 's sake , it must demand universal and direct suffrage , freedom of the press , association and assembly , and the repeal of all emergency laws directed against particular social classes .
But this is all that the proletariat need demand from the bourgeoisie .
It can not expect the bourgeoisie to stop being the bourgeoisie , but it can demand that it apply its own principles consistently .
The result will be that the proletariat will lay its hands on all the weapons which it needs for its final victory . [ 19 ]
It is not simply one aspect or another of the Enlightenment , or certain figures within it , to which Steiner takes exception .
It is the whole process by which mankind emancipated itself from centuries of superstition , social deference and religious dread , and began , in Kant 's famous phrase , to " Dare to know . "
Yet that process is the historical root of the Hegelian philosophy that he claims to admire so much , and of Marxism , which in a genuine sense sublated it .
The only aspects of the Enlightenment that Steiner evinces any desire to retain are the most backward and confused forms of thought that were expressed in mysticism .
As far as Steiner is concerned , the democratic rights that Marx and Engels defended are merely the product of bourgeois reason .
Steiner argues as though it was the Enlightenment demand for equality , the very idea of equality , that gave rise to the unequal social and political relations of bourgeois society , rather than it proving impossible to realize equality under the conditions of a capitalist economy .
Ever the idealist , Steiner consistently imagines ideas as the determinants of history and never economics .
Steiner protests his enthusiasm for the Radical Enlightenment and complains about those who attempt to lump the Radical Enlightenment and the Moderate Enlightenment together .
But it is curious that Steiner should lump himself together with Israel , because Israel regards the representatives of the Radical Enlightenment as precisely those Enlightenment thinkers who were materialists and often mechanical ones of the type that is so distasteful to Steiner .
But perhaps Steiner has not read Israel 's earlier book Radical Enlightenment in which he makes this clear .
Citing Israel in this way is typical of Steiner 's light - minded approach of picking up books and ideas as and where he can .
His theories are a melange of such objets trouvés .
He is always eclectic , ungrounded and erratic .
His work reveals a mind in chaos .
The one theme that binds it together is a constant hostility to objective thought and resistance to its liberation from the authority of dogma .
Marxism is not a First Philosophy .
In making his plea for a return to First Philosophy , Steiner is betraying his desire to return to the situation that existed in the Middle Ages , when the investigation of nature was controlled by an authoritarian Church which had converted Aristotle 's philosophy into a dogma and decreed what scientists could and could not do .
Steiner 's is the deep - seated and dogmatic ignorance of a man who craves a pulpit from which to bully people .

7 . We are at a loss to understand why if , as Steiner claims , there was a shift to neo-Platonic philosophy in the Renaissance and not a development of experiment and observation , Plato , who was after all the teacher of Aristotle , could not provide a First Philosophy too .
Steiner 's argument is , however , illogical as well as unhistorical .

Newton 's alchemy was not an armchair occupation .

The most frustrating thing that any user would experience , while browsing through websites are the broken links .
Though broken links are sure to annoy users , there are also increased possibilities for them to affect the search rankings and page rankings of the website .
Broken links can never be of any help to the websites expecting the search engines to crawl their web pages , as the search engine spider would be left half hanging .
This would not only resist the search engines from crawling through the pages but would also affect the search ranking ( the order based on which the search engine displays the results ) and the page rank that is allotted by Google .
For best results , even the inner links of websites are to be checked and confirmed that there are no broken links within .
The presence of such broken links would affect deep crawling of your website .
As we all know that there are two types of linking .
They are namely internal links and external links .
The best and simple example to explain about links would be a web application .
In any web application there would be links between various modules .
This would link all the modules and help in producing an integrated result .
This method of linking within the system is called internal linking or inbound links .
Linking the system with the outside resources is called external linking or outbound link .
Similarly , websites might also have a number of inbound links and outbound links that would require the system to collect information from various resources both within the website and outside the website .
Initially , the inbound links would be taken care of and then the outbound links would be looked .
In this process , problem might occur if any of these links are broken and lead to blank or no page .
Therefore , the best way to go about would be to find the broken links and mend it .
The simplest way of finding broken links would be to manually visit all the web pages and find the broken links .
This could be the simplest of all the methods but would require a long time and would not be practical for huge websites with hundreds of pages .
However , there are many other tools available in the market to have this work done automatically .
These tools would crawl through all the links and generate a list of all those links that lead to broken pages with error messages .
There are also options available in which you would be able to specify if any links should be omitted .
Once identified , the broken links should be rectified .
Information on the type of problem that is found and what possibly could be wrong can be found through the error that is displayed .
There are different error messages that have an individual number of their own .
This information would help in fixing the problem .
When it comes to outbound links , they need to be checked often as URLs of the resources that are linked might be changed , or the pages might have been moved or might have any similar changes .

The first time I saw the James Bond Coca - Cola ad , I did n’t think much about it .
But now it turns my spit to bile .
[ social_buttons ]
It ’s disgustingly ironic that the owners of the James Bond series would advertise Coke with a film about ( spoiler alert ) a greenwashing corporation stealing water from the third world .
Because that perfectly describes Coca - Cola Inc .
For the past decade , Coke has invested heavily in bottled water .
An increasingly health - conscious public , aware of the sickening effects of cola , drove down carbonated soft drink sales .
Coke responded by bottling purified tap water and selling it under the name “ Dasani . ”
Thanks to healthy sales of “ healthy ” drinks ( which according to the New York Times are “ still just sugar water ” ) , Coca - Cola has enjoyed rising international sales .
Of course there have been setbacks .
Coca -Cola recalled Dasani in the United Kingdom after they accidentally poisoned the bottled water with bromate , a possible carcinogen .
At least it was only the Dasani that was tainted .
In India , one of Coca - Cola ’s fastest growing markets , problems ran deeper .
In 2004 , the national Ground Water Board decided a plant in Kaladera was sucking away a region ’s groundwater , taking enough water in seven months to irragate crops for 5,000 families – so much that it could dry the Earth ’s crust , increasing the chance of an earthquake .
Though Coca - Cola tried to placate locals by donating toward water pollution programs and building water tanks at a local school , residents still blamed the plant for the drought and demanded its closure .
In a similar dispute that year in the state of Kaladera , locals and activists forced out a $ 16 million bottling plant .
( Twice .
No , sorry , three times . )
Despite those problems , sales in countries like India , China , and Turkey keep increasing Coke ’s quarterly earnings .
To maintain a green image , just this year the company has joined programs like The Climate Group , the World Wildlife Fund , and this month ’s Corporate Water Footprinting conference in San Francisco .
So why , as Planetsave ’s partner blog EcoWorldly reported , did activists protest what seems like a none - too - soon corporate turnaround ?
Because Coke , of course , is n’t turning around at all .
It ’s greenwashing .
Coca - Cola ’s CEO said last year that Coke is going “ water neutral ” : “ Today , The Coca - Cola Company pledges to replace every drop of water we use in our beverages and their production . ”
But a report from the company says going water neutral is impossible .
The CEO promised to fight increasing droughts when India accuses his company of causing them .
The company gave out bottled water in West Michigan – after polluting the area ’s wells for 23 years .
( A year later , no news of a long - term strategy has reached the press . )
The company donated $ 1 million toward water projects in developing nations – out of its annual revenue of $ 29 billion .
Commenting on a Coke partnership with The Climate Group , the company ’s North American president cited its “ long history of supporting recycling and conservation , ” a history that includes breaking its promise to use more recycled plastic and fighting “ bottle bills ” that would require deposits on recyclable bottles and cans .
So pardon us for not buying into Coke ’s supposed commitment to going green .
And maybe we ’d take Coke ’s participation in the San Francisco conference more seriously if instead of lobbying against bottle bills , they ’d lobbied for the California bill that would force them to report how much water they ’re using , a bill that Governor Schwarzenegger vetoed before declaring a statewide drought .
Coca -Cola wants to look sympathetic to the dangers of water scarcity .
But those dangers are too profitable .
According to the book The Blue Covenant , 50 million people got their water from private companies in 1990 .
By 2007 , it was over 300 million .
And as with oil , scarcity and demand drive up this commodity ’s price .
No wonder , as a blogger at Food and Water Watch noticed , that Coca - Cola resembles not James Bond , but his enemy Dominic Greene .
The villain of Quantum of Solace pitches environmentalists on an eco-park scheme called the Tierra project , while meanwhile he buys up or dams up all the water in Bolivia , eventually extorting an exclusive water rights contract from the dictator he put in charge .
Just like Greene , Coca - Cola has aggravated the world ’s water shortage , and just like Greene , Coca - Cola is reaping the financial rewards .
And the company is so cocky that it advertises its sugar - water using a movie all about fighting a water - hoarding corporation .
But no worries .
You ’ll drink it because Bond drinks it , right ?

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Growth Properties Inc. , the No. 2 mall operator in the United States , has warned that an ongoing slump in retail sales , combined with the credit market lockdown , has pushed the company to the brink of bankruptcy .
Chicago - based General Growth Properties said in an SEC filing late Monday that it has $ 900 million of property secured debt and $ 58 million of corporate debt coming up for renewal by Dec. 1 .
It also faces another $ 3.07 billion in debt that matures in 2009 .
But " given the continued weakness of the retail and credit markets , " the mall operator fears it may not be able to refinance its loans at lower rates to meet its short - term cash needs .
Shares of General Growth Properties ( GGP ) tumbled 66 % to 46 cents on Tuesday .
General Growth announced in August that it might sell some assets to raise capital for servicing its debt .
The company operates more than 200 malls -- including the Paramus Park Mall in New Jersey , Cumberland Mall in Atlanta , Water Tower Place in Chicago and the Glendale Galleria in California -- in 44 states .
" Our potential inability to address our 2008 or 2009 debt maturities in a satisfactory fashion raises substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern , " the company said in the filing .
Retail real estate experts say other large mall operators could find themselves in the same situation as General Growth .
Several of them have significant debt coming up for renewal at the end of 2008 and early 2009 .
Given the tight credit environment and dismal forecasts for retail sales in the fourth quarter , analysts said lenders probably wo n't refinance those loans at lower rates .
If General Growth does file for bankruptcy , the company 's real estate portfolio could be broken up and its malls acquired by other mall operators , said Ivan Friedman , president & CEO of RCS Retail Real Estate Advisors .
" General Growth has some very valuable properties , " he said .
Although Friedman said it 's extremely rare for a mall to be shut down , Friedman did warn that falling store occupancies pose a real challenge to mall operators .
A worsening economy has forced more Americans to clamp down on their shopping habits .
Subsequently , a pronounced slump in retail sales has forced many chain stores to exit malls .
Store vacancies at regional malls are up 6.6 % , the largest increase since early 2002 , according to real estate research firm Reis .
In some malls , store occupancy rates are falling below 75 % .
" You can keep a mall open with 60 - 70 % [ store ] occupancy , " Friedman said .
" But if it falls to below 40 % , then the weakest malls could be forced to close . "
" We are in a real retail tsunami right now , " Friedman said .
Anger is growing in India that the Mumbai attacks were not prevented Pakistan 's president has vowed to take " strong action " against any elements in his country involved in last week 's attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai .
Asif Ali Zardari made the pledge during a meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , his office said .
Speaking after the meeting , Ms Rice said she found the Pakistani leadership " focused " and " committed " on the issue .
Tensions have risen amid Indian claims of Pakistani links to the attacks , which killed at least 188 people .
Islamabad denies any role and has cast doubt on the allegations .
I have found a government that is focused on the threat and understands its responsibilities to respond to terrorism and extremism
Condoleezza Rice

Pakistan 's dilemma But President Zardari , during his meeting with Ms Rice , repeated an earlier promise to help investigate the attacks , his office said .
" The government will not only assist in investigation but also take strong action against any Pakistani elements found involved in the attack , " he is quoted in an official statement as saying .
" Pakistan is determined to ensure that its territory is not used for any act of terrorism , " he added .
Meanwhile , a Pakistani group has denied any connection with the banned militant group Lashkar - e - Toiba , which is suspected of being behind the Mumbai attacks .
A spokesman for Jama 'at ud Dawa , Abdullah Muntazir , suggested homegrown Indian militants were involved instead .
" I do not believe the attacks in Mumbai could have been carried out by Muslims , " he told reporters .
' Robust response '
Ms Rice described her talks with Mr Zardari , Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gillani and the country 's army chief as " quite satisfactory " .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" I have found a government that is focused on the threat and understands its responsibilities to respond to terrorism and extremism , " she told a news conference .
She said Pakistan would investigate any links with Mumbai , " because the Pakistani government ... does not in any way want to be associated with terrorist elements and is indeed fighting to root them out wherever they find them . "
Before arriving in Islamabad , she told reporters Pakistan must take a " tough line " on terrorism .
Ms Rice travelled to Pakistan from India where she called on both countries to show moderation in their response to the Mumbai attacks .
While Pakistan needed " a robust response " , India should not take actions that would provoke " unintended consequences " , she said .

Are attacks a chance for peace ?
Mumbai comes out to protest US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen has been pushing the same message , in meetings with defence officials in Pakistan on Wednesday and India on Thursday .
The pressure from India to take action against militants it claims were involved in the Mumbai attacks puts Pakistan 's government in a difficult position , the BBC 's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says .
The authorities in Islamabad may doubt the capacity of their own security forces to carry out such orders , he says .
And , by acceding to Indian pressure , Pakistan might risk deeper civil strife at home .
Overt Indian military action might provoke a new stand - off that would do nothing for Pakistan 's stability , which remains an ever shakier corner - stone of US and western efforts to win the war in Afghanistan , our correspondent adds .
Last week 's attacks at multiple locations in India 's financial capital stunned the country , with many describing it as India 's 9/11 .
Three major airports in India are on heightened alert after a threat of more possible attacks by the Deccan Mujahideen , the previously unknown militant group who claimed responsibility for last week 's Mumbai attacks .
Meanwhile , the resignation of Vilasrao Deshmukh , chief minister of the state of Maharashtra where Mumbai is located , was accepted by the governing Congress Party on Thursday .
His was one of a number of resignations in the wake of the attacks amid growing fury over the government 's handling of the crisis .

[ In this in - depth interview , Gamasutra talks to Mother 3 fan - translator Clyde ' Tomato ' Mandelin on working on the unofficial translation of the Nintendo classic , his day job in translation , and his localization heroes . ]
" We know what we 're doing is n't 100 % legal .
But even so , we try our best not to step on companies ' toes .
In fact , I 've received a number of e-mails in the past from professionals inside major game companies giving their thanks , offering to buy me drinks sometime , stuff like that .
What we do is appreciated , but in a hidden way , I think . "
Clyde Mandelin is a Japanese - to - English translator .
As a professional , he 's worked on video games such as Kingdom Hearts II and Tim Burton 's The Nightmare Before Christmas as well as a slew of well - known anime series including Dragon Ball , One Piece , and Lupin the 3rd .
But just as notable is Mandelin 's work on lesser - known games , all of which he translates in his free time and without payment .
You see , Mandelin is a fan translator , one of a niche but revered group of game fans who hack into those 8 - and 16 - bit Japanese video game treasures that never saw a Western release , translating them into English before finally releasing a patch onto the Internet .
Using this patch , gamers can play the game in English via an emulator , experiencing those forbidden fruits previously withheld from Western eyes .
In this underground world , Mandelin is better known by the moniker , Tomato , and it's thanks to his work that RPG fans have been able to play Square and Enix titles such Bahamut Lagoon , Star Ocean and , most recently , Nintendo's Game Boy Advance sequel to fan - favorite Earthbound , Mother 3 .
The latter title attracted a huge amount of attention this autumn ; the translation patch receiving over a hundred thousand downloads in the first week of release .
" Yeah , it was definitely a nice surprise , " he explains .
" The response was a lot bigger than we expected , and it was awesome how excited and positive everyone was during the project .
I originally thought we'd get a couple dozen thousand downloads total , but we quickly passed the 100,000 mark after the release .
With off - site mirrors and such , the real number is probably like double that .
When I think about that , I 'm just like , ' Damn . '
It 's really cool that this little project on the Internet could make so many people happy . "
Mandelin's in his twenties and works for FUNimation and Babel Media , the popular game localization agency .
When he was a boy , he lived in Hawaii , an experience that he believes sparked an interest in Asian culture and language .
A gamer since the Atari 400 , it was playing Japanese - developed Super Nintendo titles like Earthbound and Chrono Trigger that first inspired Mandelin to mess about making his own games .
But it was n't until he was leaving college that he decided what he wanted to do with life .
" I had absolutely no idea what I really wanted to do with my life after graduation .
I would switch majors and still not be happy , so I eventually decided take out a loan and spend a year studying in Japan to get out of my rut .
It was an expensive gamble . "
" While I was there , I heard about some ROM hackers who needed help translating scripts , so I offered my services .
The first day I started , I instantly knew I wanted to do this for a living , and after that , it became a kind of quest to constantly improve my skills .
That feeling of finally knowing what you want to do is so good . "
( CNN ) --
After the fire , all that was left of Jonathan Reyes ' massive Hot Wheels collection was a piece of metal that once was part of a toy car .
Jonathan Reyes shows off his new Hot Wheels cars sent by Mattel after they heard his own toys were lost in a fire .
But on Wednesday , the arrival of two cardboard boxes at his grandparents ' house sent 7 - year - old Jonathan flying to the door , said his mother , Jan Reyes .
Mattel , the company that makes Hot Wheels , sent racetracks , play sets , stickers , folders , T - shirts , hats and hundreds of toy cars .
" He was speechless , " Reyes said .
" He did n't say anything .
He just smiled .
He opened it up .
It was like Christmas .
All of us were bawling , crying .
He was so happy . "
Jonathan , who has autism , meticulously collected more than 500 Hot Wheels .
But all that was destroyed when his Sylmar home , along with hundreds of other structures , were burned down by wildfires in Los Angeles County .
Toys are like anchors for children with autism , psychologists say .
They like to play with the same toys , eat familiar foods and be in a consistent environment .
When faced with unpredictable changes , they can feel frustrated or anxious and become disruptive , according to experts .
On Tuesday , Jonathan and his parents searched for his toys among piles of debris , but they found only a piece of a Hot Wheels car and a rusty tricycle .
The rest of Jonathan 's toys were reduced to ashes .
Watch the Reyes family return to their home . »
Mattel , with headquarters in El Segundo , California , wanted to get involved after hearing on CNN that Jonathan , who had been collecting Hot Wheels since he was 2 , had lost everything .
Looking for hope in the ashes .

My popularity on television and the internet has led a very small money manager to use his popular financial blog to promote his fledgling business by attacking the recent poor performance of my long - term investment strategy .
The post is causing quite a stir and compels me to provide some badly needed context .
To achieve his ends , this individual has distorted much of what I have been saying and writing , and has twisted the facts to support his own preconceived conclusion .
In essence , his piece is nothing more than an overt advertisement ( and a highly deceptive one at that ) to use my popularity to advance his career .
In so doing he has given my critics , particularly some who have been embarrassed by their roles in the " Peter Schiff was Right " video , their moments of retribution .
In addition , some members of the press who have never been among my greatest fans are seizing the opportunity to discredit me as well .
The crux of the blogger 's arguments are that my beliefs in " decoupling , hyperinflation , and that the dollar is going to zero " have been completely discredited by the events of 2008 , and that the resulting investment losses suffered by my clients last year confirms the fatal flaws in my approach .
In addition to mischaracterizing many of my beliefs , he also is confusing short - term market fluctuations with long - term economic trends .
First of all , the hyper inflation issue is a straw man at best .
While I often talk about the possibility of hyper inflation , I have always said that it would be a worse - case scenario that would play out over many years .
The fact that it did not appear in the first year of the economic crash ( 2008 ) does not invalidate my position .
I have always maintained that this worst - case scenario will likely be avoided by what will ultimately be a dramatic shift in policy once our leaders come to their senses .
However , until then the dollar will likely lose a substantial portion of its value .
Second , I never said that the dollar would go to zero , either in 2008 or any year thereafter .
I have said that in the event of hyper inflation the dollar 's value would approach zero .
My actual forecast in my book " Crash Proof " was that the Dollar Index would fall to 40 ( currently about 85 ) , with a realistic worst case scenario , assuming very high but not hyper inflation , of 20 or lower .
Third , the blogger points out that because the decoupling theory ( foreign economies improving while the U.S. falters ) that I wrote about in " Crash Proof " has yet to occur , that the theory itself was ridiculous .
In my book I wrote that this process would not occur overnight , that initially our creditors would come to our aid , and in so doing our problems would become manifest abroad .
I wrote that it would take time for the world to realize that what had been decoupled from the economic train was not the engine but the caboose .
In fact , that is precisely the way it is playing out .
Chapter Ten of " Crash Proof " is specifically focused on the need to keep funds liquid to take advantage of the buying opportunity that would initially develop once our stock market began its collapse .
I specifically mentioned that when U.S. stocks began to fall , we could expect sympathetic declines overseas .
While I did not know the precise timing of those events , I advised readers to prepare .
I did not expect the huge dollar rally of 2008 .
But to discredit my long - term view of the dollar based on an eight month move is absurd .
So while I believed that a weak dollar would cushion the temporary decline I expected in foreign stocks , a strong dollar ended up exacerbating it .
In the meantime , I believed that the high dividends these stocks were paying would make it easier to ride out any correction .
The problem was that the dollar fell so far leading up to the crisis ( in 2005 - 2007 ) that by the time the crisis finally erupted the dollar was poised for a bounce .
Central to the argument that my investment thesis is wrong is the belief that the crisis is over or that the recent trends will continue until it is .
But the crisis is just beginning and the movements thus far in the dollar , commodities , and foreign stocks , are mere head fakes .
Once the speculators have been flushed from the markets , the underlying long - term trends I have been following should return in earnest .
To illustrate the flaws in my investment strategy the blogger has posted a client 's statement that shows a loss in excess of 60 % .
In addition , he claims to know of other Euro Pacific clients who have experienced similar losses .
The inference of course is that most , or all , of my clients must have suffered similar losses , and the existence of such losses proves that I am wrong .
In fact , some have gone a step further , claiming that such losses prove that I am a fraud .
First let 's deal with the one client 's account .
I have been following several key investment themes for the past ten years .
The basis for my strategy is that recent U.S. prosperity has been false , and that the consequences of the bursting of our bubble economy would ultimately play out in a substantial decline in the value of the U.S. dollar , higher commodity prices , the re-monetization of gold , and foreign equities substantially outperforming U.S. markets .
From an investment perspective , those themes played out extremely well in the eight years from 2000 - 2007 .
Recently we have seen a sharp , and I believe temporary , reversal of these trends .
Those that came late to the party ( at least based on where we are today ) now have to ride out a particularly difficult correction .
For example , the account in question belongs to the son of a long - standing Euro Pacific client , who is still adding funds to his accounts .
Without specially commenting on the performance of the father 's account , it must have been compelling enough to finally persuade the son to come on board himself in early 2008 .
However , as is often the case , by the time he came on board , foreign stocks and commodities were about to sell off , and the dollar was about to begin its unexpected rally .
Following such a sharp correction , the son now regrets his decision and must blame me for my part in helping him make it .
Perhaps as a stockbroker I should have persuaded the son to wait for a correction .
However , while this clearly would have been the right call with the full benefit of hind - sight , it was certainly not as clear given the information I had at the time .
However , I never held myself out to be a market timer .
My advice was always geared to long - term investors .
Given the thousands of clients that I have , and the large number who joined near the recent dollar peak and market tops , it 's no wonder that a few have contacted this blogger to complain ; especially since he has actively sought them out .
Of course , the fact that the overwhelming majority of my clients are not complaining , to him or anyone else for that matter , says a lot more about what is really going on .
To the extent that the long - term trends I have been following continue , I am confident that even those whose short - term timing was bad will still do well in time .
This is especially true if they take advantage of this pull back by adding to their accounts , either with new funds or by re-investing their dividends .
However , to examine the effectiveness of my investment strategy immediately following a major correction by looking only at those accounts who adopted the strategy at the previous peak is unfair and distortive .
Since I have been advising investors to follow these trends for ten years , I will leave it to the public to draw their own conclusions as to how long - term followers of my strategy have fared .
However , for those who only recently adopted my approach in 2007 or 2008 , the road has been a lot bumpier than they or I thought it would be when they climbed on board .
Yet if these long - term trends re-emerge , though the journey may be different than planned , the ultimate destination will remain the same .
The blogger in question implies that all of my clients are down by levels similar to the account he cites .
He has asked me to refute his allegations by providing broader performance figures for more clients .
But , since Euro Pacific Capital is a brokerage firm and not a Registered Investment Advisor , I am prohibited by regulators from providing any details on the investment performance achieved by my clients .
The blogger in question makes his challenge knowing full well that I am legally prevented from accepting it .
He then uses my failure to refute his false claim as validating its accuracy .
In addition , consider that 70 % of the account in question happens to be invested in mining and energy stocks .
These were the two sectors that got hit the hardest in the recent downturn .
This is a very aggressive exposure to those sectors and not typical of Euro Pacific clients .
While it is true that many of my clients are interested in these two sectors and specifically seek portfolios heavily weighted in these areas , most take a more balanced approach , with mining and energy typically representing 20 % to 30 % of their portfolios .
I also have clients with minimal or no exposure to these sectors .
All Euro Pacific client accounts are different reflecting the individual objectives of each client .
In general the goals of my clients are to get out of the dollar and hedge against inflation .
However the way each client chooses to pursue these goals varies .
Some choose a relatively conservative approach , consisting mainly of utilities , property trusts and bonds , others choice a more balanced approach , adding exposure to infrastructure , agriculture , energy trusts , and transportation , while some are more aggressive with heavy exposure to resources , junior mining companies , and oil and gas exploration companies .
Some clients specifically seek to gain or avoid exposure to certain regions , sectors or currencies .
Some are focused more on long - term preservation of purchasing power , while others look to maximize long - term appreciation .
Most of my accounts are yield oriented , but many of my clients specially request more aggressive growth oriented portfolios .
In a down market to evaluate my investment strategy based solely on the performance of the most aggressive accounts is completely unfair .
Doing so ignores the better performance of less aggressive accounts that were not hit nearly as hard .
In addition , to look only at the performance of foreign stocks , while ignoring other aspects of my investment strategy only tells part of the story .
What about gold , foreign bonds , short positions in financials , home builders and subprime mortgages ( or merely avoiding long exposure to those sectors ) , or other investments people have made , either at Euro Pacific or elsewhere based on my insights ?
What about dividends earned , or gains realized on closed positions ?
Mainstream economists , journalists , and investment professionals have never liked my message and have never resisted the temptation to shoot the messenger .
When my investment strategies were performing well , I got little credit for it .
Instead , all the attention was focused on the apparent failure of my dire economic predictions to materialize .
Now that the economy is collapsing along the lines that I correctly forecast , criticism is being focused on the recent poor performance of my investment strategy ( a fact that I have never tried to hide ) .
Of course by the time my investment strategy is once again in step with my economic forecasts , an event that I believe will occur sooner than most people think , it will likely be too late for most people to do adopt it .
My critics have often referred to me as a stopped clock .
I believe that the accusation is best leveled at the accusers .
Having been wrong for so long , they are now enjoying their brief moment in the sun .
They should enjoy it while it lasts .
For now , they are creating fodder for some future " Peter Schiff was Right " piece where those who now criticize my investment performance will look just as foolish as those who once criticized my economic forecasts .

Britney Spears ' Son Jayden Released From Hospital
What was supposed to be a family getaway to Kentwood , Louisiana turned into a frightening ordeal for .
The pop singers youngest son Jayden James was rushed to Mississippi Regional Medical Center on Sunday after having a " bad reaction " to something he ingested .
This was the first trip that Brit had taken with her children since her very public custody battle with ex husband Kevin Federline .
K- Fed was reportedly keeping close tabs on Jayden 's condition and was prepared to travel to Mississippi if his son had n't improved .
The good news is that Jayden was released from the medical facility last night and he and his mother Britney immediately returned to " Serenity " compound in Kentwood where the family resides .
Onlookers said that Brit looked completely worn out and who can blame her .
If you think the zombies that infest the Big Brother house in Dead Set are just products of Charlie Brooker 's fevered imagination – well , that 's just what the CIA wants you to think
Next week sees the airing of Dead Set , a five - part zombie thriller set in the Big Brother house and penned by Charlie Brooker .
But there 's more to zombies than fake blood and prosthetic peeling skin .
Reanimation , mind control and zombifying parasites are more real and more terrifying than any horror film .
Zombies made their debut in the world 's consciousness in 1889 via the pages of Harper 's Magazine .
A short article by amateur anthropologist Lafcadio Hearn reported stories of the corps cadavres – " the walking dead " – haunting the Caribbean nation of Haiti .
Almost 100 years later , Harvard ethnobotanist Wade Davis travelled to Haiti to investigate .
Writing about his experiences in The Serpent and the Rainbow , he claimed that tetrodotoxin , the poison of the deadly pufferfish , was the chemical agent responsible .
Using this drug , a voodoo priest known as a houngan could induce a death - like state in a victim , from which the victim was then partially revived and made to live as a mindless slave .
However , this does n't match the known pharmacology of tetrodotoxin , and to date there 's no hard evidence to support Davis 's claim .
By the time Davis 's book hit the shelves , the CIA had been engaged in its own zombie - creation scheme for over 30 years .
The clandestine Project MKULTRA was created in 1953 to develop the CIA 's interrogation , behaviour - modification and mind - control abilities .
This involved dosing unsuspecting subjects with drugs such as temazepam , mescaline , psilocybin and Sodium Pentothal ; more inventive techniques such as hypnosis , sub-aural frequency blasts , and sleep deprivation were also employed .
When details of MKULTRA surfaced there was a public outcry ; the programme was officially abandoned and all records ordered destroyed .
Whether the CIA ever discovered the zombie formula remains unknown .
Soviet scientists had their own zombie - themed research , retold in the snappily - titled 1940s video Experiments in the Revival of Organisms .
Although the veracity of the video is in question , the experiments it depicts – such as keeping a dog 's severed head alive with artificial circulation – are in keeping with research of the time .
This work would go one to inform procedures such as open - heart surgery and organ transplant , though Resident Evil - style zombie dogs were thankfully confined to the laboratory bench .
All this , however , pales in comparison to examples found in nature .
Parasitic species outnumber the free - living a mighty four to one , and display high proficiency in infecting and enslaving their hosts .
Take for instance the emerald cockroach wasp ( Ampulex compressa ) .
The female preys on cockroaches , driving her sting directly into the brain of the unfortunate insect .
The venom destroys the roach 's escape reflex ; it is then buried alive along with a single wasp egg .
Once hatched , the wasp larva burrows into its living host and devours it from the inside .
Infamous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer once attempted a similar feat , trepanning one of his victims and injecting acid into their brain to create a zombie , without success .
Another parasite , Toxoplasma gondii , infects rats and mice .
In order to reach its final host , a cat , the protozoan reprograms the host 's behaviour .
The rat becomes bolder , losing its instinctual fear of cats .
This foolhardy conduct ends up delivering it to the jaws of a passing cat , and the brain - warping parasite is passed on .
T gondii will infect just about any warm - blooded animal , including humans , and recent research shows it can modify our behaviour too .
Infected men become more suspicious , women become more outgoing .
Infected drivers are more likely to be involved in a car crash .
It 's estimated that 40 % of the world 's human population is infected via cat faeces .
So if you really want to find a mind - altered zombie , the best place to start looking might be a mirror .

Barack Obama chose a general sacked by the Bush administration for doubting its Iraq war strategy for his cabinet yesterday to appeal to leftwing supporters .
Obama , in announcing the selection of Eric Shinseki , as veterans ' affairs secretary , made it clear that he saw the choice as vindication of a general whose advice - had it been heeded - could have reduced the toll of the Iraq war .
Shinseki , who was army chief of staff only to be disregarded and later vilified by Pentagon chief at the time , Donald Rumsfeld , and the deputy defence secretary , Paul Wolfowitz , for telling Congress in February 2003 that keeping order in Iraq after the invasion would need several hundred thousand troops .
" No one will ever doubt that this former army chief of staff has the courage to stand up for our troops and our veterans , " Obama told a press conference in Chicago announcing the appointment yesterday .
The choice of Shinseki could go some way in satisfying opponents of the Iraq war disappointed at the appointment of Hillary Clinton , who voted for the invasion , as secretary of state , and the decision to keep on George Bush 's Pentagon chief , Robert Gates .
It was announced on a day when Obama offered his bleakest assessment to date of the economic crisis .
" The economy is going to get worse before it gets better , " he told NBC television .
He announced the biggest public works expenditure in half a century in his weekly radio on video address on Saturday , saying there would be projects to improve roads and bridges , make public schools more energy efficient , and computerise medical records .
He said he was focused on projects that would create the most jobs in short order , saying the economy was like a critically ill patient who needed a blood transfusion for survival .
Shinseki , 66 , is a decorated combat veteran and lost most of his right foot in Vietnam .
He is the highest ranking general of Asian - American descent , and his cabinet announcement appeared timed yesterday to coincide with the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbour .
The general earned the wrath of Rumsfeld when he told Congress that it might take several hundred thousand US troops to control Iraq after the invasion .
The deputy defence secretary , Paul Wolfowitz , said Shinseki 's assessment was " wildly off the mark " .
Both men boycotted Shinseki 's retirement ceremony .
George Bush acknowledged Shinseki was correct when he ordered the surge into Iraq in 2007 .
His appointment was seen yesterday as further vindication .
" It was wrong for the Bush Administration to mistreat him the way it did , " Carl Levin , the chairman of the armed services committee told Fox television .
He said the choice of Shinseki was a signal that Obama would tolerate dissenting views .
Richard Shelby , a Republican Senator for Alabama , also praised the choice .
It could also shore up morale among veterans .
The Bush Administration has been accused of underestimating the numbers of wounded soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan .
Thousands of Afghan villagers across Laghman Province rallied to protest against the latest incident of US troops killing innocent civilians .
Protesters condemned both the US forces and President Hamid Karzai ’s government , demanding that troops end a military operation that killed around 1,100 civilians in 2008 alone .
The latest incident started , as so many do , with international forces claiming to have killed 15 militants and no civilians .
Yet villagers pointed out that many of the “ militants ” were women and children and reported as many as 21 civilian bodies found across the area .
Today , President Karzai confirmed that the US raid in fact killed at least 16 civilians , and cautioned that the continued killing of innocent Afghans is “ strengthening the terrorists . ”
The enormous civilian toll in the seven - plus year war has caused considerable tension between the international forces and the Karzai government .
Reports are that even as the killings undermine confidence in the Karzai government the United States is already eying his potential ouster in the next election .
The iPhone twang : Google 's new voice recognition tool stumped by British accents
Divided :
It 's great if you 're American , but Brits are struggling with Google 's new voice recognition service for the iPhone
Google 's new voice recognition search engine for the iPhone has hit a glitch - it is stumped by British accents .
The application developed in the U.S can not recognise regional twangs .
Users say the technology mistook the word ' iPhone ' for ' sex , ' ' Einstein ' and even ' kitchen sink ' .
The Google Mobile App is designed to work just like the traditional search engine .
Rather than typing a query on the iPhone , users speak their search term and then view the results on the screen .
Saying the word pizza should spring up a selection of local pizza restaurants and invite you to call them with a single click of the phone .
And uttering ' Barack Obama ' should bring you all the latest Google results about the new U.S. president .
But one user with a Kentish accent was clearly unhappy with his experience .
When Roger Ellinson , 26 , from Maidstone asked for her nearest pizza take away , it delivered ' something about volcanoes . '
Asked about his nearest pub , the screen flashed up ' some kind of weird dating website . '
' I 'll have to try to put on my best American accent to get it to work , ' he concluded .
Online forums have shown a dramatic trans -Atlantic divide in response , with US users waxing lyrical about the service but British users stumped .
A user from Lincolnshire said his Irish lilt was a drawback .
' Irish obviously is n't the best accent to have .
I tried about 20 different 2 - 4 word phrases and not one came out right , ' he wrote .
But a spokesman for Google said the tool is not designed for UK accents .
He said : ' The product is for U.S. English .
You 're welcome to use it , but we can't guarantee it'll work with British accents . '
Cheney unhappy with Bush : Where was Libby pardon ?
Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday January 22 , 2009
Print This Email This George W. Bush was widely expected to grant a large number of pardons during his final days in office , but almost none were forthcoming .
The non-pardon of I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby for his role in revealing the identity of former CIA officer Valerie Plame may prove to be be the most controversial of these omissions -- at least if former Vice President Dick Cheney and his supporters have anything to say in the matter .
According to conservative columnist and Cheney biographer Stephen F. Hayes , writing in the Weekly Standard , " Bush 's decision not to pardon Libby has angered many of the president 's strongest defenders .
One Libby sympathizer , a longtime defender of Bush , told friends she was ' disgusted ' by the president .
Another described Bush as ' dishonorable ' and a third suggested that refusing to pardon Libby was akin to leaving a soldier on the battlefield . "
Hayes quotes Cheney himself as saying , " Scooter Libby is one of the most capable and honorable men I 've ever known .
He 's been an outstanding public servant throughout his career .
He was the victim of a serious miscarriage of justice , and I strongly believe that he deserved a presidential pardon .
Obviously , I disagree with President Bush 's decision . "
Hayes is the author of the official biography of Cheney and appears to be representing Cheney 's position in this current article .
He is also a leading proponent of the theory -- often expressed by Cheney -- that there was a working alliance between al Qaeda and Iraq .
In his article , Hayes recites the standard arguments for why Libby should never have been convicted , such as the assertion that it was actually former deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage who first mentioned Plame to reporters .
It 's true that Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was never able to establish responsibility for the original crime of outing Plame , complaining instead that " when someone charges obstruction of justice , the umpire gets sand thrown in his eyes .
He 's trying to figure what happened and somebody blocked their view . "
That is why Libby was convicted instead on four counts relating to the cover - up , including obstructing the investigation , lying under oath , and lying to the FBI about how he learned Plame 's identity and who else he told .
At the time of Plame 's outing in July 2003 , Libby was Cheney 's chief of staff and assistant for national security affairs , and there was widespread speculation during the investigation that he had lied to protect his boss .
Former Watergate conspirator John Dean wrote -- somewhat over - optimistically -- in 2005 that " when one studies the indictment , and carefully reads the transcript of the press conference , it appears Libby 's saga may be only Act Two in a three - act play .
And in my view , the person who should be tossing and turning at night , in anticipation of the last act , is the Vice President of the United States , Richard B. Cheney . "
In 2007 , emptywheel suggested at The Next Hurrah , " I do believe Fitzgerald intended to argue that Libby obstructed justice to hide Cheney 's role -- at least before Libby called Cheney to testify ( though I still think it 's likely ) .
Just in the snippet of Libby 's grand jury testimony we 've seen , Libby makes completely implausible arguments to say that Cheney was n't involved in smearing Plame - - until after Novak 's column .
...
All of this addresses the ' what ' Libby was obstructing -- what facts was he trying to hide when he threw sand in the grand jury 's eyes ? "
Hayes further argues for Libby 's innocence by describing his conviction as the outcome of a " highly charged political fight " between the CIA and the Bush administration .
He claims , " The entire chain of events that led to Libby 's conviction started with a lie from Joseph Wilson , Plame 's husband , who claimed to have debunked forged documents related to intelligence reports on Iraq , Niger and uranium .
But Wilson , who was sent by the CIA to investigate the reports after his wife recommended him , could not have discredited the reports as forgeries because the U.S. government did not yet possess them at the time he made his trip . "
In fact , Wilson never claimed " to have debunked false documents , " but merely reported that his trip to Africa early in 2002 had undermined allegations -- which the Bush administration had received from Italian intelligence -- about Saddam Hussen seeking to buy uranium in Niger .
Identical claims later resurfaced in the form of the forged Niger documents , which the administration relied upon extensively in its final push for war with Iraq , begining in October 2002 .
In his Jul. 6 2003 op - ed for the New York Times , " What I Didn't Find in Africa , " Wilson made it clear that he had never seen the forged documents -- and he may not even have realized that they were not yet in existence at the time of his trip .
He wrote :
" In February 2002 , I was informed by officials at the Central Intelligence Agency that Vice President Dick Cheney 's office had questions about a particular intelligence report .
While I never saw the report , I was told that it referred to a memorandum of agreement that documented the sale of uranium yellowcake -- a form of lightly processed ore -- by Niger to Iraq in the late 1990's .
The agency officials asked if I would travel to Niger to check out the story so they could provide a response to the vice president 's office .
. . .
( As for the actual memorandum , I never saw it .
But news accounts have pointed out that the documents had glaring errors -- they were signed , for example , by officials who were no longer in government -- and were probably forged . ) "
Hayes acknowledges that Bush may actually believe Libby was guilty , but he also goes on to suggest that Bush may have refrained from pardoning him because of a " less defensible " concern with public opinion .
He quotes Nancy Pelosi as saying that Bush is " very proud " of not having finished his termin office by pardoning " people who have influence or know friends in high places . "
Hayes concludes by noting , " Of the four times that Cheney had publicly disagreed with Bush - - on a gay marriage ban ; on firing Donald Rumsfeld ; on Washington , D.C. 's gun ban ; and on North Korea -- two of them involved personal loyalty Cheney felt to someone other than the president .
On one occasion it was his daughter , Mary Cheney , and on the other it was his longtime mentor , Donald Rumsfeld .
Libby makes it three . "
Boris Johnson has pledged an initial £ 15,000 towards the cost of mounting a legal challenge if ministers go ahead with plans to build a third runway at Heathrow , and may pay more if needed .
The mayor of London and a coalition of 21 local authorities representing 4 million people believe the expansion of Heathrow would breach EU laws on pollution .
The transport secretary , Geoff Hoon , is expected to give the green light to the scheme next month , which would see a new runway in place by 2030 and expand the number of flights at Heathrow from 480,000 to 700,000 a year .
A spokesman for Johnson said that the mayor and the 2 M group of local authorities against Heathrow expansion would analyse the government 's decision to determine whether there was a basis for legal action .
The spokesman said : " As the representative of every Londoner , the mayor has agreed to make a contribution to the funds 2 M is raising to cover the possible costs of a legal challenge . "
The spokesman said the business case for the runway expansion did not outweigh " concerns for the local environment in terms of noise and air quality " .
" The mayor is anxious to ensure that the concerns of Londoners whose environment would be affected by a further expansion of Heathrow are fully addressed , " the spokesman said .
" He is also keen that a thorough examination of the long - delayed results of the government 's consultation and environmental tests takes place . "
The case for a potential judicial review is likely to rest on whether EU air pollution limits would be breached as a result of the expansion .
The government white paper said approval would be given only if the runway met noise and environmental standards .
But critics , including the Environment Agency , say the extra nitrogen dioxide emissions produced by expansion will breach EU limits which come into force in 2010 .
The 2M leaders have already been to Strasbourg to brief the EU 's environment commissioner , Stavros Dimas , on the matter .
Hilary Benn , the environment secretary , has confirmed that the government will seek permission to postpone compliance until 2015 .
The Conservative party nationally is vehemently against the third runway .
Theresa Villiers , the shadow transport secretary , has gone as far as to warn companies not sign any contracts related to building the runway .
The Tories instead want to link Heathrow up to a high - speed rail network , leading to Birmingham , Leeds and Manchester .
Villiers has also poured cold water on her fellow Tory Johnson 's plans for a new airport in the Thames Estuary , however .
Johnson has set Doug Oakervee , an experienced engineer and executive chair of Crossrail , the task of leading the Greater London authority 's preliminary feasibility study into a new site to accommodate growing demand for flights .

When we use a toaster , or a sweater , or a word processing software package , we have certain functional expectations .
A toaster should caramelize bread evenly and consistently .
A sweater should keep a body warm without fraying or stretching out from repeated use .
A word processor should help automate the crafting of documents without requiring specialized expertise .
Some of our expectations of such objects are cosmetic .
We like our toasters to match the décor in our kitchens , our sweaters to be woven with the colors and styles of the current season .
But the history of software as a tool for work has made most cosmetic demands for software relate to matters of usability : buttons and menus should be in convenient locations , actions should feel consistent and predictable , conventions set by previous iterations of a software package should be respected , even if lightly refined .
Windows and Mirrors
In the field of human - computer interaction ( HCI ) , these values of software design are sometimes grouped under the term " transparency . "
A good software tool , like a good toaster , is supposed to show us exactly how it should be used and then meet our expectations as users immediately and consistently .
Jay Bolter and Diane Gromala have suggested a different way to look at software , especially software that seeks to explore ideas rather than to serve as tools .
Bolter and Gromala point out that the concept of transparency casts software as a window -- a clear surface that seeks to disappear as it reveals a functional affordance .
This conception works well for tools but poorly for art .
Instead , the two suggest another metaphor , a mirror .
Unlike a window , a mirror 's job is to reflect back on its users , to give them a new perspective on themselves and their place in the world .
Video games are software , but they are not meant to serve the same function as spreadsheets .
They are not tools that provide a specific and solitary end , but experiences that spark ideas and proffer sensations .
Sure , video games have interfaces , like toasters have browning levers , like sweaters have cuffs , like word processors have font menus .
But too often we mistake the demands of these interfaces ( and the in - game actions they facilitate ) with the actions of tools .
We gripe when a game does n't do what we expect , rather than asking what such an unexpected demand means in the context of the game .
[ From Creative Loafing . ]
As we predicted before the election , Barack Obama 's victory has loosed a flood of hatefulness from the racist right in America .
Digby yesterday had a detailed post laying out some of the cases that have erupted so far .
From an AP report :
Threats against a new president historically spike right after an election , but from Maine to Idaho law enforcement officials are seeing more against Barack Obama than ever before .
The Secret Service would not comment or provide the number of cases they are investigating .
But since the Nov. 4 election , law enforcement officials have seen more potentially threatening writings , Internet postings and other activity directed at Obama than has been seen with any past president - elect , said officials aware of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because the issue of a president 's security is so sensitive .
From the Christian Science Monitor :
In rural Georgia , a group of high - schoolers gets a visit from the Secret Service after posting " inappropriate " comments about President - elect Barack Obama on the Web .
In Raleigh , N.C. , four college students admit to spraying race - tinged graffiti in a pedestrian tunnel after the election .
On Nov. 6 , a cross burns on the lawn of a biracial couple in Apolacon Township , Pa .
The election of America 's first black president has triggered more than 200 hate - related incidents , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center – a record in modern presidential elections .
Moreover , the white nationalist movement , bemoaning an election that confirmed voters ' comfort with a multiracial demography , expects Mr. Obama 's election to be a potent recruiting tool – one that watchdog groups warn could give new impetus to a mostly defanged fringe element .
I talked to the SPLC's Mark Potok this morning , and here are his observations :
I think there 's something remarkable happening out there .
I think we really are beginning to see a white backlash that may grow fairly large .
The situation 's worrying .
Not only do we have continuing nonwhite immigration , not only is the economy in the tank and very likely to get worse , but we have a black man in the White House .
That is driving a kind of rage in a certain sector of the white population that is very , very worrying to me .
We are seeing literally hundreds of incidents around the country -- from cross-burnings to death threats to effigies hanging to confrontations in schoolyards , and it 's quite remarkable .
I think that there are political leaders out there who are saying incredibly irresponsible things that could have the effect of undamming a real flood of hate .
That includes media figures .
On immigration , they have been some of the worst .
There 's a lot going on , and it 's very likely to lead to scapegoating .
And in the end , scapegoating leaves corpses in the street .
According to that AP piece , neo - Nazi Web entities like Stormfront have seen a serious spike in business :
One of the most popular white supremacist Web sites got more than 2,000 new members the day after the election , compared with 91 new members on Election Day , according to an AP count .
The site , stormfront.org , was temporarily off - line Nov. 5 because of the overwhelming amount of activity it received after Election Day .
On Saturday , one Stormfront poster , identified as Dalderian Germanicus , of North Las Vegas , said , " I want the SOB laid out in a box to see how ' messiahs ' come to rest .
God has abandoned us , this country is doomed . "
That theme comes popping up a lot :
Grant Griffin , a 46 - year - old Georgia native who is white , expressed similar sentiments .
" I believe our nation is ruined and has been for several decades , and the election of Obama is merely the culmination of the change , " Griffin said .
Last week Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass created a bit of a stir by relaying the story of a Chicago teen who decided to try an experiment in tolerance by wearing a T - shirt emblazoned with the words " McCain Girl " to her high school , where Barack Obama was widely favored as a hometown hero .
She got something of an ugly reception -- mostly she was told she was stupid , while some fellow students went so far as to tell her she should die .
While it 's not terribly surprising -- passions often run high during political campaigns , and people say and do stupid things in the process , on both sides of the aisle -- it should go without saying that this kind of ugliness does not reflect well on the supposed liberals venting it .
If nothing else , it makes them look decidedly illiberal in their intolerance .
However , the flip side -- the violence - laced , vile hatred emanating from Obama haters around the country -- is already dwarfing this intolerance .
Yet you have to wonder if Kass and the right - wing pundits who made the teen 's story a cause celebre will even bother taking a look .
With Barack Obama busy building his administration , Republicans gathered Thursday to discuss ways to make him a one - term president and turn back a rising Democratic tide .
There was plenty of disagreement over how to do that .
The setting was a gloomy meeting of the Republican Governors Assn. , which drew 17 of the party ’s state executives .
Not incidentally , it also served as an early audition for the 2012 election , just about 1,450 days away .
Half a dozen or so White House prospects , led by Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , circulated at a luxury hotel alongside choppy Biscayne Bay , giving interviews , shaking hands , delivering speeches and offering varied analyses on the meaning of last week ’s election .
In one camp were the likes of Haley Barbour , Mississippi governor and longtime GOP strategist , who recalled the Republican renaissance that followed Watergate , then Bill Clinton ’s 1992 election .

“ I have seen a lot worse , folks , ” Barbour told an audience of about 150 governors , political aides and party benefactors .
“ I actually think McCain got a tremendous vote . ”
By this accounting , the GOP ’s biggest problems on Nov. 4 were the dead weight of a prolonged war , an unpopular president and an economic crisis exploding weeks before election day .
( A few blamed the messenger .
“ In terms of delivery , Stevie Wonder reads a teleprompter better than John McCain , ” strategist Frank Luntz said . )
Others , however , see a much graver problem .
They say the party has failed to change with technology , allowing Democrats to rule the Internet ; has betrayed core principles such as fiscal prudence ; and has lost its standing with a frightening number of voter groups .
“ The Republican Party ’s going to need more than a comb- over , ” Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty told reporters after Barbour spoke .
Advertisement
Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. agreed .
“ I ’m not one who buys the idea that it ’s just an aberration , ” he said .
There were other differences , which are likely to shape the eventual fight for the Republican nomination .
During Wednesday ’s opening lunch , Pawlenty -- a finalist to join McCain on the GOP ticket -- dismissed one of Palin ’s signature lines by calling for an expansive approach to energy development .
“ ‘ Drill , baby , drill , ’ is not , by itself , an energy policy , ” Pawlenty said .

Texas Gov. Rick Perry , speaking to reporters , cited the passage of measures banning same - sex marriage in California , Arizona and Florida as proof “ that conservative values still matter to the American people . ”
“ They ’re worthy of our party ’s attention , commitment .
Our effort , ” Perry said .
But Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , who has charted a more moderate course , warned against focusing too much on divisive social policy .
“ Those issues are very important , but there are a lot of issues people care deeply about that affect their lives in a real way every single day , ” Crist told reporters after he gave Thursday night ’s banquet speech .
He had supported the same - sex marriage ban but declined to campaign on its behalf .
“ Right now , with this economy , there ’s no question in my mind those are pocketbook issues . ”
Advertisement
Overall , the mood of the meeting was summarized , mordantly , at one of the opening sessions .
“ I understand how Dr. Kevorkian feels at an AARP convention , ” Luntz told the audience .
The news for Republicans on Nov. 4 was almost unremittingly bleak .
The party suffered its worst back - to - back election defeats since the Great Depression , surrendering not just the White House and broad swaths of once - loyal GOP turf but also losing at least 26 seats in Congress .
Just a third of voters identified themselves as Republican , according to exit polls , the lowest proportion since 1986 .
( Forty percent identified themselves as Democrats . )
Worse , from the GOP ’s perspective , McCain lost overwhelmingly among Latinos and voters age 18 to 29 , two groups that will probably gain influence in elections to come .
“ We can not be a majority governing party when we essentially cannot compete in the Northeast .
We are losing our ability to compete in Great Lake states ; we cannot compete on the West Coast , ” Pawlenty said in his speech .
Advertisement
A bright spot was the performance of the nation ’s Republican governors .
Although their ranks will shrink by one in January , to 21 , no GOP incumbent was defeated .
Finding solace where they could , party leaders gave a plum speaking slot to Luis G. Fortuno , who will become Puerto Rico ’s first Republican governor since 1968 ; “ a powerful message , ” Perry said .
There is perpetual tension between state executives , who see themselves as closest to the people they represent , and their elected counterparts in Washington .
The animus was all the more pronounced in Miami , given the wreckage the party faces .
“ Americans have lost confidence in national Republican leaders after years of pork - barrel spending and special interests calling the shots , ” said Perry , chairman of the governors group .
“ The election results at the federal level were no surprise to those of us at the state level who have managed to avoid that D.C. culture . ”
Given those sentiments , it is little wonder that one speaker after another declared that the next president was seated somewhere in their midst -- though interested parties were coy enough to avoid touting themselves .

“ Let the pundits go on with their idle talk about the next election , what happens in 2012 , ” said Palin , who delivered Thursday ’s keynote address .
“ Our concern should be about our states . . . and on issues like taxes and energy and healthcare , immigration , education . ”
Palin made only a few appearances at the meeting in between national TV interviews , but still managed to overshadow her peers .
She attracted more than two dozen TV cameras and 100 - plus reporters for a news conference Thursday morning , where 12 fellow governors stood on stage as a silent backdrop .
Palin repeatedly extolled the governors organization .
She then answered four questions , offering more praise for the group , before the session was abruptly cut off .

The 2012 talk is already starting

Republican governors are in Miami this week to pick over the wreckage of Nov. 4 .
For a handful , the meeting is a chance to test the waters for a 2012 presidential run .
Here are five GOP governors to watch .
Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels did not attend the three - day gathering , but his reelection has some observers talking up his prospects .
CHARLIE CRIST
Florida
Elected : 2006 , 52 % of the vote .
He faces reelection in 2010 .
Advertisement
Major achievements : Imposed strict air pollution standards and pursued policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Pushed legislation to expand the availability and affordability of healthcare .
Has pursued bipartisanship and fostered a less combative atmosphere in the Capitol .
Worked to open state government to greater media and public scrutiny .
Political outlook :
If the GOP moves more toward the middle , Crist could be the party ’s centrist standard - bearer .
But he first needs to win reelection and ease hard feelings among some fellow Republicans because John McCain lost Florida .

MITCH DANIELS

Indiana
Elected : Reelected on Nov. 4 , 58 % of the vote .
Major achievements : Passed major property tax relief and a measure to provide healthcare to 200,000 low - income residents by raising the cigarette tax .
Also passed legislation to help fund full - day kindergarten and privatize state highway operations .
Pushed the state to adopt daylight saving time , a move praised by employers but criticized by many residents .
Political outlook :
Although he is a hero to the economically conservative wing of the Republican Party , it remains to be seen whether privatization and a push for less government holds much appeal to a broader audience in a time of economic turmoil , which many blame on insufficient oversight of Wall Street and capitalist buccaneers .

BOBBY JINDAL
Louisiana
Elected : 2007 , 54 % of the vote .
Advertisement
Major achievements : Passed ethics legislation and cut business and personal taxes .
Ushered in legislation giving teachers more control over classroom discipline and creating tougher penalties for sex offenders .
Credited with overseeing a smooth evacuation before Hurricane Gustav in August .
Political outlook : A living embodiment of the American Dream , the 37 - year - old son of Indian immigrants looks like no other Republican on the national scene , which could be an asset as the party strives to remake its image and reach out to minorities and young people .
But running for president is unlike anything Jindal has attempted .
Ask Sarah Palin how tough a national campaign can be .

SARAH PALIN

Alaska
Elected : 2006 , 48.3 % of the vote .
Faces reelection in 2010 .
Major achievements : Overhaul of Alaska ’s ethics law and passage of bipartisan legislation to boost state taxes on oil companies .
Pushed for development of a natural gas pipeline linking Alaska to the lower 48 states , though questions have arisen about the bidding process and whether the pipeline will be finished .
Political outlook :
As the GOP vice presidential nominee , she built a strong following among social conservatives but put off many others -- including fellow Republicans -- and proved a drag on running mate John McCain .
Apart from governing Alaska , she will probably have to spend the next several years on a rehabilitation effort , which began shakily at this week ’s governors meeting .

TIM PAWLENTY
Minnesota
Elected : Reelected 2006 , 47 % of the vote .
Advertisement
Major achievements : Enacted tougher penalties for methamphetamine manufacturing and sexual predators .
Signed into law an abortion waiting period and concealed - weapons law .
Established several tax - free zones in distressed areas to spur job growth .
Backed rules requiring utilities to use more alternative fuels .
Has promoted drug importation from Canada as a way to reduce prescription prices .
Political outlook : After making McCain ’s short list for vice president , Pawlenty barely suppressed his disappointment at being passed over .
Ambitious and articulate , he has a blue - collar background that ’s a plus as the party works to expand .
He has struggled for support in Democratic - leaning Minnesota .
Nationally , GOP voters may be more receptive .

KEVIN RUDD has denounced the unfettered capitalism of the past three decades and called for a new era of " social capitalism " in which government intervention and regulation feature heavily .
In an essay to be published next week , the Prime Minister is scathing of the neo-liberals who began refashioning the market system in the 1970s , and ultimately brought about the global financial crisis .
" The time has come , off the back of the current crisis , to proclaim that the great neo-liberal experiment of the past 30 years has failed , that the emperor has no clothes , " he writes of those who placed their faith in the corrective powers of the market .
" Neo-liberalism and the free - market fundamentalism it has produced has been revealed as little more than personal greed dressed up as an economic philosophy .
And , ironically , it now falls to social democracy to prevent liberal capitalism from cannibalising itself . "
Mr Rudd writes in The Monthly that just as Franklin Roosevelt rebuilt US capitalism after the Great Depression , modern - day " social democrats " such as himself and the US President , Barack Obama , must do the same again .
But he argues that " minor tweakings of long - established orthodoxies will not do " and advocates a new system that reaches beyond the 70 - year - old interventionist principles of John Maynard Keynes .

Strategic video game improves critical cognitive skills in older adults
12/11/2008
Diana Yates , Life Sciences Editor

Click photo to enlarge Photo by L. Brian Stauffer Illinois psychology professor Arthur Kramer and postdoctoral researcher Chandramallika Basak found that several important cognitive skills improved in older adults who were trained in a strategic video game .
CHAMPAIGN , Ill . —
A desire to rule the world may be a good thing if you ’re over 60 and worried about losing your mental faculties .
A new study found that adults in their 60s and 70s can improve a number of cognitive functions by playing a strategic video game that rewards nation - building and territorial expansion .
This is the first such study of older adults , and it is the first to find such pronounced effects on cognitive skills not directly related to the skills learned in the video game , said University of Illinois psychology professor Arthur Kramer , an author on the study .
The research appears this month in the journal Psychology & Aging .
Decades of laboratory studies designed to improve specific cognitive skills , such as short - term memory , have found again and again that trainees improve almost exclusively on the tasks they perform in the lab – and only under laboratory conditions , Kramer said .
“ When you train somebody on a task they tend to improve in that task , whatever it is , but it usually does n’t transfer much beyond that skill or beyond the particular situation in which they learned it , ” he said .
“ And there are virtually no studies that examine whether there ’s any transfer outside the lab to things people care about . ”
Kramer and his colleagues wanted to know whether a more integrated training approach could go beyond the training environment to enhance the cognitive skills used in everyday life .
Specifically , the researchers wondered whether interactive video games might benefit those cognitive functions that decline most with age .
“ Older people tend to fare less well on things that are called executive control processes , ” Kramer said .
“ These include things like scheduling , planning , working memory , multitasking and dealing with ambiguity . ”
After testing several video games , the researchers selected “ Rise of Nations , ” which gives gamers points for building cities and “ wonders , ” feeding and employing their people , maintaining an adequate military and expanding their territory .
“ You need merchants , ” said postdoctoral researcher Chandramallika Basak , lead author on the study .
“ You need an army to protect yourself and you have to make sure you ’re spending some of your resources on education and food .
This game stresses a lot on resource management and planning , which I think for older adults is important because many of them independently plan and manage their resources . ”
The study included 40 older adults , half of whom received 23.5 hours of training in “ Rise of Nations . ”
The others , a comparison group , received no training in the game .
Both groups were assessed before , during and after the video - game training on a variety of tests designed to measure executive control functions .
The tests included measures of their ability to switch between tasks , their short - term visual memory , their reasoning skills and their working memory , which is the ability to hold two or more pieces of information in memory and use the information as needed .
There were also tests of the subjects ’ verbal recall , their ability to inhibit certain responses and their ability to identify an object that had been rotated to a greater or lesser degree from its original position .
The researchers found that training on the video game did improve the participants ’ performance on a number of these tests .
As a group , the gamers became significantly better – and faster – at switching between tasks compared with the comparison group .
Their working memory , as reflected in the tests , also was significantly improved .
Their reasoning ability was enhanced .
To a lesser extent , their short - term memory of visual cues was better than that of their peers , as was their ability to identify rotated objects .
The video - game training had no effect on their ability to recall a list of words in order , their enumeration ability or their ability to inhibit certain responses , however .
There was a correlation between their performance on the game and their improvement on certain cognitive tests , Kramer said .
Those who did well in the game also improved the most on switching between tasks .
They also tended to do better on tests of working memory .
“ In medical terminology , these would be dose - response effects , ” Kramer said .
“ The more drug – or in this case the more training on the video game – the more benefit . ”
The findings are meaningful , Basak said , because they show that multi-dimensional training can affect many individual components of cognitive function .
“ The fact that you ’re training people in a molecule and finding transfer to atoms I think is very impressive , ” she said .
“ This is one mode in which older people can stay mentally fit , cognitively fit , ” Kramer said .
“ I ’m not suggesting , however , that it ’s the only thing they should do . ”
Other activities , in particular socializing , exercising and eating well , are also important to maintaining healthy cognitive function in later years , he said .
This research was supported by grants from the National Institute on Aging .
The authors received no monetary or other support from the video - game industry .

The Arizona senator has been limited to spending $ 84 million for the general election campaign after he accepted federal funds under a program created after the Watergate scandal .
Obama initially indicated he would adhere to the same limit , but reversed course and became the first post - Watergate candidate to finance a general - election campaign with private funding .

The humble computer mouse celebrates its 40th anniversary today .
On 9 December 1968 hi-tech visionary Douglas Engelbart first used one to demonstrate novel ways of working with computers .
The first mouse that Dr Engelbart used in the demo at the Fall Joint Computer Conference ( FJCC ) was made of wood and had one button .
Much of the technology shown off in the demo inspired the creation of the hardware and software now widely used .
" It was a good show , but it was all real , " said Dr Jeff Rulifson , now director of Sun 's VLSI research group but in 1968 architect and lead programmer for the software shown off at the FJCC .

Advertisement Pioneering work A day of celebration is planned in California to mark the 40th anniversary ; with many of the researchers behind the original demo reunited to mark the event .
The mouse , which was built by Bill English , helped Dr Engelbart demonstrate how text files could be clipped , copied and pasted as well as showing ways of using computer networks to collaborate on projects or co-edit documents .
Dr Rulifson joined the group that Dr Engelbart assembled at the Stanford Research Institute in California after meeting the charismatic engineer while attending the FJCC in 1965 .
Douglas Engelbart had a clear vision of how computers should help people " I met Doug and got thoroughly enchanted , " Dr Rulifson told the BBC .
" I really understood what he was after .
I was blown away by the ideas . "
Dr Engelbart wanted computers to act as helpers that augmented human intelligence and enabled people to operate far more efficiently and productively than they would without such tools .
The 1968 demonstration showed off the computer system , called NLS , developed to put these ideas into practical form .
Most of this , said Dr Rulifson , had to be invented by the team at SRI .
" There were bits and pieces all around , " he said .
" There was no completely unique set of ideas but we pulled it all together . "
Although the mouse was central to what NLS could do , said Dr Rulifson , there was more to what Dr Engelbart wanted to achieve .
" I think people get fixated on the mouse , " he said .
" It 's a symbol they can hang on to but the idea behind it was this idea of putting text into NLS and giving it an entirely new flexibility . "
" We had full text editing and hyperlinks - the mass of what we use today , " said Dr Rulifson .
In the 1968 demo Dr Rulifson was at the SRI Lab and appeared on screen in Brooks Hall auditorium while helping Dr Engelbart to show how co-workers could use NLS to collaborate .
The demo was so far ahead of other uses of computers at the time and the technology on show was so powerfully convincing that one attendee later likened Dr Engelbart 's efforts to " dealing lightning with both hands " .
Command set
Not only did NLS impress the audience at the FJCC , but it also became the first program scheduled to be used across the fledgling Arpanet that was just being built .
NLS is mentioned in the first RFC - the technical documents that describe the workings of what we know today as the internet .

In 1969 SRI , along with UCLA , was one of the two ends of the first link in the network that became Arpanet - and ultimately the internet .
Sadly , said Dr Rulifson , NLS did not win enough people over to become the essential tool that Dr Engelbart envisioned .
" I think what happened was that Doug was very focused on extremely powerful systems for extremely highly - trained people , " he said .
" NLS had 500 single key commands . "
Learning how to use NLS was a formidable task that few took on - despite its potential .
Many of the people that worked with Dr Engelbart at SRI went on to Xerox Parc - another legendary lab in California where many contributed directly to the technologies that led to the personal computer revolution and the world wide web .
Only now is Doug Engelbart 's vision starting to be realised , said Dr Rulifson , and the world has yet to catch up with the ideas first aired in 1968 .
" Half the vision has come along , " said Dr Rulifson .
" We could see the day when these things would be small enough to carry about .
" But , " he added , " Doug was very frustrated with the stuff that grew up around the PC , because it 's too static and paper - like . "

Ejemplos
Se presentan ejemplos para varios lenguajes y un breve proceso de pensamiento .
Frances
Some French speaking places treat 0 as plural while others treat it as singular .
The only other singular is 1 while everything else is plural .
So pick either plural rule # 1 or # 2 .
pluralRule=2
seconds=seconde;secondes
minutes=minute ; minutes
hours=heure ; heures
days=jour ; jours
Like many other times when localizing words , gender agreement might force you to rearrange words in a way that the gender is always the same .
( seconde vs jour )
Chino
A word does n't change if there is a different number in front of it , so all numbers use the same plural form .
With just one plural form , it has to be plural rule # 0 .
For each word to localize , it 's just like localizing a single word with no semi-colons needed .
pluralRule=0
seconds= ?
minutes= ?
hours= ?
days= ?
Polaco
There 's a singular form for 1 , a plural form for 2 - 4 , and another for 5 - 21 at which point 22 is the same as 2 .
Plural rule # 7 has a " ends in 2 - 4 , not 12 - 14 " but the singular form includes everything ending in 1 except 11 .
Plural rule # 9 has the correct singular form for only 1 .
pluralRule=9
seconds=sekunda;sekundy ; sekund
minutes=minuta ; minuty ; minut
hours=godzina;godziny ; godzin
days=dzien ;dni;dni
Even though the last 2 plural forms of " day " are the same , both are still needed because there needs to be 3 plural forms for each word .
Sorabo
There are 4 plural forms : nominative singular , nominative dual , nominative plural , genitive plural .
These match up with plural rule # 10 .
pluralRule=10
seconds=sekunda;sekundze;sekundy ; sekundow
minutes=mjenšina;mjenšinje;mjenšiny;mjenšin
hours=hodzina;hodzinje;hodziny ;hodzin

To help make sure you pick the right plural rule and provide enough plural forms for strings , you should use the pluralForm Checker extension .
After installing the extension , it should be available from the Tools menu .
To use it , list off the property files and properties that you want to check and click the button .
The extension will load each property and display the plural forms in a table .
Selecting a table entry will populate the bottom box with sample uses of the word for some numbers .
Install pluralForm Checker v0.3 extension
Extension input
It would be good to keep this list updated with all the words that need plural forms .
People using the extension can then copy / paste this input .

Version history
0.1 : Initial version with pluralRule check , properties input loading , table generation , sample output display
0.2 : Use PluralForm.numForms ( ) to get the number of forms instead of figuring out locally to better support future rules - Requires build from 2007/01/27 or later
0.3 : Generate a list of what numbers fall into which plural form to minimize the sample output to at most 3 of each form
Desarrollar con Formas Plurales
The functionality for getting the correct plural forms is provided by a JavaScript Module , PluralForm.jsm .
This module provides a couple methods for localizing to the browser 's current locale as well as getting methods to localize to a desired plural rule .
The latter ability of specifying a plural rule is useful for extensions because the extension does n't necessarily have to be localized to the browser 's locale .
Loading PluralForm.jsm
Loading the PluralForm module from JavaScript is simple with Components.utils.import .
Just put the following line somewhere that will be evaluated before you want to use PluralForm .
At the top of your JavaScript file is fine .
Components.utils.import( " resource://gre/modules/PluralForm.jsm " ) ;
Methods : get and numForms
These methods make use of the browser 's current locale specified by chrome://global/locale/intl.properties 's pluralRule value .
/** *
Get the correct plural form of a word based on the number * * @param a Num *
The number to decide which plural form to use * @param aWords * A semi-colon ( ; ) separated string of words to pick the plural form * @return
The appropriate plural form of the word */ string plural Form get ( int aNum , string aWords )
/** *
Get the number of forms for the current plural rule * * @return
The number of forms */ int numForms numForms ( )
Here is an example of using these methods :
// Load PluralForm and for this example , assume English Components.utils.import ( " resource://gre/modules/PluralForm.jsm " ) ; // PluralForm.get expects a semi-colon separated list of words let forms = " form ; forms " ; //
We 're going to pick the correct plural form based on the following number let numForms = PluralForm.numForms ( ) ; //
Display the correct plural form for " forms " print ( " This locale has " + numForms + " " + PluralForm.get( numForms , forms ) + " . " ) ;
The above example works , but is still difficult to localize because we 're concatenating strings assuming a particular grammatical structure .
The following would be better :
Components.utils.import( " resource://gre/modules/PluralForm.jsm " ) ; let forms =
" This locale has one form .
; This locale has # 1 forms . " ; let numForms = PluralForm.numForms ( ) ; //
For English , this would display " This locale has 2 forms . " print ( PluralForm.get( numForms , forms ) .replace ( " #1 " , numForms ) ;
Notice in the above example that the code can be written to support placeholders or not use placeholders in some forms of the string .
Additionally , the localizer has control over where the placeholder is in relation to the rest of the text .
Of course , the strings to be localized will be placed in a separate file such as yourextension .
properties instead of being hardcoded in the JavaScript code file .
The following 3 file snippets show how to use PluralForm with your .xul , . properties , .js files .
downloads.xul :
< stringbundleset > < stringbundle id =" strings " src=" chrome://downloads.properties " /> </stringbundleset >
downloads .properties :
# LOCALIZATION NOTE ( downloadsTitleFiles ) : Semi-colon list of plural forms .
# See : http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Localization_and_Plurals
# # 1 number of files # example : 111 files - Downloads downloadsTitleFiles=#1 file - Downloads ; #1 files - Downloads # LOCALIZATION NOTE ( timePair ) : # 1 time number ; # 2 time unit # example : 1 second ; 11 seconds timePair= # 1 # 2 seconds=second ;seconds
downloads.js :
Components.utils.import( " resource://gre/modules/PluralForm.jsm " ) ; let getStr = function ( string ) document.getElementById(" strings " ).getString ( string ) ; //
Get the correct plural form for the title let numDownloads = 3 ; let title = PluralForm.get( numDownloads , getStr(" downloadsTitleFiles " ) ) ; //
Put in the correct number of downloads print ( title.replace ( " # 1 " , numDownloads ) ) ; //
Get the correct plural form of seconds let timeLeft = 55 ; let seconds = PluralForm.get( timeLeft , getStr ( " seconds " ) ) ; //
Print the localized string for " 55 seconds " print ( getStr ( " timePair " ) . replace ( " #1 " , timeLeft ) .replace ( " # 2 " , seconds ) ) ;
Method : makeGetter
If you 're writing an extension , you 'll want to use makeGetter instead of PluralForm.get ( ) or PluralForm.numForms ( ) because someone installing the extension on a different locale will be using the strings provided by your default extension locale .
For example , your extension localized for English with plural rule # 1 , which expects 2 plural forms , is installed on a localized version of Firefox with plural rule # 4 , which expects 3 forms .
/** * Create a pair of plural form functions for the given plural rule number .
* * @param aRuleNum *
The plural rule number to create functions * @return A pair : [ function that gets the right plural form , * function that returns the number of plural forms ] */ [ string pluralForm get ( int a Num , string a Words ) , int numForms numForms ( ) ] makeGetter ( int aRuleNum )
Here is an example usage of makeGetter :
Components.utils.import( " resource://gre/modules/PluralForm.jsm " ) ; //
Let 's get Irish ( plural rule # 11 ) let [ get , numForms ] = PluralForm.makeGetter( 11 ) ; //
Make up some values to use with " get " let dummyText = " form 1 ; form 2 ; form 3 ; form 4 ; form 5 " ; let dummyNum = 10 ; //
In the case of Irish , the value 10 uses plural form # 4 , so " form 4 " is printed print ( get ( dummyNum , dummyText ) ) ;
In this example , the Irish plural rule was hardcoded , but this could be a value specified in the . properties file .
So for your extension , specify a pluralRule value in the . properties and call PluralForm.makeGetter(pluralRuleFromProperties ) making sure to save the 2 returned functions .
( You can use destructured assignment in JavaScript 1.7 to keep things clean . )
The returned functions act just like PluralForm.get ( ) and PluralForm.numForms ( ) except for the specified plural rule instead of the default plural rule .

HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Mobile phone sales will shrink next year at their fastest pace ever as consumers cut spending , a Reuters poll showed , with analysts increasingly concerned about unsold phones piling up in stores .

TECOM REUTERS / Catherine Benson CRB
On average , the poll of 36 analysts shows global market volumes shrinking 6.6 percent next year and 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter -- traditionally the strongest period for the industry due to holiday sales .
In a similar poll in early November analysts on average forecast the market to rise 2.6 percent in 2009 .
But since then Nokia , the world ’s top mobile phone maker , has warned twice on market growth , saying on December 4 its best guess was for sales to fall 5 percent or more next year .
“ Fear and uncertainty are causing many suppliers and consumers to delay purchasing their next handsets , ” said Strategy Analytics ’ Neil Mawston .
Consumer electronics demand has slumped in the run-up to the key Christmas sales season , triggering the loss of 16,000 jobs at Sony Corp and profit warnings from Samsung Electronics Co and Texas Instruments Inc .
British electronics group Laird Plc , a component supplier for Nokia and others , on Tuesday announced the loss of 5,000 jobs , or nearly half its staff , and said it sees global handset volumes declining 10 percent next year .
Analyst estimates varied significantly due to the uncertainties over economic growth , with 2009 forecasts ranging from a market contraction of 13 percent to growth of 3 percent .
Only two analysts polled expect growth next year .
“ A 5 - 10 percent decline is the best guess at the moment , ” said Nordea analyst Martti Larjo .
“ This can move either way : if the economy continues to go downward the numbers could be worse .
But while growth is not impossible , it ’s unlikely . ”
INVENTORIES WORRY
The $ 190 billion handset market , which was born in the 1980s and became a major growth industry after a surge in the late 1990s , had a brief shock in 2001 when the market fell 6 percent , its only contraction thus far .
Analysts said mobile phone makers may feel more pain this time around .
When the market crashed in 2001 , replacement sales tumbled but sales to first subscribers continued to grow due to the low penetration of mobile phones .
The European market -- where almost everybody has a phone and margins are fatter thanks to higher sales of technologically advanced phones -- is set to fall sharply this year and analysts say the trend will continue next year .
Sales volumes in emerging markets surpassed developed markets in 2005 , and this year around two - thirds of sales are in emerging markets .
Mobile phone makers have had time to prepare for the market slowdown , but analysts said they were increasingly worried over the possible build - up of large inventories , just like in 2001 .
“ We fear that inventories could really exacerbate problems in the first quarter , ” said CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber .
“ A number of vendors look set to try and reach targets set at the start of the year in a very different climate .
That could result in a significant oversupply moving into the first quarter , ” Blaber said .
Analysts pointed to LG Electronics and Samsung Electronics as the most likely candidates to build - up inventories as they try to reach respective annual sales targets of 100 million and 200 million phones .
“ We will reach 100 million units at all costs , ” the head of LG ’s telecom division said earlier this month .
LG is expected to sell fewer phones next year , but grab the No 3 spot in the market from Sony Ericsson .
The two largest vendors , Nokia and Samsung Electronics , are set to exit 2009 stronger than before , increasing their market shares to 39.6 percent and 17.3 percent respectively .
Motorola is seen losing the most market share , with the wide range of estimates , from 55 million to 100.7 million phones , reflecting the uncertainties over the company ’s future .

Mining company Gem Diamonds has gained approval from the Botswana government for a controversial diamond mine on the land of the Kalahari Bushmen , under the condition it does not provide the Bushmen with water .
The government has , however , reserved the right to use water boreholes drilled by Gem for wildlife .
The Bushmen living in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve face severe water shortages .
The government has banned them from operating a disused borehole which was their main source of water before the government unlawfully evicted them from their land .
[ social_buttons ]
A consulting firm visited the Bushmen earlier this year , supposedly to obtain their views on diamond mining on their land .
The company ’s project manager joined the board of Gem Diamonds soon after the project ended , calling the impartiality of the consultation process into serious question .
Gem Diamonds claims that the Bushmen are in favor of the mine , but the Bushmen have had no independent advice on its probable impact .
‘ It ’s absolutely scandalous that the Botswana government is insisting that Gem Diamonds does not provide the Bushmen with water .
The government is clearly determined to go to any lengths to keep the Bushmen off their land , ” said Survival International ’s director Stephen Corry .
“ As to whether the Bushmen are in favour of the mine – the lack of information provided to them means they are in no position to be able to say .
It is likely that they do n’t even know they will not be able to access water from the mine site . ”
The UN has compared the treatment of the Bushmen to the enslavement of Africans in America .
A report states the Botswana government uses arguments justifying the eviction of the Kalahari Bushmen from their traditional homelands similar to those used to defend the transatlantic slave trade .
Racism against the Bushmen permeates throughout the Botswani culture .

Almost no segment of New York City ’s real estate industry was spared in the Madoff scandal , which may be history ’s largest Ponzi scheme : commercial brokers large and small , little - known developers and prominent families like the Wilpons and Rechlers all lost money to Bernard L. Madoff , industry executives say .
The outsize impact on the industry may have resulted largely because Mr. Madoff ( pronounced MAY - doff ) managed his funds much the way that real estate leaders have operated successfully for decades :
He provided little information and demanded a lot of trust .
“ You have a lot of wealthy people who made a lot of money on handshakes , ” said Mark S. Weiss , a commercial real estate broker at Newmark Knight Frank , where several brokers had invested heavily with Mr. Madoff .
There was “ something about this person , pedigree and reputation that inspired trust , ” he said .
Across the city , industry executives said deals had been scuttled or jeopardized because of the scandal .
Residential brokers are taking calls from Madoff investors who have had to put their apartments on the market .
Many developers had pledged their investments with Mr. Madoff as collateral for projects , and are now worried that their banks will call in their loans .

What is REST ?
REST is an architectural style , or set of conventions , for web applications and services that centers itself around resource manipulation and the HTTP spec .
Web apps have traditionally ignored the HTTP spec and moved forward using a subset of the protocol : GET and POST , 200 OK s and 404 NOT FOUND s .
As we entered a programmable web of applications with APIs the decision to ignore HTTP gave us problems we 're still dealing with today .
We have an internet full of applications with different interfaces ( GET / user / 1/ delete vs. POST / user / delete {id=1} ) .
With REST we can say / user / 1 is a resource and use the HTTP DELETE verb to delete it .
For more detail on REST check out wikipedia and " quick pitch " .
Tip # 1 Using PUT and DELETE methods
In PHP you can determine which HTTP method was used with : $ _SERVER [ ' REQUEST_METHOD ' ] ;
From web browsers this will be either GET or POST .
For RESTful clients applications need to support PUT and DELETE ( and ideally OPTIONS , etc. ) as well .
Unfortunately PHP does n't have $ _PUT and $ _DELETE variables like it does $ _POST and $ _GET .
Here 's how to access the content of a PUT request in PHP :
$ _PUT = array ( ) ; if ( $_SERVER [ ' REQUEST_METHOD ' ] == ' PUT ' ) { $ putdata = file_get_contents ( ' php://input' ) ; $ exploded = explode ( ' &' , $ putdata ) ; foreach ( $ exploded as $ pair ) { $ item = explode ( ' =' , $ pair ) ; if ( count ( $item ) == 2 ) { $ _PUT[urldecode( $item [ 0 ] ) ] = urldecode ( $item [ 1 ] ) ; } } }
Tip # 2 : Send Custom HTTP /1.1 Headers
PHP 's header function allows custom HTTP headers to be sent to the client .
The HTTP / 1.x header contains the response code from the server .
PHP will , by default , send back a 200 OK status code which suggests that the request has succeeded even if it has die ( ) 'ed or a new resource has been created .
There are two ways to change the status code of your response :
header ( ' HTTP /1.1 404 Not Found ' ) ; header ( ' Location : http://www.foo.com/bar' , true , 201 ) ;
The first line is a generic way of setting the response status code .
If your response requires another header , like the Location header to the resource of a ' 201 Created ' or ' 301 Moved Permanently ' , placing the integer status code in the third parameter of header is a shortcut .
It is the logical equivalent of the following example , which is easier to read at the cost of being an extra line of code .
header ( ' HTTP /1.1 201 Created ' ) ; header ( ' Location : http://www.foo.com/bar' ) ;
Tip # 3 : Send Meaningful HTTP Headers
Policy for deciding when it is appropriate to send each HTTP status code is a full post on its own and the HTTP spec leaves room for ambiguity .
There are many other resources on the net which provide insights so I 'll just touch on a few .
201 Created
Used when a new resource has been created .
It should include a Location header which specifies the URL for the resource ( i.e. books / 1 ) .
The inclusion of a location header does not automatically forward the client to the resource , rather , 201 Created responses should include an entity ( message body ) which lists the location of the resource .
202 Accepted
Allows the server to tell the client " yeah , we heard your order , we 'll get to it soon . "
Think the Twitter API on a busy day .
Where 202 Created implies the resource has been created before a response returns , 202 Accepted implies the request is ok and in a queue somewhere .
304 Not Modified
Used in conjunction with caching and conditional GET requests ( requests with If - Modified - Since / If - None - Match headers ) allows web applications to say " the content has n't changed , continue using the cached version " without having to re-render and send the cached content down the pipe .
401 Unauthorized
Used when attempting to access a resource which requires authentication credentials the request does not carry .
This is used in conjunction with www - authentication .
500 Internal Server Error
Better than OK when your PHP script dies or reaches an exception .
Informs the other end that the problem was on the server side and avoids potential for caching the response .
Tip # 4 : Do n't Use $ _SESSION
A truly RESTful PHP application should be entirely stateless - all requests should contain enough information to be handled without additional server side state .
In practice this means storing authentication information in a cookie with a timestamp and a checksum .
Additional data can also be stored in a cookie .
In the event you need more than a cookie 's worth of data fall back to storing it in a central database with the authentication still in the cookie .
This is how Flickr approaches statelessness .
Tip # 5 : Test with cURL or rest - client
cURL makes it easy to execute any HTTP METHOD on a resource URL .
You can pass request parameters and headers as well as inspect response headers and data .
The command line tool ' curl ' is standard on many * nix distros .
Windows users should check out MinGW / MSYS which supports cURL .
Even PHP has cURL functions which are enabled on most hosts ( php / curl install page ) .
cURL Example Usage & Common Parameters :
curl -X PUT \
http://www.foo.com/bar/1 \ - d " some=var " \ - d " other=var2 " \ - H " Accept : text / json " \ - I
-X [ METHOD ]
Specify the HTTP method .
-d " name=value "
Set a POST / PUT field name and value .
- H [ HEADER ]
Set a header .
- I
Only display response 's headers .
Tip # 6 - Use a RESTful PHP Framework
Frankly , developers should n't have to worry about many of these low - level details of REST when writing PHP apps .
REST is based on conventions and conventions , by nature , involve a lot of boilerplate .
This is right up a framework 's alley ( as Rails has shown ) .
What options exist for PHP ?
CodeIgniter 's routing completely ignores the HTTP METHOD so there is serious hacking that needs to be done .
Cake has REST support but was n't designed to make specifying useful response status codes a part of the framework .
Konstruct appears to have a very well thought out architecture for a controllers framework built around HTTP and REST .
Unfortunately it is not easily approached and lacking ( intentionally ) many components , like an ORM layer , developers have come to expect in a modern web framework .
( Disclaimer : Shameless Plug ! )
The lack of a solid , RESTful PHP framework was one of my primary motivations for creating the Recess !
Framework .
Recess is a full - stack , open source ( MIT ) , RESTful PHP framework .

Q&A : Italian Traditions Customs
" In these Italian Traditions Customs articles we discuss the Italy food culture , hygiene , Italian mommy 's boys , wedding customs , strange customs and we end with a joke ... "
Rodger asked :
How can I get the best cultural experience of Rome Italy ?
I will be touring Rome in March 2008 and I was wondering about ...
" Italian traditions customs and culture i.e .
What are typical Italian food customs , wedding customs , Italian Christmas customs and other Italian culture customs and traditions ?
And any ideas of getting the best Italian cultural experience outside of Rome ? "
Arnika replied to Italian traditions customs :
My fiance just recently bought a new car and a friend of his that has Italian roots threw some spare change into the back of the car , he said it was an Italian custom for good luck .
So I researched it ...
It 's true .
It started about 2000 years ago as an offering to the God of roads or travel as a payment for safety , but now it 's a superstition , done more for fun than anything else .
Jill replied to Italian traditions customs : I had a great experience of Italian family life and culture , I traveled on a train down the entire east coast .
I saw such amazing details of Italian life , the funniest is when they call each other on their mobile phones when they are sitting only three seats away from each other .
They all take their family , pets and lunches on the train and it is pure entertainment watching them play out their lives on the way to their summer destination .
I say travel by train and just hop off whenever you feel like it - be prepared to be amazed .
Oh yes , it 's amazing how many older women I saw wearing black !
After their husband dies some of them wear black for the rest of there lives .
Patrick replied to Italian traditions customs :
Find the best location ( meaning most Roman ) to live .
The more you are among Romans the better .
Most tourists choose to stay in a hotel near the main train station , this is the most “ non-roman ” place to book your Rome accommodation !.
It 's cheep but most of the residents there are “ new Italians ” meaning foreigners mostly from developing countries .
The place is great but there is little roman about it .
And then quite simply , take a walk around Rome , get a guide book or take notes from this site .
Eat at trattorias and Pizzerias ( not restaurants ) , they have a more homely feel and the staff and owners often like to converse .
Also eat in places away from the main tourist squares .
Cockney Jock replied to Italian traditions customs : Italians enjoy their meals and take their time to eat , they do n't shove their food down their throats in 35 - 45 minutes .
I still enjoy going to a restaurant in Italy and being able to sit 3 or 4 hours and enjoy the courses and allow my food to settle before I begin the next course .
They cook with olive oil , eat a lot of unprocessed meats and fresh vegetables from the market , and cook simple and not over spiced ( depending on the area I guess ) and do n't overload their plates .

Return to the top MaryAbbeymore replied to Italian traditions customs : I am an American who has been living in Italy for the last 9 years .
Italians are very big on hygiene , you might find some who are very dirty , but they are in the minority .
I think Italians are the Europeans who spend the most time and money on hygiene and personal appearance .
In all Italian bathrooms you will find a shower or bathtub , toilet and a bidet .
If you do not know what a bidet is it looks like a sink but it 's low on the ground and Italians use it to wash their feet and intimate parts .
Many Italians wash their intimate parts every time they visit the bathroom , and others 1 or 2 times a day .
For Italians the thought of cleaning with only toilet paper is quite disgusting .
They say it 's not clean enough .
Italian women spend millions of Euros yearly on perfumes , the hairdresser , shampoos , cosmetics , etc.and so do the Italian men .
I know plenty of Italian guys that who spend a lots of money at hair dresser on cologne , shampoo , face cream , waxing , gym , designer clothes , etc .
In the hotel I work at a Croatian client told me that Italian men are nothing like Croatian men because they take such good care of themselves ( almost better than women in most other countries ) .
I think the majority of Italians shower every day , the ones who go to gym take 2 or more showers .
Italian women , and a lot of Italian men shave almost everything .
I 've yet to see an Italian woman with hairy armpits .
I 'm telling you all this because I 've noticed a lot of stereotypes about Italian women with hairy armpits , it 's false !
Marcus from Roman Life Rome Italy replied to MaryAbbeymore re : Italian traditions customs : Wow Mary , thanks for all that information !
But what I would like to know is how you know so much about Italians shaving and bathroom habits ?!
Jeff replied to Italian traditions customs : A peculiar Italian problem is the stay - at - home son or what they are called in Italian " mammone " - mommy 's boy .
More than 80 % of men between the ages of 18 and 30 still live at home with their parents , enjoying the coddling doting mamas to wash iron clean the room etc so the son is free to spend his time and his income on pleasing himself .
Who would want to give that up if they did n't have to ?
Return to the top George replied to Italian traditions customs :
As a half Italian half Aussie I can give you the honest low down on the Italians ....
Good :
Social , extremely family oriented , and usually a faithful people .
Hospitable and excellent cooks .
If you are a friend they 've " got your back " so to speak .
And they sure know how to chuck a party .
They are also mostly hard workers .
Bad :
Can gossip a lot and force feed you even when you are not hungry .
Can be waaay to noisy , and some of the guys can be pretty sleazy .
Just like in any culture , good and bad points , but i love my Italian family , they always make me feel welcome and are smiling and laughing .
Sandy replied to Italian traditions customs :
Did you know it 's an old Italian custom to never give a knife as a gift but to always ask for some small payment ?
My friend 's Italian grandfather asked for a quarter before " giving " him a set of beautiful cooking knives .
Apparently the tradition is because if you were to give a person a knife and that person killed someone with the knife then you would feel that it is your fault .
Another one is if you give a wallet as a present you should put a penny in it , this is so that the person will always have money , if you give them an empty wallet its said that they will always be poor !
Return to the top Pasha replied to Italian traditions customs : Some Italian wedding customs are : Sugar coated Jordan Almonds as gifts from the bride ( in uneven numbers for luck ) , these are also sometimes thrown at the bride and groom as they enter the reception area , also for luck .
Putting sugar cubes in the bride and grooms glasses , it increases the effervescence and sweetness of the wine as a metaphor that your life may be the same .
A full cocktail bar beforehand , with cheeses , breads and tasty Italian snacks
A Sunday wedding is the luckiest
In some areas of Italy it is tradition to give money instead of presents to the bride and groom .
The money is not given to them personally but displayed in a rainbow design on their bed as a wish of prosperity .
Sometimes the groom carries a piece of iron in his pocket , supposedly to keep evil spirits away
Releasing white doves is another Italian tradition .
The month of May is sometimes avoided as it should be reserved for the veneration of the Virgin Mary .
Rain on the wedding day is supposed to be lucky - “ Sposa bagnata , sposa fortunata . ”
The wedding cake table is usually also packed with a medley of delicious desserts .
JackB replied to Italian traditions customs :
Sofia just got married , and being a traditional Italian she was still a virgin .
On her wedding night at her mother 's house she was nervous , but her mother reassured her , " Do n't worry , Sofia Luca is a good man , go upstairs and he 'll take care of you . "
So she went .
When she got upstairs , Luca took off his shirt and exposed his hairy chest .
Sofia ran downstairs to her mother and said , " Mama , Mama , Luca 's got a big hairy chest ! "
" Do n't worry , Sofia " , says the mother , " All good men have hairy chests , go upstairs and he 'll take good care of you . "
So up she went again .
When she was in the bedroom Luca took off his pants exposing his hairy legs , again Sofia ran downstairs to her mother , " Mama , Mama , Luca took off his pants , and he 's got hairy legs ! "
" Do n't worry Sofia , all good men have hairy legs , Luca 's a good man , go upstairs and he 'll take good care of you . "
So , up she went again .
When she got up there , Luca was taking his socks off and on his left foot he was missing three toes .
When Sofia saw this , she ran downstairs .
" Mama , Mama , Luca 's got a foot and a half ! "
" Stay here and stir the pasta " , says the mother " this is a job for Mama ! " Marcus from Roman Life Rome Italy says :

Dude Uses 45,000 LEGOs to Recreate All the Capital Ships from the Star Wars Prequels
LEGO artist Thomas Benedikt plowed hundreds of hours , thousands of dollars , and a shit - tacular amount of LEGO bricks ( 45,000 + ) into his mission that began with “ building all the ships in the Trade Federation fleet ” and then expanded to constructing other capital ships from the Star Wars prequels .
So far , he ’s built six massive , ridiculously - detailed models , including a Venator - Class Star Destroyer ( pictured above ) , General Grievous ’s Invisible Hand , a Banking Clan Frigate , a Commerce Guild Destroyer , the Trade Federation Droid Control Ship , and a Trade Federation Cruiser .
Here , Thomas discusses the elements of his Trade Federation Droid Control Ship from Episode I :
It contains about 13,200 pieces and weigh ’s approximately 30 pounds .
It is 112 cm long from front to back and 102 cm wide from side to side .
It took about 100 hours to design and 3 month ’s to construct ( about 250 hours of contruction time ) .
I used a detailed picture of the ship from the Episode I Incredible Cross - Sections book
to help design it .
Around the inner and outer walls of the ship are over 1000 yellow transparent lights which light up once a light source is placed inside .
Finally , if your wondering , the total cost of the ship is about $ 1750 US .
Well done , Thomas .
You ’ll please excuse me , though , if I do n’t enthusiastically offer my awe and adulation .
After all , the trilogy of films that so enlivened your creative spirit was the same one that ground my spirit into a muddy paste that reeked of spoiled childhood memories and of the plastic of Kenner action figures .

The UN has said at least 50,000 Gazans are now homeless
The UN 's humanitarian chief has told the BBC the situation in Gaza after a three - week Israeli offensive against Hamas was worse than he anticipated .
Sir John Holmes , who visited Gaza on Thursday , said he was shocked by " the systematic nature of the destruction " .
He said that the territory 's economic activity had been set back by years .
The International Committee of the Red Cross 's ( ICRC ) president Jakob Kellenberger said conditions in Gazan hospitals were the worst he had seen .
UN workers have been given access to Gaza .
On Friday , Israel lifted a ban on international aid agencies entering the Palestinian territory .
The ban had been in place since early November when tensions mounted between Israel and Hamas .
Staff from a number of international non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) were allowed to cross into Gaza on Friday morning .
Michael Bailey from Oxfam said : " We are extremely relieved to be able to join our local colleagues inside Gaza and to be able to provide them with some support and relief from the relentless work they have been doing . "
He described the task ahead as " enormous " , with vast amounts of building materials alone needed immediately to help rebuild hospitals , mosques , public buildings and homes .
A key problem facing them , he said , is that the main crossing for the aid is 40 km from where most of the relief is needed and is too small for the number of trucks that need to go through .
He also urged Israel to end its policy of restricting the amount of cash Gazans can have access to , saying people in Gaza had run up " phenomenal debt " over the last few weeks , trying to buy goods that are in increasingly short supply .
Future of Gaza
Mr Kellenberger told the BBC : " What I have seen in the hospital in Gaza was for me as far as a visit is concerned ... it was my most shocking experience . "
He added that the Israeli forces should not be using weapons such as phosphorus shells which made it difficult to avoid injuring or killing civilians .
Mr Holmes , the top UN official responsible for emergency relief and humanitarian affairs , said the scale of destruction would have " disturbing " repercussions for the people of Gaza .
In an interview with the BBC's Today Programme , he described an industrial area where every building within a square kilometre had been levelled , by bulldozers and shells .

He told of broken pipes pumping out raw sewage onto the streets .
" I 'm sure the Israelis would say that 's because there were people there firing shells and rockets from there , or perhaps manufacturing them .
" But the nature of that destruction means that any kind of private economic activity in Gaza is set back by years or decades , " he said .
" That 's very disturbing for the future of Gaza , for the future of the people of Gaza , who are forced to fall back on the public sector and indeed on Hamas , who control the public sector . "
A humanitarian appeal was launched by a number of UK charities on Thursday to raise money for aid relief in Gaza .
War crimes claims
Israeli PM
Ehud Olmert is reported to have placed his justice minister in charge of defending Israel against any accusations of war crimes .
Daniel Friedman will lead an inter-ministerial team to co-ordinate a legal defence for Israeli civilians and the military , a government source was quoted by AFP as saying .
Richard Falk - the UN special rapporteur for human rights in the Palestinian territories - has said there was " a prima facie case " that Israel gravely breached the Geneva Conventions during its 22 - day campaign .
Israel responded by saying that Mr Falk 's " bias against Israel was well known " .
Israel said it launched its offensive to stop cross - border rocket attacks by militants in Gaza against its civilians .
The intense fighting ended on Sunday , with both sides declaring a ceasefire .
Palestinian medical officials said about 1,300 Palestinians were killed and thousands more were injured .
Thirteen Israelis died during the conflict .

The forecast looks set to beat the 1956 record of three days over 40 degrees and may equal the 1908 record of five consecutive days above 40 .
If it tops the latter , this month will also become the hottest January in Melbourne in a century .
Conyers defers subpoena showdown with Rove Muriel Kane
Published : Friday January 30 , 2009
Print This Email This House Judiciary Committee Chair John Conyers has agreed to a request from Karl Rove 's lawyer to delay the deadline by which Rove must appear in response to a subpoena from his committee .
In a letter to attorney Robert Luskin , Conyers wrote , " I understand that you wish to have the date for your client Karl Rove 's deposition moved back to accomodate your travel schedule and also so that you may consult with President Obama and his advisors regarding Mr. Rove 's obligation to appear .
I am happy to reschedule Mr. Rove 's deposition for Monday , February 23 , 2009 , at 10:00 a.m . "
Rove has indicated that he intends to defy the subpoena , claiming that excutive privilege gives him " absolute immunity " against having to testify about his activities while in the White Houte .
The Judiciary Committee is seeking his testimony on the politicization of the Justice Department and the allegedly political firing of US Attorneys .
The Obama administration has indicated that it will not support Rove 's -- and former President Bush 's -- interpretation of executive privilege but , according to Politico , " they have yet to fully formulate their own response to the question . "
However , a specialist in executive privilege who served in the Clinton White House predicts that Obama is unlikely to support Bush 's claim that his former aides continue to be covered by executive privilege even now that he is no longer president .
" Remember what Obama kept saying during the transition : ' There 's only one president at a time ? ' "
Neil Eggleston told Talking Points Memo .
" This is one where I think a court 's going to decide there 's only one president at a time . "
I was living in NC when Colorado ’s governor , Bill Ritter , was elected , and therefore did n’t follow the campaign closely and do n’t really know a lot about the guy except that he ’s bound to be better than his predecessor , Bill Owens .
Short of actually outlawing schools , Owens did all he possibly could to destroy education in the state , and I ’m sure everybody in the tourism industry will remember when his dumb ass stepped in front of the cameras a few summers back to announce that “ today , the entire state of Colorado is on fire . ”
He did n’t actually say “ please take your tourism dollars to Utah , ” but he might as well have .
Lately , though , I ’m learning that a lot of my fellow Coloradans do n’t much like Ritter , and this includes a lot of Democrats who voted for him .
I ’m starting to understand why .
When Sen. Ken Salazar was anointed by Prez-elect Obama to take over the Dept. of the Interior , it fell to Ritter to appoint a replacement .
As part of the process , he invited the state ’s citizens to let him know who they ’d like to see named to the slot .
There were lots of possible choices , some good and some horrific , but it seemed like a nice way to factor in the Voice of the People .
As you may know , Ritter wound up selecting Michael Bennet , the head of the Denver Public School system .
The pick was something of a head - scratcher .
Bennet is well thought of by many who have dealt with him , and he is regarded as being very smart .
However , there ’s nothing in his résumé to suggest that he ’s ready for this job , at least not right now .
In tapping Bennet , Ritter passed over several pretty good candidates , including the very highly regarded former speaker of the State House , Andrew Romanoff .
The reaction from those I ’ve talked to around here has been hopeful puzzlement , for the most part .
Nobody really gets it , but we ’ll cross our fingers .
Which leads us to a story in today ’s Denver Post , which reports that Romanoff got the most votes from the 3,000 + citizens who e-mailed their thoughts to the guv .
Others getting some love included Mike Miles ( who lost to Salazar in the 2004 Dem primary ) , Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper ( my personal choice ) , “ Democratic U.S. Rep . Ed Perlmutter , former state Senate President Joan Fitz - Gerald , former Denver Mayor Federico Peña , [ and ] Democratic U.S. Rep. John Salazar . ”
Guess how many votes Bennet got ?
Go on , guess .
Bennet ’s name did not show up in any of the released communications .
Here ’s my gripe .
This was Ritter ’s call .
We can argue , if we like , about the wisdom of soliciting the opinions of others , including citizens , political leaders , business advisers , union heads and so on .
But in the end , he did n’t have to ask anybody ’s opinion .
So … why did he ?
If you do n’t care what I think , that ’s fine , just do n’t waste my time pretending that my opinion counts .
Not only is it a time - waster , it ’s insulting .
Most of us are mature enough to understand that having our opinions heard and considered does n’t mean that you always go with what we think .
We appreciate that you listened and thought about it , though .
But when you ask us to contribute and then carry on as though we never opened our mouths , that ’s alienating .
And that ’s exactly what happened here , looks like .
If Romanoff was the # 1 vote - getter but Bennet had at least a handful of people writing on his behalf , I would n’t be complaining .
The majority is n’t always right , and it ’s entirely possible that the small handful of people were the smartest contributions in the lot .
It ’s possible that Ritter was acting in good faith – we have no real way of knowing .
But right now it does n’t look good and I do n’t feel very good about it .
Over 3,000 people took the time to respond , and if they ’re all feeling a little played , I can understand why .
Secular victory in Jerusalem ?
A Channel 1 exit poll published at 10 pm Tuesday , as polling stations were closing down , shows a first round victory for secular candidate Nir Barkat in the Jerusalem municipal elections .
According to the poll , ultra-Orthodox candidate Meir Porush came in second with 42 % of the vote .
Billionaire Arcady Gaydamak won 7 % of the vote according to the exit poll .

Barkat was aiming to put an end to five years of ultra-Orthodox dominance at city hall .
However , Barkat 's campaign officials were not quick to celebrate , saying they will be waiting for the actual results .
Interior Ministry officials estimated that initial results will be received at around 1 am .
Nonetheless , Barkat supporters received the poll results with immense excitement and have been singing and dancing ever since .
Shimi Kaplan , a volunteer at the Barkat headquarters , said " there is something in the air , a sense of change .
Now it will be impossible to ignore the secular community in the city . "
Meanwhile , officials at Porush 's campaign headquarters expressed their confidence that the final results will show a wholly different picture .
" According to the data we have , which is based on turnout rates , we are not at all concerned about the results , to say the least , " a source in Porush 's camp said .
The relatively low turnout rates are supposed to favor Porush .
His camp said Porush supporters hit the polling stations en masse .
' Complete distortion of democracy '
Speaking about 90 minutes before polls closed , Interior Minister Meir Sheetrit voiced his concerns about low voter turnout rates .
By 8 pm Tuesday , the turnout rate stood at about 40 % nationwide , with lower rates in the largest cities , Jerusalem , Tel Aviv , and Haifa .
The highest voter turnout rates were recorded in Arab communities across the country .
" The implication of a low turnout rate is that small groups that are better organized gain strength that is two or three times their real power in the public , " he said .
" In my view , this is complete distortion of democracy . "
Meanwhile , a total of 420 irregular incidents were recorded at ballots throughout Israel on Tuesday as the election day winded to an end .
Police held a special security briefing , with Commissioner Dudi Cohen in attendance .
Police also detained 20 people suspected of trying to disrupt the election process , several of whom have been arrested .
Commissioner Cohen has ordered efforts be focused on ensuring ballots are closed in an orderly fashion and their transfer to their final destinations be secured .
A new analysis of the dramatic cycles of ice ages and warm intervals over the past million years , published in Nature , concludes that the climatic swings are the gyrations of a system poised to settle into a quasi - permanent colder state — with expanded ice sheets at both poles .
[ UPDATE 11/13 : Authors and critics debate the findings . ]
In essence , says one of the two authors , Thomas J. Crowley of the University of Edinburgh , the ice age cycles over the past million years are a super - slow - motion variant of the dramatic jostlings recorded by a seismograph in an earthquake before the ground settles into a new quiet state .
He and William T. Hyde of the University of Toronto used climate models and other techniques to assess the chances that the world is witnessing the final stages of a 50 - million - year transition from a planet with a persistent warm climate and scant polar ice to one with greatly expanded ice sheets at both poles .
Their findings have stirred a lot of skepticism in the community of specialists examining ancient records of past climate changes and how they might relate to variations in Earth ’s orbit and orientation toward the Sun and other factors .
I ’ll be adding some of their reactions overnight ( I ’m on the road ) .
The Nature paper ( abstract and citation below ) goes on to propose that humans , as long as they have a technologically powerful society , would be likely to avert such a slide into a long big chill by adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere .
That does n’t obviate the need to curb such emissions and the prospect of dangerous climate warming in the short run , Dr. Crowley said .
But it is more evidence that like it or not , the future of conditions on Earth is likely to be a function of human actions , whether chosen or not .
The idea that human actions can dominate the climatic influence of things as grand as shifts in a planet ’s orbit is hard to grasp , but quite a few climate specialist say it ’s pretty clear this is the case .
In 2003 , I wrote an article exploring when scientists think we ’ll slide into the next ice age ( the conventional variety ) .
James Hansen of NASA echoed Dr. Crowley , saying that as long as we ’re technologically able , we ’ll be able to keep the big ice at bay .
Strange , wonderful stuff , climate science .

Transient nature of late Pleistocene climate variability
Thomas J. Crowley & William T. Hyde
Climate in the early Pleistocene1 varied with a period of 41 kyr and
was related to variations in Earth ’s obliquity .
About 900 kyr ago ,
variability increased and oscillated primarily at a period of , 100
kyr , suggesting that the link was then with the eccentricity of
Earth ’s orbit .
This transition has often 2 –5 been attributed to a nonlinear
response to small changes in external boundary conditions .
Here we propose that increasing variablility within the past million
yearsmay indicate that the climate system was approaching a second
climate bifurcation point , after which it would transition again to a
new stable state characterized by permanent mid-latitude Northern
Hemisphere glaciation .
From this perspective the pastmillion years
can be viewed as a transient interval in the evolution of Earth’s
climate .
We support our hypothesis using a coupled energybalance /
ice - sheet model , which furthermore predicts that the future
transition would involve a large expansion of the Eurasian ice sheet .
The process responsible for the abrupt change seems to be the albedo
discontinuity at the snow–ice edge .
The best - fit model run , which
explains almost 60 % of the variance in global ice volume6 during the
past 400 kyr , predicts a rapid transition in the geologically near
future to the proposed glacial state .
Should it be attained , this state
would be more ‘ symmetric ’ than the present climate , with comparable
areas of ice / sea-ice cover in each hemisphere , and would
represent the culmination of 50 million years of evolution from
bipolar nonglacial climates to bipolar glacial climates .
You ’ve probably noticed Mark Halperin ’s claim that the level of pro-Obama bias in the election coverage this year was so bad it was “ disgusting . ”
I ’ll leave it to others to analyze what “ disgusting ” means when deployed by someone who takes his journalistic cues from Matt Drudge .
But whatever Halperin says , the financial crisis has taken so much of the oxygen from post - mortem discussions of the campaign that a few commentators do seem to be putting together a conventional wisdom that the political press this past year was wildly pro-Obama .
It ’s amazing how quickly political amnesia takes effect .
Going into this year , there was probably no national politician more liked or more favorably covered in the nation than John McCain .
Remember , the DC press corps was McCain ’s “ base . ”
For virtually the entire election cycle , national political reporters continued to grade McCain on a curve .
There are numerous examples .
Toward the end of the campaign , basically in September , McCain took a series of steps that began to crack his credibility and reputation .
He and his campaign told a series of falsehoods that were so outside the bounds even by the normal standards of political lying and took a number of steps that where so erratic and reckless ( Palin , campaign suspension , etc. ) that the nature of his coverage finally began to change .
McCain did that .
Halperin should stop complaining , put some limits on pandering to the curdled resentment of the right .

Gasification - based IGCC power plant technology offers a powerful means of cleaning up local air pollution from coal - fired power and , via carbon capture and storage , its carbon footprint .
Carbon - Nation has argued in past that it should be legally mandated for new power plants burning coal because ( 1 ) air pollution laws require use of the best emissions controls available , ( 2 ) carbon capture and storage will be economically viable under emerging carbon caps and taxes , and ( 3 ) adding new carbon emissions from coal is unjustifiable given the critical need to stabilize atmospheric levels of CO2 .
But let ’s be clear on one thing : IGCC and carbon capture can substantially clean up the coal - fired power plant , but they ca n’t deliver “ clean ” coal .
That ’s because extracting coal to feed the power plants is , in itself , a dirty business — at least as it is currently practised .
Last week I witnessed this firsthand at two West Virginia mines where mountains are literally dismantled to reveal their hidden coal seams , then piled back to a rough approximation of their original contours or left flat for development .
I visited the mines as part of the Society of Environmental Journalists ’ annual conference , held this year in the heart of coal country in Roanoke , Virginia .
Mountaintop removal mining , as this practice is called , accounts for about a third of Appalachian coal production but contributes a considerably larger share of Appalachian coal burned in power plants ( conventional deep mines yield more metallurgical coal used in steel mills ) .
They are , without question , environmentally and culturally destructive .
Thousands of cubic meters of rock , sand , and soil dumped into valleys bury ephemeral stream beds ; wildlife are displaced ; sludge impoundments from coal - cleaning operations threaten groundwater and communities ; and residents of the mountains suffer internal devestation as the lands that define their existence are blasted into oblivion .
For a sense of scale check out this 5MB panorama of the mine pictured above by National Geographic executive editor Dennis Dimmick .
Can the coal industry do better ?
Yes .
For example , reclamation experts from Virginia
Tech told the tour that mountaintop mines are adopting a new reforestation approach that could restore the mountains ’ ecology within two generations .
That ’s huge improvement over current practices where grasses and shrubs take over , leaving the land in what Virginia Tech forestry professor James Berger called a state of “ arrested succession . ”
Will the industry ever make coal mining socially and environmentally sustainable ?
Appalachian activists who have fought ‘ Big Coal ’ for decades doubt it .
For one thing , the coal companies enjoy undivided support from state legislators and governors in coal states .
That ’s why West Virginia author and political activist Denise Giardina told the SEJ conference attendees that she was “ rooting for global warming ” to stop coal .
“ I think it will force us to change , ” said Giardina , who made it clear that IGCC power plants sequestering CO2 were n’t the kind of change she had in mind .
Quite the opposite in fact : “ If we ever have clean coal , ” said Giardina , “ you can kiss the mountains goodbye . ”
I ’m going to need more time to reflect on what I saw and heard last week .
The scale of carbon reductions required and developing nations ’ right to develop may yet justify the ongoing use of coal .
But , at the very least , it is more clearer to me than ever that cleaning up our energy systems must start with energy efficiency and less extractive forms of renewable energy .
We are all , as willing users of coal - supplied power grids , contributors to Appalachia ’s plight everytime we turn on the juice .
Storied author , poet and social critic Wendell Berry put that message to the SEJ conference in the bluntest of terms : “ It ’s awfully hard to remember when you push that button that you are authorizing mountaintop removal . ”
For more on mountaintop removal mining check out this week ’s article by the Associated Press which I believe was inspired by the SEJ mountaintop mining tour .

The CEO takes out a fullpage ad in the Wall Street Journal today to thank the American Public for “ investing ” in Chrysler .
Lets see , is there anything more idiotic than spending more than 100k dollars on a full page ad “ thanks for letting me waste your money ” ad ?
Does it make it worse that its a business publication where the readers might just recognize the stupidity of wasting money on ad dollars that does n’t even try to sell the product ?
How does it make the next unemployed Chrysler worker feel that their entire year ’s salary just went for a single , ridiculous ad ?
Just one more example of how poorly run the car companies are .
Note to the Big 3 , spend money to make money .
These types of ads have as much value as a Bernie Madoff account statement .
And while I am on the subject again , one last suggestion for the Big 3 .
Instead of determining the right cost structure for your company by working backwards from the salaries of hourly employees and how they compare to foreign owned competitors , how about doing what every successful business does ?
Figure out what cars consumers want , and how much they need to sell for .
Once you can establish the right selling point that will actually encourage people to buy cars , THEN work backwards to the cost structure you need in order to sell cars at that price point .
For those in Detroit who have never operated a lemonade stand , or any other business , the way profits are generated is by making products at a price people want to buy them for , and then producing them , with all costs allocated , for less than you are selling them for .
It ’s not apparent that this is a principle that Detroit understands .
And while you are at it , when you spend marketing money , spend it to sell cars , not on Bullshit ads that accomplish nothing
You ’ve got my tax money .
When it comes time to pay back the cash , since it ’s not apparent that anyone in government can be trusted to do the right thing , Im sending these guys after you :
Update :
Here is an image of the ad from the Chrysler website

Cathy Lynn Grossman .
KUALA LUMPUR , Malaysia ( AP )  Malaysia 's top Islamic body on Saturday banned Muslims from practicing yoga , saying the Indian physical exercise contains elements of Hinduism that could corrupt Muslims .
The National Fatwa Council , which has the authority to rule on how Muslims must conduct their faith , issued a fatwa , or edict , saying yoga involves not just physical exercise but also includes Hindu spiritual elements , chanting and worship .
" It is inappropriate .
It can destroy the faith of a Muslim , " Council chairman Abdul Shukor Husin told reporters , noting that clerics in Egypt also issued a similar edict in 2004 that called the practice of yoga " an aberration . "
Decisions by the Fatwa Council in Malaysia are not legally binding on Muslims , who comprise nearly two - thirds of the country 's 27 million people , unless they are enshrined in national or Shariah laws .
However , many Muslims abide by the edicts out of deference , and the council does have the authority to ostracize an offending Muslim from society .
The fatwa reflects the growing strain of conservatism in Malaysia , which has always taken pride in its multiethnicity .
About 25 % of Malaysians are ethnic Chinese and 8 % ethnic Indians , mostly Hindus .
Recently , the council issued an edict banning tomboys , ruling that girls who act like boys violate the tenets of Islam .
Abdul Shukor said many Muslims who practice the globally popular yoga failed to understand that its ultimate aim was to be one with a god of a different religion .
" We are of the view that yoga , which originates from Hinduism , combines physical exercise , religious elements , chanting and worshipping for the purpose of achieving inner peace and ultimately to be one with god , " he said .
But yoga instructor Suleiha Merican , who is a Muslim and has been practicing yoga for 40 years , denied there was a Hindu spiritual element to it .
" We do n't do chanting and meditation , " said Merican , whose father and grandfather were also yoga teachers .
" It 's a great health science that is scientifically proven and many countries have accepted it " as alternative therapy .
The issue of yoga came into the limelight last month when an Islamic scholar expressed an opinion at a seminar that it was un-Islamic , prompting the Fatwa Council to step in .
Local newspapers have received several letters from Muslims , expressing indignation at the scholar 's view , saying yoga is simply a way to maintain health and has nothing to do with religion .
Putri Rahim , a housewife , expressed shock at the fatwa , saying she is no less a Muslim after practicing yoga for 10 years .
" I am mad !
Maybe they have it in mind that Islam is under threat .
To come out with a fatwa is an insult to intelligent Muslims .
It 's an insult to my belief , " Putri told the AP .
" I think it is easier for non-Muslims to live in Malaysia now than for Muslims , " said Putri .
She said yoga helped ease the severe back pain she used to suffer from .
There are no figures for how many Muslims practice yoga , but many yoga classes have a sprinkling of Muslims attending .
In a recent blog , social activist Marina Mahathir criticized the council for even considering a yoga ban , calling it " a classic case of reacting out of fear and ignorance . "
" Yoga may have spiritual roots but most of us do it for the exercise , both for the mind and body , " Marina wrote .

they ’d advertise – you know !
How dreary – to be – Somebody !
How public – like a Frog –
To tell one ’s name – the livelong June –
To an admiring Bog !
Comment :
1 . The first published version of this poem stands inferior to Franklin ’s or Johnson ’s versions .
There , the last line of the first stanza is rendered “ They ’d banish us , you know , ” which is far too weak for my taste .
“ Banish ” and “ advertise ” do not hold the same import , not at all .
Dickinson uses “ Nobody ” and “ Somebody ” in this poem , demonstrating a consciousness of the problem of identity .
“ Banish , ” for me , speaks less to the construction of identity than “ advertise . ”
It jumps to punishment , to exile , without bothering to address why .
Curiously , “ advertise ” stands distinct , a puzzle all its own .
“ Fame , ” a term not absent from her poetic vocabulary , is unused in this poem .
An example of “ Fame , ” at work in another of hers :
Fame is a bee .
It has a song –
It has a sting –
Ah , too , it has a wing .
2 . There are exactly two people in the world , according to this poem , who are “ Nobody : ” the speaker and the audience .
I hold the speaker is talking to herself :
I ’m Nobody !
Who are you ?
Are you – Nobody – Too ?
Then there ’s a pair of us !
Do n’t tell !
they ’d advertise – you know !
On the one hand , “ Nobody ” can be considered a product of a lack of fame and advertising .
This is the speaker ’s self - perception , precipitated by a particular social condition .
She ’s not comfortable with publicity of any sort .
On the other hand , something far subtler could be occurring .
If one were to genuinely seek self - knowledge , then a dialogue with one ’s self must start with adopting the guise of a “ Nobody . ”
This must happen regardless of whether one is famous or not .
Who would this “ Nobody ” investigate ?
It could be a “ Somebody , ” a person with a public persona and reputation .
But if the investigation into a “ Somebody ” is successful , then what results is a “ Nobody , ” a person still unknown to the world .
Of necessity , there must be a pair of Nobodies .
This brings the last line of the first stanza into sharp comic and ironic relief :
Do n’t tell !
they ’d advertise – you know !
Why on earth are you worried that you ’ll talk about yourself , and this will spread ?
This is playful ; nothing can hurt one ’s standing with oneself .
At the very same time , something about advertisement stands sinister , threatening to undo a genuine dialogue with the self .
3 . Nothing can hurt one ’s standing with oneself as long as one does not care for advertising .
The problem is being Somebody :
How dreary – to be – Somebody !
How public – like a Frog –
To tell one ’s name – the livelong June –
To an admiring Bog !
One does not need to be Somebody .
You do not need to be dreary , a frog in a bog , prostituting the truest sense of oneself for the approval of other croakers .
To be Nobody or Somebody is a choice , which Dickinson frames a peculiar way .
Singsong verse and whimsical lines give this poem a nursery rhyme / fairy tale aesthetic .
I have no idea if they had such things in the 1860 ’s , to be sure .
What I do understand is the problem of giving up one ’s name .
Here I am , writing a blog , hoping for a reputation of sorts .
As I do this , I give up control over my name to those who can not be trusted with it .
Living in the age of social media , we are all aware of this time called “ work ” which apparently consists in continually posting to the Internet to put other people down over anything and everything .
The threat , as Dickinson ’s first stanza attests , has less to do with this “ admiring Bog ” and more with a failure on our part to see the value of “ the livelong June . ”
To be Nobody in dialogue with Nobody is to understand , truly , that one ’s name is what one makes of it .
To veer away from that dialogue , to attend to reputation solely , is to not care how one ’s name changes with one ’s own action or reflection .
Obviously , we are social creatures ; we can not control entirely our own name .
At stake in this poem is an ideal .
In the best case , our work would remain our own .
Our name would be strictly tied to who we are and what we do .
It would not involve a reputation which has a life of its own .
Thus , “ the livelong June : ” our name , as a truly changing reflection of ourselves , is an eternal summer .
This may be a fairy tale , a childish sentiment .
Dickinson will grant us that .
She will only ask what price the adult world , where our value is entirely determined by others .
Big Three CEOs Flew Private Jets to Plead for Public Funds Auto industry close to bankruptcy , but they still get pricey perk .
November 19 , 2008  --
The CEOs of the big three automakers flew to the nation 's capital yesterday in private luxurious jets to make their case to Washington that the auto industry is running out of cash and needs $ 25 billion in taxpayer money to avoid bankruptcy .
The CEOs of GM , Ford and Chrysler may have told Congress that they will likely go out of business without a bailout yet that has not stopped them from traveling in style , not even First Class is good enough .
All three CEOs - Rick Wagoner of GM , Alan Mulally of Ford , and Robert Nardelli of Chrysler - exercised their perks Tuesday by flying in corporate jets to DC .
Wagoner flew in GM's $ 36 million luxury aircraft to tell members of Congress that the company is burning through cash , asking for $ 10 - 12 billion for GM alone .
" We want to continue the vital role we 've played for Americans for the past 100 years , but we can't do it alone , " Wagoner told the Senate Banking Committee .
While Wagoner testified , his G4 private jet was parked at Dulles airport .
It is just one of a fleet of luxury jets owned by GM that continues to ferry executives around the world despite the company 's dire financial straits .
" This is a slap in the face of taxpayers , " said Tom Schatz , President of Citizens Against Government Waste .
" To come to Washington on a corporate jet , and asking for a hand out is outrageous . "
Wagoner 's private jet trip to Washington cost his ailing company an estimated $ 20,000 roundtrip .
In comparison , seats on Northwest Airlines flight 2364 from Detroit to Washington were going online for $ 288 coach and $ 837 first class .
After the hearing , Wagoner declined to answer questions about his travel .
Ford CEO
Mulally 's corporate jet is a perk included for both he and his wife as part of his employment contract along with a $ 28 million salary last year .
Mulally 's family lives in Seattle , not Detroit .
The company jet takes him there and back on weekends .
Plants Closed , Company Jets Stay
Mulally made his case Tuesday before the committee saying he 's cut expenses , laid - off workers and closed 17 plants .
" We have also reduced our work force by 51,000 employees in the past three years , " Mulally said .
Yet Ford continues to operate a fleet of eight private jets for its executives .
Just Tuesday , one jet was taking Ford brass to Los Angeles , another on a trip to Nebraska , and of course Mulally needed to fly to Washington to testify .
He did not address questions following the hearing .
" Now 's not the time to do that sort of thing , " said John McElroy of the television program " Autoline Detroit . "
" Now 's the time to be humble and show that you 're sharing equally in the sacrifice , " McElroy said .
GM and Ford say that it is a corporate decision to have their CEOs fly on private jets and that is non-negotiable , even as the companies say they are running out of cash .
Private jet travel is perhaps the greatest perk of all for CEOs , who say it allows them to travel more efficiently and safely , even in a recession .
AIG , despite the $ 150 billion bailout , still operates a fleet of corporate jets .
The company says it has put two out of its seven jets up for sale and is reviewing the use of others .
Though there are no such plans by GM or Ford .
" It appears that the senior management of the automakers simply do n't get it , " said Schatz .

President - elect Barack Obama warned Sunday that the nation ’s economic problems were “ going to get worse before they get better , ” pointing to the fragility of the financial system and to recent numbers showing the U.S. with its highest unemployment rate in 15 years .
He later sought to balance the stark assessment with optimism about the economy ’s future as he voiced support for a newly proposed government bailout of the nation ’s carmakers that would be tied to restructuring and a push for greater fuel efficiency .
In comments a day after he proposed a massive public works program , Obama said Congress was doing the “ exact right thing ” by rapidly responding to the automotive crisis while holding the industry ’s “ feet to the fire . ”
Speaking in a taped interview on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” Obama seemed to be trying to brace the nation for tougher economic times .
But at a news conference in Chicago later Sunday , he tempered his remarks with a dose of optimism .

“ I am absolutely confident that if we take the right steps over the coming months that not only can we get the economy back on track , but we can emerge leaner , meaner and ultimately more competitive and more prosperous , ” he said .
Pressed by NBC ’s Tom Brokaw , Obama said his economic advisors were still “ crunching the numbers ” for a post - inauguration economic stimulus package .
In a weekend radio address , he said the package would include a massive public works program to build roads and other infrastructure projects .

A needed ‘ infusion ’

Some Republicans have said the stimulus plan would be far too expensive .
But Obama said it was more important to spend money to revive the economy and create jobs than worry about the short - term effect on the national debt .
“ We have to provide a blood infusion to the patient right now to make sure the patient is stabilized , ” he said .
Obama said the full scope of the economic pain was only starting to come into focus , noting the more than 500,000 jobs that were lost in November .
“ These are n’t just abstract numbers , ” he said at the news conference .
“ They ripple throughout the economy , and people are really suffering , which is why we ’ve got to act swiftly and boldly . ”

Obama said he thought the Bush administration understood the severity of the problem , but he said there had been a lack of “ aggressive steps ” in the housing market to stem foreclosures .
Criticized for staying on the sidelines until now , Obama for the first time voiced support for auto industry bailout legislation being drafted in Congress .
He said it would be unacceptable to allow the U.S. auto industry to fail during a time of growing unemployment , although he was less definitive on whether some auto executives should lose their jobs .
“ If this management team that ’s currently in place does n’t understand the urgency of the situation and is not willing to make the tough choices and adapt to these new circumstances , then they should go , ” he said .

Sen. Christopher J. Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , chairman of the banking committee , said on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation ” that General Motors Chief Executive Rick Wagoner “ has to move on ” as part of a government - run restructuring .
“ I think you have got to consider new leadership , ” Dodd said .
House and Senate aides are still working on details of the bailout plan , which Democratic leaders have said they hope to pass this week .
As he has since his election , Obama sidestepped a question about whether he intended to immediately fulfill a campaign pledge to raise taxes on Americans earning more than $ 250,000 a year , or whether he would wait until a tax reduction for those earners expired in 2011 .

He also declined to say whether he backed Caroline Kennedy , daughter of President Kennedy , as the replacement for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) after Clinton ’s expected appointment as secretary of State .
“ The last thing I want to do is get involved in New York politics , ” he said on “ Meet the Press . ”
“ I ’ve got enough trouble in terms of Illinois politics . ”

Adding to his team

Obama ’s network appearance came as he moved to bring into his administration one of the military ’s most visible critics of the Bush administration ’s Iraq war strategy .
The formal announcement of retired Gen. Eric K. Shinseki , 66 , as his pick for secretary of Veterans Affairs fell on the anniversary of the attacks on Pearl Harbor in 1941 .
Both Obama and Shinseki were born in Hawaii .
“ For many of today ’s troops and their families , the war does not end when they come home .
Far too many are suffering from the signature injuries of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” Obama said .
“ We have a sacred trust to repay a favor , the favor that they have done us . ”

As Army chief of staff from 1999 to 2003 , Shinseki clashed with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld .
Relations further soured in February 2003 , when Shinseki testified to Congress that it might take several hundred thousand U.S. troops to control violence in Iraq after the invasion .
Rumsfeld dismissed that estimate as “ wildly off the mark , ” and Shinseki was gone within months .
Many think President Bush ’s “ surge ” strategy in the last year vindicated Shinseki .
The first Japanese American Army four - star general , Shinseki will add diversity to Obama ’s Cabinet .
He will oversee one of the federal government ’s largest agencies and one that has come under significant criticism in recent years over the treatment of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ I can think of no higher responsibility than ensuring that men and women who have served our nation in uniform are treated with the care and respect that they have earned , ” said Shinseki , the recipient of two Purple Hearts during his service in Vietnam .

Obama , meanwhile , was asked to respond to recent news stories in which gun dealers have said that sales have surged since the election because people fear it will be harder to get weapons under the new administration .
“ I believe in common - sense gun safety laws and I believe in the 2nd Amendment , ” he said .
“ So lawful gun owners have nothing to fear .
I ’ve said that throughout the campaign .
I have n’t indicated anything different during the transition .
And I think that people can take me at my word . ”

“ Clean ” coal ’s dirtiest secret : Part III
This article , third in a series on mountaintop removal coal mining , was originally titled “ The poor are always downstream . ”
It must now be amended to add “ when there is still a stream to be down from . ”
In an act that puts a grossly ironic twist on its name , the Environmental Protection Agency has approved a repeal of the 25 - year - old stream buffer zone rule , which prohibits surface coal mining within 100 feet of a flowing stream .
The change , proposed by Department of the Interior ’s Office of Surface Mining ( OSM ) , was finalized when it received written sanction from EPA on Tuesday .
The controversial move comes amid extensive opposition , one more last - minute effort by the Bush Administration to further erode a host of environmental regulations before its imminent departure .
This one promises disproportionate harm to some of the nation ’s poorest citizens , if it ’s allowed to stand .
Opponents argued that EPA could not legally approve the rule change because it conflicts with the provisions of the Clean Water Act .
Apparently that was of no consequence to administrator Stephen Johnson , who signed off despite the opposition of the governors of Kentucky and Tennessee , whose states will be among those affected .

EPA ’s own scientists have concluded that “ dumping mining waste into streams devastates downstream water quality , ” said Edward C. Hopkins , policy analyst for the Sierra Club .
And in some cases , streams will be obliterated altogether as the “ overburden ” that is blasted away to reveal coal seams is dumped into adjacent valleys , covering up seasonal water flows that comprise many Appalachian headwaters .
The EPA action is the latest in a decades - old history of political oppression that has harmed the people of Appalachia as badly as the land they inhabit .
Most of the press since Tuesday ’s announcement has focused on the environmental destruction wreaked by mountaintop removal ( MTR ) mining : the total reshaping of the region ’s topography , including the destruction of more than 400 mountaintops comprising 800,000 acres , and 1200 headwater streams thus far .
Less attention is paid to the human impacts of this practice , which are equally disturbing .
Mountaintop removal mining takes away jobs
The counties where MTR mining is practiced are the poorest in the nation .
Of the 100 counties with the lowest incomes in the U.S. , 29 are in Kentucky , where the average household income is about $ 16,000 a year .
Underground coal miners can make $ 40,000 - 50,000 a year , but in a region where the economic benefits of coal are constantly touted by the industry and the many politicians in its pocket , MTR is taking those jobs away .

An MTR operation exposes shallow coal seams with heavy equipment and dynamite using a fraction of the human labor force of conventional underground mining .
As MTR has increased , industry jobs have shrunk .
About 17,000 people currently work in the central Appalachian coalfields compared to 150,000 in the 1970s and ‘ 80s , said Chuck Nelson , a West Virginia miner - turned - activist who spoke to a group of journalists that toured two MTR sites in West Virginia during the Society of Environmental Journalists conference in October .
Industry figures put the employment figure nearer 20,000 , but it ’s a far smaller number than it was two or three decades ago , since the advent of MTR .
Mountaintop removal mining has devastating health consequences
Chuck Nelson Chuck Nelson
While MTR is less expensive for the industry , “ it ’s not so cheap for the people who have to live around it , ” said Nelson .
When 3 million pounds of dynamite are detonated every day in Appalachia , residents of these remote hollows live with constant noise , rattling windows , cracked foundations , and tainted wells .
Regulations allow explosions within 300 feet from a house .
Flying debris has destroyed structures , and in one case killed a young boy as he lay sleeping when a boulder crashed through his bedroom wall .
Coal dust coats the inside and outside of houses near such operations .
The result may be silicosis , rather than black lung disease , but the outcome of such lethal respiratory diseases is the same .
Then there is the cost of cancer .
It ’s the biggest killer in Appalachia , said Larry Gibson , an activist whose family has lived on Kayford Mountain , W. Va. , for 230 years , surrounded now by the bleak devastation of 7500 acres of adjacent peaks that have been blown away .
The problem is poisoned water .

Up to 60 different chemicals are used in the slurry process that washes the coal once it is separated from the blast debris .
The heavy metals that occur naturally in coal , including mercury , arsenic , lead , cadmium , and selenium , leach into the water used in the coal washing process and subsequently can permeate groundwater .
The wastewater is either injected into mountainsides , often into abandoned underground mines , or penned up in gigantic , unlined slurry holdings that also contain diesel and fertilizer residue from the explosives .
Though EPA ’s latest ruling allows a dramatic expansion of what can be legally dumped , water tainted by toxic sludge is nothing new to many residents of the remote hollows where MTR mining occurs .
Just ask residents of Prenter , W. Va .
When they turn on their taps , the water runs black for 250 households in a 10 - square - mile area , Nelson said .
A YouTube video shows a penny held under a bathroom faucet tarnished in seconds by hydrogen sulfide , a neurotoxin in the community ’s well water .
Vegetable gardens die .
And the people of Prenter are dying , too .
An informal survey of residents showed exceptional rates of gallbladder disease , skin conditions , kidney and liver disease , brain tumors and thyroid cancer .
Prenter is three miles from a slurry injection site , yet state and local officials say they ca n’t do anything because they can’t confirm that coal mining is responsible for the problems .
And Prenter is not alone .
In nearby Mingo County , reports Dana Kuhnline of The Dominion , residents near another slurry site also suffer from high rates of rare diseases , where the same chemicals found in coal slurry have been found in well water at rates thousands of times the legal limit .
Mountaintop removal mining threatens to annihilate communities
While polluted water is usually a problem emanating from below , there is also the risk of a slurry dam break , threatening to inundate whole communities and their natural environs with billions of gallons of thick chemical soup .

Marsh Fork Elementary sits at the base of one of those impoundments .
Just 400 yards away , 2.8 billion gallons of opaque black slurry is contained behind an earthen dam directly above the school .
Years of efforts by local residents to get the state of West Virginia to relocate the school have been fruitless .
Thirty minutes from Gibson ’s home on Kayford Mountain , the biggest slurry impoundment in the nation , Brushy Fork , is designed to hold a staggering 9 billion gallons of sludge .
The ‘ lake ’ surface is the size of a football field , and the dam wall , constructed of rubble left over from blasting , is permitted at more than 900 feet .
The impoundment happens to be built on top of a maze of underground mine shafts , with blasting occurring nearby .

Despite assurances by industry that such impoundments are secure , evidence exists to the contrary .
A slurry dam collapsed at Buffalo Creek , W. Va. , in 1972 , sending 132 million gallons of liquid waste in a 20 - to 30 - foot torrent that killed 125 people and left 4000 homeless .
More recently , 306 million gallons of toxic coal sludge was released near Inez , Kentucky , on Oct. 11 , 2000 , when a rupture occurred in the bottom of a holding impoundment owned by a subsidiary of Massey Energy .
The sludge leaked into an underground mine , then burst out two portals into two creeks , eventually oozing 100 miles downstream to devastate the Tug Fork and Big Sandy rivers .
Community water supplies were closed , aquatic life eradicated , and yards and gardens buried beneath feet of sticky , chemical - laden goo .

The EPA called it the worst environmental disaster east of the Mississippi .
It was the nation ’s worst - ever blackwater spill , 30 times larger than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill , though few Americans outside the region knew about it .
That ’s not surprising , given the Bush Administration ’s efforts to cover it up .
Structural conditions are similar at Brushy Fork , a much larger impoundment , which has been chronically cited for permit violations by the WV Department of Environmental Protection .
The United Mine Workers has issued a dire warning for miners and coalfields residents , and Marfork Coal Company ’s own emergency plan
predicts that 990 people could die if the impoundment were to be breached .
Mountaintop removal mining destroys culture
Traditional mountain folk music flourishes in Appalachia Traditional mountain folk music flourishes in Appalachia
A bumper sticker on a pick - up truck parked at Larry Gibson ’s camp on Kayford Mountain read “ Save the Endangered Hillbilly . ”
While “ hillbilly ” has negative connotations for many Americans , the culture of Appalachia ’s “ mountaineers , ” as locals call themselves , is among the most unique in the United States .
Many here have lived off the land for generations , Nelson said , harvesting nuts , gathering medicinal herbs , hunting and fishing .
Some of the country ’s richest musical traditions hail from deep within these mountains , home to the Carter Family .
bluegrass legends like Ralph Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys , and contemporary country singer Kathy Mattea , whose latest album , Coal , is a tribute to miners and a call to end the destruction of mountaintop removal .
But the term “ hillbilly , ” synonymous in many minds with poverty and ignorance , hints at why the long - demeaned people of Appalachia have been impotent to stop mountaintop removal mining and its devastating effects on their communities and traditions .
Gibson calls residents of the coalfield hollers the “ forgotten people of Appalachia , ” whom politicians do not need to court for votes .
Theresa Burriss , professor of Appalachian studies at Radford University , says Appalachia is an “ internally colonized region , ” where residents are constructed as the exotic other , a stereotype journalists often ca n’t see beyond .
When NBC ’s Andrea Mitchell visited Bristol , Virginia , during the fall election season , she referred to it as “ redneck Nascar country , ” a crude offense to the region ’s mountain people , said Burriss .
The fact is , most residents of Appalachia are poor .
Many lack the education taken for granted in other parts of the country .
Those factors conspire to limit political power , but they do not squelch political will .
In the past several years , a hodge - podge of grassroots groups opposed to MTR have come together to create an activist coalition growing in size and influence .
Central to its efforts are citizens like Judy Bonds , daughter of an underground coal miner and an 8th generation resident of West Virginia ’s Coal River Valley .
Bonds , a former waitress and convenience store clerk , has become a vocal community leader as head of Coal River Mountain Watch .
“ My daddy was a mountaineer before he was a coal miner , ” said Bonds , who speaks reverently of her family ’s natural heritage .
Appalachia is an Indian word , Bonds said , for “ endless mountain forest – but not anymore . ”
In 2001 , Bonds and her family were the last residents to evacuate from Marfork Hollow , which was virtually destroyed by MTR mining by that point .
Like many children in the coalfields , Bonds ’ grandson was suffering from asthma , induced by the dust and polluted air .
The catalyst for her activism , she said , was the day her grandson stood in a stream in Coal River Valley with his fists full of dead fish and asked , “ What ’s wrong with these fish ? ”
Bonds told SEJ members of other atrocities she has witnessed , including the deliberate killing of a mother black bear when a worker waited to detonate a charge till she walked atop it .
She relayed another story of a “ mama bear bawling when her babies were covered up by dumping ” rubble .
The ruination of the forests , wildlife , and the ancestral home of her people has turned Bonds into a crusader .
As for the promised economic benefits of MTR mining for her community ?
“ I ca n’t find that prosperity anywhere , ” she said .
“ We have the worst health in the country . ”
Bob Dickerson , on the left Bob Dickerson , on the left
Not all coalfield residents think MTR is egregious , however .
Some , like Bob Dickerson , who works for Pritchard Mining , thinks there are some benefits to leveling the summits .
Flat land , which does n’t exist naturally in southern West Virginia , is valued for building schools , airstrips and shopping centers .
While it is unfortunate , he acknowledges , that some people have to leave the hollers , it has its upside , too : “ It ’s a lot more convenient to go to Wal - Mart … It ’s progress . ”
“ Some people are more set in their ways .
The coal has provided for them for their whole lives , but now when it can provide for others ’ lives , they do n’t want to go . ”
Dickerson believes the challenges of living in the coalfields go with the territory .
“ There ’s always been the trucks , the dust , the poverty … You hate it for the ones that are displaced , but it ’s always been a fact of life in the coal industry . ”
He himself has gotten over it .
Now 48 , he left his home in Cabin Creek half a lifetime ago , when he was 24 .
“ I enjoy being out of the holler now , ” he said , though he still returns to visit the family cemeteries on Memorial Day .
“ I ’m proud of what I do .
I provide energy , ” Dickerson said .
Some telling statistics
The U.S. gets about 50 percent of its total energy from coal .
West Virginia produces about 15 percent of that total .
Coal mining jobs , both direct and indirect , make up about 5 percent of the labor force of West Virginia .
Seventy percent of mining jobs in West Virginia are underground , with the remaining 30 percent in surface mining , including mountaintop removal and long wall mining .
It ’s evident that MTR mining provides an insignificant portion of the total U.S. coal production .
Given its massive environmental and human impacts , any person with a conscience should argue that there are other ways to produce the energy it provides .
The next – and final – installment in this series will provide a list of actions readers can take to help end mountaintop removal coal mining .
Useful Web sites and nonsense from all corners of the web .
The centerpiece of Barack Obama 's overseas tour comes Thursday in Berlin when the Democratic presidential candidate gives the only public foreign policy speech of his trip to an Obama - mad crowd of Germans who see him as another John F. Kennedy .
He 's in a country and a continent making no secret it is ready for change .
" Germans have a great desire to see this as a historic moment , " says Bastian Hermisson of the Heinrich Boll Foundation , who estimates that 100,000 will turn out for the speech .
" His message that people can hope the world can change for the better – that resonates .
The excitement is a sign that we still feel the US is a relevant force , an influence for better or worse . "
On his much - scrutinized world jaunt to listen and learn , the Illinois senator is visiting a city at the heart of America 's traditional alliance after visits to Afghanistan and Iraq , where the US - Europe relationship is most at risk for reasons of war , oil , and security .
Berlin , twice rebuilt in the 20th century , has symbolic significance , experts say – both for Europe 's past and its future .
Germany is regarded as the political epicenter of Europe , strategically located between East and West .
America may cherish its relations with Paris and London , where Obama travels next , but to move Europe as a whole will require the next president to bolster ties with Berlin , experts say .
" In Berlin , his speech is to Europe , not just to Germany , " says Dan Hamilton , director of the Center for Transatlantic Relations at the School of Advanced International Studies ( SAIS ) in Washington .
" It used to be that for the US , the problems were Europe 's divisions .
Today , the challenge is unity .
Berlin reflects this in a way no other city in Europe does . "
This city , with its plethora of historical sites , reflects many fears and hopes of the new Europe : Berlin has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey .
New immigrant groups mean that in some schools , very little German is spoken .
Russian - language newspapers abound in the subway press stands .
There are fears of a rising China , and , closer to home , angst about rapidly depopulating cities in the old East .
Berlin is special in the American framework , too : the place where fascism peaked and was defeated ; ground zero for the fight over the political values of democracy and communism , for Kennedy 's " Ich bin ein Berliner " speech , and the fall of the Berlin Wall .
Today it is where East meets
West in a vastly freer but more complicated world .
Obama is expected to stress that an America under his leadership would not act unilaterally , will close Guantánamo , be newly cooperative with Europe on climate change and energy .
But the presumptive nominee is also expected to add a note of realism , saying that a productive new relationship will require more of Europe – in Afghanistan , and even in Iraq .
Dr. Hamilton , a former deputy assistant secretary of State , anticipates something like , " If Europe and the US stick together , they represent a core group that can get things done in this world .
If we do n't work together , things do n't get done .
Iraq and [ the ] Kyoto [ Protocol ] are examples . "
" The guy needs to demonstrate a willingness to move toward a multilateral approach , " says François Heisbourg , head of the Paris - based Foundation for Strategic Research .
" I do n't think the Europeans expect a detailed foreign policy speech .
They want to know if he 's a quick learner , does he understand how serious security policy is ? "
His audience is n't likely to be hard to win over .
Obama may be taking political heat at home , and he 's run into a local spat over the location of the Berlin speech .
But Germans on both the left and right do n't seem to care : 76 percent of Berliners would vote for him , and he 's been dubbed by influential news magazine Der Spiegel as " the president of the world . "
He could " stand on his head " and it would n't matter , said one media critic .
Obama originally sought to speak at the historic Brandenburg Gate , but Chancellor Angela Merkel disapproved .
" No German candidate for high office would even think of using the National Mall [ in Washington ] ... for a rally because it would not be seen as appropriate , " said spokesman Thomas Steg .
The alternative venue , a famous winged victory column not far away – the Siegessäule featured in the hauntingly beautiful Wim Wenders film " Wings of Desire " – will allow cameras to still frame Obama with the Gate behind .
Obama will , however , meet with Mrs. Merkel .
Born and raised in East Germany and fluent in Russian , she is expected to brief him on why Europe has a different take on Moscow .
The next US president will have to deal with the thorny question of NATO expansion into Georgia and Ukraine next year – opposed by Germany , but broadly supported by both US parties .
Karen Donfried , vice president of the German Marshall Fund in Washington , argues that Obama 's upside in Europe is his ability to inspire .
" He 's an inspirational individual and that may be important when it comes to offering a vision that asks Europeans to do more .
Currently there 's a disconnect between policy elites and the public in Europe . "
Obama 's post- cynical style " makes it possible to have faith in politics , " agrees Norbert Rottgen , of Merkel 's conservative CDU party .
The potential downside , Dr. Donfried says , would take place if Senator McCain defeats Obama .
" The Europeans all think Obama is already elected , they think he will win .
If he does n't , it 's going to be a huge letdown in Europe . "
The prospect of the three - day week returned to haunt Britain yesterday as it emerged that ministers are considering paying firms to cut hours in order to survive the recession .
Tens of thousands of businesses are already planning to scale back working hours this year in an effort to stay afloat .
But as the country comes to terms with the reality of a recession , it emerged that the Government is looking at compensating employees , through their firms – thereby drawing comparisons with the shutdowns of the 1970s .
While the move would safeguard jobs , it would mean that the financial crisis is on a much larger scale , further undermining confidence in the economy with the suggestion of Britain grinding to a halt .

Major firms such as JCB have already downed tools for one day a week and are considering moving to a three - day week , with state help , if the recession gets worse .
The firm 's chief executive , Matthew Taylor , said that he is pressing Lord Mandelson , the Secretary of State for Business , to introduce compensation for workers if their hours are reduced .
Some of the jobs earmarked for redundancy , he said , could be saved if the move is introduced by April .
Ministerial sources insisted last night that a scheme to help compensate workers was " not imminent " but said it was an option being discussed .
It would match measures introduced by the German government .
The Thatcher government brought in a short - time working directive in the 1980s to cover earnings lost through shorter hours .
Such a move would cost the Government millions of pounds , but would be cheaper than the huge rise in unemployment benefit claims as a result of job losses .
Yet the move would stir bad memories of the three - day week of the early 1970s , when the Heath government imposed a cut in hours to save electricity as a result of industrial action .
Advice on how to ride the downturn published on the Department for Business website tells firms that cutting hours is one way to reduce overheads and ride the economic storm .
The guide , Real Help for Businesses Now , suggests firms could cut staff costs by reducing hours , rather than by making redundancies .
" Cutting overheads such as property costs ... will take much longer to have an effect on the balance sheet , " it said .
" You can also cut staff costs by restricting overtime or cutting staff hours .
You could also consider reducing your number of employees – though redundancy payments will increase costs in the short term .
However , the consequences of redundancies can be devastating , particularly for small businesses , and morale could suffer . "
Experts fear that the recession could be the worst for 60 years .
Figures released on Friday showed that the economy is contracting faster than at any time since 1980 .
Kenneth Clarke , the new shadow Secretary of State for Business , last night accused Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling of " panicking " over the recession .
Ministers were treating voters " like fools " by claiming they could see the " green shoots " of recovery , Mr Clarke wrote in the News of the World .
Figures from the British Chambers of Commerce , which represent 100,000 firms , show that 39 per cent of businesses are planning to cut hours .

Many firms in the car industry have introduced or are considering a three - day week , such as Bentley Motors in Crewe and Nissan in Sunderland .
But the practice is spreading to the rest of the manufacturing sector , and business leaders fear it is only a matter of time before other industries resort to the measure .
Mr Taylor , of JCB , said : " We would rather go to a shorter working week than lay people off . "
Three - day weeks have been backed by the unions , whose members are happier to take pay cuts than lose their entire salary and pension benefits .
Government sources said there were issues about whether to restrict compensation to the car industry or apply it to all firms .
The CBI refused to comment last night , but a source said some firms would be able to reduce output to three days more easily than others .
When the three - day week crippled Britain
The three - day week carries a particular resonance for anyone who remembers the 1970s , as it recalls a time when firms were forced into short - time working , redundancies , and lay - offs .
As now , the crisis erupted amid an economic emergency .
But the cause of a problem that crippled the nation 's infrastructure was not a financial calamity but a breakdown in industrial relations .
Britain 's miners walked out on 9 January 1972 – their first strike in 50 years – over the failure to meet their demand for £ 9 on top of an average weekly wage of £ 25 .
The impact of closing all 289 pits in England and Wales – and pickets at power stations – was dramatic .
A month later , the Prime Minister , Edward Heath , declared a state of emergency and , with dwindling electricity supplies forcing factories to close , he imposed a three - day week .
A week into the state of emergency , it was announced that electricity would be switched off on a rota basis between 7 am and midnight every day .
By the middle of February , it was estimated 1.2 million people had been laid off .
Imperial Chemical Industries ( ICI ) gave a week 's notice to its 60,000 weekly paid staff as a precautionary measure .
Although the crisis ended with a pay deal on 19 February , the miners repeated their industrial action less than two years later , provoking another three - day week and , ultimately , the removal of the Heath government in February 1974 .

The Wall Street Journal Debunks the Myth of Alternative Medicine
We frequently criticize the media for gullible reporting of pseudoscience and inaccurate reporting of real science .
But sometimes they exceed our fondest hopes and get it spectacularly right .
On December 25 , 2008 , the Wall Street Journal gave us all a Christmas present : they printed an article by Steve Salerno that was a refreshing blast of skepticism and critical thinking about alternative medicine .
Salerno points out that 38 % of Americans use " complementary and alternative medicine " ( CAM ) and it is being increasingly accepted in hospitals and medical schools .
He says this should be a laughing matter but is n't because of the huge amounts of money being spent on ineffective treatments .
Not to speak of the huge amounts of money being wasted on implausible research at the NCCAM .
He highlights a painful irony : the same medical centers that once fought quackery are now embracing it , not because they think it will improve patient care , but because it will increase their revenue .
Salerno quotes Dr. George Lundberg , one of the many who have said there is no such thing as CAM .
There can be alternatives within medicine ( like which antibiotic to choose ) but there can be no " alternative medicine . "
There is only medicine that has been proven to work and medicine that has n't .
If science showed that an " alternative " treatment really worked , it would be promptly and enthusiastically incorporated into standard medical practice and would no longer be considered " alternative . "
So the very term is misleading .
" Alternative medicine " is not a scientific concept .
It is a political , ideological ploy intended to raise public respect for a mishmash of untested , unproven , and even disproven treatments that are rejected by the scientific community .
We used to call those treatments quackery , folk remedies , untested , belief - based .
A rose by any other name ...
Why should we have " alternative " medicine if we do n't have " alternative " engineering ?
Dr. Mark Crislip wrote a brilliant satire entitled " Alternative Flight . "
He says , " Americans want choice .... People need to be free to choose their mode of flight based on alternative concepts of gravity and alternative airplane design .... you can focus your Qi dong to harmonize with the airplane to decrease the mass of the airplane and provide a more efficient forward motion .
Or collapse your personal wave function to arrive at your destination early . "
It 's easy to see why alternative flight is nonsense .
Why is it so hard for most people to see that most of " alternative " medicine is equally nonsensical ?
Most people are smart enough not to fly on an " alternative " airplane , but they 're eager to fork out $ 125 for an hour - long session of DNA Activation Healing , they buy water disguised as homeopathic remedies , and they let reflexologists treat their gallbladder by pressing on their feet .
For most of human history , people used medicines recommended by friends or tradition .
Sometimes they worked ; sometimes they did n't .
Then humanity discovered a wonderful thing : the scientific method .
Medicines could be tested to find out the truth about what really worked .
Alternative medicine is a step backwards : it asks us to forget about good science and believe in testimonials , untested treatments , irrational , and even disproven treatments .
I can hear readers now , saying " But some of those treatments might really work . "
Maybe , but only science can tell us which ones .
Science does n't waste time testing every crackpot idea ; it has to choose promising avenues of research .
Would you want to divert funds from cancer research to re-evaluate the efficacy of bloodletting for balancing the humours ?
Or to re-examine all those alleged perpetual motion machines ?
It may have been reasonable to test St. John 's wort ; but it is not reasonable to keep testing ultra-dilute homeopathic remedies .
It is not reasonable to keep looking for a mythical chiropractic " subluxation " after a century of failure to find it .
It is not reasonable to fund studies on " therapeutic touch " unless someone can demonstrate that " human energy fields " exist and can be detected by nurses ' hands .
Is there any " alternative " treatment that was ever tested , found to be effective , and subsequently incorporated into standard medical practice ?
I do n't think that has ever happened except for herbal remedies .
Herbal remedies are a special , plausible subset of " alternative " treatments in that they contain active ingredients with physiologic effects .
They are drugs .
Plants are regularly evaluated by scientific pharmacology .
Many of the remedies touted by " alternative " advocates have not been properly tested by pharmacology , usually because they do n't offer enough promise to warrant further testing .
Foxglove was a folk remedy for heart disease .
It clearly worked .
The effects were robust and consistent , not marginal and erratic like so many alternative remedies today .
It was promising enough to warrant proper scientific testing .
It was analyzed , purified , and a standardized product was developed .
It had side effects and the therapeutic dose was dangerously close to the lethal dose , so scientists developed a synthetic variant that was safer .
Today we can buy a Digoxin pill with a precise dose instead of crushing a foxglove leaf and taking potluck .
Is foxglove an example of an alternative medicine that was adopted by scientific medicine ?
Not really .
It 's simply a good example of science in action .
As Bob Park says in his book Superstition , if it 's not science , it 's superstition .
There is only one kind of medicine we can trust : science - based medicine .
We should be trying to weed out every vestige of superstition in scientific medical practice , not embracing new superstitions from alternative medicine .
Thank you , Wall Street Journal , for the injection of sanity !
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Wachovia reported a massive loss of nearly $ 24 billion Wednesday , in what was expected to be its last quarter as an independent company .
The struggling Charlotte , N.C. - based bank , which agreed to be acquired by Wells Fargo earlier this month , reported a net loss of $ 23.9 billion , or $ 11.18 a share , which included a whopping $ 18.8 billion impairment charge partly related to the planned merger .
Just a year ago , the company reported a profit of $ 1.62 billion , or 85 cents a share .
Despite the recent turmoil in financial markets , analysts were actually expecting the company to report a third - quarter profit of $ 547 million , or 2 cents a share .
Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) shares fell 1.6 % in early NYSE trading .
Wells Fargo execs , including CEO John Stumpf , said Wachovia 's results were about as dreary as they expected after poring over the company 's books and agreeing to buy the bank earlier this month .
" Wachovia 's third - quarter results were very much in line with our expectations , " Stumpf said in a statement .
Like many of its peers , Wachovia was hit hard this quarter by issues of credit and bad bets on the U.S. mortgage market , most notably its 2006 purchase of the California mortgage lender Golden West Financial Corp .
Over the last three months , the company said it set aside $ 4.8 billion for loan losses , as the economy showed increasing signs of weakness and the housing market continued to deteriorate in already hard - hit parts of the country such as California and Florida .
Wachovia added Wednesday that non-performing assets , or loans that are not collecting interest or principal payments , increased five - fold from a year earlier to just over 3 % of all loans .
Still , much of the blame for Wednesday 's results was the $ 18.8 billion impairment related , in part , to the tie - up with Wells Fargo .
Morgan Keegan analyst Robert Patten said the charge represented just how hard the two companies were working to clean up Wachovia 's books before proceeding with the merger .
" You want to set up '09 to look as good as possible , " he said .
Moot earnings
Assuming the company 's anticipated merger with Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) comes off without a hitch , Wachovia 's latest quarterly numbers will prove largely moot .
Still , the results offer a glimpse into just how badly the company was faring when investors seemed all but certain that Wachovia was destined to collapse .
Fears about Wachovia 's ultimate demise first took hold in mid-September following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and shortly after Lehman rival Merrill Lynch was forced into the arms of Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) .
Speculation continued to swirl about the 129 - year - old bank in the days that followed , including rumors of a possible merger with with investment bank Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) .
Even as Wachovia 's consumer customers remained relatively calm about the bank 's fate in the days that followed , Wednesday 's results revealed that commercial depositors feared that the bank could be next .
In just one quarter , the amount of commercial core deposits plunged by a colossal 24 % from the previous quarter to $ 83.4 billion .
( Big customers flee )
Regulators finally interceded on Wachovia 's behalf the last weekend in September , helping broker a $ 2.2 billion purchase of Wachovia 's banking assets by Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) .
Wachovia had a change of heart just days later , as it agreed to a sweetened offer from San Francisco - based Wells Fargo for all of Wachovia 's operations .
After some legal wrangling , Citigroup eventually walked away , leaving Wells Fargo in control of Wachovia in a deal worth $ 11.7 billion .
Wachovia shareholders have yet to approve the deal , although they are widely expected to do so by year 's end .
The combination of the two firms would transform Wells Fargo into a major player in the U.S. banking industry , with approximately $ 1.4 trillion in assets , a footprint in 39 states and the nation 's second - biggest retail brokerage network .
I fell in love ( actually lust ) with “ Taken ” starring Liam Neeson after the first time I saw the trailer .
The calm in Neeson ’s voice just sells the character / plot so hard .
SO HARD !
I did n’t expect an Oscar caliber movie .
I expected Liam Neeson to be a fucking bad ass and kill every mother fucker that took his daughter until there were no mother fuckers left to kill .
According to Josh and Eli , that is EXACTLY what you get … in the Rated - R European version of the film .
WTF Hollywood ?
Since when are we cutting out the violence for U.S. movies ?
I would n’t take a kid to see this film even if you replaced all the blood with rainbow unicorn vomit , so what gives ?
It ’s obviously intended for adults .
So once again , H - Wood has forced my hand .
I will wait for the Unrated DVD ( which I will get from Netflix ) .
So instead of $ 20 worth of tickets and $ 20 worth of concessions they ’ll get whatever percentage of $ 8.99 / month Netflix gives them .
I wo n’t say how Josh and Eli saw the international version , but it rhymes with Bit Torrent .
I do n’t know how you guys feel , but for me sometimes a movie like “ Taken ” is all you need .
It has just enough story to keep the action going and a cool - headed badassmith like Liam Neeson to carry it and keep you focused .
QUESTION TIME !
What are your favorite “ I ’m A Badass and I Must Kill Everyone Until I Am The Last One Standing !!! ”
( IABIMKEUIATLOS !!! for short ) movies ?
What other movies have had awesome Eurpean cuts and beefed it on the US release ?
Mitochondria are central to many theories of aging because they produce damaging reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as a by - product of normal function .
Over time , ROS can degrade mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) , interfering with cellular energy production .
The cell ’s strategy for dealing with this damage is to recycle its mitochondria on a regular basis : some are destroyed while others replicate ( whether these processes are ultimately under nuclear or mitochondrial control , or even whether they are random or directed , is still unknown ) .
Mitochondria replicate far more often than the cells they live in : every couple of days in liver cells , and every few weeks in post-mitotic brain cells .
Generally , the faster the mitochondria turn over , the better – it ’s a good idea to replace mitochondrial populations before too much mtDNA damage accumulates .
In experiments , mitochondrial turnover is measured using a radio - isotope pulse - chase assay .
The basic idea is to radioactively label some mitochondrial proteins , then check at regular time intervals to see whether those proteins are still present in mitochondria .
Assuming that a mitochondrion degrades as a unit , if its proteins are no longer around , then we can infer that it has been degraded .
Turnover rate is measured as the half - life of an exponential decay curve fitted to a plot of mitochondrial radioactivity vs. time .
Oddly , most of the data we have on tissue - specific rates of mitochondrial turnover are decades old , and estimates across studies vary wildly ( up to an order of magnitude ) .
A recent paper by Miwa et al. explains these discrepancies and also shows that calorie restriction speeds mitochondrial turnover :
Mitochondrial turnover in liver is fast in vivo and is accelerated by dietary restriction : application of a simple dynamic model ‘ Mitochondrial dysfunction ’ , which may result from an accumulation of damaged mitochondria in cells due to a slowed - down rate of mitochondrial turnover and inadequate removal of damaged mitochondria during aging , has been implicated as both cause and consequence of the aging process and a number of age - related pathologies .
Despite growing interest in mitochondrial function during aging , published data on mitochondrial turnover are scarce , and differ from each other by up to one order of magnitude .
Here we demonstrate that re-utilization of the radioactively labelled precursor in pulse - chase assays is the most likely cause of significant overestimation of mitochondrial turnover rates .
We performed a classic radioactive label pulse - chase experiment using 14C NaHCO 3 , whose 14C is incorporated into various amino acids , to measure mitochondrial turnover in mouse liver .
In this system , the activity of the urea cycle greatly limited arginine dependent label re-utilization , but not that of other amino acids .
We used information from tissues that do not have an active urea cycle ( brain and muscle ) to estimate the extent of label re-utilization with a dynamic mathematical model .
We estimated the actual liver mitochondrial half life as only 1.83 days , and this decreased to 1.16 days following 3 months of dietary restriction , supporting the hypothesis that this intervention might promote mitochondrial turnover as a part of its beneficial effects .
The main result of this paper is that calorie restriction makes mitochondria turn over a substantial 35 % faster , at least in mouse liver .
This provides another explanation for the recent finding that CR protects mtDNA from age - related damage .
What may prove even more important than that result , however , is the paper ’s critique of standard pulse - chase assay analysis and novel methodology for quantifying mitochondrial turnover .
Here ’s a brief summary of the authors ’ logic :
Label reuse means that turnover times are overestimated
The problem with the usual pulse - chase assay is what the authors call “ label re-utilization ” : after a mitochondrion degrades , some of the labelled pieces of its proteins may be incorporated into a new protein and a different mitochondrion .
This causes turnover time to be overestimated , because it looks like the original mitochondrion has n’t been degraded .
Miwa et al. attribute the large differences in earlier estimates of turnover rates to the practice of fitting a single exponential curve to plots of mitochondrial radioactivity vs. time – in other words , by failing to control for the effects of label reuse .

A two - component model can control for the effects of label reuse
In the liver , the urea cycle converts most 14C ( from 14C NaHCO 3 ) into the amino acid arginine ; and little arginine is reused because arginase is very active in the liver .
However , some of the 14C gets incorporated into different amino acids – and these can be reused .
This means that if we plot radioactivity as a function of time , a single exponential curve wo n’t fit the data very well .
However , Miwa et al . show that a simple sum of two components – a fast exponential decay ( from the arginine , the ‘ signal ’ ) , and a slow linear decrease ( from other amino acids that are re-used , the ‘ noise ’ ) – can do much better .
Of course , it ’s not surprising that a two - component model can beat a one - component one – more components means more parameters to tweak and better fitting flexibility .
Using data from other tissues , the authors demonstrate that their model is more general than that – the theoretical slow component in liver mitochondria is very similar to the measured decay of 14C in other tissues where there is no urea cycle ( i.e. tissues where most of the 14C does n’t become arginine and the ‘ noise ’ component dominates ) .
In the two - component model , turnover rate is measured as the half - life of the fast exponential process .
Perhaps one major reason why mitochondrial turnover rates were so little studied in recent years was purely methodological – no one knew what caused the discrepancies in earlier estimates , or what to do about the poor quality of exponential fits .
Using two - component models , it should now be straightforward to derive rigorous estimates of turnover rates in a variety of experimental conditions relevant to aging .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
On Inauguration Day , there 's one scene at the White House that wo n't be playing out exactly as it has during past transitions : the traditional moving of the outgoing first family 's belongings .
President Bush walks out of the White House Oval Office on January 10 .
Anita McBride , chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush , tells CNN that the Bushes have moved almost all of their belongings out of the White House ahead of schedule .
" There wo n't be ... the moving trucks for the Bushes coming here , " McBride said , adding , " The only things really left for President and Mrs.
Bush are their personal belongings and luggage that they 'll take that day . "
McBride said Mrs. Bush directed residence staff early -- in the summer of 2008 -- to prepare the White House for the personal transition .
" It 's probably the librarian in her , " McBride said of Mrs. Bush , a former librarian .
" Maybe we 've got a bit of a Dewey Decimal system of move - out process , but that certainly made it easier for the residence staff , and they very much appreciate it , " McBride said .
The actual clearing out of the Bushes ' belongings began over the summer , McBride says , when many items were packed and taken to Crawford , Texas .
Then , during the Christmas holiday , the Bushes moved their personal things out of Camp David , the presidential retreat in Maryland , according to McBride .
That means on Inauguration Day , while President Bush and Mrs. Bush , along with President - elect Obama and his family , are at the Capitol , staff in the White House residence will have more time to unpack and prepare the Obamas ' personal belongings .
" They have rehearsed this over the last few weeks , everyone has their marching orders , it will be all hands on deck , " said McBride .
" The residence staff will be here that morning , and they know what their jobs are when the moving truck for the Obamas ' move - in arrives , " she said , adding , " Their things will be unpacked , and their clothes will be in their rightful place , and whatever furniture that they may have selected from the White House furniture collection will be in the place that they want it to be .

Osteoporosis And Depression Linked , Says Study
A review article published in the European journal Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics says there is a relationship between depression and bone metabolism .
The study says that the association between psychiatric illness , in particular depression , and osteoporosis has been the subject of a growing body of research yielding various findings , although most identify some effect on bone .
In addition to medication - related processes and / or modifiable lifestyle factors associated with mood disturbances , endocrine and immune alteration secondary to depression may play a pathogenetic role in bone metabolism .
There are data to suggest low bone mineral density is disproportionately prevalent among those with psychiatric disorders .
This paper aims to review the current evidence on the relationship between depression and bone mineral density , and identify potential mechanisms .
Relevant sources were identified from the Pubmed and Web of Science ( ISI ) databases from the first relevant publication in 1994 to the present , 2007 , using a combination of key words and terms including depression , major depressive disorder , osteoporosis , bone mineral density , hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis , cortisol , cytokines , leptin , antidepressants , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , smoking , alcohol , physical activity and diet .
Reference lists of chosen articles were further reviewed for associated publications .

Sender - inner Carrie L. found these pictures of " Stache " on a message board .
Either Stache has had a little mishap with a Magic Marker , or that is one devastatingly delicate mustache .
And it reminds me of somebody , but I 'm not sure who ...
Now , my left brain , the logical , analytical half that tells me to store my ATM receipts in chronological order for future reference , thinks that he looks like genius supersleuth Hercule Poirot .
But my right brain , the random , creative half that tells me to run through the mall wearing nothing but body paint and ostrich feathers and singing the Oscar Meyer wiener jingle , thinks he looks like surrealist painter Salvador Dali .

In honor of the international workers ’ day celebration , workers in the Gaza Strip held a rally of over 2,000 people at the Erez crossing with Israel , and 300 people at the Rafah border with Egypt , to call for an end to the Israeli siege on Gaza that has led to unemployment rates of 80 % .
Leftist political parties , inclduing the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine , the People ’s Party , the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , and others , organized the Mayday rally to coincide with similar events all over the world .
One of the Erez protest organizers , Ramzi Rabah , told reporters , ‘ We call on the world to stop the siege of Gaza and to come to the defence of Palestinian workers in all Palestinian territories . ’
Mayday is celebrated all over the world to honor working men and women , and to celebrate the achievements of labor organizing movements of the last century .
Many Palestinian workers in Gaza were dependent on Israel for their jobs , and when the siege began after the Palestinian democratic election of Hamas in 2006 , the unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip began to soar to unprecedented levels .
The main Mayday protest in Gaza was held near the Erez border crossing in northern Gaza , between the Gaza Strip and Israel .
Israeli authorities have kept this crossing tightly sealed , allowing only a tiny trickle of goods to enter Gaza , since imposing the siege on the coastal Strip .
Another rally and sit-in was held at the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt , where workers remembered the four Palestinian workers who were gassed to death this week by Egyptian authorities in the tunnels under the Gaza - Egpyt border .
A statement by the Hamas government in Gaza read , ‘ We ask the Egyptian leadership to stop killing our workers by gas that is illegal under international law . ’
The statement added , ‘ Hamas supports all workers , especially those suffering until the end of the siege and the reopening of the crossings . ’
Ms. Jackson indicated in her confirmation hearing this month that she would “ aggressively ” review California ’s application .
The environmental agency has routinely granted California such waivers dozens of times over the past 40 years .
The California law , which was originally meant to take effect in the 2009 model year , requires automakers to cut emissions by nearly a third by 2016 , four years ahead of the federal timetable .
The result would be an increase in fuel efficiency in the American car and light truck fleet to roughly 35 miles per gallon from the current average of 27 .
The emissions standards are part of an ambitious California plan to reduce emissions of the gases that are blamed for the heating of the atmosphere .
Automotive emissions account for more than one - fifth of all such greenhouse gases .
California was joined in its plea by 13 other states , including New York , New Jersey , Connecticut , Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , Oregon and Washington .
Three other states have indicated they plan to adopt the California standard .
Together they account for about half of the American market for cars and light trucks .
Charles Territo , a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , said the car makers would prefer a single national standard and needed time to develop new fuel - sipping models .
“ Applying California standards to several different states would create a complex , confusing and very difficult situation for manufacturers , ” he said last week in anticipation of the Obama administration ’s announcement .
Mr. Obama wants to use the Monday event to promote the environmental and energy elements of his economic plan , aides said .
According to a report released by the White House this weekend , the plan is intended to double renewable energy generating capacity over three years , which would be enough to power six million American homes .
It would also pay for 3,000 miles of new or modernized transmission lines as part of a new national electric grid as well as 40 million “ smart meters , ” which provide instant readouts of electricity uses , on American homes .
The money would also help refurbish two million homes and 75 percent of federal building space to better guard against the weather and conserve enough energy to save low - income families $ 350 a year and the federal government $ 2 billion a year , according to the report .
I 've never lost any sleep when I 've had to take someone 's life : Police firearms officers speak openly for the first time
I ’ve never lost any sleep over when I ’ve had to take someone ’s life , ’ says Ray , a
25 - year veteran of Scotland Yard ’s specialist firearms unit , CO19 .
‘ I do n’t want to sound callous but that ’s what you ’re trained to do .
So when it does happen , why would you be surprised ?
‘ I ’m sure there are blokes who get involved in a shooting and find it does affect them .
But most will go on to have good careers in the department , and that means that maybe they will be in other incidents where someone gets shot .
Trained to kill :
One of the CO19 officers , in shadow to protect his identity .
' The days of the unarmed service are numbered ' he says .
‘ Psychologically , the first shooting is the barrier .
Once you get past that ...’
Ray tails off , leaving the sentence unfinished .
‘ Ultimately it ’s down to your training .
The more realistic it is , the less likely you are to be affected . ’
How many officers still serving in CO19 had already shot someone dead ?
Ray pauses , making a mental calculation .
‘ I ’m not certain but I think the answer is about 17 or 18 . ’
Last week , as the jury reached its open verdict at the end of the inquest into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell Tube station on July 22 , 2005 , by one of Ray ’s former colleagues , The Mail on Sunday conducted the first - ever
in - depth interviews with members of the elite CO19 unit .
Over many hours talking with Ray , now retired , and Chris , another recently retired officer who served in CO19 for a decade , we formed an extraordinary picture of the reality of life for the men and women who put themselves in harm ’s way in Scotland Yard ’s fight against terrorism and organised crime .
An armed police officer patrols outside Stockwell Tube station on the day Jean Charles de Menezes was shot dead
Ray and Chris are not their real names : our interviews were conducted on condition of strict anonymity .
Even after retirement , some principal officers are shielded by the equivalent of the witness protection programme : ‘ I ’ve got someone I call my guardian angel , ’ Ray says .
‘ Someone who keeps in touch , checks on the family and can provide a bolt hole quickly if the media – or someone with a gun – shows up on the doorstep . ’
But instead of the stern , Bond - like figures of popular imagination , we found ourselves with two men who take almost as much pride in their sense of humour , black at times as it is , as they do in their evident professionalism .
‘ We ’re not steely - eyed dealers of death , ’ Chris says .
‘ We ’re good at what we do but we like to have a laugh .
‘ The people I choose to socialise with , the people I choose to work with now , are people I know from working in the unit – because I trust them .
But at the same time , most of us are family guys .
‘ That ’s important : if you look at the guys who go to Afghanistan , they ’re out there for months on end with no normality .
All hell might break loose in our working day but at the end of it we get to go home .
You might be in some s*** hole getting shot at but afterwards you can snuggle up to the wife in bed . ’
Ray says that , understandably enough , ‘ the guys who make a success of this will be very steady blokes ’ .
Nevertheless , the de Menezes shooting , and its long , anguished aftermath , have imposed a heavy burden , to which no one in CO19 was immune .
The Operation Kratos guidelines for dealing with suspected suicide bombers that were in force for the shooting at Stockwell did , Ray says , mark a significant departure from the unit ’s normal procedures .
Under Kratos , one officer will hold the suspect ’s arms while another fires shots at the subject ’s head , aiming specifically for the brain stem – as the policeman who killed de Menezes did , unaware he was shooting an innocent Brazilian electrician .
Ray says : ‘ Operation Kratos means you are effectively executing someone on someone else ’s say so .
For us , the question from the start was , are we going to be backed up ?
Whenever we shoot someone , you know the kind of headlines we get : things like , “ Crazy cop killed our son . ”
‘ If I shoot someone , I ’m a cop .
If I get shot myself , I ’m a bobby .
People do n’t much like cops but they love bobbies .
That ’s how it is when the suspect is armed and dangerous but the fallout from using Kratos against the wrong person has obviously been far worse .
‘ Imagine , though , if they had n’t shot de Menezes but he had been a terrorist and killed an officer .
The whole force would have basked in the glory of his sacrifice – not that it would have helped his wife and kids . ’
Ray says the public ’s expectations of armed units can be unrealistic .
‘ A lot of the time , they ’re based on the movies , on scenes where the SWAT team goes in silently and all the commands are hand signals given with total efficiency .
‘ They forget they ’re seeing take ten , and they ’re actors , anyway .
When we make mistakes , it ’s real world .
But at the end of the day we ’re human and we ’re using equipment made by humans ’ – such as the radios that failed to work inside the station when de Menezes was killed .
Nevertheless , after Stockwell the support from the Yard ’s hierarchy , especially the then commissioner Sir Ian Blair , was exemplary .
‘ Blair was unpopular with some rank - and - file officers , ’ Ray says , ‘ but not with the SFO [ specialist firearms officer ] teams .
‘ Down the years , most senior management have tried to pretend we do n’t exist .
We ’re the absolute opposite of the image they ’re trying to portray of the caring , community police service .
‘ Blair was different .
He used to come down to our operating base and he saw what we do . ’
Once , Ray adds , the commissioner was due to be on holiday at
a time when the Crown Prosecution Service was expected to announce whether any officer would face criminal charges over the de Menezes death .
‘ He took the home and mobile phone numbers of all the officers who had been on that team away with him .
He wanted to be kept abreast of the blokes ’ domestic situations and so on and , if need be , he wanted to be able to ring them to provide support . ’
Ray scotches a rumour about the shooting that has been doing the rounds in London for months – that the team at Stockwell included soldiers from the SAS .
‘ Sometimes we exercise with them and in the past they have come out with us to see how we do things and share expertise .
But when they have it ’s been under the very strict rule : they ’re observers and cannot carry weapons . ’
Chris says : ‘ The public thinks that when someone gets shot it ’s a terrible thing .
Well , it is but you need to set that against the number of operations when no one gets shot . ’
Each year , CO19 will be deployed around 1,000 times but in many years kills no one .
‘ In ten years I must have gone on 2,000 operations and never fired once , ’ he says .
He recalls a time when a man bore down on him with a huge , curved machete .
‘ It would have been the easiest thing for him to have lost his life but there was something about his body language that made me convinced he would drop it , and he did . ’
About ten per cent of the Met ’s 31,000 officers are licensed to carry firearms , spread across various specialist squads – the Royal and Diplomatic Protection Group and the Airport Division , for example .
‘ That ’s got to drive you bonkers , has n’t it ? ’ says Chris , ‘ strolling across the concourse with an MP5 rifle , from Costa Coffee to Boots , day after day . ’
Ray adds :
‘ We jokingly call Diplomatic Protection the “ door protection group ” .
Some of them are top blokes but ultimately the reason there ’s a fat guy with an MP5 outside the Colombian embassy is that if we took him away , the Colombians would take away the platoon of soldiers and the armoured Humvee outside the British embassy in Bogota . ’
But the SFOs of CO19 are the elite of the elite .
Even the 400 officers who work on the ‘ entry level ’ armed response vehicle ( ARV ) teams on permanent armed patrol come further down the pecking order in terms of training , skills and experience .
Ray says the ARVs play a vital role .
They deal with sudden emergencies but because the SFOs are usually acting on specific intelligence the chances of confronting an armed suspect are greater .
There are far fewer SFOs – about 70 – all of whom must already have had years of experience on an ARV , and they then face an 18 - week training course where the demands are relentless .
It starts to bite in week two when would - be recruits find themselves roused in the middle of the night to take part in demanding exercises when the last has barely finished .
The Met , Chris says , gave up doing psychometric tests for SFOs in the Eighties because this style of training was more effective .
‘ The idea is to send them out after an hour ’s sleep to see if they can keep their sense of humour when they ’re already exhausted .
There are times in this job when you end up not going home for a week , just throwing your sleeping bag on the floor and grabbing a couple of hours ’ sleep .
‘ When you ’re on your chinstrap [ dog - tired ] you ca n’t hide your true nature .
Sometimes you end up sitting around for hours .
And sometimes you end up sitting around in a hide , not being able to talk for hours , too .
‘ You can get quiet periods .
But you might also get a period where you ’re run ragged for weeks . ’
After their experience on the ARVs , would - be SFOs know what to expect and sometimes the course pass rate is well over 50 per cent .
Other times , Chris says , it is as low as ten .
‘ You do get the occasional w****r who slips through .
But not many and they do n’t last long . ’
For an SFO , training does n’t stop with the course .
They will complete several months of continuation training every year , often for specific planned operations .
It ’s not enough , says Ray , just to be able to hit a target on the firing range .
SFOs need to be able to shoot straight in poor light , from moving vehicles , or in buildings they ’ve just abseiled into – while being shot at .
Key to this is ‘ simunition ’ – weapons identical to operational models that fire rounds of soap , not bullets .
‘ It will draw blood and it ’s bloody painful , ’ Ray says , ‘ and it means training can be extremely realistic .
But it wo n’t kill you .
Using simunition means you can be shooting at people who are shooting back . ’
The product of this process is an almost entirely male unit where the average age is about 40 and the ethos , both men stress , is ‘ the opposite of gung - ho and macho ’ .
Ray says only three women have served on the SFO teams to date , all with distinction .
Earlier this year , members of CO19 were dismayed by media claims that one of their number , a long - serving member who had been involved in four fatal shootings , was nicknamed ‘ killer ’ .
The officer in question had been paid £ 5,000 in compensation because Commander Susan Akers , the head of the Department of Professional Standards , who was the senior investigating officer overseeing the inquiry into the last of these shootings , had described him as ‘ the Met ’s serial killer ’ .
Ray says that many officers in the unit were convinced that the story and other sensitive information was leaked to the Press as part of a concerted effort to blacken the unit ’s name while the de Menezes inquest was in progress .
‘ I ca n’t think of anyone in the unit who ’s ever had a warlike nickname , ’ Ray says .
He gives some examples : a red - bearded officer who was known as The Cat , not because of his lightning reflexes but ‘ because he looked like he ’d been eating a ginger cat when someone hit him in the face with a spade ’ .
Another was known as Blister – ‘ because he came out whenever the hard work was finished ’ .
Americans , he notes , are different .
‘ Some of us once did some training with a Mid- western SWAT training team .
They all had nicknames like Terminator and Eagle .
The most ridiculous thing is that they were all bodybuilders with bulging muscles and showing off their unit ’s shark tattoo – despite the fact they were living a thousand miles from the sea . ’
SFOs sometimes find their colleagues from other parts of the Met amusing , too .
Inevitably , they often work with the Flying Squad , the modern - day Sweeney that still focuses on armed robbery .
‘ Some of those guys , they ’re still living the dream , ’ Ray says .
‘ You notice it most at the briefing before a job takes place .
They just do n’t speak in recognisable English .
It ’s more like a mixture of cockney rhyming slang and Flying Squad patois – a bit like Life On Mars really .
They ’ll tell you , “ When you get on the plot [ area of operations ] there may be a pair of nostrils [ a sawn - off shotgun ] .
Try not to slaughter it [ do n’t compromise the job ] but if you do bump into some faces just cheese roll ’em [ ignore them ] . ” ’
SFOs take an intense pride in their team ’s resourcefulness and adaptability .
It is , both men say , more than the equal of any similar unit in the world .
‘ That ’s why , in the end , it ’s not as stressful as you might think , ’ Ray says .
‘ If someone works in an office and is stressed , often he or she has no way of releasing it .
We ’re working with people we really enjoy working with and we do get ways of releasing it .
‘ When you take out an armed drug dealer and you have to use a bit of cunning and at the end he ’s lying on the floor trussed up with a wet patch on his trousers – that ’s a buzz .
We call it “ runaway giggling ” .
‘ Of course , if you make one mistake , that ’s it .
Sometimes SFOs get hurt :
We ’ve had officers shot on operations but we get more injuries in training – a lot of glass and blast injuries from the pyrotechnics we sometimes use to put doors and windows in .
But being shot is God ’s way of telling you you ’ve made a tactical error .
Much better to shoot the bad guy before he shoots you . ’
Making training realistic means ‘ there are no surprises out there , ’ Ray says .
At the same time , the experience of being an SFO in armed combat remains , for most of us , difficult to grasp .
‘ People who have n’t been in harm ’s way , who have n’t been in armed confrontations , wo n’t know this .
But the reality is like a car crash – like when you suddenly lose concentration and find yourself heading toward a bus .
The human mind fills in the gaps and perceptions of time , space and sound are distorted .
‘ I can remember being in situations when whole sentences formed in my mind at a speed at which I could never have spoken them , in the gap between shot three and shot four .
Or a bullet that passed six inches from my ear – and I thought , “ Who ’s that shooting up on the next floor ?
It was so quiet . ” ’
However , Ray and Chris are both convinced that throughout the police service such experiences are becoming more common .
‘ In many areas of London now , there ’s not a possibility that an officer will be confronted by an armed suspect , but a probability , ’ says Chris .
A year or so ago , four officers were chatting in the street when a car pulled up and a man ‘ hosed them ’ with a submachine gun , firing all 32 rounds .
Miraculously , no one was killed or seriously injured but , says Chris , ‘ this was amazing : a bloke fired an automatic at unarmed police officers and it did n’t even get in the papers ’ .
Ray says : ‘ The risks are getting too high .
Morally , the days of the unarmed service are numbered . ’
For a moment , the mood feels sombre .
Then the humour returns .
Ray quips : ‘ Of course , I accept there are many officers who would n’t want to be armed .
There ’s also some others I would n’t give a gun to in a million years . ’
If anyone is ashamed of me and my words , the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels .
Before you agree with the recent JAMA report that Ginkgo biloba did not prevent dementia , you may want to consider how the study was conducted and whether or not the conclusion researchers made was legitimate .
The study was a large - scale clinical trial on the effectiveness of Ginkgo in reducing the incidence of dementia and Alzheimer ’s disease .
Six medical centers participated with 3069 volunteers 75 years or older .
Of the total number of volunteers , 2587 had no cognitive disorders and 482 had mild cognitive impairment .
The volunteers were tracked for a median of 6 years and used either a placebo or 120 mg ginkgo extract twice daily .
The dementia rate was 2.9 per 100 person - years in the placebo group and 3.3 in the Ginkgo group .
The researchers concluded that 120 mg of Ginkgo biloba twice daily was not effective in reducing the rate of dementia or Alzheimer ’s disease in either those with impaired or normal cognition .
The press has interpreted this to mean that Ginkgo biloba is not generally effective .
Do you believe this conclusion ?
“ Well , yes , of course , ” say a lot of health practitioners .
“ I wo n’t recommend it anymore in my practice ! ”
If you ’re in that group of people who say they wo n’t consider using ginkgo , you may want to think again .
Scientific Oxymoron Unveiled
There ’s a huge fallacy that exists in the minds of most people regarding research studies .
That fallacy is that you can prove that something is NOT effective .
This is a scientific oxymoron .
Science is the systematic observation , measurement and classification of observable phenomenon .
The absence of a relationship cannot be observed , classified or measured .
Thus , scientific studies can only prove what exists , not what does not exist .
You ca n’t show or prove safety in a research study .
You ca n’t show or prove something does not have an effect .
It ’s impossible to qualify and quantify a relationship with something that does not exist .
In this case , the absence of an effect of Ginkgo biloba on Alzheimer ’s disease .
Pharmaceutical companies use scientific tests to prove that drugs are safe when very often it ’s later found that many of them are not .
Science has limitations .
The ginkgo study is a good example ; there are just too many variables that were not measured .
Jumping to Conclusions is Too Easy
There are too many research studies where scientists make blanket statements and generalizations and jump to conclusions without considering all of the data .
These blanket statements are all too often the result of poor study design , inappropriate research study methods , lack of planning and possibly even financial backing to prove something for a company .
The ginkgo study superficially demonstrates a lack of effect of ginkgo on cognition ; however , as stated above and for the following reasons , this conclusion is flawed :
While numerous studies have found that ginkgo improves cognition , the two main causes of Alzheimer ’s disease are clearly oxidation and glycation ; yet in this study , researchers did not address either .
Diet is the major cause of glycation and oxidation .
Excess consumption of sugar and polyunsaturated fats maximize the production of advanced glycation endproducts in the body , which drastically increase the potential for Alzheimer ’s disease and neurodegeneration .
Any study relating to the initiation or progression of Alzheimer ’s disease would have to monitor the two most important contributors to its development , glycation and oxidation .
The wrong herb was used .
A professional herbalist should have been consulted for this study .
An herbalist is not a pharmacist and a pharmacist is not an herbalist .
Herbalists seldom use a single herb to remediate a health situation or attempt to produce a change in the body .
Hundreds of studies on ginkgo are listed , over 2000 total , on PubMed alone .
These studies accurately measure both its quantitative and qualitative neuroprotective effects .
A large body of evidence has been accumulated on the actions of ginkgo on the brain through population studies , animal studies , human studies with blood indices and tissue studies .
It ’s well known that Ginkgo increases circulation to specific tissues , including the brain .
The median study time was 6 years .
Alzheimer ’s and dementia take decades to develop .
A study with Ginkgo biloba alone would require several decades .
The synergistic effect of a group of herbs taken together can be expected to produce a greater effect than the benefit of each herb taken by itself .
Successful treatment will not come from any one substance .
The bottom line is that no responsible herbalist would send someone home with Ginkgo biloba and tell them that Ginkgo was all that was needed to prevent neurodegeneration .
Any good researcher would have looked at the available scientific evidence and found that alpha-lipoic acid , resveratrol , numerous polyphenols , carnosine , and benfotiamine have profound effects on the processes of oxidation and glycation and designed the study based on that evidence .
The JAMA study was poorly designed .
It was not conducted for an adequate length of time .
The conclusions of the study falsely suggest that herbal treatment of dementia and Alzheimer ’s does not work .
One of President Elect Obama ’s new goals is to do a line item review of what is being funded by the government .
Why not start with faulty , inconclusive medical research that proves nothing ?
More on preventing and treating Alzheimer ’s disease successfully next time …

Colchicine Information
Posted by PAXCO on March 21 , 1999 at 11:41:04 :
Polyploidy ( favorable traits in Cannabis ) has not been shown to occur naturally in Cannabis ; however , it
may be induced artificially with colchicine treatments .
Colchicine is a poi- sonous compound extracted
from the roots of certain Colchicum species ; it inhibits chromosome segregation to daughter cells and
cell wall formation , resulting in larger than average daughter cells with multiple chromosome sets .
The
studies of H. E. Warmke et al. ( 1942 -1944 ) seem to indicate that colchicine raised drug levels in
Cannabis .
It is unfortunate that Warmke was unaware of the actual psychoactive ingredients of Cannabis
and was therefore unable to extract THC .
His crude acetone extract and archaic techniques of bioassay
using killifish and small freshwater crustaceans are far from conclusive .
He was , however , able to produce
both triploid and tetraploid strains of Cannabis with up to twice the potency of dip - bid strains ( in their
ability to kill small aquatic organisms ) .
The aim of his research was to " produce a strain of hemp with
materially reduced marijuana content " and his results indicated that polyploidy raised the potency of
Cannabis without any apparent increase in fiber quality or yield .
Warmke 's work with polyploids shed
light on the nature of sexual determination in Cannabis .
He also illus - trated that potency is genetically
determined by creating a lower potency strain of hemp through selective breeding with low potency
parents .
More recent research by A. I. Zhatov ( 1979 ) with fiber Cannabis showed that some
economically valuable traits such as fiber quantity may be improved through polyploidy .
Polyploids
require more water and are usually more sensitive to changes in environment .
Vegetative growth cycles
are extended by up to 30 - 40 % in polyploids .
An extended vegetative period could delay the flowering of
polyploid drug strains and interfere with the formation of floral clusters .
It would be difficult to determine if
canna - binoid levels had been raised by polyploidy if polyploid plants were not able to mature fully in the
favorable part of the season when cannabinoid production is promoted by plentiful light and warm
temperatures .
Greenhouses and artificial lighting can be used to extend the season and test polyploid
strains .
The height of tetraploid ( 4n ) Cannabis in these exper - iments often exceeded the height of the
original diploid plants by 25 - 30 % .
Tetraploids were intensely colored , with dark green leaves and stems
and a well developed gross phenotype .
Increased height and vigorous growth , as a rule , vanish in
subsequent generations .
Tetraploid plants often revert back to the diploid condition , making it diffi- cult to
support tetraploid populations .
Frequent tests are performed to determine if ploidy is changing .
Triploid
( 3n ) strains were formed with great difficulty by crossing artificially created tetraploids ( 4n ) with dip - bids
( 2n ) .
Triploids proved to be inferior to both diploids and tetraploids in many cases .
De Pasquale et al .
( 1979 ) conducted experiments with Cannabis which was treated with 0.25 % and 0.50 % solu- tions of
colchicine at the primary meristem seven days after generation .
Treated plants were slightly taller and
possessed slightly larger leaves than the controls , Anoma - lies in leaf growth occurred in 20 % and 39 % ,
respectively , of the surviving treated plants .
In the first group ( 0.25 % ) cannabinoid levels were highest in
the plants without anomalies , and in the second group ( 0.50 % ) cannabinoid levels were highest in plants
with anomalies , Overall , treated plants showed a 166-250 % increase in THC with respect to controls and
a decrease of CBD ( 30 - 33 % ) and CBN ( 39 - 65 % ) .
CBD ( cannabidiol ) and CBN ( cannabinol ) are
cannabinoids involved in the biosynthesis and degrada- tion of THC .
THC levels in the control plants were
very low ( less than 1 % ) .
Possibly colchicine or the resulting polyploidy interferes with cannabinoid
biogenesis to favor THC .
In treated plants with deformed leaf lamina , 90 % of the cells are tetraploid ( 4 n
40 ) and 10 % diploid ( 2n 20 ) .
In treated plants without deformed lamina a few cells are tetraploid and the
remainder are triploid or diploid .
The transformation of diploid plants to the tetraploid level inevitably
results in the formation of a few plants with an unbalanced set of chromosomes ( 2n + 1 , 2n - 1 , etc. ) .
These plants are called aneuploids .
Aneuploids are inferior to polyploids in every economic respect .
Aneu - ploid Cannabis is characterized by extremely small seeds .
The weight of 1,000 seeds ranges from
7 to 9 grams ( 1/4 to 1/3 ounce ) .
Under natural conditions diploid plants do not have such small seeds
and average 14 - 19 grams ( 1/2- 2/3 ounce ) per 1,000 ( Zhatov 1979 ) .
Once again , little emphasis has
been placed on the relationship between flower or resin production and poly - ploidy .
Further research to
determine the effect of poly - ploidy on these and other economically valuable traits of Cannabis is
needed .
Colchicine is sold by laboratory supply houses , and breeders have used it to induce polyploldy in
Cannabis .
However , colchicine is poisonous , so special care is exer - cised by the breeder in any use of
it .
Many clandestine cultivators have started polyploid strains with colchicine .
Except for changes in leaf
shape and phyllotaxy , no out - standing characteristics have developed in these strains and potency
seems unaffected .
However , none of the strains have been examined to determine if they are actually
poly ploid or if they were merely treated with colchicine to no effect .
Seed treatment is the most effective
and safest way to apply colchicine .
*
In this way , the entire plant growing from a colchicine - treated seed
could be polyploid and if any colchicine exists at the end of the growing season the amount would be
infinitesimal .
Colchicine is nearly always lethal to Cannabis seeds , and in the treatment there is a very
fine line between polyploidy and death .
In other words , if 100 viable seeds are treated with colchicine and
40 of them germinate it is unlikely that the treatment in - duced polyploidy in any of the survivors .
On the
other hand , if 1,000 viable treated seeds give rise to 3 seedlings , the chances are better that they are
polyploid since the treatment killed all of the seeds but those three .
It is still necessary to determine if
the offspring are actually poly - ploid by microscopic examination .
The work of Menzel ( 1964 ) presents
us with a crude map of the chromosomes of Cannabis , Chromosomes 2 - 6 and 9 are distinguished by the
length of each arm .
Chromo - some 1 is distinguished by a large knob on one end and a dark chromomere
1 micron from the knob .
Chromosome 7 is extremely short and dense , and chromosome 8 is assumed to
be the sex chromosome .
In the future , chromosome * The word " safest " is used here as a relative term .
Coichicine has received recent media attention as a dangerous poison and while these accounts are
probably a bit too lurid , the real dangers of expo- iure to coichicine have not been fully researched .
The
possibility of bodily harm exists and this is multiplied when breeders inexperi- enced in handling toxins
use colchicine .
Seed treatment might be safer than spraying a grown plant but the safest method of all is
to not use colchicine .
mapping will enable us to picture the location of the genes influencing the
phenotype of Cannabis .
This will enable geneticists to determine and manipulate the important
characteristics contained in the gene pool .
For each trait the number of genes in control will be known ,
which chromosomes carry them , and where they are located along those chromosomes .

good post , cant remember where i got mine from , i tried it about 10 years ago , its available in a pill
used to treat gout .
thats what i used and i treated over 200 good seed with it .
i got 15 or so to sprout
and was real happy about that .
but as they grew they were horrible looking mutants .
one had leaves
growing almost sideways and most were twisting and contorting .
i think i wound up with 3 that didnt
die .
after 3 months of growing them i got rid of them , i didnt have any that had the favorable
characteristics i had read about , and since its so poisonous i was a little worried about an adverse
reaction in some way ... im sure if i had continued i would have came up with some with super growth
and yield .
the possibilites exist to mutate the common dipliod cannabis and develop a super
strain .
that might grow very fast produce more branchs , and much higher yeilds and the plant might
be indistinguishable from the normal looking cannabis .
thanks and keep up the good work ... ike

About 25 years ago , when " head shops " were the rage , a bud and I bought a book about growing .
We
set up a couple of shop floros in a closet over 3 gallon buckets of SuperSoil as suggested in the
book .
Lights were left on 24/7 and we smoked the leaves .
The book never even explained how to
flower .
The first batch was like hay .
The book also talked about soaking seeds in Colchicine derived
from the Autumn Crocus .
It 's readily available at nurseries in the month of September .
We bought a
bulb , squeezed it in a garlic press , added a little water and soaked the seeds .
The result was the
best smoke that he and I ever remember .
And it was just leaves !
Cloned a closet full of the best plant for
each of us and kept the plants going for at least a year .
We are convinced that the difference was the
Colchicine but it could have just been an excellent seed to start with .
Wish I knew then what I know
now so I could report on the flowers but I can't .

hi guys , i was once 13 and first trying my hand at growing , but that was more than 25 years ago .
and i
must add im slightly burnt but still smokin , ha ha . you guys just hang in there were your at and youll do
fine .
dont take any b.s. about being to young to do what your doing , age is a frame of mind .
i for one am
glad to see some young dudes in here .
and the comment about the older angry guys gave me a
pretty good chuckle .
you young dudes seem to have hit the nail right on the head ( mine included ) .
in the
days when i started , my first grow manual was a hand me down from one of my brothers , it was
basically in cartoon form and was one that dealt with colchicine and grafting MJ onto hops , things
have come a long way , and i believe with young and old blood mixing here things will go a lot farther than
i could have ever imagined .
i guess they already have .
well this ramble was caused by the good
feeling i got when i read you young dudes post .
if i can ever help just let me know .
thanks for the
memories .

Description :
never needed em but , you can make your own colchicine .
like this , colchicine is derived from
bulbs of the winter or autum crocus [ colchicum ] .
mash the bulbs and add an equal part of water .
strain through coffee filters or paper towels .
soak seeds in the solution and plant when they start to
germinate.cultivate as usual .
only some of the seeds will become polyploid .
polyploids generally have

Cochesene toxicality
Posted by ChronX on December 19 , 1998 at 16:39:05 :
i have heard that the use of the chemical " colchesene " in the forks betwen leaves and soaking seeds in it gives the
plant a poly - ploid structure instead of bi-ploid .
the catch is that the 1st generation is toxic .
i think that the 2nd is
too but i cant remember .
anybody know ?

Colchicine itself is extremely toxic , but it does not make the plant treated toxic .
There is no literature available that
I am aware of that describes work done with this chemical on cannabis .
Colchicine is used to create polyploidy in
many other plants and the result is often bigger yield , and bigger fruit and flowers .

The substance I believe you are reffering to is an alkaloid called colchicine .
Colchicine is extracted from the autumn crocus and is approximately 5 times as toxic as potassium cyanide .
One of the more interesting sidelines of this substance is that it serves as a mutagen when applied to cannabis seeds .
The mutation usually attributed to colchicine treatment is a marked increase in potency .
Whether this is true or not is yet to be conclusivley proven .
The story goes , the U.S govt .
was experimenting with improving known hemp strains when they noticed THC .
present in plants treated with colchicine !
This might just be folk lore but this is what I 've read .
What I do Know is that colchicine is EXTEMELY toxic and not worth screwing with unless you really know what you are doing .
There are already a ton of good kickass strains available do n't fix 'em if they ain't broke .

Polyploidy in marijauna plants is not stable .
Polyploidy is when the cells contain extra chromosomes .
Diploid is
the normal state that occurs in marijuana plants ( one set of chromosomes from the male pollen and one set from the
female pistil ) .
Colchicine is poisonous and should be handled carefully .
It will cost $ 35 / gram .
If you treat 1000
seeds with colchicine and 10 germinate , they will probably be polyploid .
In other words , this substance is more
likely to kill your seeds than to make them any better .
Polyploid plants may or may not pass on this trait .
I have
read many sources that say seeds from these plants will be normal , but many say they will be like the mother
plant .
These plants will often have extremely abnormal leaf formation and will have thicker stems .
As to making
the plant more potent ... who knows .
Look on the net .
Search " Colchicine " and " Marijuana " - you can view the
OPINIONS of other people .
Also , colchicine is a treatment of gout ( in small amounts ) .
In concentration it would be a good idea to wear latex
gloves to prevent absorption through the skin .
Do I have to say birth defects ?

Is it worth poisoning my first generation with colcichine ( to

uncle Joe :
Colchicine is a chenmical that inhibits cell division , but allows chromososmes to
multipily .
Orchid growers in the past , when I grew , used it to play with genetics , it is
like throwing the dice , one never knows what will result .
Years ago I had heard that some growers were painting colchicine in matu5e
flowering plants , and then not using that plant , but letting it go to seed and planting the
seeds .
I knew no one with real botanical knowledge , purchased some colchicine under
disguise as orchid grower , and tried the ( if memory serves me right ) the 25 mg in 100
cc of water for about 6 hours , diring which cell devision is haulted , but chromosomes
will divide .
The produce was killer , had about half dozen plants , and it was one hit la la land .
I
just for friends , lived in Kona , non commercial .
I moved and have not been able to
grow for many years , am now interested in using , I am in need of medical use , so am
joining revolution .
I would guess colchocine is a controlled substance , but available
through chemical wearhouse and school labs .
Cost in 70's was abut $ 40 a gram .
Research in any university libraty will yiels all necessary information , I wlll search on
net and get back , no library here .

From Occam's Razor
In 1993 Colchicine was available for $ 6.80/100 mg .
at my favourite
micropropagation supply house , however access was limited to professionals , and
occasionally students and others who had legitimate uses for it .
You can make your own colchicine by crushing the bulbs of Colchicum
autumnale , ( the plant that the chemical is obtained from ) commonly known as the
autumn crocus or meadow saffron , in a garlic press and collecting the juice .
The % of
colchicine will vary with the time of year , plant genetics , and environmental factors ,
but diluting one part bulb juice to three parts distilled water should get a solution
strength of ~.05 % , about ideal for use as a mutating agent .
Colchicine is VERY toxic , wisdom should govern it 's use , WEAR RUBBER
GLOVES WHEN HANDLING !

Does anybody know anything about KOLCHICIN , it is a poison .
But applyed on seeds in some ratio in water
for few hours makes them to mutate .
The result is a very potent plant , more likely the first generation is used as a seed producer , the second
generation is prodicing smokeable budz , though the first generation is SAFE to smoke ....
Another sign of mutated seeds many bladed leafs , up to 17 blades !!!

Easiest way is to plant some fall purple crocus bulbs .
Then squash the bulbs and soak your seeds in the
juice .
All natuaral colchicine !!
Or you can pretend you have gout and get a prescription from the doc .
But only do this with seeds you do n't need , to be effective , the cochicine is reported to need to be strong
enough to kill most of the seeds .
Something like 1 in a 100 or 1000 will survive .
Of the survivers , it 's a crap
shoot whether or not the mutation was a good one .
If you want more , check out the weedbase search that is featured here .
Try various spelling for cochicine
though , we all seem to spell it differently cholchicine , colchicine , cholcine , kolchicine , etc , haha

he goes right into this treatment method .
he explains three different
methods to treat marijuana with colchicine .
in seed and as seedlings and clones .
just so you know ...... the colchicine extract is derived from the bulb of meadow saffron which is a member
of the crocus family .
the botanical name of meadow saffron is colchicum autumnale .
this is not a popular

I was just repeating what I was told , hehe .
You
were closer to the truth , but also with a small mistake
By coincidence today , I picked up the September
issue of a local magazine called The Coastal Grower .
In it , there is an article on Colchicum , or the meadow
saffron as it's also called , and it 's use in gardening .
This is the plant who 's bulb contains colchicine .
" Botanically colchicums reside in the lily family ( Liliaceae ) like tulips and lilies , not the iris family
( Iridaceae ) as do crocuses . "

The colchicine
( EXTREMELY poisonous stuff ) was more likely the
cause of the fish deaths than increased levels of
THC ; which is n't very toxic even in very high
concentrations .
My take on polyploidy is that it's
best left to research projects .
I think the
uncertainty of positive results and possibilty of
poisoning oneself with colchicine make it a
dangerous waste of time for most growers .
The art
of breeding cannabis is sufficiently complex without
the added complications of polyploidy .

I've
never messed wih colchicine , but apparently even if
you overcome the difficulty of creating a tetraploid
plant in the first place , it 's very difficult to keep it
that way .
It 's supposed to be a very difficult thing
to pass on to the next generation , and polyploid
plants even revert back to a diploid state all on their
own , so it would be difficult to propagate even with
cloning .
My catalog from nirvana claims their master
kush is tetraploid , but it does n't seem very likely to
me .
Everything I 've heard about polys sound like
they 're unpredictable , plagued by abnormal growth ,
slow to flower etc .

Colchicine is a powerful chemical that can actually

Seeds soaked in a DILUTE
solution of colchicine will MOSTLY die from it , but
the few survivors will have a conditon known as
" Polyploidy " , which means that instead of the normal
TWO sets of 10 chromosomes , the plants could have
3 , 4 , or another number .
The chromosomal
re -arrangement often causes strange traits like
gigantic plants , oddly coloured plants or highly
potent ones as well as usually causing such plants
to be sterile .
The germination rate of reated seeds is
EXTREMELY low ( ~5 % survivors ) .
Not too many
people see a future in using colchicine in MJ
breeding .
Experiments already done by Warmke , et
al. were inconclusive .
There are many POTENT
strains available already and colchicine is VERY
DANGEROUS to humans ... the risks outweigh any
slight possibility of creating a special plant are not
worth it .
This substance should be left to the

Induction and Recognition of Polyploidy
An excerpt from :
Wright JW. 1976 .
Introduction to Forest Genetics .
Academic Press , New York .
pages 415-417
Induction by Colchicine and Podophyllin
These chemicals are the most common means of inducing polyploidy .
They do not affect chromosome division as much as they inhibit the
spindle fiber mechanism by which divided chromosomes are drawn to
the poles .
Thus the chromosomes divide but do not pass poleward and
a 2n cell becomes 4n .
Of the two chemicals , colchicine is used most commonly .
It is usually
applied as a weak ( 0.1 to 0.5 % ) aqueous solution for a period of several
hours or several days .
It is effective on any actively growing tissue ,
such as a root tip or germinating pollen grain .
However , the goal is
a tree or branch capable of producing 4n flowers .
To achieve that goal
it must be applied to an actively growing apical meristem , such as in
a germinating seed or an actively growing bud .
Germinating seeds can
be soaked in a colchicine solution .
Growing buds can be surrounded
by colchicine - soaked cotton .
Einspahr ( 1965 ) obtained 50 4n aspen seed -
lings by soaking entire female catkins in a 0.3 % solution for 1 day at
a time when the fertilized embryos consisted of a few cells .
At the
Hessian Forest Research Institute , good results have been obtained by
treating young seedlings having only one leaf with a 0.3 to 0.4 % colchicine
solution for 72 hr ( Anonymous , 1975 ) .
- The third year after treatment
approximately 40 % of the seedlings were polyploid or mixoploid .
An actively growing apical meristem in a germinating seed or bud
consists of two self - perpetuating tissues , the outer tunica and the inner
corpus .
These in turn differentiate into other meristems , such as leaf
primordia , flower primordia , and cambium .
The exact meristems derived
from the tunica and corpus , respectively , vary among groups of trees .
Both the tunica and the corpus consist of several dividing cells .
It is relatively easy to find a concentration of colchicine which can
cause chromosome doubling in a few cells of the tunica , but it is difficult
to obtain a concentration that will cause simultaneous chromosome dou -
bling in all cells of both layers .
Trial and error is the best method .
The best concentrations and times are those which result in some mor -
tality and in a high percentage of seedlings or shoots with gross abnor -
malities .
The best results have been obtained with small - seeded species ,
such as the poplars , willows , ehns , birches , and alders .
In these species
it has been easiest to obtain good penetration into both tunica and
corpus .
Recognition and Treatment of Polyploids after Colchicine Treatment
The poisonous effects of colchicine seem to last for several cell
generations , and newly induced 4n tissue seems to grow more slowly
than surrounding 2n tissue .
As colchicine rarely acts on all cells in a
growing point , artificial induction usually results in mixtures ( called
mixoploids or chimeras ) of 2n and 4n tissue .
These mixtures may be of
various types , i.e. , one branch 4n and another branch 2n , top of leaf 2 n
and bottom of leaf 4n .
If part of the top of a leaf is 4n and the bottom
is faster growing 2n , the leaf curls upward ; if the reverse is true the leaf
curls downward .
Thus , misshapen leaves , crooked branches , and general
growth abnormalities are the first indications of successful colchicine
treatment .
The abnormalities gradually lessen and totally disappear as a
branch or tree becomes wholly 4n or 2n .
After the disappearance of such abnormalities , 4n cells usually have
twice the volume and 20 to 25 % greater length or width than 2n cells .
Such increases in cell size are detected most easily in stomatal guard
cells , which can be measured at magnffications of about 100 X with
a light - reflecting microscope .
Stomatal measurement is a quick way to
determine whether all or most of the leaves on a branch are polyploid .
Leaf size is also a convenient way to determine approximate chromo -
some number .'ln conifers generally , polyploidy is usually accompanied
by a decrease in rate of cell division so that leaves are apt to be
small in spite of the increase in cell size .
In many hardwoods there
is no change in rate of cell division so that leaves and other organs
are apt to be larger than normal .
However , since the tunica and corpus give rise to different organs ,
the presence of 4n leaves on a branch is no guarantee that the branch
will produce 4n flowers .
Thus final proof must come at time of flowering .
This can be done by examination of pollen grains ( 4n grains are usually
larger than 2n grains ) , by actual chromosome counts in dividing gameto -
phytic cells , or by actual chromosome counts of seedlings produced
by the branch .
As already noted , there is a tendency for newly produced 4n tissue
to grow more slowly than surrounding 2n tissue .
Therefore complete
reversion to the 2n condition is common .
To overcome this tendency
it is advisable to observe treated seedlings at frequent intervals , identify
2n and 4n sectors quickly , and remove 2n buds or branches .

The Induction of Polyploids
An excerpt from :
Watts , Leslie . 1980 .
Flower & Vegetable Plant Breeding Grower Books , London
The artificial induction of polypioids as recommended under ( f ) above can be
practised in a number of ways , using colchicine at a concentration of 0.5 to 1.0
per cent .
At these concentrations , the length and method of exposure to
colchicine are critical and can only be satisfactorily decided by experimentation .
Since actively growing plant tissue must be treated , the most common methods
of using colchicine are ;
( a ) by applying it to seed which has already imbibed enough water for
germination - by transferring seed from a water - soaked to a colchicine - soaked
filter paper for approximately 24 hours .
( b ) by applying droplets of solution to the growing points of seedlings .
( c ) by applying colchicine in lanolin paste to growing points of seedlings .
( d ) by applying droplets as in ( b ) or ( c ) to active buds on mature plants - but
removing all untreated bud growth .
Mixed tissues ( diploid as well as polypioid ) may arise after treatment and for
successful results it is important to remove all shoots of the original non -
polypioid , more vigorous type .
