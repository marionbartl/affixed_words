“ In many ways , ” Mr. Hernandez said of Mr. Bush , “ I feel like I have grown up with him . ”
He is not the only one .
Six years into Mr. Bush ’s presidency , the corps of loyal Texans who accompanied him to Washington from Austin remains a powerful force inside the administration , a steady source of comfort for an increasingly isolated president .
No matter how grim the polls or dire the news in Iraq , they have stood by Mr. Bush — and been rewarded with plum jobs — as their lives have grown increasingly intertwined with one another ’s and with his .
“ We ’ve gotten married , gotten remarried , had babies , ” said Margaret Spellings , who was a single mother with two children when she followed Mr. Bush to Washington and has since been promoted from a domestic policy adviser to secretary of education .
“ I remember the Bush twins when they were just little squirts . ”
To hear these people talk about the president is to meet a man many Americans have either forgotten or no longer recognize .
Their George W. Bush is the compassionate conservative who helped soften the harsh image of the Republican Party , a man who chokes up at going - away parties , as he did last year for Andrew H. Card Jr. , his departing chief of staff ; a man unafraid of giving promotions to openly gay people , as he did with Mr. Hernandez , and who always remembers to ask how the family is .
“ There ’s a lot of devotion to George Bush the person , ” said Clay Johnson , a prep school buddy of Mr. Bush who is now a deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget .

Like another Bush devotee , the first President Bush , these Texans are increasingly angry at criticism leveled at him .
Karen Hughes , the communications adviser who famously went back to Texas when her teenage son grew homesick but has since returned as an under secretary of state , says she is tired of seeing Mr. Bush treated as a “ caricature . ”
Serge Régnier ( as some readers may remember ) is a 47 - year old Belgian with three wives and thirty children .
In 1986 Régnier married Christine Wuest ( who is now 38 ) .
They have fifteen children , between 19 years and 11 months old .
A couple of years later , Christine ’s homeless sister Karine Wuest ( now 35 years old ) came to live with the couple .
Soon she fell in love with Serge .
Christine consented in her husband taking her sister as a second wife .
Serge and Karine have six children , between 10 years and 10 months old .
All that time , Serge had been meeting his former girlfriend Judith De Leenheer ( now 38 years old ) .
When Judith ’s marriage broke up – which was not altogether surprising since all her children were Serge ’s rather than her husband ’s – Serge asked his two wives whether they would mind taking her in .
They did not mind .
Serge and Judith have nine children , between 18 years and 10 months old .
They all live together in Serge ’s house in Marcinelle , a town in Wallonia , the French - speaking South of Belgium .
The Belgians call Régnier , a stocky , balding man with a fringe of beard , the “ Marcinelle bull . ”
Non-Belgians wonder perhaps how he provides for his large family .
Here is the answer .
Régnier applied for and received the status of an invalid from Wallonia 's generous welfare authorities .
He consequently receives a welfare check of over € 1,000 a month .
His three wives are all unemployed .
Hence , they each get €800 in unemployment benefits .
On top of this the family receives € 4,000 in child allowances .
This makes a grand total of more than € 7,400 a month ( $ 9,700 or £ 4,960 ) – all of it provided by Belgium ’s taxpayers .
All the money matters in the household are taken care of by Serge .
His wives are only interested in children .
They have told the press that they each hope to have another baby in 2007 .
Ten years ago Belgium was shocked by the paedophile murders of Marc Dutroux , another Walloon .
Dutroux also lived in Marcinelle .
He had installed dungeons in his cellar , where for many months he imprisoned little girls whom he had abducted , and kept them as his sex slaves .
Dutroux raped and finally murdered them .
He , too , had been recognized as an invalid .
The welfare officers granted him , and his wife and accomplice Michelle Martin , to cash a monthly check of € 2,000 in welfare benefits .
The reason why Dutroux was granted invalid status was because he was said to have suffered psychological damage during a previous spell in prison ( for raping underage girls and boys and torturing an elderly lady ) , which made it impossible for him to work for a living .
I do not know why Serge Régnier is unable to work for a living , but it certainly is not a lack of virility .
Indeed , last Tuesday the Belgian paper Gazet van Antwerpen wrote that there are marital problems in the Régnier household .
His three wives complain that their husband is often away from home , while they do not know where he is .
They suspect there is a fourth woman .
“ We are partners , friends .
There is no jealousy here , at least not between us three , ” they told the paper .
But while four is a marriage , five is a crowd .
The wives are also increasingly frustrated because Serge does not seem prepared to give them another baby yet .
“ Judith , Karine and I each want three more children , ” says Christine .
“ So did Serge a few months ago , but suddenly no more .
What must we make of that ? ” she asks .
Régnier , however , denies he is cheating on his wives .
“ They will get their children , but not for the moment , ” he says .
The wives are also cross because Régnier often withdraws into his room , locking the door .
He is the only one to have a room of his own in the house .
There he has a television set and a small fridge .
The women complain he sits there watching football and drinking beer , while they cook , wash and iron and take care of the children .
Régnier ignores their complaints , and tells the journalist : “ I do not know whether you are married but if you have one wife you can imagine what it is like to have three . ”
A story like Régnier ’s is probably only possible in the south of Belgium , where a man can spend his life in idleness while the taxpayers provide him with enough income to sustain three women and thirty children .
Wallonia is a Socialist stronghold which is subsidized by Flanders , the Dutch - speaking northern half of the country .
Belgium is a country in which any major government decision requires approval in both Flanders and Wallonia .
The Constitution stipulates that every major change requires a majority in both parts of the country .
This has doomed the country to inertia and it has inevitably led to the corruption of Wallonia .
The utterly corrupt Parti Socialiste , although only of no importance in Flanders , has become the most influential party in Belgian politics ; as the largest party in Wallonia , it can obstruct any policy it objects to .
Since no government in Belgium is formed without the approval of a majority in both Flanders and Wallonia , the Francophone Socialists have ensured themselves of an almost permanent reign .
They proceed to buy voters by promising them a permanent flow of Flemish taxpayers ' money to Wallonia .
In Flanders , which has a strong freemarket culture , there is a large political majority to change the present welfare system .
The Flemish want to lower taxes and to reform social security to reduce abuse .
But Wallonia blocks all reforms and the Walloon Socialist party guarantees voters that , as long as they support the Socialists , money from Flemish taxpayers will keep flowing to the nearly 50 % of the Walloons who are employed or subsidized by the government , including “ invalids ” like Serge Régnier .
In 2006 the 6 million Flemings subsidized the 4 million Walloons at a rate of € 11.5 billion ( an enormous amount of money compared to the € 14 billion which is the U.S. ’s annual spending on foreign aid ) .
Among the frustrated Flemings there is a growing call for secession from Belgium .
This has begun to worry the Belgian establishment .
This became particularly apparent after a hoax television news item last week in which the end of Belgium was announced .
When Caroline De Gruyter , a journalist from the Netherlands , visited Wallonia five years ago she was amazed to meet several families that had been on the dole for three generations and did not have a single relative who was officially employed .
The families liked it that way .
They all voted for the Socialist Party , because it guaranteed that Flemish money would keep flowing to Wallonia .
They described the attitude of Flemish nationalists “ who do not want to pay taxes to support the Walloon jobless ” as “ unsocial behaviour ! ”
One of the things that struck De Gruyter was that they admitted to having no shame .
It prompted her to call them “ a Community beyond Shame . ”

Yet another weird SF fan points out this example of dueling Luddites .
Here is a particularly nice example :
My favorite definition of local comes from Columbia 's Gussow , a
reporter for Time in the 1950s who went on to become a local - eating
pioneer .
For 25 years , Gussow has lectured on the environmental ( and
culinary ) disadvantages of relying on a global food supply .
Her most
oft - quoted statistic is that shipping a strawberry from California to
New York requires 435 calories of fossil fuel but provides the eater
with only 5 calories of nutrition .
In her memoir , Gussow offers this
rather poetic meaning of local : " Within a day 's leisurely drive of our
homes .
[ This ] distance is entirely arbitrary .
But then , so was the
decision made by others long ago that we ought to have produce from all
around the world . "
It is hard to even begin with statement .
First , I am not sure anyone since Ghandi has really challenged the notion of division of labor , which in fact is what Gussow is lamenting .
Second , it would be interesting to ask Gussow what residents of Chad should do for locally - grown food .
Third , the last sentence is great , in that it works from the Dr. Evil Cabal theory of capitalism , positing that current trade patterns are based on " decisions made by others long ago . "
And all these complaints do n't even tought the silliness of somehow comparing food calories with calories of work from fossil fuels ( unless Gussow is drinking Sterno at night , which might explain a lot ) .
With the rapid growth of siRNA techniques in so many experimental systems , it ’s important to know your options for getting those RNAs into your cells or organism of choice .
This month CSH Protocols presents four different methods for delivering siRNAs and shRNAs into various organisms .
Sometimes the simplest methods are the best –David Rose of UCSD provides a method for microinjection of siRNA into cells .
John Rossi and Ming Jie Li from City of Hope have written up methods that take advantage of the properties of Lentiviral vectors , which are capable of transducing non-dividing cells and maintaining long term expression of transgenes .
Making knockdown transgenic mice with silencing lentiviral vectors is the subject of a protocol by Inder Verma , Gustavo Tiscornia and Oded Singer from the Salk Institute .

Trackbacks California Universities " Fill[ing ] Their Entire Freshman Classes With Nothing But Asian Americans " :
Which political leader expressed concern about this , and suggested that abolishing race - based admissions could lead to this ( in his view unfortunate ) result ?
( Show the answer . )
President Clinton , in 1995 , when Prop. 209 was being discussed in California .
Prop. 209 , which was enacted the following year , banned race and sex preferences in public education , employment , and contracting .
From Leon Rennert [ Bee Washington Bureau Chief ] , Sacramento Bee , Apr. 7 , 1995 , at A1 ( quoting an exclusive interview with The Bee ) : " Our diversity is our great strength , " [ President Clinton ] declared .
" If a university says , ' Look , we 're only going to let in qualified people , but we think that the life of the university will be strengthened if we had different kinds of people , ' then I think that 's a legitimate thing . "
Otherwise , he added , " there are universities in California that could fill their entire freshman classes with nothing but Asian Americans . "
( Hide the answer . )
I should note that while the concern was hyperbole -- though universities of course could fill their freshman classes with Asian - Americans , race - blind admissions would not lead to such an outcome -- this year for the first time Asians outnumbered any other racial group , including whites , among students admitted to all University of California schools .
( This had already been the case as to some schools . )
My reactions : ( 1 ) UC does n't " look like California . "
In fact , as simple arithmetic will tell us , when Asians are " overrepresented " this way compared to their fraction of the California college - age population , whites and other racial groups are substantially " underrepresented . "
Yet that 's surely no reason to institute race preferences ; ( 2 ) Asian - American culture is obviously doing something right .
Others , including whites like me , should do what they can to copy those aspects of Asian - American culture that promote this .

Take Control : How to Negotiate Your Salary Men are more than four times more likely to haggle over pay .
April 24 , 2007  --
New research released this week by the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation found that just one year out of college , women working full time already earned less than their male colleagues , even when they worked in the same field .
And the pay gap widens 10 years after graduation , according to the findings .
Even after controlling for hours , occupation , parenthood and other factors known to affect earnings , the report , titled " Behind the Pay Gap , " indicates that one - quarter of the pay gap remains unexplained and is likely due to sex discrimination .
To read the full report , visit the American Association of University Women online .
We know that a wage gap may be traced in part to the negotiation process , which is something that each of us has the ability to control .
Men are more than four times more likely than women to negotiate a salary , which typically translates to more money in their pockets .
An employer may offer the same starting salary to both a man and a woman for the same position , but more times than not , the man will negotiate and the woman wo n't .
No employer has an obligation to whisper in the woman 's ear , " Hey , you know , you just lost out on more money because you did n't speak up . "
If she accepts the salary offered , so be it .
But the consequences of failing to negotiate a first salary can lead women to lose more than $ 500,000 by age 60 .
It 's up to each woman -- no matter what her career stage , industry or position -- to speak up and negotiate for herself .
Here are some tips on how to make sure you 're making the most of the negotiation process :
Commit to negotiating .
Whether by nature or nurture , we 're somehow conditioned to believe that nice girls do n't talk about money .
The reality is that smart girls do .
So the first step is saying to yourself , " I will have a voice in the process .
I will not be silent with regard to my compensation . "
Beyond that , tell yourself that you 'll do all the homework necessary to get comfortable with negotiating .
However , recognize that some people will never be completely comfortable with this topic .
So even in the absence of total comfort , commit to speaking up even if you 're shy because frankly you work too hard not to speak up .
Research salary data .
Use online tools ( salary.com and payscale.com are two resources ) , as well as salary data compiled by industry - specific associations , career services and alumni relations , to get a sense of what a position should pay based on industry , geography , size of company , level of experience and education .
You can also ask the hiring manager where the offer you receive falls in relation to the pay range for the same or similar positions within the company .
Sometimes this information wo n't be provided .
Avoid getting defensive if they say it 's confidential .
Talk to peers in the same industry to find out what they say is the going rate , but do so with a grain of salt .
Sometimes even our pals overstate what they earn , so use that information sparingly .
All of this salary information arms you with the knowledge you need to have an intelligent conversation .
You can't ask for more money if you do n't even know what the position should pay relative to your experience .
Remove the emotion .
Women often shy away from negotiating because we do n't want someone to dislike us .
We worry that our future employer will think , " Oh , she has n't even started yet , and she 's already demanding things . "
Negotiating salary is n't about being well - liked or disliked .
It 's about speaking up to receive fair compensation based on the position you 're being asked to perform .
It 's not about popularity , it 's about performance .
Focus on the professional , not the personal .
Similarly , women will often tell me -- or they 'll say that that their friends or family tell them -- " Just be thankful for the salary .
Do n't rock the boat . "
They 're gun shy because they want the job so badly .
You wo n't lose a job offer because you negotiate fairly .
( Clearly , if you make outrageous demands that are unrealistic based on what you bring to the position , you may risk losing it .
This is where research is invaluable . )
In fact , the majority of employers expect you to speak up .
So instead of listening only to the naysayers who hold you back -- or the voice of doubt in your head -- surround yourself with a cheerleader too .
Anticipate the opposition .
Figure out all of the reasons why the decision maker might say no and prepare your responses .
This helps avoid looking like a deer in the headlights .
A common objection : " This is all we budgeted for . "
To that you might ask for a signing bonus or guaranteed salary review or year - end bonus at a specific time .
Another no : " Your salary history does n't dictate a higher starting salary here . "
Your possible response : " The demands of this new role and the challenges and goals I will be expected to meet do warrant a higher base , especially with the skills and experience I bring to the position . "
This is also the time to address any differences in company size , location or industry that could impact your case for a higher starting salary .
Negotiate as if it 's for someone else .
Women are awesome when it comes to asking people to make donations to charity .
Women have no trouble haggling at a flea market -- especially when a friend wants a good buy on something .
But when it comes to speaking up for yourselves -- specially asking for money and benefits for us -- women tend to shy away .
We do n't want to come across as conceited , demanding or difficult .
So we simply accept what 's offered .
If that 's you , then pretend you 're speaking up for your best friend , your daughter or the person you care most about in the world .
You know you 'd want her to get the most , so you 're likely to do a stellar job on her behalf .
One final thought : keep in mind that the company made you an offer , so clearly they want you and they value your skills and experience .
That , too , should boost your confidence going into any negotiation conversation !

ALI SAMSAM BAKHTIARI is a retired " senior energy expert , " formerly employed by the National Iranian Oil Co. ( NIOC ) of Tehran , Iran .
He has held a number of important positions with NIOC since 1971 .
He is currently attached to the director 's office in the Corporate Planning Directorate of NIOC , and specializes in questions related to the global oil , gas and petrochemical industries .
This alone ought to pique your interest because Bakhtiari has the ear of the most important decision - makers in Iran .
What is he telling them ?
Fortunately for us in the West , Bakhtiari is also an independent consultant who writes and speaks to a worldwide audience on the subject of oil depletion in general , and Peak Oil in particular .
His tribal name , Bakhtiari , means " companions of good fortune , " and the story of his life is somewhat emblematic of that meaning .
Based on what I have seen , Bakhtiari has a gift for understanding , and a unique ability to share this gift with others .
There are few more qualified people in the world who can discuss Peak Oil .
So when Bakhtiari talks , people ought to listen .
And as an aside , anyone within the Western diplomatic or military community who deals with Iranian issues at almost any level needs to understand what Bakhtiari has been telling the leadership of Iran .
What do the mullahs know about oil that you may not know ?
It might just explain a few things about Iranian behavior .
Peak Oil : price will hit $ 100
In a recent public address to the Senate of Australia , Bakhtiari stated that " I can see a range of $ 100 - 150 [ per barrel of oil ] not very far into the future . "
He amplified this statement as follows : " We are entering an era in which we know nothing much , where we have a brand - new set of rulesOne of these new rules , in my opinion , is that there will be in the very near future nothing like business as usual .
In my opinion , nothing is usual from now on for any of the countries involved .
And the lower you are in the pile , the worse it is going to get . "
Bakhtiari believes that the world is at Peak Oil , producing about as much conventional oil on a daily basis as will ever be produced , now about 84 million barrels per day .
From here on , the oil markets of the world will be dealing with the ongoing effects of oil field depletion and irreversible production decline .
By 2025 , Bakhtiari expects that the world 's daily production of conventional oil will fall to a level between 50 - 55 million barrels of oil per day .
Bakhtiari counsels that the world 's governments , industries , and people accept the fact and begin to prepare .
There is no time to lose .
Bakhtiari is pessimistic about the prospects for large - scale energy projects based on manufactured fuels , such as coal - to - oil and gas - to - oil projects .
His reasons are many , ranging from the scale and cost of such projects to the raw environmental degradation they cause .
In addition , much of the feedstock for these projects , for raw material and / or process heat , is supposed to come from natural gas .
But natural gas supplies are about to " peak " worldwide and commence their own irreversible curve of decline , so this is not a long - term solution .
Of the 30 - million - barrel - per - day decline in conventional oil production that Bakhtiari envisions over the next 20 years , he anticipates that manufactured fuels will substitute for only about 5 million barrels per day .
" This is a drop of water in the ocean , " says Bakhtiari .
In addition , Bakhtiari is pessimistic on the future of ethanol as an oil substitute , because it will pit the world 's food supply against the needs of the world 's built - up transportation system for liquid fuels .
" People have to eat , " says Bakhtiari .
Peak Oil : four phases of decline Bakhtiari views the future in terms of four phases of transition , or , as he puts it , T1 , T2 , T3 , and T4 .
Fortunately for the world 's users of petroleum , the " hidden advantage " of Bakhtiari's T1 is that worldwide oil supplies will remain almost constant during this initial phase .
That is , new discoveries and production that is now coming on line will compensate for the production that is lost due to depletion .
T2 , T3 , and T4 will be , as Bakhtiari puts it , " more turbulent phases . "
At the end of T1 , Bakhtiari envisions " two major scales tilting . "
There will be a supply of conventional oil , all of which will be subject to world demand .
That is , there is not now , and will not be at the end of T1 , any " swing " production , such as the cushion that Saudi Arabia provided during the past 40 years or so .
Supply will dictate demand , and when the supply is gone , the demand will go unsatisfied .
" In the end , it will be the total shift " to oil supply dictating demand .
Rising prices will clear the market , and the prices will rise precipitously .
According to Bakhtiari , one of the key problems for the world in facing this ongoing T1 phase is that so - called " mega projects " for high - cost oil and other alternative fuels take 10 - 20 years to construct and come online .
These mega projects include such things as large offshore oil developments in deep water , substitute oil industries that manufacture oil from natural gas or coal , or refineries capable of handling heavy oils or tar from tar sands .
The problem is that rising oil prices , and spot shortages in the coming years , will trigger increases in prices for other commodities , like cement and steel .
Peak Oil : rising costs and risks for capital projects
One prominent example that illustrates Bakhtiari 's point was just announced by Shell Canada Ltd.
Shell Canada recently announced that an expansion of its Athabasca oil sands project will cost as much as $ 12.8 billion , because relentless cost pressures are swelling its budget .
This is nearly three times the cost per barrel that was originally planned , as recently as 2002 .
According the Shell Canada 's president , the economic environment has changed " quite substantially " in just a few years .
As recently as mid-2005 , Shell Canada estimated that expanding its plant at Athabasca would cost about $ 200 per barrel per day of capital cost .
Now the estimate is that the eventual cost will top $ 300 per barrel per day , and possibly approach $ 350 per barrel per day .
That is , under these cost estimates , a facility capable of producing 10,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent product might cost as much as $ 3.5 billion just to build , let alone the future costs of to operating on an ongoing basis .
And to construct facilities capable of producing 1 million barrels per day of oil equivalent will require a capital investment of about $ 350 billion .
At the same time , major companies that operate in the international environment are seeing their political risks rise along with the capital costs .
Increasing exposure to large projects in problematic countries has taken much of the edge off the previous enthusiasm for expansion in such regions .
For example , in Venezuela , the government of populist leader Hugo Chavez is tightening the terms of operating contracts , and imposing royalty and tax rates that are all but confiscatory .
Venezuela recently announced that it was reforming one of its production contracts with Chevron to create a " joint venture " between Chevron and Venezuela 's state - owned oil company .
The net effect is to remove 90,000 barrels per day of oil production from the control of Chevron and place the oil under the control of the Venezuelan entity .
In order to meet its own requirements for volumes of oil , Chevron will have to find other sources of petroleum .
While Chevron has announced that it plans to remain in Venezuela , some other major Western oil firms are contemplating simply abandoning operations there .
In addition , many major capital projects are subject to damage from natural events , such as last year 's Hurricanes Katrina and Rita .
Chevron , for example , recently announced a $ 300 million charge against earnings for uninsured damage caused last year to its Gulf of Mexico operations during Hurricane Katrina .
Peak oil : how to prepare Bakhtiari has a " to - do list " of what he considers to be the most urgent steps for governments , businesses , and private individuals .
His list is worth highlighting here : ( 1 ) Reprogram the mind .
That is , just throw out any previous business - as - usual thinking and similar rosy scenarios .
Nothing will remain as usual , going forward .
This also means that people should engage in as much lateral thinking as possible .
Do not just come up with Plan B , but come up with Plans C , D , and E as well .
People should challenge themselves , and their associates , not just to expect the unexpected , but to begin thinking the unthinkable .
( 2 ) Reduce oil consumption , mercilessly .
According to Bakhtiari , the normal 30 % of wasted use should be shed offhand .
Governments , businesses , and individuals should also pay down debt levels as swiftly as possible , because the effects of T1 will inevitably bring higher inflation and interest rates .
Minimize travel of all sorts to economize use of oil - derived fuels , because it is going to happen in any case .
Reduce all types of consumption and just plain get leaner and be ready for even bigger cuts .
This is as close to where you live as revising home lighting and heating systems , and also includes reducing the size and number of automobiles as soon as possible .
(3) Reuse as much as possible .
Many things are easily reusable , but it will require a mental focus to accomplish the effort .
Whether it is plastic bags or retreaded tires or outdated appliances , it is important to adopt a new cultural mind - set toward the scarcity of manufactured goods and products .
The most important thing to care for and husband may well be fresh water , which is already in short supply and will almost certainly be a precious commodity in the future .
Bakhtiari even mentions wood as a future critical commodity .
( 4 ) Recycle as much as possible .
Bakhtiari believes that tomorrow 's industrial boom will be in recycling industries on a worldwide scale .
Recycling much of what is now considered garbage should be made mandatory , as in Germany or a handful of U.S. cities , such as Seattle and Pittsburgh .
Industrial production should design " recycling " into products from the time they are on the drawing board , as is now the case in some sectors of the automobile and computer industries , as well as some other business sectors .
( 5 ) Reward people for their efforts .
Bakhtiari urges using market incentives to reward people for reducing , reusing , or recycling .
It is far better to make use of positive subsidies , instead of negative reinforcement .
The implications of Peak Oil are negative enough even without the prospect of negative reinforcement .
Peak Oil : why we can no longer live in denial " Whether we like it or not , " said Bakhtiari in a recent posting , " all developed societies are addicted to crude oil and its myriad derivatives . "
However , he continues , " Many decision - makers are trying to park Peak Oil ' in the farthest corner of their minds ( praying it will go away ) , and remain in denial that there is no replacement for oil . "
Bakhtiari amplified this comment in another discussion :
Some very worrisome news came out of China this Saturday - but it got a little more than a blip in the U.S. press .
At a high - level financial conference this past weekend , China 's Premier Wen Jiabao said , " China would actively explore and expand the channels and methods for using [ its ] foreign exchange reserves . "
Considering that the bulk of China 's reserves are in U.S. dollars , it should send tremors about the future of the greenback .
The dollar has been reeling in recent years .
A shift by China out of dollars - as Wen is hinting - could be catastrophic .
China 's reserves recently surpassed Japan's - now exceeding $ 1 trillion .
Some 70 % of these reserves -­ more than $ 700 million - are in dollars .
Interestingly , The Wall Street Journal carried this critical story on page A7 of Monday 's editions with this pleasant spin headline : " China Shift on Reserves Is n't Likely to Hit Dollar . "
Perhaps I am missing something .
China keeps most of its reserves in dollars - and its leader just announced they plan on diversifying their portfolio .
This means it wo n't affect the dollar ?
It is of note that the Financial Times placed its report on the China development smack in the center of Monday page one .
Why would U.S. media wish to play down such an important item ?
While we believe that in the short - term the dollar may not be hurt - the item should send tremors down the backs of U.S. dollar investors planning to hold the greenback over the long - term .
The Journal reported that Wen 's statement was the " highest - level confirmation yet that China is thinking actively how it can use its reserves , which have increased by more that six times since 2000 and made China one of the worlds largest holders of U.S. Treasury bonds . "
Later the article observed that , " . . . currency traders are hypersensitive to any signs Beijing is losing its appetite for the U.S. currency . "
The FT went on to observe , " This policy switch opens the way for China , which has been largely passive in managing its money to establish an agency akin to Singapore 's government . "
As I wrote in my Financial Intelligence email in December and in our sister publication , Financial Intelligence Report , as the U.S. dollar depreciates , China is actively reviewing its holdings of gold .
When China resumes , or even announces its intention to resume , its purchases of gold , expect the price of gold to respond , as we have constantly warned , possibly in a major manner .
Of course , we believe it is not in China 's short - term interests to disrupt the currency markets or the U.S. dollar , of which it holds some $ 700 billion .
But , in the longer - term , we believe China will use all its strengths , including economic and military to further its path towards super power status .
In this respect , we note last week 's news ( given a low profile in our mainstream media ) that China had shot down one of its own defunct satellites , 500 miles out into space , at the same height as U.S. military satellites .
What sort of message does that send to any observant investor or military strategist throughout the world ?
To us it means that China is already on the march to super power status and is our main challenge , even in times of peace .
We urge our readers and investors to pay great heed to the recent announcements and especially actions of the Chinese , even if buried deeply in our news media .
We believe that China 's actions are set to influence such key items as the U.S. dollar ( and therefore U.S. interest rates ) , world commodity prices , gold , and U.S. defense strategy and spending .

Published : Tuesday October 31 , 2006 Print This Email This Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki is telling his inner circle that the situation in Iraq is " nearly out of control , " according to CBS News intelligence sources .
Pentagon sources tell the network that General Casey will require 100,000 more Iraqi troops than the 325,000 who were to be trained in order to secure the nation .
The security situation , however , has worsened and Iraqi troops have proven to be less effective than their American counterparts .
Additional American troops may be called up to help train the new Iraqi security forces , and the U.S. may also double the number of advisors in each Iraqi unit .
As of Tuesday morning , the Pentagon is reporting 103 US casualties in the month of October .
Prime Minister Maliki has ordered that all checkpoints in Baghdad be lifted .
Lara Logan of CBS
News reports that some American troops expect that violence will now increase and are left questioning why U.S. Commanders would allow checkpoints to be removed now .
The move is widely seen as a victory for Muqtada al - Sadr of Sadr City , who controls one of the largest militias in Iraq .
The Inspector General warns that Iraqis do n't even have the capacity to fund or maintain their army .
The Pentagon is being called upon to provide better weapons and armored vehicles to Iraqi security forces .
The Pentagon 's Inspector General has found that 14,000 small arms provided to the Iraqis are now missing .
The lost weapons were never registered and can not be audited .
What color is a chameleon placed on the mirror ?
Stewart Brand posed that riddle to Gregory Bateson in the early 1970s .
Bateson , together with Norbert Wiener , was a founding father of the modern cybernetic movement .
Bateson had a most orthodox Oxford education and a most unorthodox career .
He filmed Balinese dance in Indonesia ; he studied dolphins ; he developed a useful theory of schizophrenia .
While in his sixties , he taught at the University of California at Santa Barbara , where his eccentric brilliant views on mental health and evolutionary systems caught the attention of holistically minded hippies .
Stewart Brand , a student of Bateson's , was himself a legendary promoter of cybernetic holism .
Brand published his chameleon koan in his Whole Earth Catalog , in 1974 .
Writes Brand of his riddle : " I asked the question of Gregory Bateson at a point in our interview when we were lost in contemplation of the function , if any , of consciousness -- self - consciousness .
Both of us being biologists , we swerved to follow the elusive chameleon .
Gregory asserted that the creature would settle at a middle value in its color range .
I insisted that the poor beast trying to disappear in a universe of itself would endlessly cycle through a number of its disguises . "
The mirror is a clever metaphor for informational circuits .
Two ordinary mirrors facing each other will create a fun-house hall that ricochets an image back and forth until it vanishes into an infinite regress .
Any message loosed between the two opposing mirrors bounces to exhaustion without changing its form .
But what if one side is a responsive mirror , just as the chameleon is , in part reflecting , in part generating ?
The very act of accommodating itself to its own reflection would disturb it anew .
Could it ever settle into a pattern persistent enough to call it something ?
Bateson felt the system -- perhaps like self - consciousness -- would quickly settle out at an equilibrium determined by the pull of the creature 's many extremes in color .
The conflicting colors ( and conflicting viewpoints in a society of mind ) would compromise upon a " middle value , " as if it were a democracy voting .
On the other hand , Brand opined that equilibrium of any sort was next to impossible , and that the adaptive system would oscillate without direction or end .
He imagined the colors fluctuating chaotically in a random , psychedelic paisley .
The chameleon responding to its own shifting image is an apt analog of the human world of fashion .
Taken as a whole , what are fads but the response of a hive mind to its own reflection ?
In a 21st - century society wired into instantaneous networks , marketing is the mirror ; the collective consumer is the chameleon .
What color is the consumer when you put him on the marketplace ?
Does he dip to the state of the lowest common denominator -- a middle average consumer ?
Or does he oscillate in mad swings of forever trying to catch up with his own moving reflection ?
Bateson was tickled by the depth of the chameleon riddle and passed it on to his other students .
One of them , Gerald Hall , proposed a third hypothesis for the final color of the mirror visitor : " The chameleon will stay whatever color he was at the moment he entered the mirror domain . "
This is the most logical answer in my view .
The coupling between mirror and chameleon is probably so tight and immediate that almost no adaptation is possible .
In fact , it may be that once the chameleon bellies up to the mirror , it can't budge from its color unless a change is induced from outside or from an erroneous drift in the chameleon 's coloration process .
Otherwise , the mirror / chameleon system freezes solidly onto whatever initial value it begins with .
For the mirrored world of marketing , this third answer means the consumer freezes .
He either locks onto whatever brand he began with , or he stops purchasing altogether .
There are other possible answers , too .
While conducting interviews for this book , I sometimes posed the chameleon riddle to my interviewees .
The scientists understood it for the archetypal case of adaptive feedback it was .
Their answers ranged over the map .
Some examples : MATHEMATICIAN JOHN HOLLAND :
It goes kaleidoscopic !
There 's a lag time , so it 'll flicker all over the place .
The chameleon wo n't ever be a uniform color .
COMPUTER SCIENTIST MARVIN MINSKY :
It might have a number of eigenvalues or colors , so it will zero in on a number of colors .
If you put it in when it 's green it might stay green , and if it was red it might stay red , but if you put it in when it was brown it might tend to go to green .
NATURALIST PETER WARSHALL : A chameleon changes color out of a fright response so it all depends on its emotional state .
It might be frightened by its image at first , but then later " warm up " to it , and so change colors .
Putting a chameleon on a mirror seemed a simple enough experiment that I thought that even a writer could perform it .
So I did .
I built a small , mirrored box , and I bought a color - changing lizard and placed it inside .
Although Brand 's riddle had been around for 20 years , this was the first time , as far as I know , anyone had actually tried it .
On the mirror the lizard stabilized at one color of green -- the green of young leaves on trees in the spring -- and returned to that one color each time I tried the experiment .
But it would spend periods being brown before returning to green .
Its resting color in the box was not the same dark brown it seemed to like when out of the mirrored box .
Although I performed this experiment , I place very little confidence in my own results for the following important reasons : the lizard I used was not a true chameleon , but an anole , a species with a far more limited range of color adaptation than a true chameleon .
( A true chameleon may cost several hundred dollars and requires a terrarium of a quality I did not want to possess . )
More importantly , according to the little literature I read , anoles change colors for other reasons in addition to trying to match their background .
As Warshall said , they also alter in response to fright .
And frightened it was .
The anole did not want to go into the mirrored box .
The color green it presented in the box is the same color it uses when it is frightened .
It may be that the chameleon in the mirror is merely in a constant state of fright at its own amplified strangeness now filling its universe .
I certainly would go nutty in a mirrored box .
Finally , there is this observer problem : I can only see the lizard when my face is peeking into the mirrored box , an act which inserts a blue eye and red nose into the anole 's universe , a disturbance I could not circumvent .
It may be that an exact answer to the riddle requires future experiments with an authentic chameleon and many more controls than I had .
But I doubt it .
True chameleons are full - bodied animals just as anoles are , with more than one reason for changing colors .
The chameleon on a mirror riddle is best kept in idealized form as a thought experiment .
Even in the abstract , the " real " answer depends on such specific factors as the reaction time of the chameleon 's color cells , their sensitivity to a change in hue , and whether other factors influence the signals -- all the usual critical values in feedback circuits .
If one could alter these functions in a real chameleon , one could then generate each of the chameleon - on - the - mirror scenarios mentioned above .
This , in fact , is what engineers do when they devise electronic control circuits to guide spaceships or steer robot arms .
By tweaking delay times , sensitivity to signals , dampening values , etc. , they can tailor a system to seek either a wide - ranging equilibrium ( say , keeping the temperature between 68 and 70 degrees ) , or constant change , or some homeostatic point in between .
We see this happening in networked markets .
A sweater manufacturer will try to rig a cultural mirror that encourages wild fluctuations in the hopes of selling many styles of sweaters , while a dishwasher manufacture will try to focus the reflections onto the common denominators of only a few dishwasher images , since making varieties of sweaters is much cheaper than making varieties of dishwashers .
The type of market is determined by quantity and speed of feedback signals .
The important point about the chameleon on the mirror riddle is that the lizard and glass become one system .
" Lizardness " and " mirrorness " are encompassed into a larger essence -- a " lizard - glass " -- which acts differently than either a chameleon or a mirror .
Medieval life was remarkably unnarcissistic .
Common folk had only vague notions of their own image in the broad sense .
Their individual and social identities were informed by participating in rituals and traditions rather than by reflection .
On the other hand , the modern world is being paved with mirrors .
We have ubiquitous TV cameras , and ceaseless daily polling ( " 63 Percent of Us Are Divorced " ) to mirror back to us every nuance of our collective action .
A steady paper trail of bills , grades , pay stubs , and catalogs helps us create our individual identity .
Pervasive digitalization of the approaching future promises clearer , faster , and more omnipresent mirrors .
Every consumer becomes both a reflection and reflector , a cause and an effect .
The Greek philosophers were obsessed with the chain of causality , how the cause of an effect should be traced back in a relay of hops until one reached the Prime Cause .
That backward path is the foundation of Western , linear logic .
The lizard - glass demonstrates an entirely different logic -- the circular causality of the Net .
In the realm of recursive reflections , an event is not triggered by a chain of being , but by a field of causes reflecting , bending , mirroring each other in a fun - house nonsense .
Rather than cause and control being dispensed in a straight line from its origin , it spreads horizontally , like creeping tide , influencing in roundabout , diffuse ways .
Small blips can make big splashes , and big blips no splashes .
It is as if the filters of distance and time were subverted by the complex connecting of everything to everything .
Computer scientist Danny Hillis has noted that computation , particularly networked computation , exhibits a nonlinear causality field .
He wrote :
In the physical universe the effect that one event has on another tends to decrease with the distance in time or in space between them .
This allows us to study the motions of the Jovian moons without taking into account the motion of Mercury .
It is fundamental to the twin concepts of object and action .
Locality of action shows itself in the finite speed of light , in the inverse square law of fields , and in macroscopic statistical effects , such as rates of reaction and the speed of sound .
In computation , or at least in our old models of computation , an arbitrarily small event can and often does cause an arbitrarily large effect .
A tiny program can clear all of memory .
A single instruction can stop the machine .
In computation there is no analog of distance .
One memory location is as easily influenced as another .
The lines of control in natural ecologies also dissolve into a causality horizon .
Control is not only distributed in space , but it is also blurred in time as well .
When the chameleon steps onto the mirror , the cause of his color dissolves into a field of effects spinning back on themselves .
The reasons for things do not proceed like an arrow , but rather spread to the side like a wind .

「 Second Lifeの何が面白いか分からない」――こんな声を最近よく聞く。Second Lifeは、昨年から日本でも話題の、米国発のネット上の3D仮想空間だ。ユーザーが自由にオブジェクトを作れたり、通貨を米ドルに換金できたりする点が注目を集め、昨年末ごろから国内の新聞やテレビで取り上げられるようになった。古書店「BOOKOFF」が支店を出したりmixiが採用オフィスを構築するなど、日本企業も続々と参入を始めている。
だが日本人の登録ユーザー数は多く見積もっても10万人以下と見られ、一度登録しても「ソフトの起動ができなかった」「操作が難しすぎる」「何をしていいか分からない」などという理由ですぐにやめてしまうユーザーが多い。盛り上がっているのはメディアと企業とごく一部のユーザーだけで、最近の過熱報道は、“ 空騒ぎ” にも見える。
Second Lifeが 「 すごそうに見える」理由
Second Lifeの日本人街 「 NAGAYA 」
Second Lifeは、 米Linden Labが2003年に正式公開した3D仮想空間だ。自分のアバターを操作して3D空間を探検できる仕組みはMMORPGに似ているが、敵を倒したりミッションをクリアしたりなどといった特定の目的はなく、何をするのもユーザーの自由。アバターデザインから住む場所、乗り物、動作、参加するコミュニティーなどを、自由に選んだり作ったりできる。
専用のクライアントソフトには3Dモデリングツールが組み込まれており、アイテムや洋服、建物、楽器など何でも作ることができる。アバターの動作や乗り物の動きを自由にプログラミングすることも可能だ。
ゲーム内通 貨 「 リンデンドル 」 （L＄）は現金（米ドル）に換金できるため、ゲーム内で商売してお金を稼ぐと、実社会でもお金持ちになれる。自作のアイテムを売ったり、土地を切り売りしたり、サービスを提供して対価を稼いだり――ビジネスの可能性はさまざま。Second Life内の土地売買でリンデンドルを稼ぎ、米ドル換算で100万ドル以上を手に入れたユーザーが出現したことも昨年話題になった。
こうした特徴がリアルビジネスに生かせると踏んだ米国企業は、昨年半ばごろから次々にSecond Lifeに参入し、プロモーションやマーケティング活動を展開してきた。日産自動車、トヨタ自動車、BMWといった自動車メーカー、Reutersなどメディア、Sony BMGなどレコード会社、IBMやSun MicrosystemsといったIT系――参入企業の業種は実にさまざまだ。
米国の有名大学による仮想キャンパスも複数あり、カリフォルニア州立大学やカリフォルニア大学ロサンゼルス校などが実際に授業やセミナーを行っている。
米国でのこうした盛り上がりが米国メディアを通じて国内に伝わり、昨年末ごろから、国内のIT系・経済系メディアでも報道されるようになった。Linden Labが「日本語版を近く公開する」と昨年から言い続けていたこともあり、日本語版への期待も相まって報道が過熱。今年に入って一般紙や雑誌、テレビなどでも「 Web2.0の “ 次” のサービス」などとして紹介されるようになり、国内企業も参入し始めている。
前出のブックオフやミクシィのほか、電通がデジタルハリウッド大学院と研究所を発足させたり、東芝EMIも楽曲プロモーションで利用すると表明するなど、大企業による参入も相次ぐ。
ユーザー数、世界合計でもmixi未満
メディアの報道と企業の参入が先行して盛り上がっているSecond Lifeだが、日本どころか世界でも流行しているとは言い難い。全世界の登録ユーザー数は、3月7日現在で約436万。これは、国内ローカルサービスであるmixiの登録ユーザー数800万（1月28日現在）にも遠く及ばない。
全登録ユーザーのうち、60日以内にログインしたユーザー数は約160万と、36％にとどまる。オンラインのユーザー数は常時2万人弱〜3万人弱程度と、全登録ユーザーの1％未満。「ラグナロクオンライン」のピーク時の最大同時接続数が70万（ボットはともかく）を超えていたことを考えると、世界的に見てもそう大きいサービスとは言えなくなる。
日本人ユーザーに限定すると、さらに寂しい状況だ。Linden Labが2月9日に発表した1月時点でのSecond Lifeの国勢調査によると、全登録ユーザー311万7287のうち、日本人は1.29％・約4万という計算だ。
増加を見積もって現在の日本人ユーザー数を6万と仮定し、アクティブ率を世界全体と同じ36％と仮定すると、日本人アクティブユーザーは2万程度。オンラインのユーザーはワールドワイドより多めに見積もって1％としても、たった600人に過ぎない。
報道の過熱ぶりや大企業による派手な参入による“盛り上がり感”に反して、Second Lifeの日本人ユーザーはかなり少なく、とても流行しているとは言えない。ここまで期待されながら、なぜ盛り上がらないのだろうか。実際にプレイしてみると、その理由が見えてくる。
Second Life 「 不」人気、7つの理由
（1）始めるまでの手続きが面倒
最近のネットサービスはほとんどが、Webブラウザ上で完結するものばかり。専用のクライアントソフトをダウンロードする必要があるSecond Lifeはそれだけで障壁が高い。しかも、ソフトは頻繁にアップデートされるため、そのたびにダウンロードし直さなくてはならなくて面倒だ。
また、アバターデザインがいかにもアメリカ風で、日本人好みではない。アバターがかわいければプレイへの意欲が高まり、少々のハードルも乗り越えようと思えるだろうが、このアバターで日本人を惹きつけるのは難しいだろう。
アバターのラストネームは100以上の選択肢から選ぶのだが、日本人名はごくごく一部。不本意な名前を付けることになると、アバターへの愛情も持ちにくく、プレイへの意欲も減退してしまう（関連記事参照）。
（ 2）要求PCスペックが高い
Second Lifeをストレスなく動かすには、そこそこ高スペックなPCと、光回線レベルのブロードバンド環境が必要になる。対応しているビデオカードも限られており、デフォルトの環境ではソフトのインストールすらできないという声もよく聞く。
記者もビデオカード問題に悩まされた1人。記者が普段仕事で使っている、昨年会社で購入したデスクトップはビデオカードが対応しておらず、別のPCをSecond Life専用機を用意し、改めてインストールし直す羽目になった。
その専用機とは、4年ほど前に購入したデスクトップで、Celeron/1.8GHz、768Mバイトメモリ、ビデオカード内蔵型のDellマシン。さすがにこのスペックだと動きはカクカクするし、頻繁にフリーズするし、描画は極端に遅く、かなりイライラした。
Second Lifeの推奨スペックは、CPU
がPentium 4/1.6GHzかAthlon 2000＋以上、メモリは512Mバイト以上、グラフィックスカードはGeForce FX 5600／6600 以上 かRadeon 9600／X600以上となっている。ストレスなく動かすには、できるだけ高スペックなPC――できればオンラインゲーム推奨レベルの性能を持ったマシンが望ましいだろうが、ノートPC率が高い日本では不利なユーザーも多そうだ。
（ 3）操作が難しすぎ る
（1）（2）のハードルを乗り越えてログインし、晴れて初心者の島「 Orientation Island」にやってきたとしよう。だがここでまた壁にぶつかる。操作方法が難しいのだ。

A dump / restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate data from any previous release .
Observe the following incompatibilities :
Set escape_string_warning to on by default ( Bruce )
This issues a warning if backslash escapes are used in non-escape ( non- E '' ) strings .
Change the row constructor syntax ( ROW ( ... ) ) so that list elements foo . * will be expanded to a list of their member fields , rather than creating a nested row type field as formerly ( Tom ) The new behavior is substantially more useful since it allows , for example , triggers to check for data changes with IF row ( new . *)
IS DISTINCT FROM row ( old . * ) .
The old behavior is still available by omitting .* .
Make row comparisons follow SQL standard semantics and allow them to be used in index scans ( Tom ) Previously , row = and <> comparisons followed the standard but < <= > >= did not .
A row comparison can now be used as an index constraint for a multicolumn index matching the row value .
Make row IS [ NOT ] NULL tests follow SQL standard semantics ( Tom ) The former behavior conformed to the standard for simple cases with IS NULL , but IS NOT NULL would return true if any row field was non-null , whereas the standard says it should return true only when all fields are non-null .
Make SET CONSTRAINT affect only one constraint ( Kris Jurka )
In previous releases , SET CONSTRAINT modified all constraints with a matching name .
In this release , the schema search path is used to modify only the first matching constraint .
A schema specification is also supported .
This more nearly conforms to the SQL standard .
Remove RULE permission for tables , for security reasons ( Tom ) As of this release , only a table 's owner can create or modify rules for the table .
For backwards compatibility , GRANT / REVOKE RULE is still accepted , but it does nothing .
Array comparison improvements ( Tom ) Now array dimensions are also compared .
Change array concatenation to match documented behavior ( Tom ) This changes the previous behavior where concatenation would modify the array lower bound .
Make command - line options of postmaster and postgres identical ( Peter )
This allows the postmaster to pass arguments to each backend without using -o .
Note that some options are now only available as long - form options , because there were conflicting single - letter options .
Deprecate use of postmaster symbolic link ( Peter ) postmaster and postgres commands now act identically , with the behavior determined by command - line options .
The postmaster symbolic link is kept for compatibility , but is not really needed .
Change log_duration to output even if the query is not output ( Tom ) In prior releases , log_duration only printed if the query appeared earlier in the log .
Make to_char ( time ) and to_char ( interval ) treat HH and HH12 as 12 - hour intervals Most applications should use HH24 unless they want a 12 - hour display .
Zero unmasked bits in conversion from INET to CIDR ( Tom ) This ensures that the converted value is actually valid for CIDR .
Remove australian_timezones configuration variable ( Joachim Wieland )
This variable has been superseded by a more general facility for configuring timezone abbreviations .
Improve cost estimation for nested - loop index scans ( Tom ) This might eliminate the need to set unrealistically small values of random_page_cost .
If you have been using a very small random_page_cost , please recheck your test cases .
Change behavior of pg_dump -n and -t options .
( Greg Sabino Mullane )
See the pg_dump manual page for details .
Change libpq PQdsplen ( ) to return a useful value ( Martijn van Oosterhout )
Declare libpq PQgetssl( ) as returning void * , rather than SSL * ( Martijn van Oosterhout )
This allows applications to use the function without including the OpenSSL headers .
C - language loadable modules must now include a PG_MODULE_MAGIC macro call for version compatibility checking ( Martijn van Oosterhout )
For security 's sake , modules used by a PL / PerlU function are no longer available to PL / Perl functions ( Andrew ) Note :
This also implies that data can no longer be shared between a PL / Perl function and a PL / PerlU function .
Some Perl installations have not been compiled with the correct flags to allow multiple interpreters to exist within a single process .
In this situation PL / Perl and PL / PerlU cannot both be used in a single backend .
The solution is to get a Perl installation which supports multiple interpreters .
In contrib / xml2 / , rename xml_valid( ) to xml_is_well_formed ( ) ( Tom ) xml_valid ( ) will remain for backward compatibility , but its behavior will change to do schema checking in a future release .
Remove contrib / ora2pg / , now at http://www.samse.fr/GPL/ora2pg
Remove contrib modules that have been migrated to PgFoundry : adddepend , dbase , dbmirror , fulltextindex , mac , userlock
Remove abandoned contrib modules : mSQL - interface , tips
Researchers from the Universities of Melbourne and Cambridge have unveiled a new theory that shows light can behave like a solid .
“ Solid light will help us build the technology of this century , ” says Dr Andrew Greentree of the School of Physics at the University of Melbourne .
Dr Greentree and colleagues Jared Cole and Professor Lloyd Hollenberg of the University of Melbourne with Dr Charles Tahan of the University of Cambridge made their ‘ solid light ’ breakthrough using tools more commonly used to study matter .
“ Solid light photons repel each other as electrons do .
This means we can control photons , opening the door to new kinds of faster computers , ” says Dr Greentree .
“ Many real - world problems in quantum physics are too hard to solve with today ’s computers .
Our discovery shows how to replicate these hard problems in a system we can control and measure . ”
He says photons of light do not normally interact with each other .
In contrast , the electrons used by computers strongly repel each other .
The team has shown theoretically how to engineer a ‘ phase transition ’ in photons , leading them to change their state so that they do not interact with each other .

“ A phase transition occurs when something changes its state , for example when water becomes ice , ” says team member Jared Cole .
“ Usually , photons flow freely , but in the right circumstances , they repel each other , and form a crystal . ”
He says phase transitions are very important in science and technology , but only the simplest phase transitions can be understood .
Dr Greentree says the solid light phase transition effect ties together two very different areas of physics , optics and condensed matter “ to create a whole new way of thinking ” .
“ It is very exciting for the University of Melbourne and its international collaborations to be leading the world in this new area , ” he says .
The team ’s work has been reported in the prestigious scientific journals Nature Physics and New Scientist .
Funding has come from international and national sources , including the Australian Research Council , the Australian Government , US National Security Agency , the US - based Advanced Research and Development Activity , Army Research Office and the US National Science Foundation .
ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict on Wednesday warned Catholic politicians they risked excommunication from the Church and should not receive communion if they support abortion .
It was the first time that the Pope , speaking to reporters aboard the plane taking him on a trip to Brazil , dealt in depth with a controversial topic that has come up in many countries , including the United States , Mexico , and Italy .
The Pope was asked whether he supported Mexican Church leaders threatening to excommunicate leftist parliamentarians who last month voted to legalize abortion in Mexico City .
“ Yes , this excommunication was not an arbitrary one but is allowed by Canon ( church ) law which says that the killing of an innocent child is incompatible with receiving communion , which is receiving the body of Christ , ” he said .
“ They ( Mexican Church leaders ) did nothing new , surprising or arbitrary .
They simply announced publicly what is contained in the law of the Church ... which expresses our appreciation for life and that human individuality , human personality is present from the first moment ( of life ) ” .
Under Church law , someone who knowingly does or backs something which the Church considers a grave sin , such as abortion , inflicts what is known as “ automatic excommunication ” on themselves .
The Pope said parliamentarians who vote in favor of abortion have “ doubts about the value of life and the beauty of life and even a doubt about the future ” .
“ Selfishness and fear are at the root of ( pro-abortion ) legislation , ” he said .
“ We in the Church have a great struggle to defend life ... life is a gift not a threat . ”
“ ALWAYS A GIFT ”
The Pope ’s comments appear to raise the stakes in the debate over whether Catholic politicians can support abortion or gay marriage and still consider themselves proper Catholics .
In recent months , the Vatican has been accused of interference in Italy for telling Catholic lawmakers to oppose a draft law that would grant some rights to unwed and gay couples .
During the 2004 presidential election , the U.S. Catholic community was split over whether to support Democratic candidate John Kerry , himself a Catholic who backed abortion rights .
Some Catholics say they personally would not have an abortion but feel obliged to support a woman ’s right to choose .
But the Church , which teaches that life begins at the moment of conception and that abortion is murder , says Catholics cannot have it both ways .
“ The Church says life is beautiful , it is not something to doubt but it is a gift even when it is lived in difficult circumstances .
It is always a gift , ” the Pope said .
Only Cuba , Guyana and U.S. commonwealth Puerto Rico allow abortion on demand in Latin America .
Many other countries in the region permit it in special cases , such as if the fetus has defects or if the mother ’s life is at risk .
Brazil , the world ’s most populous Catholic country , is mulling bringing the debate to a referendum .
Or so it would seem based on this report :
COLUMBIA , S.C. ( AP ) â € ”
The chairman of the Michigan Republican Party said Wednesday that he will try to bar Ron Paul from future GOP presidential debates because of remarks the Texas congressman made that suggested the Sept. 11 attacks were the fault of U.S. foreign policy .
Michigan party chairman Saul Anuzis said he will circulate a petition among Republican National Committee members to ban Paul from more debates .
At a GOP candidates ’ debate Tuesday night , Paul drew attacks from all sides , most forcefully from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , when he linked the terror attacks to U.S. bombings .
(…)
Anuzis called the comments “ off the wall and out of whack . ”
“ I think he would have felt much more comfortable on the stage with the Democrats in what he said last night .
And I think that he is a distraction in the Republican primary and he does not represent the base and he does not represent the party , ” Anuzis said during an RNC state leadership meeting .
“ Given what he said last night it was just so off the wall and out of whack that I think it was more detrimental than helpful . ”
Anuzis said his petition would go to debate sponsors and broadcasters to discourage inviting Paul .
Texas Governor Perry took Merck money before mandating cervical vaccine
David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Thursday February 22 , 2007 Print This Email This
Texas Gov. Rick Perry ( R ) says that it 's just a coincidence that he and eight other lawmakers received donations of $ 5,000 each from Merck lobbyists just a few days before mandating the drug giant 's HPV cervical cancer vaccine for all females in Texas ages 12 and up .
" There 's been a lot of pressure about the implications of vaccinating young girls against sexually - transmitted diseases , " says CNN 's Ali Velshi in the video below , " some people thinking that that encourages promiscuity at that age . "
He reports though that " this thing is coming undone by word , rumor and report of connection between Rick Perry 's office and Merck . "
The main lobbyist for Merck previously worked as Chief of Staff for Gov. Rick Perry .
Several other states are considering making the vaccine mandatory , thanks in part to Merck 's aggressive lobbying .
CNN 's coverage can be viewed below .

One of the time leaks I noticed was checking up on certain things too often .
I ’ve already gotten my email processing down to only once a day , but I found I was still checking up on things like blog comments , feeds , ad revenue , sales through my games site , web traffic , watchlists , and other stats several times per day at random intervals .
On the one hand , it ’s great to have up - to - the - minute information available , but taking in that ever - changing information can become a time drain if done to excess .
Some days I feel as if I ’m infected by the curiosity bug , always wanting to know the very latest information for no particular reason .
I ’d catch myself unconsciously checking up on various information outlets far more frequently than I needed to .
Perhaps this is a strange form of perfectionism .
I opted to consciously determine how often I really need to check up on these ever - changing pieces of data .
Much of the information is important , and it would be best if I reviewed most of it daily .
But just because this data is updated in real - time does n’t mean I have to maintain a real - time brain - feed .
I figured that for comments people post on this blog , it ’s reasonable for me to check those twice a day .
Email is still good at once a day ; I only check email at the end of my workday , since I ’ve found it to be too distracting to check it earlier in the day .
I can check on sales and ad revenue twice a day , since I can do both of those in less than a minute , and if something is broken , I want the chance to detect and fix it early .
But for all my other stats , once at the end of each day is fine , and some things I only need to check once a week .
I find that working on my most important tasks early in the day and leaving most of the routine stats checking until later in the day is more productive .
While I might miss the chance to react early to some important piece of data by a few hours , it ’s rare that happens , and the time savings outweighs that opportunity .
Just 10 minutes every weekday wasted on unnecessary stats checking adds up to a full - time workweek every year .
No wonder I did n’t have time for a vacation last year …. 🙁
Of course , if I simply intend to make this change , I ’ll be good for a few days and then forget about it and slip back into old habits .
So first , I ’m going to use a behavioral conditioning technique to put the behavior on cue , in this case tying it to a particular time of day .
For stats checking I do once a day , that will be done at the end of my workday after I ’ve done everything else .
So if I check those stats any earlier , I know without a doubt I ’ve goofed .
My workday ends at 5 pm most days , so that will happen in the 4 - 5 pm range .
For anything I do twice a day , the first check will be done right after I ’ve completed four hours of writing my book , which will put it into the 11 am - 12 pm range , just before lunch .
Putting these behaviors on cue helps me establish my new habit by binding it to specific times of day .
Secondly , I ’m turning this into a 30 - day challenge for myself , so I ’m committed to sticking with it for 30 days to see how it works .
I ’m sure many other people have routine tasks they perform far more often than necessary , but perhaps the tasks are still important and ca n’t be eliminated entirely .
Try binding those actions to certain times or day or before or after once - a - day activities like meals , and keep it up for at least three weeks .
This will break the old habit and establish the new one .

The following letter from Carl Wunsch is intended to clarify his views on global warming in general , and the The Great Global Warming Swindle which misrepresented them .
Partial Response to the London Channel 4 Film “ The Global Warming Swindle ”
Carl Wunsch 11 March 2007
I believe that climate change is real , a major threat , and almost surely has a major human - induced component .
But I have tried to stay out of the `climate wars ’ because all nuance tends to be lost , and the distinction between what we know firmly , as scientists , and what we suspect is happening , is so difficult to maintain in the presence of rhetorical excess .
In the long run , our credibility as scientists rests on being very careful of , and protective of , our authority and expertise .
The science of climate change remains incomplete .
Some elements are so firmly based on well - understood principles , or for which the observational record is so clear , that most scientists would agree that they are almost surely true ( adding CO2 to the atmosphere is dangerous ; sea level will continue to rise , … ) .
Other elements remain more uncertain , but we as scientists in our roles as informed citizens believe society should be deeply concerned about their possibility : failure of US midwestern precipitation in 100 years in a mega - drought ; melting of a large part of the Greenland ice sheet , among many other examples .
I am on record in a number of places complaining about the over - dramatization and unwarranted extrapolation of scientific facts .
Thus the notion that the Gulf Stream would or could “ shut off ” or that with global warming Britain would go into a “ new ice age ” are either scientifically impossible or so unlikely as to threaten our credibility as a scientific discipline if we proclaim their reality [ i.e. see this previous RC post ] .
They also are huge distractions from more immediate and realistic threats .
I ’ve paid more attention to the extreme claims in the literature warning of coming catastrophe , both because I regard the scientists there as more serious , and because I am very sympathetic to the goals of my colleagues who sometimes seem , however , to be confusing their specific scientific knowledge with their worries about the future .
When approached by WAGTV , on behalf of Channel 4 , known to me as one of the main UK independent broadcasters , I was led to believe that I would be given an opportunity to explain why I , like some others , find the statements at both extremes of the global change debate distasteful .
I am , after all a teacher , and this seemed like a good opportunity to explain why , for example , I thought more attention should be paid to sea level rise , which is ongoing and unstoppable and carries a real threat of acceleration , than to the unsupportable claims that the ocean circulation was undergoing shutdown ( Nature , December 2005 ) .
I wanted to explain why observing the ocean was so difficult , and why it is so tricky to predict with any degree of confidence such important climate elements as its heat and carbon storage and transports in 10 or 100 years .
I am distrustful of prediction scenarios for details of the ocean circulation that rely on extremely complicated coupled models that run out for decades to thousands of years .
The science is not sufficiently mature to say which of the many complex elements of such forecasts are skillful .
Nonetheless , and contrary to the impression given in the film , I firmly believe there is a great deal to be learned from models .
With effort , all of this is explicable in terms the public can understand .
In the part of the “ Swindle ” film where I am describing the fact that the ocean tends to expel carbon dioxide where it is warm , and to absorb it where it is cold , my intent was to explain that warming the ocean could be dangerous — because it is such a gigantic reservoir of carbon .
By its placement in the film , it appears that I am saying that since carbon dioxide exists in the ocean in such large quantities , human influence must not be very important — diametrically opposite to the point I was making — which is that global warming is both real and threatening in many different ways , some unexpected .
Many of us feel an obligation to talk to the media — it ’s part of our role as scientists , citizens , and educators .
The subjects are complicated , and it is easy to be misquoted or quoted out context .
My experience in the past is that these things do happen , but usually inadvertently — most reporters really do want to get it right .
Channel 4 now says they were making a film in a series of “ polemics ” .
There is nothing in the communication we had ( much of it on the telephone or with the film crew on the day they were in Boston ) that suggested they were making a film that was one - sided , anti-educational , and misleading .
I took them at face value — clearly a great error .
I knew I had no control over the actual content , but it never occurred to me that I was dealing with people who already had a reputation for distortion and exaggeration .
The letter I sent them as soon as I heard about the actual program is below .

As a society , we need to take out insurance against catastrophe in the same way we take out homeowner ’s protection against fire .
I buy fire insurance , but I also take the precaution of having the wiring in the house checked , keeping the heating system up to date , etc. , all the while hoping that I wo n’t need the insurance .
Will any of these precautions work ?
Unexpected things still happen ( lightning strike ?
plumber ’s torch igniting the woodwork ? ) .
How large a fire insurance premium is it worth paying ?
How much is it worth paying for rewiring the house ?
$ 10,000 but perhaps not $ 100,000 ?
There are no simple answers even at this mundane level .
How much is it worth to society to restrain CO2 emissions — will that guarantee protection against global warming ?
Is it sensible to subsidize insurance for people who wish to build in regions strongly susceptible to coastal flooding ?
These and others are truly complicated questions where often the science is not mature enough give definitive answers , much as we would like to be able to provide them .
Scientifically , we can recognize the reality of the threat , and much of what society needs to insure against .
Statements of concern do not need to imply that we have all the answers .
Channel 4 had an opportunity to elucidate some of this .
The outcome is sad .

What is morally wrong can never be advantageous , even when it enables you to make some gain that you believe to be to your advantage .
The mere act of believing that some wrongful course of action constitutes an advantage is pernicious .
~ Cicero
The received wisdom informs us that the American public has tired of George Bush and his use of lies and other deceptions to fashion a war - crazed police - state .
According to this view , voters will go to the polls this November and exchange a sufficient number of Republican scoundrels for Democratic ones to deprive Bush of a GOP - controlled Congress .
Then , we are further led to believe , the sociopathic madness that has metastasized from inside the u201Cbeltwayu201D will have come to an end , and — like members of any lynch mob who later reflect on their deed — most Americans will rediscover their lost sense of sanity and decency .
I accept none of this foolish thinking .
I see no evidence that any greater number of Americans are critical of Mr. Bush ’s appetites for tyranny or unprovoked wars than existed at the time of his Afghan / Iraqi attacks .
This is not to suggest that many Americans are pleased with Mr. Bush ’s performance .
Public opinion polls reflect a growing dissatisfaction with his handling of the presidency .
But their displeasure does not rise to the level of a moral condemnation of his actions .
It ’s not that Mr. Bush ’s performance has been one long string of lies and deceptions that bothers many Americans .
Politics is dependent upon lies , fraudulent promises , and misrepresentations .
Americans know this and insist upon their fantasies and delusions being catered to with a faithful adherence to accepted rhyme and meter .
Those who insist upon the truth are treated as outcasts : u201 Cextremists , u201D u201 Ccynics , u201D u201 Cwackos,u201D or u201 Cparanoid conspiracy theorists , u201D are the usual epithets directed against persons who would bring discredit to the game by truth - telling .
While most Americans demand that their politicians be liars and pretenders , they want the performance to be carried off with sophistication and elegance .
Mr. Bush ’s lies have been too transparent .
He is like a clumsy magician who inadvertently lets the egg drop from his sleeve just as he is about to remove it from behind a subject ’s ear .
Americans prefer being seduced by such suave , smooth - talking types as Bill Clinton or the Kennedys .
Bush comes across as a crude fraternity boy seeking a fast conquest .
His deviation from the accepted standards of refined dishonesty are so apparent as to have made a success of Jon Stewart ’s The Daily Show .
While Clinton and the Kennedys are Democrats , the Republicans are expected to have their practitioners of the subtle arts of mendacity .
Men like Henry Kissinger — who can both promote wars and win the Nobel Peace Prize ! — provide a model to which conservatives can repair .
Was it not Kissinger who said that u201 Cpower is the ultimate aphrodisiacu201D ?
Is this the reason Kissinger has been brought into the White House to advise President Bush ?
A number of critics have asked why the Democratic politicians have been so tame regarding the Bush administration ’s outrageous policies .
Why have n’t they taken a strong stand against Mr. Bush ’s unprovoked wars , his phony u201 Cwar on terrorism , u201D his snowballing police state , and his plans to add Iran to his laundry list of war targets ?
The answer to this question is quite evident , for two reasons : ( 1 ) the Democrats are as much a part of the system that depends upon lies , deceit , and violence as are the Republicans , and do not want discredit to be brought upon the game they imagine themselves to be controlling one day soon .
( 2 ) The Democrats understand the mindset of most Americans , and recognize that their political ambitions would be dealt a fatal blow should they be perceived as embracing moral principles .
Most Americans have an aversion to reality , and are inclined to settle for ersatz versions of it in so - called u201 Creality televisionu201D programs that can be turned off whenever troublesome questions arise .
The mainstream media continue to divert attention away from any topic that would lay a burden upon the minds of men and women who prefer live coverage of car chases , or stories about missing children or a teenager in Aruba .
With politicians and government officials providing the example , truth - telling has become just one of numerous strategies for pursuing one ’s advantage ; a lie is as good as the truth if it serves one ’s ends and others will believe it .
What has brought so much of modern society to such a low course ?
Why do so many of us not only accept being lied to — particularly about matters that lead to the deaths and mutilations of hundreds of thousands of innocent people — but are unwilling to voice any moral objection to such practices ?
Why were so many people prepared to run Bill Clinton out of the White House for lying about his sexual trysts , but now embrace a president who tells one lie after another in order to carry out what appears to be his dominant purpose : the conduct of war against as many defenseless people as possible ?
Why do so many of us feign moral indignation over the sexual peccadilloes of politicians , while decorating our homes and cars with flags in support of mass - murder ?
The answers to such questions begin in the practice of identifying ourselves through various institutional abstractions , the nation - state being the most prominent and troublesome .
I have written extensively on this topic , and will not repeat the details of it here .
Suffice it to say that we have learned to regard the very essence of our being as indistinguishable from such abstractions .
To most of us , being an u201CAmericanu201D is much more than a matter of physical geography ; it provides us with what Frederick Perls ’ termed our u201 Cego boundaries , u201D the sense of who we are .
The same processes explain the weltanschauung of Germans , Chinese , Israelis , Swedes , Palestinians , et al. , as well as the u201 Cego boundary u201D identities defined by one ’s race , religion , gender , or other collective criteria .
And herein lies the problem .
My question , u201 Chow does a nation lose its soul ?
u201D , is intentionally misleading .
A nation is but an abstraction and has no more u201 Csoulu201D than does a crowd of subway passengers .
Only individuals enjoy a spiritual essence .
A nation - state is but a tool that has proven useful to men and women who seek to promote their interests by inducing others to submit their lives and other resources to their management and control .
To accomplish such ends , it is first necessary for the politically ambitious to herd individuals into a collective mindset , a process that requires us to transform our inner , individualized sense of being into an externalized one .
We learn to twist the moral , ethical , emotional , and spiritual sense that inheres within each of us , into the collective virtues of conformity , obedience , resignation , and intolerance for members of other u201 Cego boundary u201D collectives .
In such ways does the soul of an individual become corrupted and homogenized into a form of potential energy to be used for collective purposes .
Carl Jung and others have devoted much effort to helping us understand the u201 Ccollective unconsciousu201D that we share with our fellow humans .
Each of us has a u201 Cdark sideu201D consisting of unconscious forces we prefer not to share : capacities for dishonesty , violence , anger , irresponsibility , bigotry , or any of numerous other negative qualities .
We may not act in response to such impulses , but we fear that , sufficiently motivated , we might do so .
It is such u201 Cdark sideu201D energies that the state exploits in fostering and reinforcing our sense of collective identity .
Responsive to fears and weakness , our u201 Cdark sideu201D is easily mobilized and made available for the state ’s destructive purposes .
Evidence for this is found in the response of most Americans to the events of 9/11 , whose spectral fears are bolstered by daily reminders of the dangers we face from alleged u201Cterrorists u201D plotting to attack our neighborhood grocery store , a petting zoo , or people boarding airliners with toothpaste .
For those challenged by the complexities of simple language , a color chart is made available , whose hues can be manipulated to elicit the desired fear response .
When we become collectivized beings , the moral perspective that might otherwise arise from our individualized judgments , gets transformed into a kind of mechanistic u201 Cgroup - think , u201D without any basis for more introspective thought .
u201CLegalityu201D takes the place of u201Cmorality u201D ; the rules of u201 Cpolitical correctnessu201D substitute for intellectual acuity ; while the Dow - Jones Industrial Average and the world price for oil become the standards for measuring political propriety .
Such collectivized thinking has provided George Bush with the safety net that does not translate his lies and butcherous dispositions into a widespread moral resentment .
Most criticisms of his policies have arisen not out of any fundamental philosophic principles , but — at least recently — only from the pursuit of partisan political advantage .
At best , his disapproval ratings derive generally from perceived defects in style , not substance .
His clumsiness and arrogance run counter to the expectations people have come to expect from occupants of the White House ; to be president , one must act presidential , not like a grade - schooler in a cowboy suit .
The office must not be besmirched by a lack of grace .
Most people do not comprehend the dissimilarity of public and political reaction to Bill Clinton ’s and George Bush ’s behavior .
Clinton ’s offense was not that he had lied about illicit sex , but that he had chosen to engage in it in the u201 Coval office , u201D thus desecrating the holy temple of the statist religion .
Had he confined his trysting to local motels , his acts would have brought about no more criticism than was visited upon FDR or JFK for their liaisons .
To inject moral or philosophic considerations into the political process totally misconceives of the basic nature of the state .
To confront a collectivized mind with normative principles is as much a waste of time as trying to educate a person in differential calculus whose understanding of mathematics has been confined to using an abacus ; or to explain the communicative powers of the Internet to a medieval man accustomed to sending fire signals from towers .
Mr. Bush , his Machiavellian supporters , and the Democrats understand this essential fact of politics quite well .
If the Republicans suffer at the polls this November , it will not be due to any moral hostility to the wholesale lying or the slaughter of innocents directed from the White House , but only from a substantial deviation from the political forms , practices , and litanies upon which collective minds insist .
We begin to lose our souls when we allow ourselves to become part of a collective , a truth the statists understand as providing the foundation for their vicious systems .
If individuals do not maintain their constant awareness , the u201 Cdark sideu201D is very easy to mobilize into a collective mass of destructive energy .
Crowds and mobs are made up of people who allow their judgment and responsibility to be taken over by such collective forces that speak in one simple , uncomplicated voice .
By contrast , the moral dimensions of our being — whose intuitive and emotional nature are the language of the soul — do not organize well .
Though we may speak with one another of such matters , their resolution ultimately comes down to a sense that emerges wholly within each of us .
This is why , historically , collective forces of state power have prevailed over mankind .
As we have discovered from the failures of constitutional limitations on government , there is no way of preventing the state from doing whatever its leaders choose to do , once millions of people have been herded into a collective force obedient to the will of their masters .
A nation — any nation — does not lose its u201 Csoulu201D for , being an abstraction , it has none to lose .
Only individuals can suffer such a loss , which they do whenever they allow their sense of being to get submerged in any collective .
But such dynamics also indicate the way out of our collective madness , namely , to go back in our thinking to our childhood , and become aware of how we were taught to stand in straight lines , to recite pledges of allegiance , and to march to other people ’s music .
In such reflective ways , we may rediscover our individuality by withdrawing our energies from the collective mindset ; we may learn to have a healthy skepticism about the nature of organizations .
In so doing , we may end our contributions to world madness .
Men and women devoted to their collectivized identities will never bring about such change .
Neither will those of us who — enmeshed in the 51 % political mentality in which he have been trained — believe that meaningful change depends upon altering the thinking of others .
But as chaos theory informs us , the flapping of the wings of a butterfly over the Andes will affect the weather in Tibet .
Carl Jung expressed the matter most poignantly : u201 Cthe salvation of the world consists in the salvation of the individual soul .u201D
Think of the creative powers that might be unleashed from just two of us — you and me — intent on rediscovering our souls .

Suggestion for a distributed open - source system to fight badness :
The system allows you to enter the name / location of a person who needs to be punched in the face , somewhere in the world ( a known spammer , for example ) .
Then , you see if there is anyone near you that needs to be punched in the face .
Punch them .

Quantum mechanics just got even stranger .
In the quantum world , it is meaningless to imagine which cars are which colours , or what might happen if you step into a busy road .
Getty
There 's only one way to describe the experiment performed by physicist Anton Zeilinger and his colleagues : it 's unreal , dude .
Measuring the quantum properties of pairs of light particles ( photons ) pumped out by a laser has convinced Zeilinger that " we have to give up the idea of realism to a far greater extent than most physicists believe today . "
By realism , he means the idea that objects have specific features and properties — that a ball is red , that a book contains the works of Shakespeare , or that an electron has a particular spin .
For everyday objects , such realism is n't a problem .
But for objects governed by the laws of quantum mechanics , like photons and electrons , it may make no sense to think of them as having well defined characteristics .
Instead , what we see may depend on how we look .
This notion has been around ever since the advent of quantum mechanics in the early twentieth century .
The theory seemed to show that , in the quantum world , objects are defined only fuzzily , so that all we can do is work out the probability that they have particular characteristics — such as being located in a specific place or having a specific energy .
“ We have a little more evidence that the world is really strange . ”
Anton Zeilinger
University of Vienna
Allied to this assault on reality was the apparent prediction of what Albert Einstein , one of the chief architects of quantum theory , called ' spooky action at a distance ' .
Quantum theory suggests that disturbing one particle can instantaneously determine the properties of a particle with which it is ' entangled ' , no matter how far away it is .
This would violate the usual rule of locality : that local behaviour is governed by local events .
Einstein could not believe that the world was really so indeterminate .
He supposed that a deeper level of reality had yet to be uncovered — so - called ' hidden variables ' that specified an object 's properties precisely and in strictly local terms .
Failed test
In the 1960s the Irish physicist John Bell showed how to put locality and realism to the test .
He deduced that if both ideas applied to the quantum world , then two particular quantities calculated from measurements made on a pair of entangled photons would be equal to one another .
If so , there would be nothing ' spooky ' about entanglement after all .
Experiments were done to test his prediction in the ensuing two decades , and results showed that Bell 's equality was violated .
Thus , either realism or locality , or possibly both of these ideas , do not apply in the quantum world .
But which is it ?
That 's what Zeilinger , based at the University of Vienna in Austria , and his colleagues tried to find out .
They came up with a similar test to Bell 's , to see whether quantum mechanics obeys realism but not locality .
Again the experiment involves comparing two quantities calculated from measurements on entangled photons , to see if they are equal .
But whereas in Bell 's test these quantities are derived from the so - called ' linear ' polarization of the photons — crudely , whether their electromagnetic fields oscillate in one direction or the other —
Zeilinger 's experiment looks at a different sort of polarization , called elliptical polarization .
Like Bell's , Zeilinger 's equality proved false .
This does n't rule out all possible non-local realistic models , but it does exclude an important subset of them .
Specifically , it shows that if you have a group of photons that all have independent polarizations , then you can't ascribe specific polarizations to each .
It 's rather like saying that you know there are particular numbers of blue , white and silver cars in a car park — but it is meaningless even to imagine saying which ones are which .
Truly weird
ADVERTISEMENT
If the quantum world is not realistic in this sense , then how does it behave ?
Zeilinger says that some of the alternative non-realist possibilities are truly weird .
For example , it may make no sense to imagine what would happen if we had made a different measurement from the one we chose to make .
" We do this all the time in daily life , " says Zeilinger — for example , imagining what would have happened if you had tried to cross the road when a truck was coming .
If the world around us behaved in the same way as a quantum system , then it would be meaningless even to imagine that alternative situation , because there would be no way of defining what you mean by the road , the truck , or even you .
Another possibility is that in a non-realistic quantum world present actions can affect the past , as though choosing to read a letter or not could determine what it says .
Zeilinger hopes that his work will stimulate others to test such possibilities .
" Our paper is not the end of the road , " he says .
" But we have a little more evidence that the world is really strange . "

large clay ribbon loop ... peels the rind off the pumpkin beautifully as well as does 90 % of the carving , minus the small details .
medium clay ribbon loop ... more blocking in of the face
mini clay ribbon loops .... smaller details , especially around the eyes .
Xacto knife and paring knife for sharp defined lines and cuts .

Scroll down and learn how to create your very own .
If you have yet to try and carve a pumpkin in a 3 - D manner you need to .
Its fun and everybody enjoys a cool pumpkin .
Unfortunately they begin to rot less than a week after carving so be sure to take plenty of pictures .
You can experiment with ways of preserving them but I find nothing works better than a nice photo .
Some chefs that I have carved for put lemon juice on the faces to help slow down the natural molding process that will occur .
Picking out the right pumpkin is very important .
You need a pumpkin with a thick wall .
To get this kind you will have to choose one that is very heavy for its size .
Also avoid perfectly round pumpkins and opt for ones that have a protruding ridge that sticks out on one side .
These shapes make nice faces as you could imagine how difficult it would be to carve a 3 - D face onto a shallow flat surface .
Using the large loop , peel the pumpkins skin .
Shave away the deepest areas , such as the area below the nose and the eyes sockets .
Be brave , go deep .
Unfortunately if you go too deep you 'll break through and have to get a new pumpkin and start over , but if you do n't go deep enough it just will not look as impressive .
After a few hundred mess ups you will begin to know just exactly how thick your pumpkin are .
The grain will become more fiberous as you approach the center .
Every year I accidentally break threw a few .
Typically I put my fist through the face , throw it out to the deer and start over .
This pumpkin had a curve in it so I used it to my advantage when composing the face .
The smaller loops work well for getting small deep cut areas such as the inner mouth .
Use the paring knife to create nice sharp creases along the smile marks ans nostrils .
To obtain these creases make 2 angled cuts and pull the wedge out .
Paring knives have a nice curve to the blade allowing for better ability around curves .
Small loops are great for blocking in areas such as stiches .
Be sure to also utilize a knife later so that the details of the stitches become crisp .
After blocking in the eyes with the loops I then add crisp lines with the paring knife .
Use an xacto to draw the pupil and lift out some meat to create shadow .
The loops can create wrinkles that are softer .
Draw the teeth in with an xacto knife , then using your paring knife cut the edges off the teeth at a 45 degree angle .
Hard to explain but the pictures may explain .
Hope you enjoyed our tutorial .
Give it a try yourself this Halloween .

Theres a new technique emerging in large organisations ( and tiny internet blogs no one reads ) that 's sweeping the nation and make every staffer feel empowered in their position at no extra cost to their employers .
Sounds incredible does n't it ?
Well read on !
And as with all great innovations , its so simple its impact leaves people scratching their eyes in frustration that they did n't think of it and patent it first .
Heres the devilishly simple trick : essentially all you have to do is take an perfectly respectable job title , Editors Assistant , for example , and tack on a lot of empty but important - sounding modifiers to semantically sugar coat the fact that the poor sap concerned is still doing the same job at the same desk for the same money , and will be forever ( they got turned down for a job as a real designer you see ) .
The worker drone , delighted with his longer , faintly ludicrous new sobriquet is then safe in the knowledge that his four - inch business card now describes him as Senior Associate Editor At Large In Charge Of Document Content Generation , and he can get back to work spazzing out baffling , teeth - grittingly ignorant ' articles ' with peppered with the sort of doggerel that would get you a detention in GCSE English .
( That 's probably third grade or junior high or something for you guys in the US )
I can all too easily imagine the great mind quote above opening the link to the laptop in question and staring blankly at the screen for 60 endless seconds before wiping the drool away and tapping with painful slowness into his big colourful Senior Associate Editor keyboard " retarded . "

Surely that 's worth more that some crummy car computer thing is n't it ?

Do n't worry kids , theres a perfectly rational explanation for this character .
His dad was a policeman , and he had a simple computer installed into his cruiser , where such a computer is eminently useful to officers communicating with their base or entering crime scene information .
It was the sight of this otherwise innocuous piece of electronics , that s0crates saw bobbing gaily up and down in his peripheral vision as daddy rammed him mercilessly in the back seat of the cop car , gradually obscured by blood as his sobbing face slammed relentlessly against the clear plastic barrier , that forever turned him against laptops in cars .

When two policemen turned up unannounced at Alan Rawlinson 's home asking to speak to his young son , the company director feared something serious had happened .
So he was astounded when the officers detailed 11 - year - old George 's apparent crime - calling one of his schoolfriends ' gay ' .
They said primary school pupil , George , was being investigated for a ' very serious ' homophobic crime after using the comment in an e-mail to a 10 - year - old classmate .
Scroll down for more ...
But now his parents have hit out at the police , who they accused of being heavy - handed and pandering to political correctness .
" It is completely ridiculous , " Mr Rawlinson said .
" I thought the officers were joking at first , but they told me they considered it a very serious offence .
" The politically correct brigade are taking over .
This seemed like a huge waste of resources for something so trivial as a playground spat . "
Cheshire police launched the investigation last month after a complaint from the parents of the 10 - year - old younger boy who received George 's e-mail .
They said their son had been called a ' gay boy ' and were concerned that there was more to the comment than playground banter and that their child was being bullied .
As a consequence , two officers were sent to the boys ' school , Farnworth Primary , in Widnes , Cheshire , to speak to the headteacher who directed them to the Rawlinsons ' home in nearby St Helens , Merseyside .
George told his parents that the comment was in no way meant to be homophobic and that he had simply been using the word gay instead of ' stupid ' .
Mr Rawlinson , 41 , who runs his own business , and whose wife , Gaynor , also 41 , is a magistrate , said his son was terrified when the police arrived at their home .
He feared he was going to be arrested and locked up in a cell because of it , he added .
" I feel very aggrieved about this , " Mr Rawlinson , who has lodged a formal complaint against the police , said .
" We are law - abiding citizens who have paid taxes all our lives .
" I 've constantly contacted police about break - ins at my business and never get a suitable response .
" George was really upset , he thought he was going to be locked up .
This just seemed like a huge waste of resources for something so trivial . "
Inspector Nick Bailey , of Cheshire police , said no further action would be taken against George .
However , he said the force had been obliged to record the incident as a crime and that they had dealt with it in a ' proportionate ' manner .
" The parents of the boy believed it was more sinister that just a schoolyard prank , " Inspector Bailey said .
" We were obliged to record the matter as a crime and took a proportionate and maybe old fashioned view .
" Going to the boy 's house was a reasonable course of action to take .
This e-mail message was part of some behaviour which had been on going .
" The use of the word ' gay ' would imply that it was homophobic , but we would be hard pushed to say it was a homophobic crime .
" This boy has not been treated as an offender . "
This is a latest in a series of incidents where police have been accused of heavy handedness for interviewing or threatening children with prosecution for seemingly trivial crimes .
Last October the Daily Mail revealed how 14 - year - old Codie Scott was arrested and thrown in a police cell for almost four hours after she was accused of racism for refusing to sit next to a group of Asian pupils in her class .
Teachers reported the youngster , from Harrop Fold High School in Worsley , Greater Manchester , after she claimed it was impossible for her to get involved in the class ' discussion ' because only one of the Asian pupils spoke English .
She had her fingerprints and DNA taken but was eventually released without charge .
The incident followed that of a 15 - year - old boy from Burnley , Lancashire , who was arrested , thrown in a police cell , hauled before the courts and landed with a criminal record simply for throwing a snowball at a car .
The teenager , who can not be named for legal reasons , was prosecuted under a little used 160 - year - old law last March , and fined £ 100 in a case which provoked a public outcry .
Guest Post by Babar Bhatti
The overall consensus of industry analysts is that Pakistan is one of the countries with a huge untapped potential for telcom growth and an attractive investment environment .
Recently Business Monitor International ( BMI ) ranked Pakistan as a key destination for telecom growth .
The BMI rankings take into account a number of factors including industry situation , growth potential , competitive landscape and economy and political risks etc .
The sudden growth in subscriber base in Pakistan has caused network congestion and service quality problems .
The major operators are responding to this problem by upgrading their networks .
These multibillion dollar improvements , along with a regulatory effort to introduce Mobile Number Portability ( MNP ) next year , should maintain the stiff competition in PakistanÃ ƒÂ ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€ žÂ¢s mobile market .
Pakistan is still an unsaturated market and with the falling cost of handsets there are plenty of new subscribers to compete for , especially in the rural areas .
But eventually , as in saturated markets , if mobile operators want to avoid simply competing on price , they will have to compete on superior service , innovative features and ease - of - use .
As an example of new trends there were so many text messages ( SMS ) sent on this Eid that the networks of all 6 companies were kept extremely busy !
Pakistan has also had some strategic wins in the international telecommunication scene .
This month Pakistan won the council seat of International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) and Chairman Pakistan Telecommunication Authority ( PTA ) was elected as member of Radio Regulation Board of ITU .
Pakistan also holds the office of President in Asia Pacific Telecommunity .
ITU has also announced that it will setup a Center of Excellence in Pakistan for telecommunication regulation and policy .
There is still a long way to go for PakistanÃ ƒÂ ¢ Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€ žÂ¢s telecom industry .
Pakistan needs to increase telecom research and development work within the country .
China and India are in the process of becoming worldÃƒÂ ¢ Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€ žÂ¢s major R&D centers for technology and telecommunication .
Two top Chinese telecom equipment firms have announced their plans to collaborate with Pakistan : Huawei is working with UET Lahore and ZTE will setup R&D center in Islamabad .
The goal of the policy makers should be to increase the rate of transfer of technology from abroad , broaden the pool of local skilled workforce and accelerate the local production of telecom equipment and handset parts etc .
At the top of the list of Pakistani mobile companies is Mobilink , the Pakistani unit of Egypt - based telecom company Orascom .
It has been in Pakistan since 1994 .
With 20 million subscribers it has the largest market share .
Its shares are listed on the Egyptian and London stock markets ( OTLD ) .
Ufone , a wholly owned subsidiary of Pakistan Telecommunication Co. Ltd ( PTCL ) , is now under the control of Etisalat group of UAE .
With 8.8 million subscribers it is the runner up .
For those in Pakistan it is the one company where they can easily invest locally .
In third place is Warid , owned by the Abu Dhabi group of the United Arab Emirates and sister of Wateen group .
With 5.9 million subscribers it controls 14 % market of subscribers .
NorwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s
Telenor , a recent entrant with about a billion US dollar invesment in Pakistan has been doing well , based on its recent earning report .
It has about 4.6 million subscribers or 11 % of the market .
Telenor stock is listed in the Oslo stock market ( TEL ) and Nasdaq NY ( TELN ) .
Paktel and Instaphone are owned by Luxembourg based Millicom International Cellular ( listed in Nasdaq as MIC ) .
It is down to 1 % of the subscriber share in Pakistan and according to recent news it is on its way out of Pakistan .
One sign of the growth burst of the sector in Pakistan and its self - confidence are the media ads of the various companies .
As they fight for market share , that battle is being conducted over the airwaves and newsprint .
It is hard not to notice the mobile phone advertising campaigns in Pakistan .
The mobile phone and services advertisements are in the media , on billboards and everywhere else imaginable .
The quality and aggressiveness of the advertising campaigns indicates the level of effort to gain market share .
According to studies Pakistan has been adding 2 million subscribers each month in 2006 .
The market segments mobile companies are targeting include :
tech - savvy youth
business users ( due to the their higher average revenue per user )
first - time subscribers in remote and rural areas
previously ignored segments , for instance housewives and women
The ads are vibrant and colorful , conveying a sense of excitement and empowerment – but I did not find them very creative .
The pretty picture these ads paint is separated from the real world where poor cellular service has led to PTA to announce that punitive action will be taken if problems persist .
Take a look at some of the recent advertisements and enjoy .
The following four videos are of ads from Mobilink ( Focus : Ringtones ) ; Warid ( Focus : 30 - second Billing ) ; Telenor ( Focus : TalkShawk Package ) ; and Ufone ( Focus : General ) .

Effective scientific electronic publishing
Markus G. Kuhn , Computer Laboratory , University of Cambridge
This is a brief list of recommendations for authors of scientific papers who make their work available online .
It focuses in particular on producing high - quality PDF files with LaTeX and covers some other technical and typographic pitfalls .
Contents
Be consistent with how you write your name
Choose an exact spelling of your name at the start of your scientific career and use that and only that on all your publications .
Do not change any part of your name .
If you have a middle initial in your name , then either use it always ( preferred ) or use it never , but avoid switching between the two possibilities .
Otherwise , you will get sorted in bibliographic databases ( Science Citation Index , etc. ) under various different places like J DOE and JA DOE , which makes it more difficult to locate your work .
Use the LaTeX styles suggested by the conference organizers
If the conference proceedings will be published by Springer as Lecture Notes in Computer Science , then use the latest LLNCS LaTeX2e macro package provided by Springer to format your camera - ready copy .
Read the authors ’ instructions carefully .
Make sure your online version has page numbers and reference information
Camera - ready submission formats required by publishers often lack page numbers or an indication of where this paper was published , because the publishers want to add this information themselves .
If you put this camera - ready version on the Web , then people will print it out and forget where they downloaded it .
If they then ca n’t find the reference information on the paper , they will not be able to quote your paper properly .
Therefore , your own online version should differ from the submitted camera - ready copy in these two aspects .
The page numbers should be switched on and the precise bibliographic reference of your paper should be included .
Preferably put the reference information at the bottom of the first page , in a way that does not change the page breaks compared to the submitted camera - ready copy .
Update your online copy once you receive all the precise metadata ( page numbers , ISBN , publication date , etc. ) of the final published paper version .
Users of Springer ’s LLNCS style can use the package butterma.sty to add the bibliographic reference to the first page of the online version .
To make this work , the file should start like \ documentclass [ runningheads ] {llncs} \usepackage {butterma} \idline{J.~Doe and E.~Muster ( Eds. ) : Perfect Publishing , LNCS 9999} \ setcounter{page} {101} %\renewcommand{\year} {1999} % just if you do n't want the current year ... \ maketitle \thispagestyle{electronic} where of course the text after \idline has to be replaced with your reference and the page number after \setcounter {page} has to be adjusted to your first page number .
The line \thispagestyle {electronic} which follows \maketitle suppresses the page number on the first page , which was activated by the [ runningheads ] in the first line .
If your title is too long to fit into the running heads , then you should provide a shorter one using \titlerunning and \authorrunning .
Special thanks to Antje Endemann from Springer for this description .
My variant prebutterma.sty , which only adds the \idline value at the bottom , can be used to annotate preprints that are not yet published in LNCS and therefore do not yet need a Springer copyright notice and a page - number range .
If you make a paper that you submitted to a publisher available online , then read the publisher ’s copyright conditions carefully .
Most scientific publishers now allow you to have your paper on your Web page , but some require you to add a special copyright notice .
The first printed page should be page number 1
International Standard ISO 7144 ( “ Documentation — Presentation of theses and similar documents ” ) :
“ The numbering of pages shall run consecutively , including blank pages , also if a thesis is published in several volumes , in arabic numerals , beginning on the recto of the first printed leaf .
The title - leaves are counted but not numbered . ”
If your document comes with a table of contents or index and the printed version is usually bound separately ( e.g. , a thesis , technical report , manual , book ) , then it is very convenient if the page numbers printed in the document match exactly the page numbers displayed by an electronic document viewer , such as Adobe Reader or ghostview .
This is most easily achieved , if , starting from the title page ( the front of the first page that comes out of the printer ) , all pages are numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals ( 1 , 2 , 3 , ... ) .
The LaTeX “ article ” and “ report ” styles do this .
Avoid separate Roman numerals for front matter ( the LaTeX “ book ” style uses these by default ) .
Should the thesis presentation regulations of your institution disagree , you may want to make those who wrote them aware of ISO 7144 .
Use PDF as the distribution format for your online version
Adobe ’s Portable Document Format has long become the preferred format for publishing formatted documents .
PDF has several advantages over the more traditional Adobe PostScript format :
PDF was specifically designed as a document distribution and archive format , while PostScript is just a printer control language .
PDF is more portable .
PDF viewers and printing tools such as the Adobe Reader , GhostScript , xpdf , and kpdf are freely available .
They are much more widely deployed and user friendly than PostScript printers and viewers ( especially on Microsoft platforms ) .
The Shrink to fit function of Adobe Reader provides an elegant workaround for the non-ISO paper size problem with which North Americans continue to plague the world .
PDF has built - in per-page compression , therefore it is not necessary to use extra compression and packaging tools such as PKZIP .
necessary to use extra compression and packaging tools such as PKZIP .
PDF allows authors to include URL hyperlinks ( accessible from TeX via HyperTeX and the hyperref LaTeX macros ) .
PDF encodes photos very compactly using the JPEG algorithm , whereas they increase the size of PostScript Level 1 files tremendously .
Some PDF
Web - browser plugins support fast direct download of individual pages in documents .
PostScript can be converted to PDF with the “ ps2pdf ” tool included with ghostscript , or with Adobe ’s Acrobat Distiller product .
Please do not package PDF files into ZIP files .
They are already compressed .
Put them directly on your web server .
Applying PKZIP in addition will not reduce the size significantly , but it will render the convenient PDF plug-ins of web browsers useless .
Make sure that your web server serves PDF files with the line “ Content - Type : application / pdf ” in the HTTP header .
PdfTeX is a version of TeX that can produce both DVI and PDF files as output .
It knows a number of additional commands to control the PDF output ( adding URLs , embedding graphics , etc. ) .
Pdftex does not allow to embed EPS files as this is possible with dvips , but EPS files can be converted into PDF using ghostscript and the epstopdf script that comes with tetex .
One good way of including diagrams into TeX documents is to use xfig or for more complicated cases MetaPost in order to generate an embedded PostScript file .
Both these tools allow you to include mathematical formulae into diagrams that will be typeset by LaTeX ( in xfig , export to " Combined PS / LaTeX ( both parts ) " to get a pair of pstex / pstex_t files ) .
I ’ll discuss below some of the more important issues of generating PDF with TeX .
Some related information can be found in :
Use Type1 vector fonts for generating PDF files with TeX
TeX ( and LaTeX ) traditionally used raster - graphic fonts produced by Metafont for a specific device resolution .
Dvips originally produced PostScript files containing 300 or 600 dpi raster fonts , and so did the PDF files converted from that by ps2pdf or Acrobat Distiller .
PDF viewers do usually a rather bad job when displaying device - dependent “ Type3 ” raster fonts .
Texts in raster fonts are displayed slow on the screen and with no or suboptimal anti-alias filtering .
Also , the “ Type3 ” raster fonts inserted by dvips lack information about which character each glyph represents , which interferes badly with full - text search and copy&paste .
You can check whether the output of dvips contains any Type3 raster / bitmap fonts under Unix with the command
grep '% DVIPSBitmapFont : ' file.ps
This should produce no output if there are no bitmap fonts .
Instead of Type3 ( raster graphics ) fonts , make sure any Postscript file that you produce for conversion into PDF uses only resolution - independent Type1 vector fonts .
Fortunately , a consortium of AMS , SIAM , IBM , Springer , Elsevier , BlueSky Research , and Y&Y Inc. arranged to make commercial high - quality PostScript Type1 versions of both the Computer Modern fonts and AMS fonts for TeX freely available under the copyright of AMS .
Dvips has used these resolution - independent TeX fonts by default for a few years now .
If you still use some pre-2005 version of dvips , you may have to use special command - line options to get the desired Type1 fonts , such as
dvips - Ppdf - G0 ...
Or better upgrade to a more recent TeX distribution .
[ The - G0 was a workaround for an old bug in dvips that caused ligatures to disappear in some fonts , which also got fixed in more recent versions . ]
Make sure you configure the distiller to the “ Subset fonts below 100 % ” option .
This will ensure that only fonts for which 100 % of all characters are used in the document are included completely and the distiller will remove font data for all unused characters from your PDF file .
This will keep your PDF files small .
When you want to convert to PDF historic PostScript files that were produced with Computer Modern bitmap fonts , then try the pkfix tool to replace these fonts in the PostScript with their Type1 equivalents .
Set the information fields of the PDF file
In PDF files , you can store the title , authors , and keywords of a paper in special information fields .
This information can help search engines to locate and present your paper more accurately .
There are several ways to set this information :
You can manually add it using the Adobe Acrobat product .
You can add via dvips a special PostScript command that will instruct the distiller or ps2 pdf tool to set these fields correctly .
The direct way to do this is by adding somewhere near the beginning of a TeX or LaTeX document code like \special{ !
/ pdfmark where {pop} {userdict / pdfmark / cleartomark load put} ifelse [ / Author ( Markus G. Kuhn , Ross J. Anderson ) / Title ( Soft Tempest : hidden data transmission using electromagnetic emanations ) / Keywords ( compromising emanations , data security , eavesdropping ) / DOCINFO pdfmark} to store the author , title , and keywords in the PDF file automatically .
Under LaTeX , the hyperref macros ( see the hyperref manual ) , allow you to do the same in a slightly more convenient form via package options , as in \usepackage [ pdftitle= {Soft Tempest : Hidden Data Transmission Using Electromagnetic Emanations} , pdfauthor= {Markus G. Kuhn , Ross J. Anderson} , pdfkeywords ={compromising emanations , data security , eavesdropping} ] {hyperref} Warning : LLNCS style file version 2.14 ( 2004 -08 - 14 ) contained a bug that changes the figure / table caption font size slightly when hyperref is loaded , fixed in more recent LLNCS versions .
With pdftex , you can also use \pdfinfo{ / Author ( Markus G. Kuhn , Ross J. Anderson ) / Title ( Soft Tempest : Hidden Data Transmission Using Electromagnetic Emanations ) / Keywords ( compromising emanations , data security , eavesdropping ) }
Use the paper format of the printed version in the PDF file
PDF files look best on the screen if the specified paper size matches the one for which the layout was designed .
Therefore , use the actual physical paper size of the published document in the PDF file .
When a PDF file is printed , the page will always be centered , and if the Shrink oversizes pages to paper size or Expand small pages to paper size function is used it is also guaranteed to fit the output paper size .
For users of the LNCS style : the paper size is 152 mm × 235 mm and correct alignment of the output relative to the upper left corner can be achieved by instructing distiller to ps2pdf to use the CropBox parameters [ 92 112 523 778 ] .
British Standard BS 1413 defines a book page size of 156 mm × 234 mm called “ Metric royal octavo ” .
This is the best clue I have found so far on where the LNCS format might have come from .
Springer actually use in their own LNCS online PDFs the paper format 155 mm × 235 mm ( 439.37 pt × 666.142 pt ) , which seems the same size , just rounded differently .
There are several ways to achive this :
You can directly insert a special command into the DVI file right after \begin{document} : \ special{ ! / pdfmark where {pop} {userdict / pdfmark / cleartomark load put} ifelse [ / CropBox [ 92 112 523 778 ] / PAGES pdfmark} % LNCS page : 152x235 mm
This line causes dvips to insert a pdfmark instruction into the PostScript output , which will set in the distiller the page size correctly .
: If you use the hyperref macros in LaTeX , you can achieve the same more elegantly via the package options \usepackage [ pdfpagescrop={92 112 523 778},a4paper=false ] {hyperref} Warning :
The current LLNCS style file ( version 2.14 , 2004 - 08 - 14 ) still has a bug that changes the figure / table caption font size slightly when hyperref is loaded .
In pdftex , you can also use the command \pdfpagesattr{ / CropBox [ 92 112 523 778]} % LNCS page : 152x235 mm
Use appropriate graphics formats for figures
Choose appropriate formats for included graphics .
In particular :
Whenever possible , use resolution - independent vector graphic formats ( e.g. , EPS , WMF ) for diagrams and line drawings such as
block diagrams ;
flow charts ;
function plots ;
circuit diagrams ;
diagrams that include text labels .
Use pixel - based raster - graphic formats ( PNG , JPEG , TIFF , GIF ) only for figures in which the original source information has a fixed resolution , such as
screen shots ;
photos ;
scanned paper documents ;
computer - generated raster graphics .
Before considering lossy compression formats , such as JPEG and GIF , for presenting scientific data , make sure you understand exactly what information their encoders throw away .
In particular :
JPEG was only designed for storing photos that will be viewed unmodified by humans .
Avoid ( DCT or wavelet ) transform - based photo - compression algorithms , such as JPEG , for storing non-photographic or computer - generated material ( e.g. , screen shots ) .
These formats are not suitable for storing images that contain only a small number of distinct colours , large areas of identical color and distinct edges .
Avoid lossy compression formats such as JPEG if your image represents authentic scientific data that readers may want to inspect closely with image - processing functions ( zooming in , contrast enhancement , etc. ) .
Avoid GIF , unless you know that the image contains fewer than 256 different colors .
Warning : Normally , distiller and ps2pdf will apply the DCT - JPEG compression to any colour and grayscale raster image that they encounter in the input PostScript file .
In many scientific publications , especially those related to image processing and compression , this JPEG compression can introduce unacceptable artifacts that distort the meaning of the image .
You can avoid this by processing the output of pnmtops with my sed script nojpeg.sed , which adds a setdistillerparams command to the generated EPS file that deactivates JPEG compression in the distiller for this image only .
To use nojpeg.sed in the Makefile described in the next section , simply use the replacement macro
PNMTOPS =pnmtops - rle - noturn - nosetpage | sed -f nojpeg.sed
Use good software engineering for the document sources
Ensure that your document preparation becomes a traceable and repeatable process , just as you should have learned to do with software ( think ISO 9000 ) .
Use a revision control system like Subversion ( manual ) or RCS in order to keep track of old revisions and prepublications .
Make sure that you can always regenerate the source of any version of your paper that you ever have given away .
Document - preparation systems that use plain - text document formats , such as LaTeX , are particularly easy to use with version - control software .
You may find that the diff and merge functions work best if you start a new line after each sentence .
If you work on a paper with coauthors , then cooperate via the revision control system and not by sending around new revisions via email .
This avoids confusions and makes sure no changes are accidentally lost .
If you use other TeX macro packages such as llncs.cls in your document , always add the version number and release date as a comment to where you include the macros .
Keep all revisions of macro packages that you use in a revision control database as well .
To include the file name and the RCS revision of your current draft on every printout , use the rcs.sty or rcsinfo.sty package , which extracts the relevant information from the $ Id : ...$ strings that version - control tools can update automatically .
or package , which extracts the relevant information from the $ Id : ...$ strings that version - control tools can update automatically .
Write a Makefile .
If you used other software to generate embedded postscript files that you use in your TeX file ( for instance fig2dev , gnuplot , etc. ) , then add rules for how this software is called to your Makefile .
Your Makefile should be able to regenerate automatically all intermediate files from the earliest processing step involved .
A typical Makefile for a paper with various embedded images will contain production rules such as : .DELETE_ON_ERROR : %.pdf %.aux %.idx : %.tex pdflatex $ < while grep ' Rerun to get ' $ *. log ; do pdflatex $< ; done %.ind : %.idx makeindex $* %.bbl : %.aux bibtex $* %. pdftex %.pdftex_t : %.fig fig2dev - L pdftex_t -p $ *. pdftex $< $*. pdftex_t fig2dev - L pdftex $< $*. pdftex all : clean : rm -f *~ *.log *.bak *.aux *.toc *.blg *.bbl *. pdftex *. pdftex_t
If you include bitmap images , then use the JPEG format only for photos from a camera or scanner .
For line drawings or computer - generated plots never use JPEG .
For the latter , preferably use a vector format such as PDF or EPS , or where this is not practical ( e.g. , computer - made screenshots ) , use the lossless PNG format instead .
Archive the source plus PDF version of your paper in a long - term format .
Standards such as tar , gzip , ISO 9660 , PDF , TeX , and CD - R are today well documented and so widely deployed that people will most likely still be able to read them without major problems in 100 years from now .
Eventually write your archive onto a CD - R , preferably the silver or gold looking ones using the phthalocyanine dye , which should keep the data intact for many decades , if not centuries .
Remember that magnetic media lasts hardly longer than 5 – 10 years .
Ensure that your institution has a long - term archive concept for the source and final formatted version of all publications .
Use filenames that are meaningful in a broader context
It is a good idea to include an indication of where the paper is published ( abbreviation for the conference or journal ) and a most significant title word in the filename .
For instance ih98 - tempest.tex is much more useful then just paper.tex .
Plan your filenames such that you and all your local colleagues can have them nicely together in a single public directory .
No filename should be longer than 25 characters ; preferably keep them at less than 15 characters .
Use only lowercase US - ASCII letters , digits , hyphens , and a dot ( only for the extension ) .
If you publish a HTML version of your paper , then please check not only whether it displays nicely with your current browser , but also send it through an SGML parser that grammatically validates your HTML syntax against the HTML 4.01 document type definition .
A validation service is available for instance from W3C , or you can easily install your own using nsgmls .
Also perform a link check from time to time , as URLs are unfortunately not very stable .
Typographic conventions
Professional typesetting works slightly differently from using typewriters or ASCII email .
Make sure that you are well familiar with these conventions .
Lamport ’s LaTeX User ’s Guide provides a very brief introduction is section 2.2.1 .
In particular , make sure you are aware of
how to use directional quotation marks ;
the differences in shape and use of hyphen ( - ) , minus ( − ) , en-dash ( – ) and em- dash ( — ) ;
the fact that the default font used by TeX ’s math mode was designed only for use with single - letter variables and must not be used for writing words or multi-letter abbreviations ;
When using BibTeX , understand that it tries to change the capitalization of titles to lowercase unless a word is protected by surrounding {} .
Therefore , protect all proper nouns ( names ) and abbreviations in this way in your BibTeX file .
Here are some more typographic conventions that you may want to consider :
Capitalization of headlines .
In the United States , it is a common practice to capitalize the first letter of more words in headlines and titles than in normal sentences .
The style guides and author ’s instructions of U.S. publishers , such as the IEEE , require this .
On the other hand , in Britain , in many other English - speaking countries , and in many international organizations , professional typographers use in headlines exactly the same capitalization rules as in normal sentences , namely only the first word and proper nouns or abbreviations are capitalized .
I personally strongly prefer the British convention .
It preserves more information ( which word is a name ) and causes far fewer problems with bibliographic databases ( like BibTeX ) , where the unnecessary U.S. - style capitalization has to be removed for most bibliographic - reference styles .
My advice is to follow the requirements of publishers , but if there are none , do not perform any unnecessary capitalization in titles .
In any case , always remain consistent within a single document .

Quantities and units .
There are well - established rules for typesetting units of measurements , which are described , for example , in NIST SP 811 and ISO 31 - 0 .
In particular : numbers and unit symbols are separated by a no - break space ; unit symbols are never written in italics , to distinguish them from variables for physical quantities , which are in italics ; indices of variables are only written in italics if they represent another variable , but not if they are just an abbreviation of a word ; symbols for SI units have well - defined capitalization rules ( prefix symbols are uppercase from mega upwards and lowercase from kilo downwards , unit symbols start with an uppercase letter only if the unit was named after a person ) .
Bad example : v max = 120 Kph Good example : v max = 120 km/h
There are well - established rules for typesetting units of measurements , which are described , for example , in NIST SP 811 and ISO 31 - 0 .

A recent study suggests marijuana is the top US cash crop
The vehicle was unlocked and the engine warm , but no - one was in the cab .
The patrolman found plastic - wrapped bundles of the drug in the back of the rental vehicle near Los Angeles after smelling marijuana , AP said .
A spokesman said there were " no suspects and no real leads " .
Local authorities plan to destroy the drug .
" Somebody 's going be in some major trouble for walking away and leaving that quantity sitting on the side of the freeway , " said Sgt Telfinues Preszler Jnr of the California Highway Patrol .
" I'm glad I 'm not him . "
He suggested the engine might have overheated , causing the vehicle to be abandoned along with three tons of marijuana on a slip road in the city of Ontario late on Wednesday .
The drug has been turned over to the San Bernardino County Sheriff 's Department , which will seek a court order to destroy it , a spokeswoman said .
A recent report estimates that despite intensive eradication plans , $ 35 bn worth of the marijuana a year is produced in the US , making it the country 's top cash crop .

The achievement is notable , since they 've managed to build a whole 16 qubit computer that actually does some simple computations , even if it 's far less powerful than even the most basic of home computers .
Qubits are quantum bits that can be in an " on , " " off " or " both " state due to fuzzy physics at the atomic level , and up until now the best anyone had done was get three qubits together for computing .
This 16 - bit version can solve Sudoku , create a complicated seating plan and search for molecular structures , but quantum computers will need to be in the range of thousands of qubits to be able to solve puzzles -- such as encryption -- that current computers cannot .
D- Wave is planning to have a 1,000 qubit version ready by the end of next year , but scientists in the field are skeptical .
The adiabatic method used by D - Wave , which cools electronic circuits into a superconducting state , with the resulting qubits being slowly varied in a magnetic field , might not be able to keep its speed when on that large of a scale .
" It probably wo n't work but it 's not quixotic , " says Seth Lloyd of MIT .
" If it works then they can solve really hard problems and they 'll be very much in demand , " he says .
But it 's a long shot : " It 's certainly not the kind of company I 'd invest my money in . "
To raise awareness , D - Wave will be opening the computer up to computational problems over the internet after the results of the project are peer - reviewed .

German troops are based in a relatively quiet part of Afghanistan
At least 14 people were injured in the blast which happened when the troops were conducting a foot patrol in Kunduz city , in the province of the same name .
An Afghan interpreter working with the troops was among those killed , and two Germans were among the injured .
About 3,000 German troops are based in northern Afghanistan as part of the Nato forces in the country .
Witnesses say a suicide bomber on foot targeted the German patrol as they walked through a shopping district in the city .
" Suddenly we heard a big sound .
We were frightened , " Aziz , a shopkeeper , was quoted by Reuters as saying .
" We saw very thick smoke and people rushing to escape . "
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said : " These perfidious murders fill us all with disgust and horror . "
She expressed her " deepest sympathies " to the relatives of the German and Afghan victims , but said such incidents would not deter Germany from its reconstruction mission .
US troops hurt
On 16 April , a Taleban suicide bomber attacked a group of policemen doing morning exercises in Kunduz , killing nine and injuring 25 .
In a separate incident , four US troops were reportedly injured when their vehicle rolled down a steep slope after a failed suicide car bomb attack in Khost , in the south - east of the country .
A suicide bomber had driven into their convoy , but his explosives failed to go off , the BBC's Alastair Leithead in Kabul said .
Lengthy gun battle
And in the eastern province of Paktia , near the Pakistan border , coalition troops and Afghan security forces clashed with Taleban militants late on Friday in a gun battle which lasted several hours .
Afghan army officials said more than 60 insurgents were killed in the fighting , though this has not been verified .
No coalition or government forces were reported injured .
Paktia province has been the scene of frequent violence involving the Taleban , the radical Islamist group toppled from power after the US - led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 .
The Taleban are threatening to increase their attacks following the killing of their top military commander Mullah Dadullah a week ago .
Dadullah was killed in an operation by the US - led coalition , supported by Isaf , in Helmand province .
Dadullah 's name had been linked with the beheading of suspected spies , controlling the guerrilla war in Helmand province , dispatching suicide bombers and the kidnapping of Westerners .
So far , what exactly is surging in Iraq ?
U.S. casualties , which are at a post- invasion high : According to an Associated Press analysis , more American troops were " killed in combat in Iraq over the past four months -- at least 334 through Jan. 31 -- than in any comparable stretch since the war began " ; and February , with 34 American deaths in its first nine days , is exceeding this pace .
These loses are largely due to roadside bombs ( IEDs ) and to the fact that U.S. troops are now engaged in almost continuous urban warfare .
Before the invasion of Iraq , the possibility of fighting an urban war in the Iraqi capital 's streets and alleys was the American high command 's personal nightmare .
Now , it 's their reality -- and the President 's surge plan can only make it more nightmarish .
Downings of U.S. helicopters , six in less than three weeks :
With road travel , even in convoys , now so dangerous , thanks to IEDs , the helicopter has been a transport workhorse for the U.S. military in Iraq .
The sudden surge in downed helicopters raises the specter of new tactics by the insurgents as well as the possibility that they have new , advanced missiles in their hands .
It raises a warning flag of the first order .
Let 's not forget that the beginning of the end of the Russian occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s came when CIA - supplied Stinger missiles began to take down Russian helicopters in significant numbers .
Iraqi and American no -shows :
The first Iraqi Army units promised by Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki for the beginning of the February surge in the capital have shown up .
But as with everything involving that Green Zone government and Iraqi forces generally , there is a catch :
The initial Iraqi brigades are evidently at only 55 - 65 % troop strength .
Undoubtedly , these no -shows are Kurds and Shiites who did n't want to leave their home areas to fight in Baghdad .
In addition , according to McClatchy 's Tom Lasseter , who went out on patrol with Iraqi forces in Baghdad recently , despite the $ 15.4 billion the American military has so far poured into " standing them up , " they are militia - infiltrated , incompetent , and exceedingly corrupt .
" Two weeks with American units that patrolled with Iraqi forces in west and east Baghdad found , " he wrote , " that Iraqi officers sold new uniforms meant for their troops , and that their soldiers wore plastic shower sandals while manning checkpoints , abused prisoners and solicited bribes to free suspects they 'd captured . "
Nor have most American troops designated to surge into Baghdad arrived yet .
Louise Roug of the Los Angeles Times estimates that only 20 % of the promised surge forces , Iraqi and American -- about 5,000 troops in all -- have even made it to the capital .
( The fifth and final American brigade in this plan is n't scheduled to arrive until May ! )
In the meantime , senior American diplomats , voting with their analytic feet , are resisting taking posts in Iraq , assignments which , unlike military personnel , they are not obliged to accept .
( They are evidently doing so on the same basic what - the - hell - am - I - going - there - for principle as the Kurdish and Shiite troops . )
Iraqi refugees :
One out of every seven Iraqis has by now " fled his or her home or sought refuge abroad , " reports the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) .
" Every day , " according to McClatchy 's Warren Strobel , " violence displaces an estimated 1,300 more Iraqis in the country ; every month , at least 40,000 . "
According to UN officials , in surging Iraq , things are only expected to worsen .
" The UNHCR projects that the number of internally displaced in Iraq could grow to about 2.7 million by year 's end . "
An in - depth assessment conducted by the International Medical Corps , a humanitarian organization , suggests that " over one million residents of Baghdad could be driven from their homes in the next six months if Iraq 's sectarian violence continues at its current level . "
That would be a surge indeed .
The devastation of Sunni neighborhoods in Baghdad : Some of these are being turned into ghost areas , as Ilana Ozernoy and Ali Hamdani indicate in a limited survey of one street in a Sunni area of the capital that appeared recently in the Atlantic .
Other accounts seem to verify this .
For instance , New York Times reporter Damien Cave , in a piece on how the vast Shiite slum of Sadr City is beginning to thrive under the protection of Moqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army and with reconstruction money from the Maliki government , comments in passing that , in contrast , " middle - class Sunni enclaves are withering into abandoned ghettos , starved of government services . "
Massive publicity about the details of the slow - to - happen surge operation :
These have been offered copiously by the supposedly security - conscious Bush administration , giving Sunnis and Shiites opportunity to prepare both defenses and evasions .
It has meant , according to early American military assessments , that in the first search operations in key neighborhoods , they are finding little or nothing .
( " ' I do n't know if it 's bad information , bad intelligence , of if they knew we were coming and left , ' said Capt .
Isaac Torres of the Army 's 3rd Brigade Stryker Combat Team .
' They were all dry holes . ' " )
Oh , as for the surge plan itself , Michael Schwartz , whose Tomdispatch pieces on U.S. and Iraqi strategies and tactics in the complex struggle engulfing that country , have regularly been significantly ahead of the mainstream analytic curve , points out that the President 's new surge plan has already been tested in the last few weeks and found to be most successful -- in further depopulating Baghdad neighborhoods as well as creating more destruction , greater sectarian violence , and new levels of animosity .
His is a devastating piece on another bit of Bush administration planning that takes us right through the " gates of hell . "
Tom
In his Iraq policy address on January 10 , President Bush promised three new initiatives : a " surge " of American troops accompanied by a new " clear , hold , and build " strategy in Sunni insurgent strongholds ; an offensive against Shia militias , particularly the Sadrist Mahdi Army which " U.S. military officials now identify as the greatest security threat in Iraq " ; and forceful action to prevent Iran from further increasing its influence in Iraq and the Middle East .
Events in the last few weeks make it clear that all three prongs of this strategy are being enacted , even while the Congress is engaged in a prolonged debate over its ( non-binding ) opposition to the " surge " part of the new regional plan .
The " surge " strategy was actually initiated one day before the speech was even given -- in an offensive on Baghdad 's Haifa Street that briefly dominated the headlines .
The new initiative aimed at Shia militias appears to have begun with a battle outside of Najaf in which about 200 members of the Al - Hawatim and al - Khazali tribes were killed by American and Iraqi forces -- apparently because the tribal militias had been involved in a growing ( if under - reported ) " anti-U.S. and anti-Baghdad " guerrilla war that " has been spreading like wildfire " in the Shia south .
And the new aggressiveness towards Iran is now being played out not only in Iraq , but in the increasingly credible threats of an American or Israeli , or combined American and Israeli , air assault on Iran itself .
We may have to wait weeks , or even months , to evaluate the consequences of American actions against those Shia militias and Iran .
But the Haifa Street offensive , now almost a month old , already offers us a vivid portrait of the horrific consequences that are the likely result of the Sunni insurgent part of the President 's " surge " strategy .
Haifa Street as an Enemy Stronghold
Haifa Street , a moderately prosperous two - mile - long avenue just outside the American - controlled Green Zone in Baghdad , has been a center of Sunni resistance since early in the war .
Despite the imagery of constant violence associated with the neighborhood in the media , it has , like most insurgent areas , largely been quiet -- except when American troops attempted to pacify it .
Soon after the fall of Baghdad , anti-American forces became the military and political leadership in the Haifa Street neighborhood , setting up local militias to combat a wave of criminal violence that swept through the capital after the Americans dismantled the Iraqi military and police .
By 2004 , the insurgents were the local government in the area , institutionalizing their form of Sunni fundamentalism but at that early date still tolerating the presence of a Shia minority , who continued to live peacefully among the Sunni majority .
Sustained violence only occurred when American patrols entered the area .
Then snipers , IEDs , and gun battles would -- often successfully -- be brought into play to divert the Americans from their goal of arresting or killing suspected insurgents .
The ferocity of the resistance led American soldiers to dub the area " Death Street . "
After one abortive attempt at conquering the neighborhood , the number of U.S. patrols dwindled as Haifa Street became one of many virtual " no - go " areas in the capital ( not to speak of the country ) , " off - limits for American and even Iraqi soldiers . "
In November 2004 , an IED exploded near one of those occasional American patrols , demolishing a Humvee and triggering a cascading set of events that culminated in an American helicopter shooting into a crowd and killing Mazen Tomeizi , a Palestinian reporter for the al Arabiya satellite news network of Dubai .
Because Tomeizi was filming his follow - up to the earlier incident when he was shot , his death became one of the most horrific , widely viewed images of the war -- at least in the Middle East -- with his blood splattering on the camera as he cried , " I 'm going to die , I 'm going to die . "
This incident , apparently , convinced the American military command to make another attempt to pacify Haifa Street .
Under the headline , " A Violent Street Finds Calm , " Christian Science Monitor reporter Scott Peterson described how the Americans took control of the neighborhood in a six - month military offensive , involving " rooftop snipers " and other " tough measures that reportedly included abuse of detainees . "
This running battle , which began in January 2005 , qualifies as the most violent period in recent Haifa Street history -- until the latest offensive .
But in American reportage , the emphasis was on the pacification and quiescence achieved , once -- by the late spring of 2005 -- the Americans had suppressed the active resistance .
Sprinkled in with the positive stories of grateful residents welcoming the end of the fighting were telltale signs of an unpopular military occupation :
Some residents would " glower " when American troops passed by ; " tensions [ were ] a little higher " whenever American troops entered a street ; and graffiti proclaiming , " Long Live the Mujahideen , " were quickly restored after American soldiers tried to obliterate them .
Nevertheless , in June of 2005 , ABC reporter Nick Watt declared that " Death Street is indeed a thing of the past . "
That battle , now two years past , was a perfect example of how the new " clear , hold , and build " strategy that President Bush announced in his recent speech is supposed to work .
An American clearing - and - holding operation was to be followed by a transfer of power to Iraqi military units , supposedly already " stood up " through intensive American training and advising .
This particular turn - over operation was hailed at the time by occupation authorities as " a high - profile example of how Iraqi National Guard troops -- trained , supported , and let loose by US advisers -- can claw back territory from insurgents . "
It was heralded as a giant step forward , " a template for spreading government control across Iraq and undercutting the insurgency . "
The template , however , ultimately collapsed because the Haifa Street guerrillas did what guerillas normally do :
They melted into the population and awaited new opportunities to attack the occupation .
Just before the declarations of success were issued , they initiated their own " surge of violence " before again melting into the neighborhood .
And even at the moment when ABC reporter Watt was offering an obituary to " Death Street , " American troops and their Iraqi protégés were conducting dozens of weekly patrols , breaking into homes in the Haifa Street neighborhood to arrest or kill suspected insurgents .
These patrols , together with a massive increase in unemployment , the precipitous deterioration of public services , and economic shocks generated by the removal of government food and fuel subsidies only led to increased support for , as well as membership in , the resistance .
This ever - growing resistance insured that the " build " part of " clear , hold , and build " remained unbuilt .
In February 2006 , the Americans finally left without securing the neighborhood , probably because the troops were needed for a new Baghdad - wide offensive , which began at about that time .
Soon after , the guerrillas resurfaced and expelled the Iraqi army , thus putting an end to all military patrols , home invasions , arrests , and detentions as well as the sporadic fighting they had generated .
Haifa
Street once again became a quiescent enemy enclave , and -- with the rise of sectarian violence -- was suspected of " harboring terrorists " of an anti-Shiite variety .
As New York Times reporter Marc Santora put it :
" For the past two years , [ Haifa Street ] has been relatively quiet , but in recent months , as the sectarian fighting has intensified , Iraqi and American military officials suspected it was being used as a base of operations for insurgents concentrating on the Shiite civilian population and American forces . "
The Americans Re-enter , Bringing Sectarian Violence with Them
Haifa Street 's calm was sustained even while ferocious sectarian violence erupted elsewhere in the capital .
Ethnic cleansing , so prevalent in other parts of the city , had not yet invaded the neighborhood and most of the Shia members of the community remained in their homes .
When adjoining Shia neighborhoods also calmed down , an uneasy but genuine peace settled over the area .
The foundation of this truce was no mystery : Haifa Street militia members , freed from defensive fights against the American military and strengthened by their victory over the Iraqi military , were mobilized to protect and defend the community against Shia death squads .
In fact , all around Baghdad militias have become a critical protection for Sunnis .
As Asia Times commentator Mahan Abedin put it , " The residents widely welcome the presence of the guerrillas as vital protection against Shi'ite paramilitaries ( often operating as Iraqi security forces ) . "
The work of the local mujaheddin was complemented by the work of Moqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi 's army in neighboring Shia communities .
Since al - Qaeda in Mesopotamia began its car - bombing campaign against Shia civilians in late 2004 , the Mahdis had been patrolling the vast Shiite slum of Sadr city , and -- for the most part -- successfully preventing such suicide bombings .
As the violence spread in Baghdad , the Mahdis also spread , and their arrival in the Shia neighborhoods around Haifa Street insured mutual deterrence on both sides of the sectarian divide .
Until the Americans arrived .
In early January , as part of President Bush 's new strategy of attacking Shia militias , American troops entered a border area near Haifa Street and arrested a " senior member " of the Mahdi Army , apparently the local commander in that part of the city .
This attack seems to have disrupted the Mahdis ' protective patrols and left Shia communities in the area increasingly vulnerable to terrorist attack .
Quoting an American military official , New York Times journalist Santora reported :
" The arrest , the official said , created an opening for Sunni insurgents , and they began aggressively singling out Shiites who had relocated south from the neighborhood of Kadhimiya , the official said . "
These attacks may or may not have originated in the Haifa Street neighborhood , but when 27 Shia bodies were dumped there on January 6 , this became the occasion for the first American offensive in Bush 's not - quite - yet - announced " surge . "
As U.S. military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Scott Bleichwehl explained , " It 's an area that needed to be brought back under Iraqi security control . "
Ali al - Dabaggh , a spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , was blunter : " This area must be cleansed , " he said .
Haifa Street residents believed al - Dabaggh , particularly after the American commanders mentioned the 2005 battle of Tal Afar as the exemplar of their new strategy .
In Tal Afar , a city of about 300,000 near the Syrian border , the entire population was moved out as part of the pacification process .
Iraqi military forces were sent in to Haifa Street first , but within a couple of days , they had been repulsed .
This battle , and the growing sectarian violence in bordering areas , shattered the fragile foundation of sectarian peace within Haifa Street , and Shia residents soon began receiving threats that they would be killed " if they did not leave immediately . "
Before dawn on January 9 , the Americans and Iraqis attacked in force , backed by helicopters and jets .
Washington Post reporters Sudarsan Raghavan and Joshua Partlow offered this description of the battle , quoting Major Jesse Pearson and Sergeant Israel Schaeffer :
" In the pre-dawn darkness , the joint forces took control of the buildings surrounding Tallil Square , a key target of the operation .
" ' We showed up in their living room for breakfast , ' Pearson said .
" About 7 a.m. , the trouble began .
' As soon as the sun came up , the insurgents began shooting , ' he said .
" ' We started taking it from all sides , ' Schaeffer recalled .
" From rooftops and doorways , the gunmen fired AK - 47 assault rifles and machine guns .
Snipers also were targeting the U.S. and Iraqi soldiers .
U.S. soldiers started firing back with 50 - caliber machine guns mounted on their Stryker armored vehicles .
They used TOW missiles and Mark - 19 grenade launchers .
The F - 15 fighter jets strafed rooftops with cannons , while the Apaches fired Hellfire missiles . "
After 11 hours of death and devastation , the Americans prevailed and 1,000 American and Iraqi troops began house - to - house searches , arresting and killing suspected insurgents .
The Denouement
One week later , McClatchy News reporters Nancy Youssef and Zaineb Obeid visited Haifa Street to survey the results of the first offensive action in the President 's new strategy .
Partly what they found was a depressingly familiar scene : massive destruction , police state conditions , widespread suffering , and ongoing fighting .
But partly they found something new : Even as the threatened ethnic cleansing of Shias in the neighborhood finally appeared to be completed , there was now a contrary campaign -- mounted by the mainly Shiite Iraqi Army with the support of the US military -- to expel the Sunni majority :
" A 44 - year - old Haifa Street resident , who asked to be identified only as Abu Mohammed for security reasons , said that only three or four [ Sunni ] families of an estimated 60 families remained on his block .
He said no vehicles were allowed to drive through the area and that there was no electricity , kerosene or running water .
[ U.S. ]
Snipers have taken positions on the rooftops .
" ' They are shooting randomly , ' he said .
' Today , they shot Raghad Marwan , a 28 - year - old young woman who was trying to get food .
She got a bullet in her shoulder , and now we do n't know how to get her to the hospital . '
" He said several families were evacuating the neighborhood : ' I can see the families with their children walking in the narrow streets of the neighborhood taking nothing but small bags . '
" ' The new security plan has given militias permission to go into our houses and apartments and kill people , ' Abu Mohammed said .
' This plan targets Sunnis and forces them to leave their homes .
And they are . ' "
The next day , CBS News reporter Lara Logan provided horrifying visual evidence of conditions on Haifa Street , in a report that only appeared on the CBS website .
It showed demolished buildings , deserted neighborhoods , and the results of sectarian torture on both sides .
It concluded with a resident who blamed the Americans for the plight of his community :
" They told us they would bring democracy .
They promised life would be better than it was under Saddam .
But they brought us nothing but death and killing .
They brought mass destruction to Baghdad . "
According to the McClatchy reporters , " A U.S. military spokesman said he had no reason to believe Haifa Street residents ' accounts . "
U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad told a press conference , '' I am encouraged by what I have seen . "
One week later , the battle for Haifa Street continued .
More and more residents were fleeing the area , trying to escape American airstrikes , avoid the crossfire between the Americans and the insurgents , or elude the death threats from either side of the sectarian divide .
Reflecting on the battle for a neighborhood that " the United States has now fought to regain from a mysterious enemy at least three times in the past two years , " Sgt. First Class Marc Biletski told New York Times reporters Damien Cave and James Glanz , " This place is a failure .
Every time we come here , we have to come back . "
In the meantime , the departing Sunni population viewed the still unfinished battle as the latest episode in American sponsorship of ethnic cleansing .
During the first day of fighting , Harith al - Dari , the leader of the Association of Muslim Scholars ( AMS ) , the political arm of the Sunni resistance , called it , " a bloody sectarian massacre . "
Nine days later , an AMS spokesman read the names of 12 men who had been killed in the battle on al - Jazeera Television and then commented :
" All of their guilt was that they defended their neighbourhood The American president said in 2003 , ' Mission accomplished . '
Now in 2007 he uses jetfighters a few meters from the Green Zone . "
The final word for the present was perhaps spoken by another inhabitant of the area , commenting on the ongoing assassination of neighborhood residents by the Iraqi military and police : " The Americans are doing nothing , as if they are backing the militias .
This military siege is killing us ...
If this plan continues for one more week , I do n't think you will find one family left on Haifa Street . "
The Early Returns Are Not Encouraging
Even before the Americans arrived on Haifa Street in January as the vanguard of the new Bush strategy to pacify Baghdad , previous experience strongly suggested that the effort was doomed to failure .
A month later , that expectation has certainly been fulfilled .
Unfortunately , there are some genuinely new , grim elements to the battle for Haifa Street ; elements that threaten to make the coming Baghdad - wide " surge " dramatically more damaging than its predecessors .
To begin with , there is the far greater application of American airpower ; bombing runs and high caliber assaults from helicopter gunships have dramatically increased the death and destructiveness of the still ongoing battle , rendering much of Haifa Street an unlivable graveyard .
Added to this is the systematic and largely successful effort of the Sunni jihadists to expel the Shia minority from the area , an effort triggered by the initial American incursions .
And then , overlaid on top of the cleansing of the Shia minority , came the contrary cleansing of the Sunni majority ; engineered by the Iraqi military that arrived in the neighborhood with the Americans , and conducted their own purge with the support or acquiescence of the U.S. military .
The Haifa Street battle sadly shows that Bush 's new strategy will measurably increase the violence in Baghdad above already intolerable levels .
With more troops at their disposal , American generals will try to pacify many more neighborhoods like Haifa Street and cities like Tal Afar that need " to be brought back under Iraqi security control . "
And when they do this , they will bring the same mix of horror that they brought to Haifa Street , including brutal air power , house - to - house searches and fighting , sectarian violence , massive dislocation , and ethnic cleansing .
Like the other campaigns initiated by the U.S. occupation of Iraq , this new strategy will make things measurably worse .

YOU can say what you want against American politics .
You can call it corrupt , vulgar , interminable , and boringly limited to two behemoth parties .
But you cannot accuse it of lacking in drama .
The mid-term elections are still a month away , but some of the most intriguing action is taking place in the race for the presidency .
Mitt Romney , the governor of Massachusetts , is making a concerted bid to seize the mantle as the leader of “ the Republican wing of the Republican Party ” .
Mr Romney is a scarily perfect presidential candidate .
He has handsome looks — a mixture of Ronald Reagan and JFK , according to fans — and fearsome intelligence .
He graduated from both Harvard Law School , cum laude , and Harvard Business School in the top 5 % of his class .
He is a Republican governor of liberal Taxachusetts , a sprig of a powerful mid-western political dynasty , and is much admired as a businessman .
But Mitt has one big problem : Mormonism .
Hence one of the liveliest debates on the right : can a Mormon win the presidency ?
Two years before a presidential election might seem a bit soon for such questions .
But this is the age of the “ permanent campaign ” .
And the Republicans have a habit of anointing their champion as early as possible : George Bush had the nomination locked up by the late 1990s .
John McCain has made a good job of turning himself into the party 's heir presumptive .
But now Mr Romney is mounting a powerful assault from the right .
On September 22nd he delighted 1,800 “ values voters ” gathered in Washington , DC , with a barn - storming defence of traditional marriage and patriotism .
He has vocally defended Mr Bush 's policies on the interrogation of suspected terrorists , and suggested that the authorities should spend more time monitoring mosques .
For a growing number of conservatives he is the answer to their prayers : a man who can not only derail the McCain Express but also hold the White House in 2008 .
Mr Romney 's emergence as a conservative champion owes something to luck .
His two biggest rivals on the right have imploded : Bill Frist because of his lacklustre performance as Senate majority leader , George Allen because of his gaffe - ridden Senate campaign .
But it owes more to years of investment .
Mr Romney has not only fought harder than any other governor on “ social issues ” , particularly gay marriage .
He has done so in the heart of enemy territory .
Mr Romney won the governorship of a state where only 13 % of the voters are registered Republicans , and where the congressional delegation is 100 % Democratic .
And he succeeded in working with a legislature where 87 % of the members represent the other party .
When he was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2002 , he found a $ 3 billion budget deficit ; two years later he was running a surplus of more than $ 700m .
His hallmark before his recent fire - breathing reincarnation was pragmatism and competence .
He founded Bain Capital , one of the country 's most successful venture - capital companies .
He was at the heart of two dramatic turnarounds , first of Bain & Co ( which was on the verge of going under when he was brought in as CEO ) and then of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City ( which threatened to collapse under the weight of bribery scandals and $ 400 m - worth of debt ) .
As governor of Massachusetts , he produced an eye - catching health - care reform that tries to use market mechanisms to solve the most pressing problem , lack of coverage for the uninsured .
Yet Mr Romney is a devoted Mormon — a former bishop , no less — at a time when religion is playing a growing role in American politics .
Opinion polls suggest that anti-Mormon feeling is one of the most enduring religious prejudices in America .
An LATimes / Bloomberg poll in June found that 37 % of Americans would not vote for a Mormon presidential candidate ; other polls put the figure at 17 % .
Anti-Mormon feeling is particularly strong among Bible - believing Christians , a vital part of the Republican base .
Many evangelicals regard Mormonism as nothing more than a cult : and a cult , moreover , that is based not only on a false theology but also on a willingness to tamper with the inerrant word of God that is the Bible .
Looking past Mormonism
So will the whiz - kid governor be doomed by the Book of Mormon ?
Not necessarily .
That 37 % is certainly not an encouraging figure .
But back in 1960 35 % of people told pollsters that they would have qualms about voting for a Catholic , and in that year a Catholic reached the White House .
Today , 21 % of people say they would have qualms about voting for an evangelical ; time may tell differently .
For most voters , religion is just one factor among many that they consider : there is a difference between rejecting a generic Mormon and rejecting a smooth operator with a plan for universal health insurance .
As for evangelical Christians , they can be a remarkably pragmatic bunch .
They have spent the past few decades building alliances with “ people of faith ” whom they once regarded as spawn of the devil .
And they know a winner when they see one : they happily forgave Reagan his divorce and eccentric theological views .
In an ideal world they might prefer a more orthodox man of faith .
But if it comes to a choice between Mr Romney and a maverick like Mr McCain or an avowed social liberal like Rudy Giuliani , they may be willing to swallow the Book of Mormon .
Mr Romney 's opponents may well find other weaknesses to exploit .
He is a somewhat bloodless candidate , a conservative of the head rather than the heart , and approaches presidential politics rather like a Harvard Business School case study .
First , prove that he can run a state ; then lock up the conservative base ; then pivot back to the centre .
But for the moment at least it seems that conservative Republicans have found their man for 2008 .

Asked to reflect on the recent backlash against Thomas Edison 's pioneering " invention " , his great - great - grand nephew strikes a positive note : " It 's served us well for over 100 years " , says Robert KL Wheeler .
But as the inverted commas suggest , this is not the first time the humble light bulb has been fought over .
Its very inception is a long - standing point of dispute among historians and engineers , with many , especially on this side of the Atlantic , crediting it to a Brit - Sir Joseph Swan .
Judging by Chancellor Gordon Brown 's pronouncement this week to phase out these energy - sapping bulbs within four years , the debate seems destined to outlive the invention itself .
Australia and California have already announced plans for a ban .
Yet in discarding the unassuming old light bulb , it would be reckless to overlook its impact .
For a spurned piece of " obsolete " technology , it still shifts by the truck load - some 200 million a year are sold in the UK .
It 's hard to think of another electrical component that is more affordable , ubiquitous and disposable ; its influence more profound , than the familiar incandescent tungsten filament light bulb .
Let there be light
Sure , it 's about as environmentally sound as a Humvee with an oil leak , but then the bulb that millions of us flick on and off several times a day without so much as a second thought , is largely unchanged from the one that Edison patented 127 years ago .
HOW THE LIGHT BULB WORKS Bulb filled with inert gas Current heats filament to very high temperature Filament becomes excited , releasing thermally equilibrated photons in the process
" The light bulb grew up with the electricity supply , " he says , noting that in the 1880s , just after the bulb was invented , there were only a few , isolated power stations in Britain .
" It gave a purpose to electricity .
It was what brought it along . "
Artificial light pre-dates Swan and Edison 's eureka moments .
Candle light , oil lamps and , by the 1820s , gas lighting helped extend the day beyond the setting sun .
But these were dirty , messy and smelly ways of illuminating a room , and , before gas , the light itself would be little more than a dull glow .
By the mid-19th Century , the light bulb had been solved in theory - all that was lacking was the technology to make it work .
Several inventors were on the case but it was Sir Joseph Swan who figured out how to create a vacuum in the bulb - thereby starving the filament of oxygen so it would glow slowly , rather than burn out in a flash .
Edison originals :
Two bulbs up for auction in 2006
A glance at the diagram filed with his initial patent in 1880 ( see below ) shows how little Edison 's light bulb has changed .
After thousands of years of man living by the natural rhythms of the sun , suddenly a room could be lit up with the flick of a switch .
But with few houses actually wired up , the electricity industry used lighting to sell its benefits .
" Electricity sold itself on its cleanliness and simplicity , and also associated itself with modernity , " says Frank James , professor of history at the Royal Institution .
At the same time , engineers were busy refining the light bulb , discovering tungsten glowed brightest .
The final refinement came in 1934 , with the inter - twining of two filaments to make a brighter lamp and a longer - lasting filament , says Mr Peterson .
" When you buy a light bulb today , you are buying precisely 70 - year - old technology , " he says .
Cover of darkness
At about the same time , the National Grid came online and by the end of the 1930s , half the households in Britain had electricity .
Twenty years later , it was nearing 100 % .
When you buy a light bulb today , you are buying 70 - year - old technology
Ian Peterson
" It has transformed nearly a half of every day in terms of how we divide our time , " says Prof Ekirch , author of At Day 's Close : A History of Night - time .
Before artificial light , night time was a time of " real and imagined fear " .
The near - absolute anonymity of darkness accommodated horrific violence , says Prof Ekirch , as policing was largely impossible .
The murder rate was five to 10 times higher in Britain , than today .
Darkness was also the attendant of superstition and it's no coincidence that the intellectual enlightenment of the 19th Century accompanied the more tangible enlightenment .
But while " pre-industrial populations had thousands of years to adjust to nocturnal darkness , " says Prof Ekirch , the light bulb has interfered with , perhaps even corrupted , the 24 - hour circadian rhythm of our body clocks .
Edison 's patented bulb , left , from 1880 , and a more modern incarnation
" I'm no physicist , " says Prof Ekirch , but he wonders whether this segmented sleep pattern explains many of today 's sleep disorders .
It 's a theme that several academics have picked up since his book came out .
But Prof Ekirch says the light bulb has mostly been a blessing and suggests it is " arguably the greatest symbol today of modern progress " .
So what would Edison have made of its impending banishment ?
" I 'd like to think he would think there 's always a better way to do it , " says Robert KL Wheeler .
" Besides , I do n't think the light bulb was his greatest achievement .
The first recording of sound is his greatest contribution . "

Dont knock the lightbulb , using a 100W bulb indoors in a well insulated home gives 100W of heat which prevents your inefficient central heating boiler from cutting in .
Rushing to change to energy saving bulbs may lower your electric bill but it is short sighted as the C02 production may be increased overall .

Obliging people to buy energy - saving bulbs instead of ordinary ones is a good idea .
But what about the spotlight type ones that are used so widely today ?
A kitchen ceiling can house quite a few spotlights , all controlled by one switch - 6 x 60 watt would give a total of 360 watts consumption .
Low energy consuming alternatives for these are available as well via the internet .
Will ordinary spotlight bulbs be discontinued as well ?

I must admit that I occasionally marvel at the things humans have created .
The Light bulb , Ball Point pens , Records and players etc .
Some times simple ideas , and sometimes not .
If something happened to our world and we lost our technology , would enough people remember how things worked to re-invent them ?
My partner thinks I 'm mad having to know why and how things work , and where they came from .
I believe that in knowing how things have come to be and how they work is a silent tribute to those great people who came up with the ideas .
Iain Record , Nottingham
About time !
This seems a much more realistic approach than the current one of having building regs require fittings that can only take energy saving bulbs , at 10 x the cost of a normal fitting that takes a normal energy saving bulb .
Will the incandescent halogen bulbs that are so popular at the moment also be banned ?

It 's unfortunate that History has forgot one of the all time greatest inventors of our time , Nikola Tesla , the inventor of AC power and the man who brought electricity to the masses , along with hundreds of other things , with his alternating current .
He invented the flourescent tube at the same time as Edison and new how inefficient the filament lamp was compared to the filament bulb , but sadly money and power decide what the people should have and his invention lay by the wayside for decades .
It could be argued that Edison has done us more harm than good .

Whilst for general lighting the fluorescent bulb is on the whole better , will we still be able to buy the many decorative forms of bulb that are part of interior design ?

I hope the old - fashioned light bulb does n't disappear entirely , especially the little battery ones - they 're ideal for getting into the understanding of electricity .
Low energy light light bulbs run on much more difficult physics and chemistry .
Also , I understand you can't keep switching low energy bulbs on and off , which is an invitation to leave them on in the bathroom which you may only visit for a minute at a time .
Robert H. Olley , Reading , Berks , UK
With " 70 year " old technology I can have a bright light or any level of dimmed light just by turning a knob .
With modern technology I can just have a dim light , that 's progress for you .
Peter Horsfall , Farnborough
Can anyone tell me whether there are ecologically friendly lightbulbs available for use with dimmer switches and / or timers ?
Those I 've seen do n't suit either of these uses .
Helen , Kent , UK
Far from telling us that little has changed since the patent was filed , the diagram clearly shows that since then the whole design has quite literally been turned on his head !
On a lighter note ( sorry ) , before the light bulb , what did cartoonists draw above someones head to symbolise a good idea ?!?
Colin , Edinburgh
This is a daft idea - it does n't sound as if the total cost to society has been considered .
What about the consequences of the manufacture and disposal of these " low - energy " bulbs ?
Instead of just glass and metal , which are easily recycled , they are loaded with electronics - so they " cost the earth " to manufacture .
And what about dimmer switches ?
They do n't work with low - energy bulbs .
The only upside might mean the end of those terrible 500W " Bishops Rock " security lamps outside every home ...
Stuart , Edinburgh
A fascinating and illuminating (! ) article - easily the best thing I 've read on the BBC site for months .
Keith , London , UK
I really do try to be as green as I can - recycling , rarely using my car , taking holidays in the UK - but I 'm dreading the enforced use of low energy bulbs .
They take ages to warm up and when they do , the light they give off is dull and cold .
We have one in our flat and I never turn it on - maybe this is how they save energy ?!
Sue , London
This is just another " frightener " to kid the public into speding more money to save the planet .
Has anyone actually established how much more energy is actually consumed in producing these new bulbs ?
What are people with lights using " mini " bulbs ( eg wall lights ) supposed to do .... scrap their light fittings ?
How can old age pensioners afford to restock their house with bulbs at £ 10 a throw ?
This would easily cost £ 100 per houseeven discounting the need to buy new fittings .
Is there anything this government can do that does n't cost everybody more and more money ?
Meanwhile , let us all contribute to the Olympic fund , yet another way of surreptitiously offloading the government 's losses .
Remember the Milenium Dome ???

For a man whose confidence in his construction company borders on braggadocio , C.C. Myers was noticeably nervous on the ninth night after he promised to rebuild the fire - damaged MacArthur Maze in just 25 days .
Moments earlier , he had brashly predicted that his company would reopen the Interstate 580 connector a week sooner than his original ambitious prognostication -- and in about one - third of the time forecast by Caltrans .
" Yeah , I 'm getting antsy , " he admitted when asked about a large steel girder that had n't yet been put into place two hours after the lower Interstate 880 freeway had been closed .
" We 've got to set four of those tonight . "
He picked up his cell phone and bellowed into it as he strode toward the construction crews .
About 10 minutes later , crews started lifting the first girder into the gap created when the I - 580 connector crumpled in the heat of a gasoline - tanker fire .
Twenty - six days later , I - 580 opened at 8:40 p.m. Thursday -- in time for this morning 's commute and in line with Myers ' prediction .
Nobody had expected such a speedy recovery for the much - maligned maze , an often - congested interchange traveled by 280,000 vehicles every day .
Rebuilding the freeways was not just a highway construction project .
With the Bay Area , the construction industry and others across the country watching , it became a race .
Winning the race required an uncommon combination of pride , planning , timing and teamwork .
" I expected to get it done fast , " Myers said before heading home to the Sacramento area the night the first girders were raised , " but not this fast . "
So enthusiastic were some drivers about the reopening that they could n't wait to use the new connector .
Douglas Spalding , 46 , a teacher from Oakland , was on his way home Thursday night from Trader Joe 's in Emeryville when he heard I - 580 was about to reopen .
He rushed to the Bay Bridge toll plaza parking lot and cut across to east I - 80 so that he could be one of the first drivers across the new connector .
" I go back and forth to the city all the time , so for me it 's very convenient , " said Spalding , who was driving an older model Toyota Corolla wagon .
Well before dawn on April 29 , a gasoline tanker truck had crashed on the freeway that connects westbound Interstate 80 to southbound I -880 .
It burst into flames , and the fireball generated such intense heat that it caused the steel frame supporting I - 580 directly above to bend and collapse .
It also scarred and damaged I - 880 .
Both freeway connectors were barricaded , detours were mapped out and marked , and transportation officials and nervous commuters speculated that it could take months to rebuild .
But Caltrans was n't resigned to that fate .
With the smell of smoke still in the air at the maze , design engineers early that Sunday rushed to work at the department 's structure design offices in Sacramento and started pulling out old maze plans , viewing the damage on television and the Web and fielding calls from engineers at the site .
" They had a design roughed out within hours -- once they figured out where it happened and what it looked like , " said Rick Land , Caltrans ' chief engineer .
Nothing like the maze
Land , who lives in the Sierra foothills about an hour northeast of Sacramento , has worked 29 years at the state Department of Transportation , all but four of those years on structures -- bridges , overpasses , underpasses , tunnels and the like .
California 's highways have suffered many disasters , he said , but nothing similar to the maze collapse .
" I 've never seen a failure like this , " he said .
" I 've seen pictures of it in other states , but we 've never had anything like it in California .
We 've had structures in forest fires or in truck crashes ( and fires ) , but you do n't see something like this very often -- at least not in California . "
Less than two days after the I - 580 connector collapsed , demolition crews removed the mangled section .
A day later , Caltrans engineers clambered over the charred section of I - 880 , drilling concrete core samples , X - raying parts of the structure and dragging chains over the roadway -- all tests to determine the extent of repairs needed .
The results came back the next day -- the fourth day after the collapse .
I - 880 had suffered no serious structural damage to the concrete , Caltrans concluded .
The freeway connector could be jacked up and supported with temporary braces while workers used a heat - straightening technique to repair warped steel girders underneath .
Contractor ACC
West completed the work quickly , and I - 880 was reopened to traffic after being closed for just eight days .
Meanwhile , back at Caltrans headquarters in Sacramento , the state 's top transportation officials were working on a plan to speed the reconstruction of I -580 .
The challenge , said Land , was : " How quickly could we get it done without compromising quality ? "
" We had a lot of conversations about what could go wrong , " he said .
" Once you have that conversation , you can address the requirements and procedure to prevent that from happening . "
$ 200,000 bonus offer
Caltrans officials worked to speed the process by preparing a list of potential contractors it knew could do the work quickly and by streamlining its process , clearing as much red tape as possible .
Then they drew up a contract offering a $ 200,000 bonus -- with a limit of $ 5 million -- for each day the work was done in less than 50 days and levying a $ 200,000 penalty for each day after that deadline .
On May 7 , an unseasonably warm day in Sacramento , Caltrans employees , contractors and reporters gathered in the dingy basement of Caltrans headquarters for the opening of the seven bids received .
Dale Bonner , the recently appointed secretary of Business , Transportation and Housing , announced the Caltrans estimate of $ 5.2 million , then commenced opening bids .
When he opened the first bid -- $ 1.1 million -- from California Engineering Contractors , the crowd of about 30 quieted .
It turned silent when the fifth bid , from C.C. Myers Inc. , came in at $ 867,075 .
No one could beat that .
At about 3:30 p.m. , Caltrans awarded the contract to C.C. Myers .
Myers and Caltrans Director Will Kempton signed the contract , and then Myers turned to several television cameras and promised to complete the job in 25 days -- half of Caltrans ' estimate and just in time to collect the full $ 5 million bonus .
The race to rebuild the maze was on .
Within hours -- some say it was closer to 15 minutes -- Myers had workers on the site of the maze collapse .
Meanwhile , in Lathrop ( San Joaquin County ) , concrete fabrication firm ConFab started building what is essentially a big , rectangular concrete block .
The block , filled with steel reinforcement bars and cables , is what 's known to road builders as a bent cap -- a 243,750 - pound beam that sits atop two columns and supports the frame of the elevated roadway .
While the beam was being built , steel was being rushed from Pennsylvania and Texas to Stinger Welding , a steel fabrication firm in Arizona .
Carl Douglas , president of Stinger , found in Pennsylvania the nation 's only supply of the 2 - inch steel plate needed to make the bottom flange of the steel girders .
He found the half - inch and 1 - inch steel needed for the rest of the girders in Texas .
It was loaded onto trucks with two drivers in each rig so they could make the trips with fewer stops .
Once the steel reached Arizona , Stinger crews began working two 10 - hour shifts daily to get the girders built .
Caltrans sent inspectors and engineers -- all authorized to make on - the - spot decisions -- to answer questions and ensure the quality of the fabrication , Land said .
Caltrans and Stinger agreed to use a more expensive , but faster , style of producing steel girders with the required strength .
" Caltrans came in and put good people in our shop , " Douglas said .
" If there were any problems , we could go to them and get immediate answers .
Usually ( done by phone , fax or e-mail ) , it takes weeks .
It was a breath of fresh air to have a government agency come in and perform like that . "
The first two girders were done on May 14 -- just four days after Stinger started working and seven days into C.C. Myers ' contract -- and around noon they were put on trucks bound for the Bay Area .
Workers wrote a message on the side of the girders in chalk : " To the people of Oakland , California , from Stinger Welding , Coolidge , Arizona , " and the trucks rolled off , again with two drivers in each rig .
" They 're stopping only for fuel and potty breaks , " Douglas said .
Stinger finished the girders in nine days -- a job that would normally have taken about 45 , he said .
The first two girders arrived early on May 15 at ABC Painting , an industrial paint shop on the old Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo .
Crews blasted the girders with steel grit to rough them up enough to hold a good coat of paint .
Then they applied a zinc primer in " Caltrans gray , " a sort of greenish gray .
The zinc , explained Eric Jeffress , president of ABC , is a cathodic primer that sacrifices itself to the elements before they can get to the steel .
Caltrans usually requires primers to dry for three days , he said , but on this job allowed a one - day drying time .
As the girders were painted , the massive concrete bent cap began making its way from Lathrop on an 18 - axle truck .
The load was so heavy that the truck was n't permitted on I - 580 over the Altamont Pass and had to use rural roads to get to the Tri-Valley .
Still , the bent cap arrived about 15 minutes before Caltrans ' scheduled 8 p.m. closure May 15 of the I - 880 connector for the installation , and had to wait on the side of Interstate 80 in Berkeley .
Shortly after 8 p.m. , the rig pulled onto the closed 880 connector and parked at an angle beneath the two I - 580 columns that survived the collapse and needed only minor repairs .
After the beam was untied and hooked to lifting cables , a pair of cranes raised it at 8:50 p.m. and had it in place by 9 p.m .
Crane operators then dropped large steel " pins " into holes in the bent cap and injected grout to secure the connection .
Crowd watched big event
Dozens of people watched the pivotal event , including a media village that established itself in the dust beneath the maze .
Closer to the action , at least 20 engineers , construction workers and Caltrans officials stood and watched .
There was a feeling in the cool night air that if this pivotal part of the job could be done so quickly and seemingly easily , C.C. Myers really could complete the job in 25 days .
" I have n't encountered anything like this , " said Chris Snyder , a business representative with Operating Engineers Union Local 3 , which represents heavy equipment operators and other construction workers .
" The whole world is watching to see how fast ( C.C. Myers ) can do it . "
After the first four girders were lifted into place , two more arrived each subsequent night , and they were put in place without difficulty .
As soon as each pair was secured , workers swarmed the steel beams and started installing the wooden forms and steel - reinforcement bar for the concrete roadway .
On a typical job , the contractor would wait until the girders were all installed before preparing for the concrete pour , Land said .
" C.C. Myers was very good at coordinating things .
They eliminated the transitions , the waiting time , " he said , mentioning the importance of flexibility on the job .
In another example , instead of requiring the contactor to wait for detailed construction drawings to be approved , Caltrans agreed to let the work start while they were being reviewed .
It was a risk for both the contractor and Caltrans , Land said , but was a relatively safe bet " because the work was so straightforward . "
It ended up saving about five days .
When Caltrans mentioned a willingness to be flexible when it awarded the job , some critics feared it would mean lower standards and inferior quality .
In fact , UC Berkeley civil engineering professor Abolhassan Astaneh said Thursday he was not convinced that four concrete columns supporting 580 or 880 could withstand a major earthquake .
Instead , they should have been demolished and replaced , he said .
But Land and Peter Strykers , Caltrans senior engineer , said multiple tests were performed on both the surviving structures and the new construction , and they are confident of its safety .
" We did n't cut any corners at all , " Strykers said .
In addition to taking core samples of the columns and roadways that survived the inferno and testing them days after the collapse , Caltrans engineers took samples of the concrete from each pour of the deck and walls .
Those samples were subjected to crushing tests at the department 's Sacramento laboratory to determine their strength .
After curing for 48 hours , the concrete poured on Sunday had already attained the required strength -- 3,500 pounds per square inch -- for the road deck , Land said .
But Caltrans wanted it to cure -- beneath burlap and plastic blankets to keep it damp -- for at least 96 hours .
The extra time , Strykers said , will prevent cracking .
" Some people think we could have gotten it done a little sooner , " he said , standing atop the new 580 connector Wednesday evening .
" But we want it to be a quality job that will have no maintenance problems for years to come . "
C.C. Myers will collect $ 5 million in bonus money .
The job is estimated to have cost the firm $ 2.5 million .
But Myers has said this job was not about making a ton of money ; it was about pride and reputation .
Land agreed .
" It 's not about making a huge profit , " he said .
" It 's about getting the job done quick and pointing out that you 're one of the best contractors in the industry . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British adventurer is planning to highlight the effects of global warming by becoming the first person to swim at the North Pole and break his own record for the coldest swim .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Sporting just a cap , trunks and goggles , Lewis Gordon Pugh will swim 1 km ( 0.6 miles ) in water at a temperature of minus 1.8 degrees Celsius on July 15 , a dip he expects to last 21 minutes .
Such a swim would have been impossible as little as 10 years ago because the water would have been frozen , Pugh says .
“ Most people have no idea that you can find patches of open sea at the North Pole in summer , ” said Pugh , who set the record for the coldest human swim off Antarctica at 0 degrees Celsius .
“ I ca n’t think of a better way to show that climate change is a reality than by swimming in a place that should be totally frozen over .
I hope it will ... put pressure on the leaders of the G8 summit to cut carbon emissions dramatically , ” he said in a statement .
Climate change is expected to be high on the agenda at a meeting of the Group of Eight leading industrial countries in Germany next month .
Last year Pugh broke his own world record for the longest ice water swim by covering 1.2 km in a fjord in the Norwegian mountains , staying in the water for 23 minutes 50 seconds .
Any normal person would hyperventilate , suffer extreme shock and drown within minutes of jumping into near freezing water , but Pugh -- nicknamed the Polar Bear because of his ability to withstand freezing temperatures -- is made of sterner stuff .
In preparation for his swim , Pugh , 37 , has increased his body weight from 87 kg to 105 kg by eating six meals a day , and has trained by swimming in a specially designed ice pool .
“ This is the coldest water any human being will have swum in and Lewis has been extraordinarily dedicated , ” Professor Tim Noakes of the University of Cape Town , an expert on the effect of cold water on the human body , said in the statement .
Pugh will spend his last month of training at a Norwegian glacial lake with Jorgen Amundsen , a relative of Roald Amundsen , the first man to reach the South Pole in 1911 .
“ This expedition represents the end of an era of Arctic exploration as we know it , ” said Amundsen , who will ski the last 10 km to the North Pole with Pugh before his swim .
“ It ’s becoming increasingly difficult to walk to the North Pole and many expeditions fail each year when they encounter big stretches of open sea , ” added Amundsen .
Pugh , a lawyer and “ ambassador ” for the environmental group WWF , says he is the only person to have completed a long distance swim in each of the five oceans , and last year he swam the length of England ’s 203 - mile River Thames .
Yes , today ’s Dilbert comic ( Saturday ) is a repeat .
Here ’s the scoop .
I submit my comics a month or so in advance , then forget about them .
Yesterday I got a call from my syndication company , United Media , alerting me that the comic scheduled for today makes a casual reference to serial killing .
Obviously this is exceptionally bad timing .
The average reader does n’t know how far in advance the comics are submitted , and it would look cruel , possibly intentional , given recent events .
One option was to alert client newspapers and give them the option of running the comic or replacing it with a repeat .
I decided to go further and ask all of the newspapers to run the repeat .
Some papers did not get enough notice to make the change .
Comics are sometimes typeset in advance , depending on what technology the newspaper company uses .
So I ’m in for a bumpy ride today .
Wish me luck .
I apologize for any bad feelings the comic might cause for anyone who sees it .
Whether it's two billion years from now , when the Sun will no longer provide enough heat to support life on earth , or two hours from now in a nuclear holocaust , life on earth will inevitably come to an end .
All religious traditions grapple [ wiki ] with this fact .
Here 's what they 've come up with so far .
Christianity
Things Get Bad :
At least according to the Book of Revelation , things will be very bad indeed .
Weeping , gnashing of teeth , rending of garments , blood in the streets , etc .
All of this will occur during " the Tribulation [ wiki ] . "
And Then : the Second Coming of Christ , wherein Christ - to quote the Nicene Creed - " comes again in glory to judge the living and the dead . "
Until : the Rapture [ wiki ] , wherein all Christians ( or at least good ones , depending on your particular denomination ) are moved from earth directly to heaven with no dying or passing Go .
Islam
Things Get Bad : The Last Judgment in Islam is known as the Qiyamah [ wiki ] .
At a time of God 's choosing - no one knows when - Jesus ( yes , that Jesus ) will come down from heaven , end all wars , and kill ad - Dajjal [ wiki ] ( Islam 's equivalent to an Antichrist ) .
And Then : Each and every person who ever lived will be bodily resurrected and judged by God .
Those found wanting will be sent to hell either temporarily or permanently ; those who have been good and faithful go to heaven .
Until :
No , that 's it , actually .
For the record , most Muslims do believe that some " People of the Book , " that is , Christians and Jews , will also get to heaven .
Judaism
Things Get Bad :
The end of days [ wiki ] , or acharit hayamim , will be marked by conflict and tumult .
When ?
Well , the Talmud states that the world will only last 6,000 years - so many Orthodox Jews believe the world as we 've always known it will end in 2240 CE .
And Then :
All of Israel 's enemies will be defeated , the twice - destroyed Temple will be rebuilt [ wiki ] , the dead will be resurrected , and the Jewish Messiah will become King of Israel .
Until : God intervenes in the Battle of Armageddon , saving the Jews , evil leaves the world , and earth becomes perfect .
It 's like Belinda Carlisle song : " They say in heaven love comes first / We 'll make heaven a place on earth . "
Buddhism
Things Get Bad : According to the Buddhist holy scripture , the Tipitaka , we 'll know the end of the world is coming when morality disappears and people start following the " 10 Amoral Concepts . "
Those concepts ?
Theft , violence , murder , lying , evil speaking , adultery , idle talk , covetousness , greed , and perverted lust .
Um , uh -oh .
And Then :
Once morality disappears , things will degenerate into misery .
Until : A Buddha named Maitreya ( known in English as the " future Buddha " ) , the successor to the Buddha we all know and love , will arrive on earth and begin teaching the pure Dharma .
Hinduism
Things Get Bad : Most Hindus believe that we are currently living in Kali Yuga [ wiki ] , the Iron Age , or age of darkness .
Unfortunately for us , that means that evil is on the upswing .
Eventually , Vishnu will become incarnate for the 10th and final time .
By then , karma will have been completely turned on its head , with good people suffering needlessly and the evil rising to ranks of power .
And Then : Shiva [ wiki ] , " the Destroyer , " will dissolve the evil and corrupt universe .
And then , because all things are cyclical , the universe will simultaneously be reborn .
Until :
We start getting evil again and get ourselves into another age of darkness .
Most Hindus are careful not to put an exact time frame on eschatological matters .
If you do , you can end up looking awfully foolish ...
Not the End of the World : People and Groups Who Falsely Predicted the End- time
Ca n't Keep Those Davidians Down
In 1942 , a Seventh - day Adventist named Victor Houteff [ wiki ] broke away from the church with 11 followers and founded a " Davidian " branch of the church in Waco , Tex. Davidian .
Branch .
Waco .
You see where this is going .
But what a winding path the church took .
After Houteff died , his wife prophesied that the world would end on April 22 , 1959 .
In point of fact , about the most interesting event of April 22 , 1959 , was the Yankees ' Whitey Ford [ wiki ] striking out 15 Washington Senators en route to a 1 - 0 victory .
Several hundred members of the Davidians left after the non-Apocalypse , but - remarkably - dozens remained faithful .
In 1962 , Benjamin Roden [ wiki ] became the group 's leader and proclaimed himself successor to not only Ms. Houteff , but also to King David , noted star of the Hebrew Bible .
Roden 's wife became the new Davidian ( get it ? ) when she took over the church .
She quickly declared that in the Second Coming , Christ would assume the body of a woman .
You'd think by now the group would have theological whiplash , and yet it stayed together until 1981 , when Vernon Howell , who would later rename himself David Koresh [ wiki ] , showed up .
By the time the ATF raided the compound in 1993 , the Branch Davidians had 130 members .
While their numbers dwindled after the massacre , Davidianism is still alive : A few people still claim to follow Koresh 's teachings .
Go Ahead , Drink the Kool - Aid .
Jim Jones , cult leader of the People 's Temple [ wiki ] , portrayed as
the loving father of the " Rainbow Family "
By now , " Do n't drink the Kool - Aid " is a well - known admonishment not to buy into collective wisdom .
It derives from the 1978 Jonestown massacre , when 914 followers of Jim Jones [ wiki ] , included 276 children , committed suicide .
But here 's the thing :
No one at Jonestown drank Kool - Aid [ wiki ] .
They drank cyanide - laced grape Flavor Aid , a Kool - Aid competitor - but the poor , innocent Kool - Aid man has been taking the fall ever since .
Prominent ( False ) Prophets
Henry Adams
Famous for : being the grandson and great - grandson of American presidents and writing the memoir The Education of Henry Adams , which Modern Library named the Best Nonfiction Book of the 20th century .
Prophecy :
In his old age , with the confidence of a man who would not live to be proved wrong , Adams [ wiki ] declared the world as we know it would end in 1921 .

I was recently invited by Jason Calacanis to A Small World , the uber - exclusive social network ( do n’t ask for invitations , it ’s a privilege I have n’t been granted since I ’m a newcomer there ) .
This has prompted me to think about a number of issues relating to social networks in general .
In this entry , I will try to look at why social networks fail .
Subsequent entries will focus on why they succeed and what opportunities they create .
So without further ado , here are five reasons why social networks fail :
5. Privacy concerns
The first reason I would highlight , and part of the reason why social networks have not really gained much traction outside of a self - selected group of people is the amount of privacy concerns that exist within certain age groups .
Younger people are generally more immune to those but older people tend to worry about what the social networks in question do with their data and are worried that they will either be data mined or that they will suffer from identity theft .
This anxiety has largely been driven by media emphasis on how your data on the Internet is unsafe and how there are “ nefarious characters ” running around the net .
4 . No real reward or penalty system
Most social networks are putting a heavy emphasis on how many connection a user have .
A user ’s worth is based on his / her number of connection , not on the quality of those connections .
This tends to drive a lot of people to try to connect to as many people as they can .
Mary Hodder likens this effort to collecting baseball cards , an apt metaphor since the number of connections you have is no guarantee of the value of those connections .
However , few of the social networking sites are doing anything to gate the amount of connection .
One of the nice thing on asmallworld is that it actually penalizes people for sending out invitations that were declined .
I believe this is a good thing as it makes people rethink whether they want to attempt a connection or not .
The other question is the reward in social networking : what do I get for sharing my contacts ?
We know what the companies get but it ’s sometimes fuzzier to see what extra value one gets from a social network .
Some have done a good job at showing a sense of mission , whether it is job - related and expertise - related connectivity like connections Linked In or dating like … well , this is where it gets trickier .
3 . Not granular enough
Context is generally missing from most social networks .
For example , I may know Bob in a social context as a friend but I have no idea of how good an employee he is .
Or I may know Joe in a work context but not realize that he ’s not dating material for my friends .
The lack of granularity as to the types of relationships is another current failure of most social networking sites .
The other thing that is missing from social network is a more fine - tuned approach to ranking relationships .
Relationships are not binary .
It ’s not either someone is my friend or not .
The truth of the matter is that relationships are very granular in nature : I may be a close friend to John , whom I ’ve known for 20 years and hang out with on a daily basis and I may have been a friend with Peter in the past but have n’t seem him in 10 years .
Yet , to a social network , if I added both of them as friends , we have the same types of relationships .
Similarly , there seems to be a trigger missing for evolving relationships : what if my relationship with Peter has been slowly degrading over time .
Do I kick him out as a friend ( an option few networks allow ) or do I keep him on my list .
This granularity is missing and it is odd that it does n’t exist as it would be relatively easy to capture this data .
Situational relevance is another factor that is largely ignored by social networks today : in what context does that network function .
It ’s something that needs to be more granularly defined than the catch - all approach of existing implementations .
2 . Not integrated with other apps
Should social networks be standalone apps or is social networking just a feature ?
There is really little value in knowing people just for the sake of knowing people .
However , there is value in interfacing with those people , whether it is to find a job , get some information from a subject matter expert , find money , or get a new date .
I believe the real value of social network sites to the end user will eventually be discovered when they start integrating with other components like email and IM .
Presence ( is the person online or not ) , location services ( where in the physical world is the person right now ) and communication ( can I phone / IM / email / page them now ) would add greatly to the value of social networks .
However , at the current time , few efforts have been made to integrate the social networks with other apps .
Which brings me to the biggest reason why social networks fail :
1. Walled Gardens
At the end of the day , social networking sites are walled gardens .
They do not want to share information with others for fear that it will dilute their power as THE central hub for all relationships .
This lack of interoperability is the primary problem with social networking sites and , I believe , one of the reason why their growth is impeded .
A network that would be willing to open up could see better integration with other tools and could benefit from other sites connecting to it and creating more specialized sub -networks .
For example , a large social networking site could become a large repository of a number of relationships with smaller sites looking at it to specialize across horizontal uses ( for example , creating a site focused on dating or job search ) or vertical ones ( for example , a site focused on information exchange between subject matter experts within one particular domain )

1. Scorpions : Leading the Battle Against Brain Cancer
2. Cone Shell Snails : Little Creatures Tackling Big Pain
3. Poison Dart Frogs : The Heart - Healthy Choice
4. Vipers : Lowering Blood Pressure Since 1981
5. Gila Monster : Attacking Type 2 Diabetes
Sure , you know these five creatures as stinging , biting merchants of death .
But is n’t it time we put aside our differences and embrace the positive ?
For the most part , scorpions use their toxins to capture prey , ward off competitors during mating season , and defend themselves against larger predators .
Unfortunately , humans count as larger predators .
A sting by some species can leave you with a number of potentially deadly conditions , including heart and lung failure .
Medical researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham ( UAB ) have discovered a new use for scorpion venom – in cancer medication .
Each year , some 9,000 Americans are diagnosed with malignant glioma , a form of brain cancer that kills about half its victims within a year of diagnosis .
Glioma cells work a lot like cockroach muscle cells .
And while that fact is pretty disgusting , it also got UAB researchers thinking about the giant Israeli scorpion , whose venom is harmless to humans but deadly to its cockroach prey .
Doctors found that when they injected a drug derived from the venom of giant Israeli scorpions into cancer - infected human brains , the poison destroyed the glioma cells and left surrounding , healthy cells alone .
The treatment is still in the early stages of development , but researchers remain optimistic .
Thanks to their unique colors and intricate patterns , cone shells look like they ’d make great beach souvenirs .
But watch your fingers ; they ’re actually home to one of the world ’s deadliest creatures .
Cone shell snails come equipped with an extendable “ arm ” – complete with a sharp , venomous tooth – that they use to immobilize and kill prey .
And while the venom certainly helps the slow - moving hunters from going hungry , it can also paralyze , or even kill , victims .
The good news : Death by cone shell is completely painless .
Cone shell venom , called conotoxin , has incredible potential as a painkiller , with one added bonus :
Unlike many current anesthetics , conotoxin is n’t addictive .
In 2005 , Ireland - based Elan Pharmaceuticals became the first company to market a drug made from the venom .
Called Prialt , the drug is pumped into the fluid around a patient ’s spine to relieve chronic pain and is believed to be up to 1,000 times more powerful than morphine .
Meanwhile , at the University of Melbourne , a research team headed by Professor Bruce Livett is currently developing another conotoxin - based painkiller called ACV1 , which was first tested in the summer of 2005 .
Unlike Prialt , however , ACV1 does n’t affect a patient ’s blood pressure and can be injected under the skin , making it a lot less intimidating .
Plus , ACV1 is believed to be as much as 10,000 times stronger than morphine .
You know an animal is bad news when its sweat was once considered a state - of - the - art military technology .
Meet the poison dart frog , which secretes a highly dangerous neurotoxin , called batrachotoxin , through its pores .
In fact , various Latin American tribes used to collect the stuff ( carefully ) to poison the tips of their arrows for hunting and warfare .
Interestingly , however , the frogs do n’t produce their own toxin .
They get it from eating insects that most likely picked up the poison from the plants they consume .
The same frogs , if raised in a laboratory rather than the rain forest , are n’t poisonous at all . :
Before batrachotoxin stops your heart , its speeds it up .
Consequently , medical experts believe it might be possible to tweak elements of the frog ’s toxin to bring patients out of cardiac arrest and potentially save lives .
And because it also deadens nerve endings , batrachotoxin has potential as an ingredient in anesthetics .
Studies into other uses of the toxin are still in the early stages , but the frog ’s medical benefits bolster the argument for preserving the rainforest .
Most scientists believe we ’ve only just begun to grasp the pharmaceutical possibilities of some of the world ’s rarest and deadliest creatures .
Most vipers are scary enough as it is , but jararaca vipers are venomous to boot .
But what ’s truly fascinating is the unique way their venom works .
Unlike a traditional toxin , viper venom functions by preventing the blood from clotting , meaning the snakes actually kill their victims by causing them to bleed to death .
Lucky for us , slow - clotting blood is n’t always a bad thing .
Researchers have found that small doses of viper venom can prevent arteries from hardening , thus stopping the kinds of blood clots that commonly occur in cardiac patients .
In fact jararaca viper venom ( or at least a synthesized version of it ) is a key ingredient in most of today ’s ACE inhibitors .
Introduced in 1981 , ACE inhibitors work by slowing down the body ’s angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) .
When left untreated , the enzyme can produce a peptide that causes muscle constriction around blood vessels .
That kind of constriction can set off a chain reaction whereby a person ’s blood vessels narrow and his or her blood pressure shoots through the roof , leading to greater risk of heart attack and other ailments .
Because the ACE inhibitors can stop this domino effect , they ’re frequently used to treat millions of men and women with high blood pressure .
One of only two species of venomous lizards , the Gila monster is native to southwestern United States and northern Mexico .
Unlike other deadly critters , Gila monsters do n’t inject venom directly into their victims .
Instead , poison oozes from the lizard ’s teeth into the open wounds of its prey , usually while the Gila monster is chewing .
Because of this , human fatalities from Gila monster bites are rare , but a bite can cause intense pain , nausea , swelling , fatigue , dizziness , and chills – none of which is particularly fun .
In addition to all those nasty side effects , Gila monster venom stimulates insulin production and slows down glucose production , which is great news for diabetics .
Byetta , a drug manufactured by Amylin Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly & Company to treat Type 2 diabetes , uses a manufactured form of Gila monster venom as its main ingredient .
Approved by the FDA in April of 2005 , Byetta is injected before meals to help their bodies produce the right amount of insulin at the right time – the best part being that it does n’t cause the mood swings often associated with traditional insulin regimens .

Orhan Pamuk – Nobel Lecture
December 7 , 2006
My Father ’s Suitcase
Two years before his death , my father gave me a small suitcase filled with his writings , manuscripts and notebooks .
Assuming his usual joking , mocking air , he told me he wanted me to read them after he was gone , by which he meant after he died .
‘ Just take a look , ’ he said , looking slightly embarrassed .
‘ See if there ’s anything inside that you can use .
Maybe after I ’m gone you can make a selection and publish it . ’
We were in my study , surrounded by books .
My father was searching for a place to set down the suitcase , wandering back and forth like a man who wished to rid himself of a painful burden .
In the end , he deposited it quietly in an unobtrusive corner .
It was a shaming moment that neither of us ever forgot , but once it had passed and we had gone back into our usual roles , taking life lightly , our joking , mocking personas took over and we relaxed .
We talked as we always did , about the trivial things of everyday life , and Turkey ’s neverending political troubles , and my father ’s mostly failed business ventures , without feeling too much sorrow .
I remember that after my father left , I spent several days walking back and forth past the suitcase without once touching it .
I was already familiar with this small , black , leather suitcase , and its lock , and its rounded corners .
My father would take it with him on short trips and sometimes use it to carry documents to work .
I remembered that when I was a child , and my father came home from a trip , I would open this little suitcase and rummage through his things , savouring the scent of cologne and foreign countries .
This suitcase was a familiar friend , a powerful reminder of my childhood , my past , but now I could n’t even touch it .
Why ?
No doubt it was because of the mysterious weight of its contents .
I am now going to speak of this weight ’s meaning .
It is what a person creates when he shuts himself up in a room , sits down at a table , and retires to a corner to express his thoughts – that is , the meaning of literature .
When I did touch my father ’s suitcase , I still could not bring myself to open it , but I did know what was inside some of those notebooks .
I had seen my father writing things in a few of them .
This was not the first time I had heard of the heavy load inside the suitcase .
My father had a large library ; in his youth , in the late 1940s , he had wanted to be an Istanbul poet , and had translated Valéry into Turkish , but he had not wanted to live the sort of life that came with writing poetry in a poor country with few readers .
My father ’s father – my grandfather – had been a wealthy business man ; my father had led a comfortable life as a child and a young man , and he had no wish to endure hardship for the sake of literature , for writing .
He loved life with all its beauties – this I understood .
The first thing that kept me distant from the contents of my father ’s suitcase was , of course , the fear that I might not like what I read .
Because my father knew this , he had taken the precaution of acting as if he did not take its contents seriously .
After working as a writer for 25 years , it pained me to see this .
But I did not even want to be angry at my father for failing to take literature seriously enough …
My real fear , the crucial thing that I did not wish to know or discover , was the possibility that my father might be a good writer .
I could n’t open my father ’s suitcase because I feared this .
Even worse , I could n’t even admit this myself openly .
If true and great literature emerged from my father ’s suitcase , I would have to acknowledge that inside my father there existed an entirely different man .
This was a frightening possibility .
Because even at my advanced age I wanted my father to be only my father – not a writer .
A writer is someone who spends years patiently trying to discover the second being inside him , and the world that makes him who he is : when I speak of writing , what comes first to my mind is not a novel , a poem , or literary tradition , it is a person who shuts himself up in a room , sits down at a table , and alone , turns inward ; amid its shadows , he builds a new world with words .
This man – or this woman – may use a typewriter , profit from the ease of a computer , or write with a pen on paper , as I have done for 30 years .
As he writes , he can drink tea or coffee , or smoke cigarettes .
From time to time he may rise from his table to look out through the window at the children playing in the street , and , if he is lucky , at trees and a view , or he can gaze out at a black wall .
He can write poems , plays , or novels , as I do .
All these differences come after the crucial task of sitting down at the table and patiently turning inwards .
To write is to turn this inward gaze into words , to study the world into which that person passes when he retires into himself , and to do so with patience , obstinacy , and joy .
As I sit at my table , for days , months , years , slowly adding new words to the empty page , I feel as if I am creating a new world , as if I am bringing into being that other person inside me , in the same way someone might build a bridge or a dome , stone by stone .
The stones we writers use are words .
As we hold them in our hands , sensing the ways in which each of them is connected to the others , looking at them sometimes from afar , sometimes almost caressing them with our fingers and the tips of our pens , weighing them , moving them around , year in and year out , patiently and hopefully , we create new worlds .
The writer ’s secret is not inspiration – for it is never clear where it comes from – it is his stubbornness , his patience .
That lovely Turkish saying – to dig a well with a needle – seems to me to have been said with writers in mind .
In the old stories , I love the patience of Ferhat , who digs through mountains for his love – and I understand it , too .
In my novel , My Name is Red , when I wrote about the old Persian miniaturists who had drawn the same horse with the same passion for so many years , memorising each stroke , that they could recreate that beautiful horse even with their eyes closed , I knew I was talking about the writing profession , and my own life .
If a writer is to tell his own story – tell it slowly , and as if it were a story about other people – if he is to feel the power of the story rise up inside him , if he is to sit down at a table and patiently give himself over to this art – this craft – he must first have been given some hope .
The angel of inspiration ( who pays regular visits to some and rarely calls on others ) favours the hopeful and the confident , and it is when a writer feels most lonely , when he feels most doubtful about his efforts , his dreams , and the value of his writing – when he thinks his story is only his story – it is at such moments that the angel chooses to reveal to him stories , images and dreams that will draw out the world he wishes to build .
If I think back on the books to which I have devoted my entire life , I am most surprised by those moments when I have felt as if the sentences , dreams , and pages that have made me so ecstatically happy have not come from my own imagination – that another power has found them and generously presented them to me .
I was afraid of opening my father ’s suitcase and reading his notebooks because I knew that he would not tolerate the difficulties I had endured , that it was not solitude he loved but mixing with friends , crowds , salons , jokes , company .
But later my thoughts took a different turn .
These thoughts , these dreams of renunciation and patience , were prejudices I had derived from my own life and my own experience as a writer .
There were plenty of brilliant writers who wrote surrounded by crowds and family life , in the glow of company and happy chatter .
In addition , my father had , when we were young , tired of the monotony of family life , and left us to go to Paris , where – like so many writers – he ’d sat in his hotel room filling notebooks .
I knew , too , that some of those very notebooks were in this suitcase , because during the years before he brought it to me , my father had finally begun to talk to me about that period in his life .
He spoke about those years even when I was a child , but he would not mention his vulnerabilities , his dreams of becoming a writer , or the questions of identity that had plagued him in his hotel room .
He would tell me instead about all the times he ’d seen Sartre on the pavements of Paris , about the books he ’d read and the films he ’d seen , all with the elated sincerity of someone imparting very important news .
When I became a writer , I never forgot that it was partly thanks to the fact that I had a father who would talk of world writers so much more than he spoke of pashas or great religious leaders .
So perhaps I had to read my father ’s notebooks with this in mind , and remembering how indebted I was to his large library .
I had to bear in mind that when he was living with us , my father , like me , enjoyed being alone with his books and his thoughts – and not pay too much attention to the literary quality of his writing .
But as I gazed so anxiously at the suitcase my father had bequeathed me , I also felt that this was the very thing I would not be able to do .
My father would sometimes stretch out on the divan in front of his books , abandon the book in his hand , or the magazine and drift off into a dream , lose himself for the longest time in his thoughts .
When I saw on his face an expression so very different from the one he wore amid the joking , teasing , and bickering of family life – when I saw the first signs of an inward gaze – I would , especially during my childhood and my early youth , understand , with trepidation , that he was discontent .
Now , so many years later , I know that this discontent is the basic trait that turns a person into a writer .
To become a writer , patience and toil are not enough : we must first feel compelled to escape crowds , company , the stuff of ordinary , everyday life , and shut ourselves up in a room .
We wish for patience and hope so that we can create a deep world in our writing .
But the desire to shut oneself up in a room is what pushes us into action .
The precursor of this sort of independent writer – who reads his books to his heart ’s content , and who , by listening only to the voice of his own conscience , disputes with other ’s words , who , by entering into conversation with his books develops his own thoughts , and his own world – was most certainly Montaigne , in the earliest days of modern literature .
Montaigne was a writer to whom my father returned often , a writer he recommended to me .
I would like to see myself as belonging to the tradition of writers who – wherever they are in the world , in the East or in the West – cut themselves off from society , and shut themselves up with their books in their room .
The starting point of true literature is the man who shuts himself up in his room with his books .
But once we shut ourselves away , we soon discover that we are not as alone as we thought .
We are in the company of the words of those who came before us , of other people ’s stories , other people ’s books , other people ’s words , the thing we call tradition .
I believe literature to be the most valuable hoard that humanity has gathered in its quest to understand itself .
Societies , tribes , and peoples grow more intelligent , richer , and more advanced as they pay attention to the troubled words of their authors , and , as we all know , the burning of books and the denigration of writers are both signals that dark and improvident times are upon us .
But literature is never just a national concern .
The writer who shuts himself up in a room and first goes on a journey inside himself will , over the years , discover literature ’s eternal rule : he must have the artistry to tell his own stories as if they were other people ’s stories , and to tell other people ’s stories as if they were his own , for this is what literature is .
But we must first travel through other people ’s stories and books .
My father had a good library – 1 500 volumes in all – more than enough for a writer .
By the age of 22 , I had perhaps not read them all , but I was familiar with each book – I knew which were important , which were light but easy to read , which were classics , which an essential part of any education , which were forgettable but amusing accounts of local history , and which French authors my father rated very highly .
Sometimes I would look at this library from a distance and imagine that one day , in a different house , I would build my own library , an even better library – build myself a world .
When I looked at my father ’s library from afar , it seemed to me to be a small picture of the real world .
But this was a world seen from our own corner , from Istanbul .
The library was evidence of this .
My father had built his library from his trips abroad , mostly with books from Paris and America , but also with books bought from the shops that sold books in foreign languages in the 40s and 50s and Istanbul ’s old and new booksellers , whom I also knew .
My world is a mixture of the local – the national – and the West .
In the 70s , I , too , began , somewhat ambitiously , to build my own library .
I had not quite decided to become a writer – as I related in Istanbul , I had come to feel that I would not , after all , become a painter , but I was not sure what path my life would take .
There was inside me a relentless curiosity , a hope - driven desire to read and learn , but at the same time I felt that my life was in some way lacking , that I would not be able to live like others .
Part of this feeling was connected to what I felt when I gazed at my father ’s library – to be living far from the centre of things , as all of us who lived in Istanbul in those days were made to feel , that feeling of living in the provinces .
There was another reason for feeling anxious and somehow lacking , for I knew only too well that I lived in a country that showed little interest in its artists – be they painters or writers – and that gave them no hope .
In the 70s , when I would take the money my father gave me and greedily buy faded , dusty , dog-eared books from Istanbul ’s old booksellers , I would be as affected by the pitiable state of these second - hand bookstores – and by the despairing dishevelment of the poor , bedraggled booksellers who laid out their wares on roadsides , in mosque courtyards , and in the niches of crumbling walls – as I was by their books .
As for my place in the world – in life , as in literature , my basic feeling was that I was ‘ not in the centre ’ .
In the centre of the world , there was a life richer and more exciting than our own , and with all of Istanbul , all of Turkey , I was outside it .
Today I think that I share this feeling with most people in the world .
In the same way , there was a world literature , and its centre , too , was very far away from me .
Actually what I had in mind was Western , not world , literature , and we Turks were outside it .
My father ’s library was evidence of this .
At one end , there were Istanbul ’s books – our literature , our local world , in all its beloved detail – and at the other end were the books from this other , Western , world , to which our own bore no resemblance , to which our lack of resemblance gave us both pain and hope .
To write , to read , was like leaving one world to find consolation in the other world ’s otherness , the strange and the wondrous .
I felt that my father had read novels to escape his life and flee to the West – just as I would do later .
Or it seemed to me that books in those days were things we picked up to escape our own culture , which we found so lacking .
It was n’t just by reading that we left our Istanbul lives to travel
West – it was by writing , too .
To fill those notebooks of his , my father had gone to Paris , shut himself up in his room , and then brought his writings back to Turkey .
As I gazed at my father ’s suitcase , it seemed to me that this was what was causing me disquiet .
After working in a room for 25 years to survive as a writer in Turkey , it galled me to see my father hide his deep thoughts inside this suitcase , to act as if writing was work that had to be done in secret , far from the eyes of society , the state , the people .
Perhaps this was the main reason why I felt angry at my father for not taking literature as seriously as I did .
Actually I was angry at my father because he had not led a life like mine , because he had never quarrelled with his life , and had spent his life happily laughing with his friends and his loved ones .
But part of me knew that I could also say that I was not so much ‘ angry ’ as ‘ jealous ’ , that the second word was more accurate , and this , too , made me uneasy .
That would be when I would ask myself in my usual scornful , angry voice : ‘ What is happiness ? ’
Was happiness thinking that I lived a deep life in that lonely room ?
Or was happiness leading a comfortable life in society , believing in the same things as everyone else , or acting as if you did ?
Was it happiness , or unhappiness , to go through life writing in secret , while seeming to be in harmony with all around one ?
But these were overly ill - tempered questions .
Wherever had I got this idea that the measure of a good life was happiness ?
People , papers , everyone acted as if the most important measure of a life was happiness .
Did this alone not suggest that it might be worth trying to find out if the exact opposite was true ?
After all , my father had run away from his family so many times – how well did I know him , and how well could I say I understood his disquiet ?
So this was what was driving me when I first opened my father ’s suitcase .
Did my father have a secret , an unhappiness in his life about which I knew nothing , something he could only endure by pouring it into his writing ?
As soon as I opened the suitcase , I recalled its scent of travel , recognised several notebooks , and noted that my father had shown them to me years earlier , but without dwelling on them very long .
Most of the notebooks I now took into my hands he had filled when he had left us and gone to Paris as a young man .
Whereas I , like so many writers I admired – writers whose biographies I had read – wished to know what my father had written , and what he had thought , when he was the age I was now .
It did not take me long to realise that I would find nothing like that here .
What caused me most disquiet was when , here and there in my father ’s notebooks , I came upon a writerly voice .
This was not my father ’s voice , I told myself ; it was n’t authentic , or at least it did not belong to the man I ’d known as my father .
Underneath my fear that my father might not have been my father when he wrote , was a deeper fear : the fear that deep inside I was not authentic , that I would find nothing good in my father ’s writing , this increased my fear of finding my father to have been overly influenced by other writers and plunged me into a despair that had afflicted me so badly when I was young , casting my life , my very being , my desire to write , and my work into question .
During my first ten years as a writer , I felt these anxieties more deeply , and even as I fought them off , I would sometimes fear that one day , I would have to admit to defeat – just as I had done with painting – and succumbing to disquiet , give up novel writing , too .
I have already mentioned the two essential feelings that rose up in me as I closed my father ’s suitcase and put it away : the sense of being marooned in the provinces , and the fear that I lacked authenticity .
This was certainly not the first time they had made themselves felt .
For years I had , in my reading and my writing , been studying , discovering , deepening these emotions , in all their variety and unintended consequences , their nerve endings , their triggers , and their many colours .
Certainly my spirits had been jarred by the confusions , the sensitivities and the fleeting pains that life and books had sprung on me , most often as a young man .
But it was only by writing books that I came to a fuller understanding of the problems of authenticity ( as in My Name is Red and The Black Book ) and the problems of life on the periphery ( as in Snow and Istanbul ) .
For me , to be a writer is to acknowledge the secret wounds that we carry inside us , the wounds so secret that we ourselves are barely aware of them , and to patiently explore them , know them , illuminate them , to own these pains and wounds , and to make them a conscious part of our spirits and our writing .
A writer talks of things that everyone knows but does not know they know .
To explore this knowledge , and to watch it grow , is a pleasurable thing ; the reader is visiting a world at once familiar and miraculous .
When a writer shuts himself up in a room for years on end to hone his craft – to create a world – if he uses his secret wounds as his starting point , he is , whether he knows it or not , putting a great faith in humanity .
My confidence comes from the belief that all human beings resemble each other , that others carry wounds like mine – that they will therefore understand .
All true literature rises from this childish , hopeful certainty that all people resemble each other .
When a writer shuts himself up in a room for years on end , with this gesture he suggests a single humanity , a world without a centre .
But as can be seen from my father ’s suitcase and the pale colours of our lives in Istanbul , the world did have a centre , and it was far away from us .
In my books I have described in some detail how this basic fact evoked a Checkovian sense of provinciality , and how , by another route , it led to my questioning my authenticity .
I know from experience that the great majority of people on this earth live with these same feelings , and that many suffer from an even deeper sense of insufficiency , lack of security and sense of degradation , than I do .
Yes , the greatest dilemmas facing humanity are still landlessness , homelessness , and hunger …
But today our televisions and newspapers tell us about these fundamental problems more quickly and more simply than literature can ever do .
What literature needs most to tell and investigate today are humanity ’s basic fears : the fear of being left outside , and the fear of counting for nothing , and the feelings of worthlessness that come with such fears ; the collective humiliations , vulnerabilities , slights , grievances , sensitivities , and imagined insults , and the nationalist boasts and inflations that are their next of kind …
Whenever I am confronted by such sentiments , and by the irrational , overstated language in which they are usually expressed , I know they touch on a darkness inside me .
We have often witnessed peoples , societies and nations outside the Western world – and I can identify with them easily – succumbing to fears that sometimes lead them to commit stupidities , all because of their fears of humiliation and their sensitivities .
I also know that in the West – a world with which I can identify with the same ease – nations and peoples taking an excessive pride in their wealth , and in their having brought us the Renaissance , the Enlightenment , and Modernism , have , from time to time , succumbed to a self - satisfaction that is almost as stupid .
This means that my father was not the only one , that we all give too much importance to the idea of a world with a centre .
Whereas the thing that compels us to shut ourselves up to write in our rooms for years on end is a faith in the opposite ; the belief that one day our writings will be read and understood , because people all the world over resemble each other .
But this , as I know from my own and my father ’s writing , is a troubled optimism , scarred by the anger of being consigned to the margins , of being left outside .
The love and hate that Dostoyevsky felt towards the West all his life – I have felt this too , on many occasions .
But if I have grasped an essential truth , if I have cause for optimism , it is because I have travelled with this great writer through his love - hate relationship with the West , to behold the other world he has built on the other side .
All writers who have devoted their lives to this task know this reality : whatever our original purpose , the world that we create after years and years of hopeful writing , will , in the end , move to other very different places .
It will take us far away from the table at which we have worked with sadness or anger , take us to the other side of that sadness and anger , into another world .
Could my father have not reached such a world himself ?
Like the land that slowly begins to take shape , slowly rising from the mist in all its colours like an island after a long sea journey , this other world enchants us .
We are as beguiled as the western travellers who voyaged from the south to behold Istanbul rising from the mist .
At the end of a journey begun in hope and curiosity , there lies before them a city of mosques and minarets , a medley of houses , streets , hills , bridges , and slopes , an entire world .
Seeing it , we wish to enter into this world and lose ourselves inside it , just as we might a book .
After sitting down at a table because we felt provincial , excluded , on the margins , angry , or deeply melancholic , we have found an entire world beyond these sentiments .
What I feel now is the opposite of what I felt as a child and a young man : for me the centre of the world is Istanbul .
This is not just because I have lived there all my life , but because , for the last 33 years , I have been narrating its streets , its bridges , its people , its dogs , its houses , its mosques , its fountains , its strange heroes , its shops , its famous characters , its dark spots , its days and its nights , making them part of me , embracing them all .
A point arrived when this world I had made with my own hands , this world that existed only in my head , was more real to me than the city in which I actually lived .
That was when all these people and streets , objects and buildings would seem to begin to talk amongst themselves , and begin to interact in ways I had not anticipated , as if they lived not just in my imagination or my books , but for themselves .
This world that I had created like a man digging a well with a needle would then seem truer than all else .
My father might also have discovered this kind of happiness during the years he spent writing , I thought as I gazed at my father ’s suitcase : I should not prejudge him .
I was so grateful to him , after all : he ’d never been a commanding , forbidding , overpowering , punishing , ordinary father , but a father who always left me free , always showed me the utmost respect .
I had often thought that if I had , from time to time , been able to draw from my imagination , be it in freedom or childishness , it was because , unlike so many of my friends from childhood and youth , I had no fear of my father , and I had sometimes believed very deeply that I had been able to become a writer because my father had , in his youth , wished to be one , too .
I had to read him with tolerance – seek to understand what he had written in those hotel rooms .
It was with these hopeful thoughts that I walked over to the suitcase , which was still sitting where my father had left it ; using all my willpower , I read through a few manuscripts and notebooks .
What had my father written about ?
I recall a few views from the windows of Parisian hotels , a few poems , paradoxes , analyses …
As I write I feel like someone who has just been in a traffic accident and is struggling to remember how it happened , while at the same time dreading the prospect of remembering too much .
When I was a child , and my father and mother were on the brink of a quarrel – when they fell into one of those deadly silences – my father would at once turn on the radio , to change the mood , and the music would help us forget it all faster .
Let me change the mood with a few sweet words that will , I hope , serve as well as that music .
As you know , the question we writers are asked most often , the favourite question , is ; why do you write ?
I write because I have an innate need to write !
I write because I ca n’t do normal work like other people .
I write because I want to read books like the ones I write .
I write because I am angry at all of you , angry at everyone .
I write because I love sitting in a room all day writing .
I write because I can only partake in real life by changing it .
I write because I want others , all of us , the whole world , to know what sort of life we lived , and continue to live , in Istanbul , in Turkey .
I write because I love the smell of paper , pen , and ink .
I write because I believe in literature , in the art of the novel , more than I believe in anything else .
I write because it is a habit , a passion .
I write because I am afraid of being forgotten .
I write because I like the glory and interest that writing brings .
I write to be alone .
Perhaps I write because I hope to understand why I am so very , very angry at all of you , so very , very angry at everyone .
I write because I like to be read .
I write because once I have begun a novel , an essay , a page , I want to finish it .
I write because everyone expects me to write .
I write because I have a childish belief in the immortality of libraries , and in the way my books sit on the shelf .
I write because it is exciting to turn all of life ’s beauties and riches into words .
I write not to tell a story , but to compose a story .
I write because I wish to escape from the foreboding that there is a place I must go but – just as in a dream – I ca n’t quite get there .
I write because I have never managed to be happy .
I write to be happy .
A week after he came to my office and left me his suitcase , my father came to pay me another visit ; as always , he brought me a bar of chocolate ( he had forgotten I was 48 years old ) .
As always , we chatted and laughed about life , politics and family gossip .
A moment arrived when my father ’s eyes went to the corner where he had left his suitcase and saw that I had moved it .
We looked each other in the eye .
There followed a pressing silence .
I did not tell him that I had opened the suitcase and tried to read its contents ; instead I looked away .
But he understood .
Just as I understood that he had understood .
Just as he understood that I had understood that he had understood .
But all this understanding only went so far as it can go in a few seconds .
Because my father was a happy , easygoing man who had faith in himself : he smiled at me the way he always did .
And as he left the house , he repeated all the lovely and encouraging things that he always said to me , like a father .
As always , I watched him leave , envying his happiness , his carefree and unflappable temperament .
But I remember that on that day there was also a flash of joy inside me that made me ashamed .
It was prompted by the thought that maybe I was n’t as comfortable in life as he was , maybe I had not led as happy or footloose a life as he had , but that I had devoted it to writing – you ’ve understood … I was ashamed to be thinking such things at my father ’s expense .
Of all people , my father , who had never been the source of my pain – who had left me free .
All this should remind us that writing and literature are intimately linked to a lack at the centre of our lives , and to our feelings of happiness and guilt .
But my story has a symmetry that immediately reminded me of something else that day , and that brought me an even deeper sense of guilt .
Twenty - three years before my father left me his suitcase , and four years after I had decided , aged 22 , to become a novelist , and , abandoning all else , shut myself up in a room , I finished my first novel , Cevdet Bey and Sons ; with trembling hands I had given my father a typescript of the still unpublished novel , so that he could read it and tell me what he thought .
This was not simply because I had confidence in his taste and his intellect : his opinion was very important to me because he , unlike my mother , had not opposed my wish to become a writer .
At that point , my father was not with us , but far away .
I waited impatiently for his return .
When he arrived two weeks later , I ran to open the door .
My father said nothing , but he at once threw his arms around me in a way that told me he had liked it very much .
For a while , we were plunged into the sort of awkward silence that so often accompanies moments of great emotion .
Then , when we had calmed down and begun to talk , my father resorted to highly charged and exaggerated language to express his confidence in me or my first novel : he told me that one day I would win the prize that I am here to receive with such great happiness .
He said this not because he was trying to convince me of his good opinion , or to set this prize as a goal ; he said it like a Turkish father , giving support to his son , encouraging him by saying , ‘ One day you ’ll become a pasha ! ’
For years , whenever he saw me , he would encourage me with the same words .
My father died in December 2002 .
Today , as I stand before the Swedish Academy and the distinguished members who have awarded me this great prize – this great honour – and their distinguished guests , I dearly wish he could be amongst us .

Here 's a helpful article that documents some common pitfalls to avoid when composing XML documents .
Nobody wants to be called an XML Bozo by Tim Bray , the co-editor of the XML specification , right ?
I 'm a little ambivalent about XML , largely due to what John Lam calls " The Angle Bracket Tax " .
I think XSLT is utterly insane for anything except the most trivial of tasks , but I do like XPath -- it 's sort of like SQL with automatic , joinless parent - child relationships .
But XML is generally the least of all available evils , and if you 're going to use it , you might as well follow the rules .

The majority of suicide bombers , like most of the world 's soldiers , have been young men .
Veiled women wired with bombs were seen in Moscow 's theatre siege
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the insurgency in Iraq , where suicide bombings are a near - daily occurrence , have promoted a view of the suicide bomber as a male motivated by a sense of injustice against Islam .
However , some of the most lethal exponents of suicide bombing have been neither male nor Muslim .
Women involved in a series of recent attacks and attempted attacks - including in Jordan and Indian - administered Kashmir - are beginning to undermine this stereotype .
Women bombers were widely used by Tamil Tiger rebels in Sri Lanka , most dramatically in the 1991 assassination of the former Indian Prime Minister , Rajiv Gandhi .
Young women , with no dependents , are said to be among those most commonly chosen for suicide missions by the Tigers .
Women bombers have also been used by Kurdish guerrilla groups operating in Turkey .
Like the Tamil Tigers , the Kurdish groups are motivated more by a secular , nationalistic cause than a religious one .
Experts remain divided over whether female suicide bombers will be more widely deployed by al - Qaeda , whose conservative philosophy restricts women to an auxiliary role in the jihad .
Gender and jihad
For modern militant movements with an Islamic inflection , the advantages of using women as suicide bombers can override cultural arguments against their involvement .
A woman is less likely to be intercepted precisely because she does not match the typical profile of a suicide bomber .
Moreover , her actions generate greater media coverage , arguably boosting the militants ' propaganda battle .
The traditional perception of women as life - givers rather than killers is responsible for much of the shock their attacks create .
Using women [ in suicide attacks ] transgresses on what is acceptable in Arab society
Magnus Ranstorp
Terrorism expert
For the militants , therefore , deploying women suicide bombers remains a fraught tactic - instead of new recruits , it risks attracting revulsion .
Where female suicide bombings succeed in bringing in new recruits , the new militants are as likely to be men as women , according to Dr Laleh Khalili , lecturer in Middle - Eastern politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London .
Witnessing women traditionally associated with domestic duties taking part in frontline militancy operations can have a shaming effect on the men , " impelling more of them to take part " , she says .
Attacks by women also shatter " the male monopoly over jihad " , according to Dr Mustafa Alani , a counter - terrorism expert with the Gulf Research Centre in Dubai .
The martyrs ' paradise - often cited as a reward for suicide attackers - need no longer be a male preserve , he says , warning that attacks involving women are likely to increase , as will their stature within al - Qaeda .
Exception or rule ?
Other experts disagree , arguing that the use of women bombers alienates the conservative Muslim constituency from which the militants draw their support .
Such a reaction seemed to have been intended in Jordan , where officially - sanctioned television pictures showed an alleged woman bomber captured after her explosives failed to detonate .
A failed ' suicide bomber 's ' televised appearance shocked Jordan
Sajida Mubarak Atrous al - Rishawi said she had been hoping to die in the manner of her husband , an Iraqi national alleged to have blown up the Radisson SAS hotel in Amman in November 2005 .
She was not al - Qaeda 's first female recruit - in September 2005 , eight people were killed in the Iraqi town of Talafar by a woman suicide bomber said to have been sent by al - Qaeda .
But the BBC's Middle East analyst Roger Hardy says the network 's occasional use of female bombers defies its conservative ideologues , who have argued that women can best serve the jihad as dutiful wives and mothers to fighters .
Female involvement in al - Qaeda bombings is therefore likely to remain an eye - catching exception rather than becoming a rule , he says .
Magnus Ranstorp , a terrorism expert at the Swedish National Defence College , agrees : " Using women transgresses on what is acceptable in Arab society . "
Secular traditions
But women suicide bombers are better established elsewhere .
Chechen rebel commander Shamil Basayev has long boasted of his regiment of Black Widows , the wives of men apparently killed by Russian forces .
Militants in Indian - administered Kashmir have recruited women
Images of women strapped with explosives and wearing black veils , revealing only their eyes , became icons of the rebels ' bloody hostage - taking operations in Beslan and a Moscow theatre .
During a four - month period in 2003 , six out of seven Chechen suicide attacks were carried out by women .
Their high profile proves the nationalist tradition in the Chechen insurgency has survived despite the inroads made by a more conservative brand of Islam imported into the region by Arab fighters , says the BBC's Roger Hardy .
Female participation in suicide attacks is more influenced by a militant group 's historical roots than by its theological affiliations , according to Dr Khalili .
She says the growing involvement of Iraqi women in al - Qaeda suicide attacks comes as no surprise - for decades under Saddam Hussein 's secular regime , these women enjoyed more rights than most of their Arab counterparts .
Long accustomed to political life , she says , they are now more ready to engage in political violence .
Loving the victims
Anger at losing loved ones to conflict appears to be a major source of motivation among female suicide bombers .
Rajiv Gandhi's assassin carries a garland , moments before the blast
The first suicide bombing by a Palestinian woman in Israel was carried out by a 28 - year - old paramedic , Wafa Idris , in January 2003 .
Her mother later said that her daughter had probably been motivated " by all the wounded people she saw in ambulances " .
Some scientists who have studied suicide bombers say this is not surprising - many of their subjects appear driven more by a love of the victims of perceived injustices than by any hatred of the injustices ' perpetrators .

Another Way for Newspapers to Not Die
Not long ago , we posted here about the supposedly desperate future of newspapers .
Now here ’s a S.F.
Chronicle column by Peter Scheer saying the same thing I tried to say , but Scheer says it better : i.e. , if the future of newspapers is so bleak , why are so many smart people rushing to buy them ?
( The list includes Jack Welch , David Geffen , and as of today , Hank Greenberg . )
But the most interesting point in Scheer ’s article is his proposal for how newspapers can protect their value : by placing a 24 - hour embargo on their original reporting , not allowing it to appear on free Internet sites until a newspaper ’s paying customers have had first crack at it .
“ The point is not to remove content from the Internet , ” Scheer writes , “ but to delay its free release in that venue .
A temporary embargo , by depriving the Internet of free , trustworthy news in real - time , would , I believe , quickly establish the true value of that information .
Imagine the major Web portals —
Yahoo , Google , AOL and MSN — with nothing to offer in the category of news except out - of - date articles from ‘ mainstream ’ media and blogosphere musings on yesterday ’s news .
Digital fish wrap . ”
Imagine the uproar if Scheer ’s proposal were to become real .
We are all very spoiled , getting the world ’s best news delivered to us , free and instantly .
And it is very hard to make people pay for something they ’re used to getting for free .
( Just ask AOL ; on the other hand , we pay plenty now for bottled water . )
From what I know , most newspapers are moving in the opposite direction that Scheer supports .
But it is a very intriguing idea , maintaining the value of a besieged commodity simply by shifting the time frame of its use .
It takes a lot of time and a lot of money to produce good reporting .
Most people who consume good reporting do n’t seem to know this , or care to know it .
But they will certainly figure it out if the good reporting begins to disappear because media owners can no longer provide the kind of product we ’ve become accustomed to getting for free .
Somehow I ca n’t see U.S. citizens willing to support the reporting tax that the U.K. levies to support the BBC .
Compared to that tax , a 24 - hour Internet embargo looks mighty cheap .
Ashley 's parents call her their Pillow Angel , a moniker that is a reference to the love and joy they feel for their nine - year - old daughter and the severe disabilities she has suffered from birth .
She can not sit up , walk or talk , is fed by tube , and , as her parents put it , " stays right where we place her - usually on a pillow " .
Ashley wo n't know this , as she is brain - damaged and has the awareness , her doctors say , of a baby , but she has become the subject of a passionate argument in disability circles and beyond .
Her name is becoming synonymous with the debate about the acceptable limits of medical intervention in the care of disabled people .
The cause of the controversy is the " Ashley Treatment " - a course of surgery and hormone supplements devised for her at her parents ' request and with the blessing of doctors - that will for ever keep her small .
It involves surgical operations , including a hysterectomy , and hormone prescriptions that will , in effect , freeze - frame her body at its current size .
Although she has a normal life expectancy , she will , physically , always be nine years old .
Her growth has been suspended at 4ft 5in ( 1.3 metres ) , rather than the 5ft 6in she would probably otherwise have become .
Her weight will stick at around 75 lb ( 34kg ) rather than 125lb .
This week Ashley 's parents , who have chosen to remain anonymous and have only let it be known that they are " college - educated professionals " living in Washington state , have posted on the internet a lengthy explanation of their desire to stunt her growth .
It is the first time they have given a public account of their actions .
The explanation is accompanied by a gallery of photographs showing Ashley over the years , from her as a smiling baby a few months old , through to today when she is seen nestled in a sheepskin rug .
She was diagnosed , they explain , with brain damage with unknown causes just after birth and has remained at the same developmental level since about three months .
Three years ago she began to show early signs of puberty , and they grew anxious about the impact of fertility and of her rapidly increasing size and weight on the quality of her life .
In discussions with doctors at Seattle Children 's hospital they devised the treatment : removal of Ashley 's uterus to prevent fertility , excision of early buds on her chest so that she would not develop breasts , and medication with high doses of oestrogen to limit her growth by prematurely fusing the growth plates of her bones .
The parents insist that the treatment , carried out in 2004 , was conceived for Ashley 's benefit and not their own ease or convenience .
With a lighter body and no breasts , Ashley will have fewer bed sores and lie more comfortably .
And a smaller Ashley can be cared for and carried .
" As a result we will continue to delight in holding her in our arms and Ashley will be moved and taken on trips more frequently instead of lying in her bed staring at TV or the ceiling all day long , " they write .
But as news about the treatment became known , Ashley 's parents were surprised by the virulence of some of the response .
Comments on chatboards have included : " Ouch - this smacks of eugenics " ; " I find this offensive , truly a milestone in our convenience society " ; " This smells , I can't agree with this " .
Outrage has also been expressed by organisations representing disabled people across the US , with many asking why a course of treatment that would not be countenanced for an able - bodied person should be allowed in this case .
" People have been horrified by the discrepancy , " said Mary Johnson , editor of Ragged Edge , an online magazine for disability activists .
She said she felt for Ashley 's parents and could understand why they had made the decision .
But she feared that the treatment would open a Pandora 's box that could have adverse effects for other children .
" What will now be said in the case of a child with spina bifida , who you could argue has the same physical challenges but whose brain is fully functioning ?
This is very troubling . "
Debate has raged among doctors and medical ethicists .
Jeffrey Brosco of Miami University has co-written an editorial in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine criticising the procedure as an experiment without proper research controls .
" This is a technological solution to a social problem .
I work with severely disabled children and know how hard it is on families , but what we need most is better federal funding so that they can be cared for properly . "
State help for caring for disabled people is available through Medicaid , which is restricted to poor families .
Ashley 's parents would not qualify , and say it is impossible to find carers they can afford .
The ethical row is likely to deepen as the Seattle doctors , led by Daniel Gunther , say they are considering other children for similar treatment , though only after monitoring by the hospital 's ethics committee .
The doctors accept that Ashley 's hysterectomy was contentious , given the dark history of sterilisation of disabled people in Europe and America , and that there were risks involved in the operations and oestrogen doses .
But they argue the benefits outweigh the risks .
Ashley has , they admit , been " infantilised " but question the harm that would do a person whose mental capacity " will always be that of a young child " .
Ashley cannot say what she thinks .
But in a telephone interview with the Guardian last night , her father said that many people had assumed he and his wife had to agonise over their decision .
" We did n't .
It was easy , " he said .
" We clearly saw the benefits to Ashley 's quality of life .
We have also been criticised for harming Ashley 's dignity .
But for us , what would be grotesque would be to allow a fully formed woman to grow up , lying helplessly and with the mentality of a three - month - old . "
Hormones
There is a long history of hormones being used to control growth in children .
In some cases they are used to counteract a hormonal imbalance or genetic disorder .
But there have also been sustained attempts to control body size for cosmetic reasons .
In 1956 MA Goldzieher became the first to report using high doses of oestrogen to treat exceptionally tall girls .
Over ensuing years thousands of tall girls were prescribed oestrogen to prevent them tipping over the 6ft mark , protecting their marriage prospects .
As the stigma against tallness in women has declined , so has the practice , though it still continues .
Boys considered to be shorter than the norm have recently begun to be treated with a growth hormone , often for cosmetic reasons .
US federal restrictions have been loosened , allowing private paediatricians to offer the treatment that can cost up to $ 40,000 a year .

CBS : Bush created ' safe haven ' for terrorism with Iraq invasion
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday May 24 , 2007 Print This Email This
Thursday morning CBS News's Early Show criticized President Bush 's latest justification for the Iraq War as being the first line of defense against al Qaeda , by citing an upcoming Senate Intelligence Committee report which states that the administration was warned before the invasion that a US presence in Iraq would actually increase terrorist influence .
Analyst Paul Kurtz expanded on this criticism , saying , " Prior to our invasion of Iraq ... Iraq was not a fertile ground for terrorist activity , " but that now " we have a safe haven in Iraq for terrorists . "
The administration , says Kurtz , is trying to have it both ways .
When asked directly , " Is the United States winning the war on terror ? "
Kurtz immediately responded , " without a doubt no " and added that " our continued engagement in Iraq is spawning more terrorist activity . "
The following video is from CBS 's Early Show , broadcast on May 24 .

' DC madam ' lawyer : Cheney is n't not on phone records Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday May 23 , 2007 Print This Email This Although ABC
News claimed that an examination of Deborah Jeane Palfrey 's phone records revealed that there were n't any more prominent ex-clients of the DC madam , that has n't stopped the guessing games and rumour mills from working overtime .
" Vice President Cheney is nt not on the phone records of the alleged D.C. Madam , who is accused of running a high - price call - girl ring in Washington , the accused madams lawyer said on Tuesday , " Emily Heil reports for Roll Call .
" But then again , the veep isnt on the list , he said  not necessarily . "

' We are investigating some numbers in the McLean area ... and if that turns something up , he might be called as a witness , ' Sibley said , referring to the Virginia neighborhood that the vice president once called home , " Roll Call reports .
A few weeks ago , DC gossip blog Wonkette gave " [t ] hanks to the 700 people who sent in the latest ' anythings possible ' rumor from angry local blogger Wayne Madsen . "
" ABC News all but dropped the story when Cheney threatened to jam that prop phone three feet up the ass of Brian Ross , " Wonkette mocked .
" That s why the formerly explosive scandal story instead got seven minutes at the end of whatever ABC News show Friday night . "
According to Roll Call , " Palfrey and Sibley expressed disappointment , too , over the shortage of boldfaced names in ABCs reporting on the phone records . "
At his website , Madsen mentioned that CBS late night host David Letterman referred to the Cheney rumour .
" Here 's a story we 're working on now , " Letterman said , according to Madsen 's account .
" Apparently , there are rumors coming out of Washington that Vice President Dick Cheney , when he was the CEO of Halliburton , used to go visit prostitutes .
This could explain why one girl was paid two billion dollars .
I mean , I was thinking about this and Cheney ... I mean , going to a prostitute , that 's ... I mean , I can't believe a good - looking guy like that would ever have to pay for sex , you know what I 'm saying ? "
Wonkette explained why its staffers were " underwhelmed by this rumor . "
" Because even if its a fact , which it probably is , theres no way it would have any impact on Cheneys ' career , ' " Wonkette continued .
" This is a draft - dodging half - human war criminal with a pregnant lesbian daughter who tells senators to fuck themselves and shoots his own friends in the face .
Ordering an outcall hooker is positively innocent compared to the well - known things Cheney does every day . "

In a surprise move , today it was announced that News Corp. ’s Rupert Murdoch ( pictured right ) has made an unsolicited bid for The Wall Street Journal of $ 5 billion .
The Wall Street Journal made an official statement :
" Dow Jones & Company today confirmed that its Board of Directors has received an unsolicited proposal from News Corporation to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Dow Jones common stock and Class B common stock for $ 60.00 per share in cash , or in a combination of cash and News Corporation securities .
The Board of Directors and members and trustees of the Bancroft family , who hold shares representing a majority of the Company 's voting power , are evaluating the proposal .
There can be no assurance that this evaluation will lead to any transaction . "
The implications of the proposed deal are staggering .
Already the world ’s largest media organization , News Corp. owns 175 different newspapers , book publisher HarperCollin , Fox Interactive ( which includes MySpace , IGN , Rotten Tomatoes , AskMen , AmericanIdol.com , Fox.com ) , TV Guide , The Weekly Standard , leading UK television network Sky TV , DirectTV , 20th Century Fox , Fox News , FX ( cable network ) , and the National Geographic Channel .
Murdoch ’s most high profile print media asset is The New York Post , a paper often criticized for its controversial covers , right leaning politics and tabloid tactics ( largely led by its Page Six section ) .
The acquisition of The Wall Street Journal would not only add a hefty amount of blue chip credibility to the News Corp. media fold , but it would also place the leading business news source on the planet in the hands one man .
The Wall Street Journal itself today published a story about the offer , mentioning the Washington Post Co. , the New York Times Co. and Bloomberg as other potential suitors in what could become a heated bidding war .
Nevertheless , many will see the sheer audacity of the offer by News Corp. , a company already on the edge of a media monopoly , as a signal that the deal must not be allowed to close .

Scientology poses as a religion but really is a ruthless global scam -- and aiming for the mainstream
by Richard Behar
This young Russian - studies scholar had jumped from a 10th - floor window of the Milford Plaza Hotel and bounced off the hood of a stretch limousine .
When the police arrived , his fingers were still clutching $ 171 in cash , virtually the only money he had n't turned over to the Church of Scientology , the self - help " philosophy " group he had discovered just seven months earlier .
His death inspired his father Edward , a physician , to start his own investigation of the church .
" We thought Scientology was something like Dale Carnegie , " Lottick says .
" I now believe it 's a school for psychopaths . "
Their so - called therapies are manipulations .
They take the best and the brightest people and destroy them . "
The Lotticks want to sue the church for contributing to their son's death , but the prospect has them frightened .
For nearly 40 years , the big business of Scientology has shielded itself exquisitely behind the First Amendment as well as a battery of high - priced criminal lawyers and shady private detectives .
The Church of Scientology , started by science - fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard to " clear " people of unhappiness , portrays itself as a religion .
In reality the church is a hugely profitable global racket that survives by intimidating members and critics in a Mafia - like manner .
At times during the past decade , prosecutions against Scientology seemed to be curbing its menace .
Eleven top Scientologists , including Hubbard 's wife , were sent to prison in the early 1980s for infiltrating , burglarizing and wiretapping more than 100 private and government agencies in attempts to block their investigations .
In recent years hundreds of longtime Scientology adherents -- many charging that they were mentally of physically abused -- have quit the church and criticized it at their own risk .
Some have sued the church and won ; others have settled for amounts in excess of $ 500,000 .
In various cases judges have labeled the church " schizophrenic and paranoid " and " corrupt , sinister and dangerous . "
Yet the outrage and litigation have failed to squelch Scientology .
The group , which boasts 700 centers in 65 countries , threatens to become more insidious and pervasive than ever .
Scientology is trying to go mainstream , a strategy that has sparked a renewed law - enforcement campaign against the church .
Many of the group 's followers have been accused of committing financial scams , while the church is busy attracting the unwary through a wide array of front groups in such businesses as publishing , consulting , health care and even remedial education .
In Hollywood , Scientology has assembled a star - studded roster of followers by aggressively recruiting and regally pampering them at the church 's " Celebrity Centers , " a chain of clubhouses that offer expensive counseling and career guidance .
Adherents include screen idols Tom Cruise and John Travolta , actresses Kirstie Alley , Mimi Rogers , and Anne Archer , Palm Springs mayor and performer Sonny Bono , jazzman Chick Corea and even Nancy Cartwright , the voice of cartoon star Bart Simpson .
Rank - and - file members , however , are dealt a less glamorous Scientology .
According to the Cult Awareness Network , whose 23 chapters monitor more than 200 " mind control " cults , no group prompts more telephone pleas for help than does Scientology .
Says Cynthia Kisser , the network 's Chicago - based executive director : " Scientology is quite likely the most ruthless , the most classically terroristic , the most litigious and the most lucrative cult the country has ever seen .
No cult extracts more money from its members . "
[ Note : since publication of this article , the Cult Awareness Network has been taken over by Scientology .
Do not contact them ! ]
Agrees Vicki Aznaran , who was one of Scientology 's six key leaders until she bolted from the church in 1987 : " This is a criminal organization , day in and day out .
It makes Jim and Tammy [ Bakker ] look like kindergarten . "
To explore Scientology 's reach , TIME conducted more than 150 interviews and reviewed hundreds of court records and internal Scientology documents .
Church officials refused to be interviewed .
The investigation paints a picture of a depraved yet thriving enterprise .
Most cults fail to outlast their founder , but Scientology has prospered since Hubbard 's death in 1986 .
In a court filing , one of the cult 's many entities -- the Church of Spiritual Technology -- listed $ 503 million in income just for 1987 .
High - level defectors say the parent organization has squirreled away an estimated $ 400 million in bank accounts in Liechtenstein , Switzerland and Cyprus .
Scientology probably has about 50,000 active members , far fewer than the 8 million the group claims .
But in one sense , that inflated figure rings true : millions of people have been affected in one way or another by Hubbard 's bizarre creation .
Scientology is now run by David Miscavige , 31 , a high school dropout and second - generation church member .
Defectors describe him as cunning , ruthless and so paranoid about perceived enemies that he kept plastic wrap over his glass of water .
His obsession is to obtain credibility for Scientology in the 1990s .
Among other tactics , the group :
Retains public relation powerhouse Hill and Knowlton to help shed the church 's fringe - group image .
Joined such household names as Sony and Pepsi as a main sponsor of Ted Turner 's Goodwill Games .
Buys massive quantities of its own books from retail stores to propel the titles onto best - seller lists .
Runs full - page ads in such publications as Newsweek and Business Week that call Scientology a " philosophy , " along with a plethora of TV ads touting the group 's books .
Recruits wealthy and respectable professionals through a web of consulting groups that typically hide their ties to Scientology .
The founder of this enterprise was part storyteller , part flimflam man .
Born
In Nebraska in 1911 , Hubbard served in the Navy during World War II and soon afterward complained to the Veterans Administration about his " suicidal inclinations " and his " seriously affected " mind .
Nevertheless , Hubbard was a moderately successful writer of pulp science fiction .
Years later , church brochures described him falsely as an " extensively decorated " World War II hero who was crippled and blinded in action , twice pronounced dead and miraculously cured through Scientology .
Hubbard 's " doctorate " from " Sequoia University " was a fake mall - order degree .
In a I984 case in which the church sued a Hubbard biographical researcher , a California judge concluded that its founder was " a pathological liar . "
Hubbard wrote one of Scientology 's sacred texts , Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health , in 1950 .
In it he introduced a crude psychotherapeutic technique he called " auditing . "
He also created a simplified lie detector ( called an " E- meter " ) that was designed to measure electrical changes
In the skin while subjects discussed intimate details of their past .
Hubbard argued that unhappiness sprang from mental aberrations ( or " engrams " ) caused by early traumas .
Counseling sessions with the E- meter , he claimed , could knock out the engrams , cure blindness and even improve a person 's intelligence and appearance .
Hubbard kept adding steps , each more costly , for his followers to climb .
In the 1960s the guru decreed that humans are made of clusters of spirits ( or " thetans " ) who were banished to earth some 75 million years ago by a cruel galactic ruler named Xenu .
Naturally , those thetans had to be audited .
An Internal Revenue Service ruling in 1967 stripped Scientology 's mother church of its tax - exempt status .
A federal court ruled in 1971 that Hubbard 's medical claims were bogus and that E - meter auditing could no longer be called a scientific treatment .
Hubbard responded by going fully religious , seeking First Amendment protection for Scien - tology 's strange rites .
His counselors started sporting clerical collars .
Chapels were built , franchises became " missions , " fees became " fixed donations , " and Hubbard 's comic - book cosmology became " sacred scriptures . '
During the early 1970s , the IRS conducted its own auditing sessions and proved that Hubbard was skimming millions of dollars from the church , laundering the money through dummy corporations in Panama and stashing it in Swiss bank accounts .
Moreover , church members stole IRS documents , filed false tax returns and harassed the agency 's employees .
By late 1985 , with high - level defectors accusing Hubbard of having stolen as much as S200 million from the church , the IRS was seeking an indictment of Hubbard for tax fraud .
Scientology members " worked day and night " shredding documents the IRS sought , according to defector Aznaran , who took part in the scheme .
Hubbard , who had been in hiding for five years , died before the criminal case could be prosecuted .
Today the church invents costly new services with all the zeal of its founder .
Scientology doctrine warns that even adherents who are " cleared " of engrams face grave spiritual dangers unless they are pushed to higher and more expensive levels .
According to the church 's latest price list , recruits -- " raw meat , " as Hubbard called them -- take auditing sessions that cost as much as $ 1,000 an hour , or $ 12,500 for a 12 1/2 - hour " intensive . "
Psychiatrists say these sessions can produce a drugged - like , mind - controlled euphoria that keeps customers coming back for more .
To pay their fees , newcomers can earn commissions by recruiting new mem- bers , become auditors themselves ( Miscavige did so at age 12 ) , or join the church staff and receive free counseling in exchange for what their written contracts describe as a " billion years " of labor .
" Make sure that lots of bodies move through the shop , " implored Hubbard in one of his bulletins to officials .
" Make money .
Make more money .
Make others produce so as to make money . . .
However you get them in or why , just do it . "
Harriet Baker learned the hard way about Scientology 's business of selling religion .
When Baker , 73 , lost her husband to cancer , a Scientologist turned up at her Los Angeles home peddling a $ 1,300 auditing package to cure her grief .
Some $ 15,000 later , the Scientologists discovered that her house was debt free .
They arranged a $ 45,000 mortgage , which they pressured her to tap for more auditing until Baker 's children helped their mother snap out of her daze .
Last June , Baker demanded a $ 27,000 refund for unused services , prompting two cult members to show up at her door unannounced with an E - meter to interrogate her .
Baker never got the money and , financially strapped , was forced to sell her house in September .
Before Noah Lottick killed himself , he had paid more than $ 5,000 for church counseling .
His behavior had also become strange .
He once remarked to his parents that his Scientology mentors could actually read minds .
When his father suffered a major heart attack , Noah insisted that it was purely psychosomatic .
Five days before he jumped , Noah burst into his parents ' home and demanded to know why they were spreading " false rumors " about him -- a delusion that finally prompted his father to call a psychiatrist .
It was too late .
" From Noah 's friends at Dianetics " read the card that accompanied a bouquet of flowers at Lottick 's funeral .
Yet no Scientology staff members bothered to show up .
A week earlier , local church officials had given Lottick 's parents a red - carpet tour of their center .
A cult leader told Noah 's parents that their son had been at the church just hours before he disappeared -- but the church denied this story as soon as the body was identified .
True to form , the cult even haggled with the Lotticks over $ 3,000 their son had paid for services he never used , insisting that Noah had intended it as a " donation . "
The church has invented hundreds of goods and services for which members are urged to give " donations . "
Are you having trouble " moving swiftly up the Bridge " -- that is , advancing up the stepladder of en- lightenment ?
Then you can have your case reviewed for a mere $ 1,250 " donation . "
Want to know " why a thetan hangs on to the physical universe ? "
Try 52 of Hubbard 's tape - recorded speeches from 1952 , titled " Ron's Philadelphia Doctorate Course Lectures , " for $ 2,525 .
Next : nine other series of the same sort .
For the collector , gold - and - leather - bound editions of 22 of Hubbard 's books ( and bookends ) on subjects ranging from Scientology ethics to radiation can be had for just $ 1,900 .
To gain influence and lure richer , more sophisticated followers , Scientology has lately resorted to a wide array of front groups and financial scams .
Among them :
CONSULTING .
Sterling Management Systems , formed in 1983 , has been ranked in recent years by Inc. magazine as one of America 's fastest - growing private companies ( estimated 1988 revenues : $ 20 mil- lion ) .
Sterling regularly mails a free newsletter to more than 300,000 health - care professionals , mostly dentists , promising to increase their incomes dramatically .
The firm offers seminars and courses that typically cost $ 10,OOO .
But Sterling 's true aim is to hook customers for Scientology .
" The church has a rotten product , so they package it as something else , " says Peter Georgiades , a Pittsburgh attorney who represents Sterling victims .
" It 's a kind of bait and switch . "
Sterling 's founder , dentist Gregory Hughes is now under investigation by California 's Board of Dental Examiners for incompetence .
Nine lawsuits are pending against him for malpractice ( seven others have been settled ) , mostly for orthodontic work on children .
Many dentists who have unwittingly been drawn into the cult are filing or threatening lawsuits as well .
Dentist Robert Geary of Medina , Ohio , who entered a Sterling seminar in 1988 , endured " the most extreme high - pressure sales tactics I have ever faced . "
Sterling officials told Geary , 45 , that their firm was not linked to Scientology , he says .
but Geary claims they eventually convinced him that he and his wife Dorothy had personal problems that required auditing .
Over five months , the Gearys say , they spent $ 130,000 for services , plus $ 50,000 for " gold - embossed , investment - grade " books signed by Hubbard .
Geary contends that Scientologists not only called his bank to increase his credit card limit but also forged his signature on a $ 20,000 loan application .
" It was insane , " he recalls .
" I could n't even get an accounting from them of what I was paying for . "
At one point , the Gearys claim , Scientologists held Dorothy hostage for two weeks in a mountain cabin , after which she was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown .
Last October , Sterling broke some bad news to another dentist , Glover Rowe of Gadsden , Ala. , and his wife Dee .
Tests showed that unless they signed up for auditing Glover 's practice would fail , and Dee would someday abuse their child .
The next month the Rowes flew to Glendale , Calif. , where they shuttled daily from a local hotel to a Dianetics center .
" We thought they were brilliant people because they seemed to know so much about us , " recalls Dee .
" Then we realized our hotel room must have been bugged . "
After bolting from the center , $ 23,000 poorer , the Rowes say , they were chased repeatedly by Scientologists on foot and in cars .
Dentists are n't the only once at risk .
Scientology also makes pitches to chiropractors , podiatrists and veterinarians .
PUBLIC INFLUENCE .
One front , the Way to Happiness Foundation , has distributed to children in thousands of the nation 's public schools more than 3.5 million copies of a booklet Hubbard wrote on morality .
The church calls the scheme " the largest dissemination project in Scientology history . "
Applied Scholastics is the name of still another front , which is attempting to install a Hubbard tutorial program in public schools , primarily those populated by minorities .
The group also plans a 1,000 acre campus , where it will train educators to teach various Hubbard methods .
The disingenuously named Citizens Commission on Human Rights is a Scientology group at war with psychiatry , its primary competitor .
The commission typically issues reports aimed at discrediting particular psychiatrists and the field in general .
The CCHR is also behind an all - out war against Eli Lilly , the maker of Prozac , the nation 's top - selling antidepression drug .
Despite scant evidence , the group 's members -- who call themselves " psychbusters " -- claim that Prozac drives people to murder or suicide .
Through mass mailings , appearances on talk shows and heavy lobbying , CCHR has hurt drug sales and helped spark dozens of lawsuits against Lilly .
Another Scientology linked group , the Concerned Businessmen 's Association of America , holds antidrug contests and awards $ 5,000 grants to schools as a way to recruit students and curry favor with education officials .
West Virginia Senator John D. Rockefeller IV unwittingly commended the CBAA in 1987 on the Senate floor .
Last August author Alex Haley was the keynote speaker at its annual awards banquet in Los Angeles .
Says
Haley : " I did n't know much about that group going in .
I 'm a Methodist . "
Ignorance about Scientology can be embarrassing : two months ago , Illinois Governor Jim Edgar , noting that Scientology 's founder " has solved the aberrations of the human mind , " proclaimed March 13 " L. Ron Hubbard Day . "
He rescinded the proclamation in late March , once he Iearned who Hubbard really was .
HEALTH CARE .
HealthMed , a chain of clinics run by Scientologists , promotes a grueling and excessive system of saunas , exercise and vitamins designed by Hubbard to purify the body .
Experts denounce the regime as quackery and potentially harmful , yet HealthMed solicits unions and public agencies for contracts .
The chain is plugged heavily in a new book , Diet for a Poisoned Planet , by journalist David Steinman , who concludes that scores of common foods ( among them : peanuts , bluefish , peaches and cottage cheese ) are dangerous .
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop labeled the book " trash , " and the Food and Drug Administration issued a paper in October that claims Steinman distorts his facts .
" HealthMed is a gateway to Scientology , and Steinman 's book is a sorting mechanism , " says physician William Jarvis , who is head of the National Council Against Health Fraud .
Steinman , who describes Hubbard favorably as a " researcher , " denies any ties to the church and contends , " HealthMed has no affiliation that I know of with Scientology . "
DRUG TREATMENT .
Hubbard 's purification treatments are the mainstay of Narconon , a Scientology - run chain of 33 alcohol and drug rehabilitation centers -- some in prisons under the name " Criminon " -- in 12 countries .
Narconon , a classic vehicle for drawing addicts into the cult , now plans to open what it calls the world 's largest treatment center , a 1,400 - bed facility on an Indian reservation near Newkirk , Okla . ( pop. 2,400 .
At a 1989 ceremony in Newkirk , the As- sociation for Better Living and Education presented Narconon a check for $ 200,000 and a study praising its work .
The association turned out to be part of Scientology itself .
Today the town is battling to keep out the cult , which has fought back through such tactics as sending private detectives to snoop on the mayor and the local newspaper publisher .
FINANCIAL SCAMS .
Three Florida Scientologists , including Ronald Bernstein , a big contributor to the church 's international " war chest , " pleaded guilty in March to using their rare - coin dealership as a money laundry .
Other notorious activities by Scientologists include making the shady Vancouver stock exchange even shadier ( see box ) and plotting to plant operatives in the World Bank , International Monetary Fund and Export - Import Bank of the U.S.
The alleged purpose of this scheme : to gain inside information on which countries are going to be denied credit so that Scientology - linked traders can make illicit profits by taking " short " positions in those countries ' currencies .
In the stock market the practice of " shorting " involves borrowing shares of publicly traded companies in the hope that the price will go down before the stocks must be bought on the market and returned to the lender .
The Feshbach brothers of Palo Alto , Calif . -- Kurt , Joseph and Matthew - have become the leading short sellers in the U.S. , with more than $ 500 million under management .
The Feshbachs command a staff of about 60 employees and claim to have earned better returns than the Dow Jones industrial average for most of the 1980s .
And , they say , they owe it all to the teachings of Scientology , whose " war chest " has received more than $ 1 million from the family .
The Feshbachs also embrace the church 's tactics ; the brothers are the terrors of the stock exchanges .
In congressional hearings in 1989 , the heads of several companies claimed that Feshbach operatives have spread false information to government agencies and posed in various guises -- such as a Securities and Exchange Commission official -- in an effort to discredit their companies and drive the stocks down .
Michael Russell , who ran a chain of business journals , testified that a Feshbach employee called his bankers and interfered with his loans .
Sometimes the Feshbachs send private detectives to dig up dirt on firms , which is then shared with business reporters , brokers and fund managers .
The Feshbachs , who wear jackets bearing the slogan " stock busters , " insist they run a clean shop .
But as part of a current probe into possible insider stock trading , federal officials are reportedly investigating whether the Feshbachs received confidential information from FDA employees .
The brothers seem aligned with Scientology 's war on psychiatry and medicine : many of their targets are health and bio- technology firms .
" " Legitimate short selling performs a public service by deflating hyped stocks , " says Robert Flaherty , the editor of Equities magazine and a harsh critic of the brothers .
" But the Feshbachs have damaged scores of good start - ups . "
Occasionally a Scientologist 's business antics land him in jail .
Last August a former devotee named Steven Fishman began serving a five - year prison term in Florida .
His crime : stealing blank stock - confirmation slips from his employer , a major brokerage house , to use as proof that he owned stock entitling him to join dozens of successful class - action lawsuits .
Fishman made roughly $ 1 million this way from 1983 to 1988 and spent as much as 30 % of the loot on Scientology books and tapes .
Scientology denies any tie to the Fishman scam , a claim strongly disputed by both Fishman and his longtime psychiatrist , Uwe Geertz , a prominent Florida hypnotist .
Both men claim that when arrested , Fishman was ordered by the church to kill Geertz and then do an " EOC , " or end of cycle , which is church jargon for suicide .
BOOK PUBLISHING .
Scientology mischiefmaking has even moved to the book industry .
Since 1985 at least a dozen Hubbard books , printed by a church company , have made best - seller lists .
They range from a 5,000 - page sci-fi decology ( Black Genesis , The Enemy Within , An Alien Affair ) to the 40 - year - old Dianetics .
In 1988 the trade publication Publishers Weekly awarded the dead author a plaque commemorating the appearance of Dianetics on its best - seller list for 100 consecutive weeks .
Critics pan most of Hubbard 's books as unreadable , while defectors claim that church insiders are sometimes the real authors .
Even so , Scientology has sent out armies of its followers to buy the group 's books at such major chains as B. Dalton 's and Waldenbooks to sustain the illusion of a best - selling author .
A former Dalton 's manager says that some books arrived in his store with the chain 's price stickers already on them , suggesting that copies are being recycled .
Scientology claims that sales of Hubbard books now top 90 million worldwide .
The scheme , set up to gain converts and credibility , is coupled with a radio and TV advertising campaign virtually un- paralleled in the book industry .
Scientology devotes vast resources to squelching its critics .
Since 1986
Hubbard and his church have been the subject of four unfriendly books , all released by small yet courageous publishers .
In each case , the writers have been badgered and heavily sued .
One of Hubbard 's policies was that all perceived enemies are " fair game " and subject to being " tricked , sued or lied to or destroyed . "
Those who criticize the church journalists , doctors , lawyers and even judges often find themselves engulfed in litigation , stalked by private eyes , framed for fictional crimes , beaten up or threatened with death .
Psychologist Margaret Singer , 69 , an outspoken Scientology critic and professor at the University of California , Berkeley , now travels regularly under an assumed name to avoid harassment .
After the Los Angeles Times published a negative series on the church last summer , Scientologists spent an estimated $ 1 million to plaster the reporters ' names on hundreds of billboards and bus placards across the city .
Above their names were quotations taken out of context to portray the church in a positive light .
The church 's most fearsome advocates are its lawyers .
Hubbard warned his followers in writing to " beware of attorneys who tell you not to sue . . . the purpose of the suit is to harass and discourage rather than to win . "
Result : Scientology has brought hundreds of suits against its perceived enemies and today pays an estimated $ 20 million annually to more than 100 lawyers .
One legal goal of Scientology is to bankrupt the opposition or bury it under paper .
The church has 71 active lawsuits against the IRS alone .
One of them , Miscavige vs. IRS , has required the U.S. to pro- duce an index of 52,000 pages of documents .
Boston attorney Michael Flynn , who helped Scientology victims from 1979 to 1987 , personally endured 14 frivolous lawsuits , all of them dismissed .
Another lawyer , Joseph Yanny , believes the church " has so subverted justice and the judicial system that it should be barred from seeking equity in any court . "
He should know : Yanny represented the cult until 1987 , when , he says , he was asked to help church officials steal medical records to blackmail an opposing attorney ( who was allegedly beaten up instead ) .
Since Yanny quit representing the church , he has been the target of death threats , burglaries , lawsuits and other harassment .
Scientology 's critics contend that the U.S. needs to crack down on the church in a major , organized way .
" I want to know , Where is our government ? " demands Toby Plevin , a Los Angeles attorney who handles victims .
" It should n't be left to private litigators , because God knows most of us are afraid to get involved . "
But law - enforcement agents are also wary .
" Every investigator is very cautious , walking on eggshells when it comes to the church , " says a Florida police detective who has tracked the cult since 1988 .
" It will take a federal effort with lots of money and manpower . "
So far the agency giving Scientology the most grief is the IRS , whose officials have implied that Hubbard 's successors may be looting the church 's coffers .
Since 1988 , when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the revocation of the cult 's tax - exempt status , a massive IRS probe of church centers across the country has been under way .
An IRS agent , Marcus Owens , has estimated that thousands of IRS employees have been involved .
Another agent , in an internal IRS memorandum , spoke hopefully of the " ultimate disintegration " of the church .
A small but helpful beacon shone last June when a federal appeals court ruled that two cassette tapes featuring conversations between church officials and their lawyers are evidence of a plan to commit " future frauds " against the IRS .
The IRS and FBI have been debriefing Scientology defectors for the past three years , in part to gain evidence for a major racketeering case that appears to have stalled last summer .
Federal agents complain that the Justice Department is unwilling to spend the money needed to endure a drawn - out war with Scientology or to fend off the cult 's notorious jihads against individual agents .
" In my opinion the church has one of the most effective intelligence operations in the U.S. , rivaling even that of the FBI , " says Ted Gunderson , a former head of the FBI 's Los Angeles office .
Foreign governments have been moving even more vigorously against the organization .
In Canada the church and nine of its members will be tried in June on charges of stealing government documents ( many of them retrieved in an enormous police raid of the church 's Toronto headquarters ) .
Scientology proposed to give $ 1 million to the needy if the case was dropped , but Canada spurned the offer .
Since 1986 authorities in France , Spain and Italy have raided more than 50 Scien - tology centers .
Pending charges against more than 100 of its overseas church members include fraud , extortion , capital flight , coercion , illegally practicing medicine and taking advantage of mentally incapacitated people .
In Germany last month , leading politicians accused the cult of trying to infiltrate a major party as well as launching an immense recruitment drive in the east .
Sometimes even the church 's biggest zealots can use a little protection .
Screen star Travolta , 37 , has long served as an unofficial Scientology spokesman , even though he told a magazine in 1983 that he was opposed to the church 's management .
High - level defectors claim that Travolta has long feared that if he defected , details of his sexual life would be made public .
" He felt pretty intimidated about this getting out and told me so , " recalls William Franks , the church 's former chairman of the board .
" There were no outright threats made , but it was implicit .
If you leave , they immediately start digging up everything . "
Franks was driven out in 1981 after attempting to reform the church .
The church 's former head of security , Richard Aznaran , recalls Scientology ringleader Miscavige repeatedly joking to staffers about Travolta 's allegedly promiscuous homosexual behavior .
At this point any threat to expose Travolta seems superfluous : last May a male porn star collected $ 100,000 from a tabloid for an account of his alleged two - year liaison with the celebrity .
Travolta refuses to comment , and in December his lawyer dismissed questions about the subject as " bizarre . "
Two weeks later , Travolta announced that he was getting married to actress Kelly Preston , a fellow Scientologist .
Shortly after Hubbard 's death the church retained Trout & Ries , a respected , Connecticut - based firm of marketing consultants , to help boost its public image .
" We were brutally honest , " says Jack Trout .
" We advised them to clean up their act , stop with the controversy and even to stop being a church .
They did n't want to hear that . "
Instead , Scientology hired one of the country 's largest p.r. outfits , Hill and Knowlton , whose executives refuse to discuss the lucrative relationship .
" Hill and Knowlton must feel that these guys are not totally off the wall , " says Trout .
" Unless it 's just for the money . "
One of Scientology 's main strategies is to keep advancing the tired argument that the church is being " persecuted " by antireligionists .
It is supported in that position by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Council of Churches .
But in the end , money is what Scientology is all about .
As long as the organization 's opponents and victims are successfully squelched , Scientology 's managers and lawyers will keep pocketing millions of dollars by helping it achieve its ends .
Mining Money in Vancouver
One source of funds for the Los Angeles - based church is the notorious , self - regulated stock exchange in Vancouver , British Columbia , often called the scam capital of the world .
The exchange 's 2,300 penny - stock listings account for $ 4 billion in annual trading .
Local journalists and insiders claim the vast majority range from total washouts to outright frauds .
Two Scientologists who operate there are Kenneth Gerbino and Michael Baybak , 20 - year church veterans from Beverly Hills who are major donors to the cult .
Gerbino , 45 , is a money manager , marketmaker and publisher of a national financial newsletter .
He has boasted in Scientology journals that he owes all his stock - picking success to L. Ron Hubbard .
That 's not saying much : Gerbino 's newsletter picks since 1985 have cumulatively returned 24 % , while the Dow Jones industrial average has more than doubled .
Nevertheless Gerbino 's short - term gains can be stupendous .
A survey last October found Gerbino to be the only manager who made money in the third quarter of 1990 , thanks to gold and other resource stocks .
For the first quarter of 1991 , Gerbino was dead last .
Baybak , 49 , who runs a public relations company staffed with Scientologists , apparently has no ethics problem with engineering a hostile takeover of a firm he is hired to promote .
Neither man agreed to be interviewed for this story , yet both threatened legal action through attorneys .
" What these guys do is take over companies , hype the stock , sell their shares , and then there 's nothing left , " says John Campbell , a former securities lawyer who was a director of mining company Athena Gold until Baybak and Gerbino took it over .
The pattern has become familiar .
The pair promoted a mining venture called Skylark Resources , whose stock traded at nearly $ 4 a share in 1987 .
The outfit soon crashed , and the stock is around 2 cents .
NETI Technologies , a software company , was trumpeted in the press as " the next Xerox " and in 1984 rose to a market value of $ 120 million with Baybak 's help .
The company , which later collapsed , was delisted two months ago by the Vancouver exchange .
Baybak appeared in 1989 at the helm of Wall Street Ventures , a start - up that announced it owned 35 tons of rare Middle Eastern postage stamps -- worth $ 100 million -- and was buying the world 's largest collection of southern Arabian stamps ( worth $ 350 million ) .
Steven C. Rockefeller Jr. of the oil family and former hockey star Denis Potvin joined the company in top posts , but both say they quit when they realized the stamps were virtually worthless .
" The stamps were created by sand - dune nations to exploit collectors , " says Michael Laurence , editor of Linn 's Stamp News , America 's largest stamp journal .
After the stock topped $ 6 , it began a steady descent , with Baybak unloading his shares along the way .
Today it trades at 18 cents .
Athena Gold , the current object of Baybak 's and Gerbino 's attentions , was founded by entrepreneur William Jordan .
He turned to an established Vancouver broker in 1987 to help finance the company , a 4,500 - acre mining property near Reno .
The broker promised to raise more than $ 3 million and soon brought Baybak and Gerbino into the deal .
Jordan never got most of the money , but the cult members ended up with a good deal of cheap stock and options .
Next they elected directors who were friendly to them and set in motion a series of complex maneuvers to block Jordan from voting stock he controlled and to run him out of the company .
" I 've been an honest policeman all my life and I 've seen the worst kinds of crimes , and this ranks high , " says former Athena shareholder Thomas Clark , a 20 - year veteran of Reno 's police force who has teamed up with Jordan to try to get the gold mine back .
" They stole this man 's property . "
With Baybak as chairman , the two Scientologists and their staffs are promoting Athena , not always accurately .
A letter to shareholders with the 1990 annual report claims Placer Dome , one of America 's largest gold - mining firms , has committed at least $ 25.5 million to develop the mine .
That 's news to Placer Dome .
" There is no pre-commitment , " says Placer executive Cole McFarland .
" We 're not going to spend that money unless survey results justify the expenditure . "
Baybak 's firm represented Western Resource Technologies , a Houston oil - and - gas company , but got the boot in October .
Laughs Steven McGuire , president of Western Resource : " His is a p.r. firm in need of a p.r. firm . "
But McGuire cannot laugh too freely .
Baybak and other Scientologists , including the estate of L. Ron Hubbard , still control huge blocks of his company 's stock .

Pushing Beyond the U.S. :
Scientology makes its presence felt in Europe and Canada
By Richard Behar
Today Hubbard 's minions continue to wreak global havoc , costing governments considerable effort and money to try to stop them .
In Italy a two - year trial of 76 Scientologists , among them the former leader of the church 's Italian operations , is nearing completion in Milan .
Two weeks ago , prosecutor Pietro Forno requested jail terms for all the defendants who are accused of extortion , cheating " mentally incapacitated " people and evading as much as $ 50 million in taxes .
" All of the trial 's victims went to Scientology in search of a cure or a better life , " said Forno , " But the Scientologists were amateur psychiatrists who practiced psychological terrorism " .
For some victims , he added , " the intervention of the Scientologists was devastating . "
The Milan case was triggered by parents complaining to officials that Scientology had a financial stranglehold on their children , who had joined the church or entered Narconon , its drug rehabilitation unit .
In 1986 Treasury and paramilitary police conducted raids in 20 cities across Italy shutting down 27 Scientology centers and seizing 100,000 documents .
To defend itself in the trial , the cult has retained some of Italy 's most famous lawyers .
In Canada , Scientology is using a legal team that includes Clayton Ruby , one of the country 's foremost civil rights lawyers , to defend itself and nine of its members who are to stand trial in June in Toronto .
The charges : stealing documents concerning Scientology from the Ministry of the Attorney General , the Canadian Mental Health Association , two police forces and other institutions .
The case stems from a 1983 surprise raid of the church 's Toronto headquarters by more than 100 policemen , who had arrived in three chartered buses ; some 2 million pages of documents were seized over a two - day period .
Ruby , whose legal maneuvers delayed the case for years , is trying to get it dismissed because of " unreasonable delay . "
Spain 's Justice Ministry has twice denied Scientology status as a religion , but that has not slowed the church ' s expansion .
In 1989 the Ministry of Health issued a report calling the sect " totalitarian " and " pure and simple charlatanism . "
The year before , the authorities had raided 26 church centers , with the result that 11 Scientologists stand accused of falsification of records , coercion and capital flight .
" The real god of this organization is money , " said Madrid examining magistrate Jose Maria Vasquez Honrnbia , before referring the case to a higher court because it was too complex for his jurisdiction .
Eugene Ingram , a private investigator working for Scientology claims he helped get Honrubia removed from the case for leaking nonpublic documents to the press .
In France it took a death to spur the government into action : 16 Scientologists were indicted last year for fraud and " complicity in the practice of illegal medicine " following the suicide of an industrial designer in Lyon .
In the victim 's house investigators found medication allegeally provided to him by the church without doctor 's prescription .
Among those charged in the case is the president of Scientology 's French operations and the head of the Paris - based Celebrity Centre , which caters to famous members .
Outside the U.S. , Scientology appears to be most active in Germany where the attorney general of the state of Bavaria has branded the cult " distinctly totalitarian " and aimed at " the economic exploitation of customers who are in bondage to it . "
In 1984 nearly 100 police raided the church in Munich .
At the time , city officials were reportedly collaborating with U.S. tax inspectors and trying to prove that the cult was actually a profitmaking business .
More recently , Hamburg state authorities moved to rescind Scientology 's tax reduced status , while members of parliament are seeking criminal proceedings .
In another domain , church linked management consulting firms have infiltrated small and middle sized companies throughout Germany , according to an expose published this month in the newsmagazine DER SPIEGEL ; the consultants , who typically hide their ties to Scientology , indoctrinate employees by using Hubbard 's methods .
A German anticult organization estimates that Scientology has at least 60 fronts or splinter groups operating in the country .
German politics appears as well to attract Hubbard 's zealots .
In March the Free Democrats , partners in Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s ruling coalition in Bonn , accused Scientology of trying to infiltrate their Hamburg branch .
Meanwhile the main opposition party , the Social Democrats , has been warning its members in the formerly com- munist eastern part of the country against exploitation by the church .
Even federal officials are being used by the church : one Scientology front group sent copies of a Hubbard written pamphlet on moral values to members of the Bundestag .
The Office of Foreign Minister Hans - Dietrich Genscher unwittingly endorsed the Scientologists ' message : " Indeed , the world would be a more beautiful place if the principles formulated in the pamphlet , a life characterized by reason and responsibility , would find wider attention . "

The Scientologists and Me
[ Sidebar , page 57 ]
For the TIME story , at least 10 attorneys and six private detectives were unleashed by Scientology and its followers in an effort to threaten , harass and discredit me .
Last Oct. 12 , not long after I began this assignment , I planned to lunch with Eugene Ingram , the church 's leading private eye and a former cop .
Ingram , who was tossed off the Los Angeles police force
In 1981 for alleged ties to prostitutes and drug dealers , had told me that he might be able to arrange a meeting with church boss David Miscavige .
Just hours before the lunch , the church 's " national trial counsel , " Earle Cooley , called to inform me that I would be eating alone .
Alone , perhaps , but not forgotten .
By day 's end , I later learned , a copy of my personal credit report -- with detailed information about my bank accounts , home mortgage , credit - card payments , home address and Social Security number -- had been illegally retrieved from a national credit bureau called Trans Union .
The sham company that received it , " Educational Funding Services " of Los Angeles , gave as its address a mail drop a few blocks from Scientology 's headquarters .
The owner of the mail drop is a private eye named Fred Wolfson , who admits that an Ingram associate retained him to retrieve credit reports on several individuals .
Wolfson says he was told that Scientology 's attorneys " had judgments against these people and were trying to collect on them . "
He says now , " These are vicious people .
These are vipers . "
Ingram , through a lawyer , denies any involvement in the scam .
During the past five months , private investigators have been contacting acquaintances of mine , ranging from neighbors to a former colleague , to inquire about subjects such as my health ( like my credit rating , it 's excellent ) and whether I 've ever had trouble with the IRS ( unlike Scientology , I have n't ) .
One neighbor was greeted at dawn outside my Manhattan apartment building by two men who wanted to know whether I lived there .
I finally called Cooley to demand that Scientology stop the nonsense .
He promised to look into it .
After that , however , an attorney subpoenaed me , while another falsely suggested that I might own shares in a company I was reporting about that had been taken over by Scientologists ( he also threatened to contact the Securities and Exchange Commission ) .
A close friend in Los Angeles received a disturbing telephone call from a Scientology staff member seeking data about me -- an indication that the cult may have illegally obtained my personal phone records .
Two detectives contacted me , posing as a friend and a relative of a so - called cult victim , to elicit negative statements from me about Scientology .
Some of my conversations with them were taped , transcribed and presented by the church in affidavits to TIME 's lawyers as " proof " of my bias against Scientology .
Among the comments I made to one of the detectives , who represented himself as " Harry Baxter , " a friend of the victim 's family , was that " the church trains people to lie . "
Baxter and his colleagues are hardly in a position to dispute that observation .
His real name is Barry Silvers , and he is a former investigator for the Justice Department 's Organized Crime Strike Force . ( RB )

Be it in a luxury yacht charter in Phuket or in Indonesia , it is always better that the company constantly updates its list of itineraries in order to provide more travel destinations for its customers and in order to keep up with the trend of the modern generation .
From Komodo to Raja Ampat
And thus , before last year ended , the prominent Nataraja Liveaboard has launched new itineraries , which now explores the parameters of the Indonesian archipelago that ranges from the Komodo to Raja Ampat , and even beyond .
The new cruise ship is fully - equipped with diving and cruising paraphernalia .
Arguably , the brand name Nataraja came from a Hindu connection , which they deemed perfect for wooden yacht ( the spirit and the arts ) .
Each cabin in the 32 - m yacht contains air conditioning system and private bathrooms .
It also features a living room wherein you could enjoy the majestic view outside through its enormous glass windows .
Experiencing Indonesian Wonders Above and Below the Waters
Moreover , various details in the said cruise ship are inspired by the tropical nature of Indonesia and they also added hints of the Indonesian culture aboard .
Anchored on the core concepts of privacy and relaxation , the cruise is also perfect for divers who want to explore the waters of the archipelago both above and beneath .
It also offers charters exclusive for families and dive groups as well .
Five of their itineraries include the Raja Ampat Central and North Diving 8 - 11 Nights , the Raja Ampat Central South Diving 8 - 11 Nights , the Raja Ampat Central and North Snorkelling and Freediving Cruise 7 - 11 Nights , the Raja Ampat to Triton Bay ( Kaimana ) 11 - 12 Nights , and the Spice Island Cruise : raja Ampat to Ambon 9 - 11 Nights .
To give a brief overview , the Raja Ampat Central South Diving Site will take you to famous diving sites and viewpoints including the Misool Eco Conservation Zone while Raja Ampat Central and North Snorkelling and Freediving Cruise will focus in the areas around Wayag .
Kaimana , on the other hand , will take you to far - flung areas of Indonesia with astounding biodiversity .
With outstanding itineraries and remarkable destinations , a trying out a luxury yacht charter in Phuket and in other places worldwide would indeed be an exciting and memorable experience .
JM played a small role on a gargantuan project : contractor working on large SMS sending and routing system .
Of course , JM was n't the only outsider on the project .
The company brought in a whole host of vendors and divided them up into Consultants and Contractors .
Consultants had minimal supervision and an hourly billing rate that could only be expressed using three digits .
Contractors , on the other hand , billed much less per hour and were assigned to work for either a Consultant or an Employee .
Aside from that , and the fact that Consultants all had business cards with incredibly ambiguous job title such " Solution Developer , " " Solution Specialist , " and " Doer of Things " , there was little difference .
JM 's team was responsible for interfacing a web - based user interface with an SMS broadcasting service developed by one of the consultant 's teams .
The web UI would send the service a message with a list of recipients and the service would convert it to individually - addressed SMS messages and then send the messages to the appropriate queue .
Problems kept cropping up with the message broadcast service : clients were complaining about stability and that only a portion of the expected messages were being sent to the appropriate gateway queues .
Naturally , JM 's team was to blame : they were the Contractors and not the Consultants .
They were the ones tasked with coming in during off - peak hours ( 5:00 AM Sunday morning ) to debug the live service .
The first thing they noticed when they came in was that the service was not running as a Service at all -- it was running as an Interactive Windows Application .
I 'm talking the GUI kind of application ; the ones that do n't automatically restart when the computer is rebooted .
That explained stability problem number one .
The main problem was with how the Consultants populated the queues from an individual message : they did it row by row .
Now , keep in mind that the consultant 's service had to handle the constraints of bulk - sending , often times tens of thousands of individual SMS messages per transaction .
Yes , it 's one of those systems used by those " Text 782537 Your $ 1.99 Joke - A - Day Subscription " services .
A " smallish " broadcast of 2,000 messages took about three hours to process .
From a technical perspective , this involved inserting 2,000 rows in a " Queue " table in their Microsoft SQL Server database .
Obviously , the users were not to thrilled about this either , especially when they wanted to broadcast news to their subscribers .
Although the Consultants were very protective of " their " source code , JM was able to get hold of it for debugging purposes .
He found out exactly what was causing the " service " to take so long :
//SQL Query to retreive all unbroadcast messages string sqlCmd = " SELECT o.* , r.* , ... , c.* , u. * " + " FROM Orgs o , Recipients r , Contacts C , " + " ... " + " Groups g , Users u " + " WHERE m. Group_Id = g._Group_Id " + " AND u.User_Id = gu.
User_Id " + " AND ... " + " ORDER BY o. Priority_Code , o.Delivery_Num , ... " ; // Execute SqlCommand DataTable dt = DataHelper.ExecSqlToTable(sqlCmd ) ; // For each row retreived , insert a row into the Queue table for ( int i=0 ; i< dt.
Rows .
Count ; i++) { //Insert Sql command SqlCommand insCmd = DataHelper.CreateCmd( " INSERT INTO Queue ( Sender_Id , Recipient_Id , ... ) " + " VALUES ( @Sender_Id , @Recipient_Id , ... ) ) " ; // Add Parameters to command AppendParam ( insCmd , " @Sender_Id " , dt. Rows [i ] [ " Sender_Id " ] ) ; AppendParam ( insCmd , " @Recipient_Id " , dt. Rows [i ] [ " @Recipient_Id " ] ) ; ... //execute command insCmd.ExecuteNonQuery ( ) ; }
In essence , this process would select a giant set of results from the database , loop through each row , and then insert a new row into another table .
JM knew he could do better and rewrote the procedure to use a single query to handle both the INSERT and the SELECT .
Something like ,
INSERT INTO Queue (...) SELECT ... FROM Messages m , Recipients r , ...
It ran in less than five minutes instead of several hours .
Sadly , since he was " just a Contractor , " his improvement never saw the light of day .
The client instead bought a much faster and clustered database server .
This post is pure provocation , take it as you will .
The left often stresses how wealthy people have superior opportunities in life .
They can save more , avoid debt , buy better educations , they have a better chance to start a company , and so on .
Furthermore this is seen as unfair .
Right ?
To put the point in simple quantitative terms , equity yields an average of about seven percent , while holding debt claims yields a bit over one percent .
Most poor people do n’t hold much equity , or for that matter they tend to take out debt rather than hold it .
Smart rich people stock their portfolios with equity quite heavily .
So on average rich people get richer .
That is even more unfair .
Right ?
OK , to oversimplifiy the numbers just a bit , rich people earn — at least — six to seven times more on their money than do poor people .
Many of the poor earn negative rates of return .
The contemporary left often seeks to remedy this unfairness , but in the meantime it is true true true .
Right ?
So for each extra dollar we leave with rich people , the economy earns six or seven times more in net terms — at least — than if that dollar had been given to the poor .
" The rich people ’s economy " doubles in size about every ten years or so .
" The poor people ’s economy " doubles in size about every sixty years or so , at best .
After sixty years have passed , " the rich people ’s economy " has done at least six times better , relative to its original starting point .
Now trickle - down effects from rich people are possibly quite slight .
If a rich person creates a dollar ’s worth of investment , the consumer surplus and wage - boosting effects from those investments wo n’t be more than 25 cents on the dollar , right ?
That means poor people get …
Well , it depends upon your assumptions .
But how do you feel about this claim ?
" I favor redistribution from the rich to the poor .
It will make the poor better off for a few decades , but no more .
After that point , the poor are worse off , forever , and by more each year . "
Um…oops .
The more you emphasize the unfair differences between the capabilities of the rich and the poor , the more easily you fall into this trap .
Redistribution is good for the poor only in the short run , and we have n’t even considered the traditional negative incentive effects on the rich .
Supply - side economics does n’t have to be about assuming unrealistically large elasticities of substitution on the part of the wealthy .
The real supply side story is about how different social classes use resources in different ways and to achieve different rates of return .
Right ?
The 1974 bestseller Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance begins with the following disclaimer from author Robert Pirsig :
“ [ This book ] should in no way be associated with that great body of factual information relating to orthodox Zen Buddhist practice .
It ’s not very factual on motorcycles , either . ”
Likewise , this article is n’t going to teach you much of anything about Zen Buddhism , and absolutely zero about motorcycles .
But I hope it does provide some insight into effective blogging , or , at a minimum , gets you to think differently about your current notions regarding content and the attention you seek with it .
The Four Noble Truths of Blogging
1. Get Over Your “ Self ”
Buddhists believe that suffering begins with our perception that we are separate and distinct from the rest of reality .
In other words , our own egos make us miserable .
In blogging , the publisher / reader mindset can also cause you unnecessary pain .
The key to successful blogging is an alignment of interests between writer and reader .
It ’s that sweet spot where what ’s good for your readers matches what ’s good for you .
Do n’t focus on having a great blog .
Focus on producing a blog that ’s great for your readers .
2. Free Your Mind
Zen is all about seeing deeply into the nature of things by direct experience .
Blogging that gets noticed and linked to is all about seeing existing information from a unique perspective and writing with a fresh angle .
Zen encourages meditation , and great blogging requires contemplative thought .
If you ’re truly going to get into lateral thinking mode , you ’ve got to step away from the keyboard and think .
Stop surfing , twittering , and reading RSS feeds and go for a walk .
Albert Einstein figured out that time is relative while on a stroll with a friend .
Go do something else and a killer angle for your next blog post may just pop into your head .
3. Detach From Results
Another key to existential angst is an attachment to outcomes rather than simply focusing on excelling in our actions .
This is true for any pursuit , including blogging and social media marketing .
When you focus on the outcome you expect from your content , you are almost invariably failing your readers .
Moreover , while one great piece of content may change your blogging profile immensely , a failure to consistently perform at or near the same level will make you nothing more than a one - hit wonder .
Focus on consistently producing excellent reader - focused content and effectively promoting it .
The results will come .
4 . It ’s Up to You
While still steeped in Buddhist philosophy , Zen is more concerned with attaining wisdom through doing , in that daily life and mundane tasks will teach you more than any sacred text could .
In this way , blogging and Zen are closely aligned — simply showing up and keeping at it will teach you more than anyone else can .
Zen encourages practitioners to learn from teachers and other students to better understand how to attain truth through direct experience .
The blogging community offers a similar environment , but the final breakthrough will always occur in your own mind and be the result of your own actions .
You ’ve got to accept responsibility for your own success .
I ’m sure the story of the origin of Zen can make this point much clearer than I ever could :
Buddha gathered his disciples at a lake on Gridhakuta for instruction .
His adherents sat in a circle about him eagerly awaiting his teachings .
Wordlessly Buddha reached into the muck and pulled up a single lotus flower .
He then held it high for all to see .
Practically everyone was bewildered .
But then the disciple Mahakashyapa began to laugh .
Finally , Buddha handed the lotus flower to Mahakashyapa and said , “ What can be said I have said to you , and what can not be said , I have given to Mahakashyapa . ”
Get it ?
Finnish space scientist Pekka Janhunen proposes a new solar sail made of spinning , electrified wires that would catch the fast - moving solar wind .
A spinning web of electrified wire 30 miles wide may become the spacecraft propulsion system of the future .
A team from the Kumpula Space Center in Finland is proposing a huge electronic sail for spacecraft that may dramatically reduce journey times across the solar system .
The giant sail , which would be twice the length of Manhattan , is made from about 100 wires spun up into a whirling disk .
Electrified by an onboard , solar - powered electron gun , the negatively charged wires repel the positively charged protons of the solar wind , providing thrust .
The solar wind is a high - speed plasma stream blowing outward from the Sun .
The average pressure of the solar wind is miniscule ( a mere 2 nanopascals , or 0.2 grams of weight per square kilometer ) , which explains the need for such a large sail .
" It 's such a small force that it 's really hard to imagine even , " says Pekka Janhunen of the Finnish Meteorological Center , who leads the team behind the concept .
" But it 's still enough to move the spacecraft because it 's doing it continuously over a large area . "
The sail is described ( .pdf ) in the latest issue of physics journal Annales Geophysicae .
Because the wires , or tethers , are thinner than human hair , they can create a sail ( .avi ) that is much larger than a solid surface – up to 30 miles wide .
" The most difficult challenge is posed by the tethers and the tether reels , " says Jahnunen .
" Manufacturing 25 - km - long tethers ( the equivalent of 15 miles long ) thinner than human hair is an engineering challenge , as is development of the mechanics of the reel . "
Results drawn from computer simulations indicate that in an average solar wind , a 440 - pound spacecraft could achieve final speeds of up to 62 miles a second ( or 1.9 billion miles a year ) , allowing a spacecraft to reach Pluto in less than five years .
Because the electric sail needs no propellant or other consumables , it might also provide cheap transportation of raw materials in space .
Now that the feasibility of the concept has been proven , a prototype could be built within two years , says Janhunen .
But technical issues have yet to be overcome , says space scientist Robert Winglee .
" Any kind of proposal that looks towards tapping into the energy of the solar wind is a good idea , but with any kind of system , there are always issues with drawing a current from the ambient plasma , " he says .
" Since you inevitably end up losing power to or exchanging power with the solar wind , you have to be careful with those kinds of technical issues , " says Winglee .
Winglee leads a University of Washington team developing a rival spacecraft propulsion system called the MagBeam , which provides thrust using directed plasma streams that push against a magnetic field carried by a spacecraft .
The MagBeam is intended for short , quick journeys , such as from low - Earth orbit to the moon , or from Earth to Mars , says Winglee .

The new Police and Justice Act , published today , could criminalise legitimate IT security activity .
There are fears among security experts that changes it makes to the Computer Misuse Act will make it illegal to distribute some vital tools .
The new law modifies the Computer Misuse Act of 1990 , the cornerstone of Britain 's anti-hacking law .
The changes make clear for the first time that denial of service attacks are an offence , but they also address the distribution of hacking tools .
The new Act will make a person guilty of an offence " if he supplies or offers to supply any article believing that it is likely to be used to commit , or to assist in the commission of , [ a hacking offence ] " .
The word " article " is defined in the Act to include " any program or data held in electronic form " .
Some software tools commonly used by IT security professionals can also be used for malicious purposes , making the new legislation a cause for concern .
" This applies particularly to dual use tools like nmap , which security professionals use to check if a network is insecure or not and which the bad guys use to scan for insecurities to then attack it , " said Richard Clayton , a member of digital rights group the Open Rights Group and a security researcher at Cambridge University .
" Distributors of this have to decide if the people getting it from them are the good guys or the bad guys . "
Legal argument and uncertainty will surround what exactly constitutes " likelihood " to be used for malicious purposes .
" The Home Office believes that likely is more than 50 per cent , so you have to have a trial within a trial to decide if it is more than 50 per cent likely that distribution is more likely than not to result in an offence being committed , " said Clayton .
The final wording of the legislation is broader than was initially proposed .
A version of the bill published in January 2006 ( 145 page /663KB PDF , at clause 35 ) made the offence contingent upon knowledge or intent that the article would be used for hacking ; but the final version reduced that requirement to a belief that such use is likely .
The legislation may have been broadened as it went through Parliament to ensure that a person can be prosecuted if , for example , he posts software to the internet with a reckless disregard for its use .
Another fear of the new law is that it could be stretched to apply to warnings about security flaws and damage the ability of security firms to warn about third party software security breaches .
" The difficulty in the Act is that it says ' any item ' and people are worried that that might include information about a piece of software 's security vulnerability , " said Clayton .
" If you distribute information about a security vulnerability and the bad guys use it to attack it then the information about that vulnerability might qualify . "
That could then allow software companies themselves to block publication of their products ' flaws .
" There are worries that software companies will use this to stop people publishing information about security flaws , to suppress that because they do n't want the information out , " said Clayton .
Security company Sophos said it did not plan to alter its practices , despite the law change .
" We have no intention of changing our procedures in light of this legislation , " said Carole Theriault , a spokeswoman for Sophos .

Rails ’ ActiveRecord makes it quite easy to ad event callbacks when an object is inserted , updated or deleted :
class User < ActiveRecord :: Base before_create :encrypt_password def encrypt_password do_some_encryption( self [ : password ] ) end end
In SQLAlchemy we can do the same with a MapperExtension :
from sqlalchemy.orm.mapper import MapperExtension class EncryptField ( MapperExtension ) : self.__init__(self , field_for_encryption ) : self . field = field_for_encryption def before_insert ( self , mapper , connection , instance ) : encrypted_value = do_some_encryption( getattr( instance , self. field ) ) setattr ( instance , self .
field , encrypted_value )
When we declare our mapper , we pass an instance of this class to the extension argument .
This can be a single MapperExtension instance , or list of instances ( so we can chain extensions together ) :
users_mapper = mapper ( User , users_table , extension = EncryptField ( ' password ' ) )
If you are using Elixir you have to use the using_mapper_options statement :
class User( Entity ) : has_field ( ' password ' , String ( 50 ) ) using_mapper_options ( extension = EncryptField ( ' password ' ) )
The MapperExtension class provides various methods for you to override , for example before and after insert / update / delete and when the object is retrieved from the database .
OK , but what we really want is something like this :
class User( Entity ) : has_field ( ' password ' , String ( 50 ) ) before_insert ( ' encrypt_password ' ) def encrypt_password ( self ) : self.password = do_some_encryption(self.password )
With Elixir we can do this with a Statement .
Elixir infact is little more than Statements ( DSLs ) on top of SQLAlchemy .
See http://cleverdevil.org/computing/52/ for an excellent introduction to Statements .
First , we need a MapperExtension subclass that handles the before_insert behaviour in a generic way :
from sqlalchemy.orm.mapper import MapperExtension class MapperExtensionProxy ( MapperExtension ) : def before_insert ( self , mapper , connection , instance ) : if has_attr ( instance , ' __before_insert__ ' ) : instance.before_insert ( )
This simply checks if our Entity subclass has the __before_insert__ method ( underscores added to prevent possible name clashes ) and calls that method .
We could do exactly the same with other behaviours , such as after_insert , before_destroy , etc ; see the MapperExtension docs for a list of methods and arguments .
Then , we need to create the Statement class .
This is just a plain Python new - style class :
from elixir.statements import Statement class BeforeInsert ( object ) : def __init__( self , entity , * callbacks ) : add_extension_proxy(entity , ' before_insert ' , callbacks ) before_insert = Statement ( BeforeInsert )
The add_extension_proxy function simply adds the appropriate behaviour to the Entity class , then adds the MapperExtension Proxy object to the list of extensions the Entity has ( that way , we do n’t override other extensions we might want to use ) .
So now we can do this :
class User( Entity ) : has_field ( ' password ' , String ( 50 ) ) before_insert ('encrypt_password ' , 'email_new_user ' ) before_delete ( 'email_ex_user ' ) def encrypt_password ( self ) : self.password = do_some_encryption(self.password ) def email_new_user(self ) : self.send_notification_mail(' Welcome to the system ' ) def email_ex_user ( self ) : self.send_notificiation_mail(' Your account is about to be destroyed , Bye ! ' )
The full code for adding these events to Elixir can be found here .
For those of you fancying an autumn trip to jolly olde England , you might consider SENS 3 .
From the conference website :
You are cordially invited to participate in the third Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence ( SENS ) conference , which will be held from 6 - 10 September 2007 at Queens ’ College , Cambridge .
The purpose of the SENS conference series , like all the SENS initiatives ( such as the journal Rejuvenation Research and the Methuselah Mouse Prize ) , is to expedite the development of truly effective therapies to postpone and treat human aging by tackling it as an engineering problem : not seeking elusive and probably illusory magic bullets , but instead enumerating the accumulating molecular and cellular changes that eventually kill us and identifying ways to repair — reverse — those changes , rather than merely to slow down their further accumulation .
Almost 50 illustrious speakers are already confirmed .
The provisional schedule for the conference is here .
SENS 3 will therefore continue and extend the superlative quality of the first and second SENS conferences , held in 2003 and 2005 .
The calibre of those meetings can be seen from the abstracts [ IABG10 , SENS2 ] , the online audio recordings of the talks [ IABG10 , SENS2 ] and most of all from the proceedings volumes , which were published as volume 1019 of the prestigious Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences and as issues 9 ( 1 ) and 9 ( 2 ) of the high - impact ( IF 8.571 ) journal Rejuvenation Research .
The proceedings of SENS 3 will again be published in Rejuvenation Research , the only international peer - reviewed academic journal focused on the development of technologies to postpone and reverse age - related physical and cognitive decline in mammals and eventually humans .
The meeting will comprise invited talks , short oral presentations of submitted abstracts , and poster sessions .
There will be no concurrent sessions .
Talks will take place in the Fitzpatrick Lecture Hall .
Poster sessions will take place each evening in the conservatory adjacent to the bar , with the customary free alcohol .
The conference will also feature the traditional punting on the Cam : an hour on the Backs for the faint - hearted and an afternoon or evening trip to Grantchester for the rest of us .
All questions should be directed to the main organiser , Aubrey de Grey .
Each time a wave peak hits the atom , the probability that an electron will be progressively released within a few 100 attoseconds increases .
This phenomenon , which was predicted in theory , evaded direct observation for more than four decades -- an international team of scientists has now demonstrated it for the first time .

We have to climb a mountain in order to conquer it .
In quantum physics there is a different way : objects can reach the opposite side of a hill simply by tunnelling through it , instead of laboriously climbing over it .
An international team of researchers working with Prof. Ferenc Krausz from the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics has now observed electrons in this tunnelling process .
This effect is responsible for the ionization of atoms under the influence of strong magnetic fields .
The electrons overcome the attraction of the atomic nucleus by tunnelling through a potential wall .
The scientists used ultra -short laser pulses to show discrete stages of ionization in this process , each of which lasts 100 attoseconds - a fraction of a billionth of a second .
The results make a significant contribution to understanding how electrons move around in atoms and molecules .
The electrical field of a laser pulse exerts a strong force on an electron located at the edge of an atom ( green cloud around the nucleus ) .
This force changes over time .
In approximately only a femtosecond , a trillionth of a second , it changes direction -- at t1 it is strongest towards the right , at t2 it is strongest towards the left and after another femtosecond , at t3 , again towards the right .

In the same way as gravity brings a body to a halt on the floor of a valley , the nuclear force ( which binds protons and neutrons to form the atomic nucleus ) and the electrical force ( which combines negatively charged electrons with the positively charged atomic nucleus to make an atom ) hold these particles within a tiny space .
This binding effect can also be depicted as a type of valley , which is also called a potential by physicists .
In the world of quantum particles , it is , to a certain extent , a normal event to tunnel through the wall surrounding the potential well .
An international team of researchers working with Ferenc Krausz has now caught the electrons in the act of tunnelling through the binding potential of the atom nucleus under the influence of laser light .
The physicists used the new tools provided by attosecond metrology .
" For the first time , our findings confirmed in real time observation the theoretical predictions of quantum mechanics , " says Ferenc Krausz , Director at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics and head of the team of scientists .
The tunnelling effect can be explained by the wave behaviour of each particle .
Macroscopic objects are extremely unlikely to tunnel , which is why the phenomenon has never been observed in them .
In contrast , there is a significant probability that particles from the microcosmos will tunnel through areas where , according to the rules of traditional physics , they are not even supposed to be .
The tunnelling effect is considered to be responsible for processes as varied as atomic nuclei decay and the switching process in electronic components .
However , since it only lasts for an extremely short time , it has not yet been observed in real time .
Krausz and his colleagues have now followed this process live with the aid of two light pulses : an intense pulse of just a few wave trains of red laser light and an attosecond pulse of extreme ultraviolet light perfectly synchronized with the red pulse .
The electrical field of the laser pulses periodically exerts strong forces on the electrons .
When the force is at its strongest , the light force presses the potential wall downwards .
For a short moment when the wave peaks , the electron has the opportunity to penetrate the barrier and escape from the atom .
This opportunity only arises when the wave peaks , that is over an extremely short interval of a fraction of a femtosecond , a trillionth of a second .
There is no instrument that can directly resolve the tunnel effect .
It is only possible to show the existence of the end products , the atoms , which , following the laser pulse , disintegrate into an electron and a positively charged ion .
The researchers therefore had to use the trick of experimenting with neon atoms .
In these , the electrons are in a closed shell , and therefore in particularly strong bonds , and resist the attempts of the laser pulse to release them from the atom .
Only electrons hit by an attosecond flash of UV manage to reach the periphery of the atom and can extricate themselves from the atom by tunnelling .
Therefore , the physicists can only ionize neon atoms with a red laser pulse that they have first prepared with this flash .
" With a UV pulse lasting just 250 attoseconds , which was synchronized exactly with the red laser pulse , we moved an electron at any point in time during the laser wave with attosecond precision to the periphery , " explains Krausz .
Step by step , the researchers shifted this point in time and measured the number of atoms ionized by the laser .
This allowed them to reconstruct the chronology of the ionization process .
As the theory predicted , the electrons left the atoms in the immediate vicinity of the most intense wave peaks , which can be seen clearly from the discrete stages of ionization coinciding exactly with the peaks in fig .
3 ( the green line ) .
The electrons remained at this stage for less than 400 attoseconds .
Within such a short period , the electrons are released from the atom by the light energy .
" The experiments not only provide us with insight into the dynamics of electron tunnelling for the first time , " says Krausz .
" We have also shown that the movement of electrons in atoms or molecules can be observed in real time with the aid of laser field - induced tunnelling . "
Based on this finding and the enabled control over electron movement within the atom , in the future scientists will be able to research how the boundaries of microelectronics can be shifted , or how to develop sources of compact , very bright X - rays .
These will in turn allow progress to be made in the imaging of biological objects and in radiation therapy .

Condom sales and bookings at several of South Korea 's pay - by - the - hour " love motels " surged in the aftermath of North Korea 's nuclear test , according to statistics released in Seoul Thursday .
South Koreans are used to living in the shadow of war , and life has continued as normal across the country in the wake of the Oct. 9 explosion .
But statistics on the number condoms sold in recent weeks suggest that despite their apparently blasÃ© reaction to the North 's nuclear bluster , many South Koreans may be seeking solace in sex .
A leading chain of convenience stores reported Thursday that their condom sales rose to an average of 1,930 a day in the week after Oct. 9 , compared to 1,508 a day for the year to Sept. 30 .
Sales of the prophylactics dropped slightly to 1,772 in the week of Oct. 16 - 21 , but remained well above previous norms .
Another national chain said it sold $ 3,721 US worth of condoms a day during the week after the test — a 14.8 per cent rise over last month 's sales figures , and a 12 per cent rise over the year to Sept. 30 .
It was impossible to know whether the increase in sales was directly linked to a heightened sense of vulnerability or stress among South Koreans .
However , the head of the Korea Institute for Sex Education , Seong Gyeong - won , said it is not uncommon for people to seek comfort in the arms of a lover during times of crisis .
" People tend to have urges to procreate in times of extreme situations , " she said .
" Stress is released through sex â¦ it 's one of the top 10 reasons why sex is good for the body . "
A popular online reservation site for South Korea 's ubiquitous " love motels " - the popular term for lodgings built for clandestine rendezvousâ¦ also reported a rise in bookings immediately after the heightened security threat , according to a report in the mass - circulation newspaper Chosun Ilbo .
The motels are a fixture across South Korea .
In one of the world 's most densely populated countries , where extended families often live together , such accommodations provide a refuge for those seeking discreet intimate encounters .
But those who have n't already made their reservations will have to wait .
The online system says it has no available slots until next month .
In the early hours , two days before the attack on Iraq began , two men in their 30s , Phil Pritchard and Toby Olditch , cut through the fence surrounding the air base at Fairford in Gloucestershire and made their way towards the B52 bombers which were stationed there .
The planes belonged to the US air force .
The trespassers were caught by guards and found to be carrying tools and paint .
They confessed that they were seeking to disable the planes , in order to prevent war crimes from being committed .
This year they were tried on charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage , which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years .
Last week , after long deliberations , the jury failed to reach a verdict .
The same thing happened a month ago .
Two other activists , Margaret Jones and Paul Milling , had entered the same RAF base and smashed up more than 20 of the vehicles used to load bombs on to the B52s .
The charges were the same , and again the jury failed to agree .
In both cases the defendants claimed to be putting the state on trial .
If I were in government , I would be starting to feel uneasy .
The defendants had tried to argue in court that the entire war against Iraq was a crime of aggression .
But in March this year the law lords ruled that they could not use this defence : while aggression by the state is a crime under international law , it is not a crime under domestic law .
But they were allowed to show that they were seeking to prevent specific war crimes from being committed - principally , the release by the B52s of cluster bombs and munitions tipped with depleted uranium .
They cited section 5 of the 1971 Criminal Damage Act , which provides lawful excuse for damaging property if that action prevents property belonging to other people from being damaged , and section 3 of the 1967 Criminal Law Act , which states that " a person may use such force as is reasonable in the prevention of a crime " .
In summing up , the judge told the jurors that using weapons " with an adverse effect on civilian populations which is disproportionate to the need to achieve the military objective " is a war crime .
The defendants are likely to be tried again next year .
While these non-verdicts are as far as the defence of lawful excuse for impeding the Iraq war has progressed in the UK , in Ireland and Germany the courts have made decisions - scarcely reported over here - whose implications are momentous .
Last year , five peace campaigners were acquitted after using an axe and hammers to cause $ 2.5 m worth of damage to a plane belonging to the US navy .
When they attacked it , in February 2003 , it had been refuelling at Shannon airport on its way to Kuwait , where it would deliver supplies to be used in the impending war .
The jury decided that the five saboteurs were acting lawfully .
This summer , the German federal administrative court threw out the charge of insubordination against a major in the German army .
He had refused to obey an order which , he believed , would implicate him in the invasion of Iraq .
The judges determined that the UN charter permits a state to go to war in only two circumstances : in self - defence , and when it has been authorised to do so by the UN security council .
The states attacking Iraq , they ruled , had no such licence .
Resolution 1441 , which was used by the British and US governments to justify the invasion , contained no authorisation .
The war could be considered an act of aggression .
There is no prospect that the British prime minister could be put on trial for war crimes in this country ( although , as the international lawyer Philippe Sands points out , there is a chance that he could be arrested and tried elsewhere ) .
Even so , the government appears to find these legal processes profoundly threatening .
When the Fairford protesters took their request to challenge the legality of the war to the court of appeal , Sir Michael Jay , permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office , submitted a witness statement which seems to contain a note of official panic .
" It would be prejudicial to the national interest and to the conduct of the government 's foreign policy if the English courts were to express opinions on questions of international law concerning the use of force ... which might differ from those expressed by the government , " he wrote .
Such an opinion " would inevitably weaken the government 's hand in its negotiations with other states .
Allied states , which have agreed with and supported the United Kingdom 's views on the legality of the use of force , could regard such a step as tending to undermine their own position . "
It does n't seem to matter how many journalists , protesters or even lawyers point out that the British government had no legal case for attacking Iraq , that the attorney general 's official justification was risible and that Blair 's arguments were mendacious .
As long as the government has a majority in parliament , the support of much of the press and an army of spin doctors constantly weaving and reweaving its story , it can shrug off these attacks .
It can insist , with some success , that we " move on " from Iraq .
But an official verdict , handed down by a court , is another matter .
If a ruling like that of the German federal administrative court were made over here , it could be devastating for Blair and his ministers .
The prosecutors have lost before .
In 1999 , a sheriff ( a junior Scottish judge ) at the court in Greenock instructed the jury to acquit three women who had boarded a Trident submarine testing station on Loch Goil and thrown its computers into the sea .
They had argued that the deployment of the nuclear weapons carried by the submarines contravened international law .
The sheriff said she could not " conclude definitively " whether or not this was true , but that she had " heard nothing which would make it seem to me that the accused acted with criminal intent " .
The court of session in Edinburgh later overturned her ruling .
Now campaigners against nuclear weapons will be mounting further legal challenges , as they try to sustain a continuous peaceful blockade of the Trident base at Faslane for a year ( see www.faslane365.org).
In 1996 , four women were acquitted of conspiracy and criminal damage after disabling a Hawk jet which was due to be sold by BAE to the Suharto dictatorship in Indonesia .
They argued that they were using reasonable force to prevent crimes of genocide that the Indonesian government was committing in East Timor .
Their acquittal might have helped persuade Robin Cook to seek to introduce an " ethical dimension " to foreign policy in 1997 ( he was , as we now know , thwarted by Blair ) .
It is true that such verdicts ( or non-verdicts ) impose no legal obligations on the government .
They do not in themselves demonstrate that its ministers are guilty of war crimes .
But every time the prosecution fails to secure a conviction , the state 's authority to take decisions which contravene international law is weakened .
These cases cannot reverse the hideous consequences of the crime of aggression ( the " supreme international crime " , according to the Nuremberg tribunals ) that Blair and Bush committed in Iraq .
But they do make it harder to repeat .

Does Love at First Sight Exist ?
Before exploring outer space people used to think that the earth was flat and that you could fall off its edge if you ever went that far .
The same goes for everything else that we do n’t understand .
People usually try to associate all unknown facts with things they are familiar with and love is no exception to that rule .
Even though learning about the psychology of falling in love can help you understand why you fall in love and why you love someone but not the other still the majority of people prefer not to read about it and to just think of love as a mysterious process that has no rules .
Love at first sight exists simply because many of us have been through it before .
This article is going to explain to you why you might fall in love with someone at the first sight .
Why Do We Fall in Love ?
I have talked about this topic extensively in this article so I am just going to give a brief explanation about it here .
In most cases , we fall in love to compensate for our unmet needs , when we find someone similar to us , when we find someone who reminds us of a close person we love ( like one of our parents for example ) or when someone meets our unconscious criteria .
The unconscious criteria is simply a list of traits that should be found in a person before we can fall in love with him .
Love at First Sight
If you understood the previous points then you may have already guessed why we sometimes fall in love with someone at the first sight .
We fall in love at the first sight when someone meets most of our unconscious criteria at the first meeting .
For example if a guy had dark skin and really loved his mother then it ’s very likely that his unconscious criteria will include items such as 1 )
She should have white skin and that 2 ) She should be as kind as my mother .
Of course it ’s not that simple ; the criteria can be very complex and can include hundreds of items but I am just simplifying the idea in order for you to easily get it .
( see Why do we like certain people )
What will happen if that guy met a girl who has such traits ?
What if in addition to all that she was attractive as well ?
Most probably that guy will develop an instant crush on her , or as we say , love her at the first sight .
People who fall in love at the first sight usually believe in false ideas like " the one " and " soul mate " .
In my book “ How to get over someone in few days ” i explained how getting rid of such concepts can be a vital step in the recovery from any breakup .
By just understanding how love at the first sight works you are actually helping yourself in getting over such false beliefs .
Love or Best Friends ?
Now the question that may have popped into your mind is “ Why do I sometimes find someone who is absolutely fantastic , has many good traits but i still never love him at the first sight ? ” .
The answer is simple : either because he did n’t match your criteria at all or because you are looking for traits that ca n’t be noticed at the first meeting .
That ’s why people who care much about physical appearance are more likely to experience love at first sight than others .
Because many items in their criteria is dependent on appearance , which is something that can be noticed quickly , they usually fall in love at the first sight .
The earth is not flat and love is not that mysterious .
Read a lot and seek answers so that you can remove these mysteries from you life .
2 knowmyself is , without doubt , the only complete source for the psychology of falling in love on the whole web .
If you dare to challenge this statement then check out the psychology of falling in love section and you will discover it yourself .
The book How to make someone fall in love with you was released by 2 knowmyself.com ; the book will dramatically increase your chance of letting someone fall in love with you .

Editor ’s Note : Guest writer Frank Tipler is a professor of physics at Tulane University .
A recent study shows that Shakespeare is no longer a required course for English majors at the overwhelming majority of American elite universities .
This is not a surprise : most people are well aware that students are no longer taught the basics in the humanities departments .
Unfortunately , the situation is just as bad in physics departments .
At the overwhelming majority of physics departments at American universities , even the most elite , key elements of basic physics are no longer taught .
For example , I am aware of no American university that requires , for an undergraduate degree in physics , a course in general relativity , which is Albert Einstein ’s theory of gravity .
At the overwhelming majority of American universities , including Harvard , M.I.T. and Cal Tech , one is not even required to take a course in general relativity to get a Ph.D. in physics !
As a consequence , most American Ph.D. ’s in physics do not understand general relativity .
If a problem arises that requires knowledge of Einstein ’s theory of gravity , almost all American physicists can only look blank .
This is in spite of the fact that general relativity has been known to be the correct theory of gravity for almost a century .
And it gets worse .
The greatest achievement of physics since World War II has been the discovery of the Standard Model of particle physics , a unified theory of all forces and matter not including gravity .
The electromagnetic force — light and radio waves — and the weak force responsible for radioactive decay , are shown to be two aspects of one force , the electroweak force , by the Standard Model .
The Standard Model also explains how all fundamental particles obtain their mass and it predicts that matter can be directly converted into energy – which hints at a new energy source far more powerful than nuclear energy .
The Standard Model has been experimentally confirmed , and some dozen and more Nobel Prizes in physics have been awarded for the discovery and experimental confirmation of the Standard Model .
Yet I am aware of no physics department in the United States that requires a course in the Standard Model for an undergraduate degree in physics .
Very few , if any , require a course in the Standard Model even for a Ph.D. in physics .
It ’s as if law schools stopped requiring students to take courses in crucial subjects like contracts and property law .
So one can get an undergraduate degree in physics and even a Ph.D. , without knowing anything at all about the fundamental forces that control the universe at the most basic level .
Since our entire civilization requires at least somebody knows basic physics , requires that at least people who have Ph.D. ’s in physics know basic physics , this is a disaster .
If very few physicists know the Standard Model , it is unlikely that anyone will attempt to develop the new source of energy which the Standard Model shows is possible in principle .
The basic reasons why modern physics is not covered in required courses are identical to the basic reasons why Shakespeare is not covered : ( 1 ) the faculty in both cases want to teach their narrow specialty rather than the basic courses in their field , ( 2 ) the faculty members in both cases no longer understand the basic material in their own field , ( 3 ) the faculty no longer believe there are fundamental truths in their own disciplines .
I ’m sure that many members of typical university ’s English faculty no longer have a basic understanding of Shakespeare .
How could they , if they themselves have never taken a course on Shakespeare ?
A degree in English is no longer a guarantee that the degree holder has a basic knowledge of Shakespeare or other great writers .
Similarly , a degree in physics from an American university is no guarantee that the student with this degree understands basic physics .
The physics faculty ’s increasing ignorance of basic physics is starting to show up in their research , as I describe at length in my recent book , The Physics of Christianity ( Doubleday , 2007 ) .
I show that , across all disciplines , a collapse of belief in Christianity over the past several decades among university faculty has been accompanied by a collapse in the belief that there is fundamental truth which should be imparted to students .
Every undergraduate majoring in physics , or at the very least , every graduate student in physics , should be required to take a two - semester sequence : one semester on general relativity , and one semester on the Standard Model .
Both courses have been taught for decades to physics students as an elective , but no physics department will require them .
Once , on my own initiative , I forced a required course on the Standard Model at the graduate level , since I firmly believe that knowledge of the Standard Model should be required for all Ph.D. ’s in physics .
I achieved this by changing a required two - semester graduate course in electromagnetism into a one - semester course in electromagnetism , and a one - semester course on the Standard Model .
I used an undergraduate textbook for the Standard Model course .
The students violently objected .
They did n’t see any reason to learn the Standard Model .
They saw no reason why they should know any basic physics beyond what was standard 50 years ago .
The other faculty backed them up .
This occurred more than 10 years ago , and since then not one Ph.D. student at Tulane has been taught the Standard Model .
The reason the physics faculty backed the graduate students up — supported them in their desire to remain ignorant of the central fundamental theory of physics — is that they themselves were never taught the Standard Model when they were graduate students , and thus they saw no reason to require their own students to learn it .
I was n’t taught the Standard Model either when I was a graduate student — it was in the process of being discovered when I was a graduate student — but it was obviously something every physicist should know , so I taught myself the theory .
These same physics faculty were never taught general relativity either ( I was ; and in fact my Ph.D. thesis was on a problem in general relativity ) , so they see no reason why physics Ph.D. ’s should be taught general relativity .
I fear that in the very near future , education in physics will have to be obtained from some source other than a university .
It is becoming increasingly clear that this corruption of education is probably universal across all disciplines .
If so , then all advanced education will have to be obtained outside of the university .
And if that is the case , then why should universities exist at all ?
Hours after 9/11 attacks , Rumsfeld allegedly said , ' My interest is to hit Saddam ' RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday May 2 , 2007 Print This Email This According to NBC 's chief Pentagon correspondent , former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that his " interest is to hit Saddam Hussein " just hours after the attacks on September 11 , 2001 , " even though all indications pointed at al - Qaida as the guilty party , " a Rhode Island newspaper reports .
At the annual Business Expo at the Rhode Island Convention Center Tuesday , NBC's Jim Miklaszewski " advanced a theme garnering attention since former CIA director George J. Tenet made his public revelations last week , " writes Tom Mooney for the Providence Journal .
" Some things are right on the mark , when he says the Bush administration appeared predisposed to attack Iraq , " Miklaszewski says of Tenet 's book At the Center of the Storm .
The NBC correspondent 's " information " comes from " off the record " notes given to him from an unidentified person who was " in the White House situation room in the hours after the attacks . "
" However , the notes describe , Miklaszewski said , then - Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld vowing to avenge the terrorist attacks by voicing frustration that attacks against the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983 and the attack on the Cole , in 2000 , had gone unavenged , " Mooney writes .
" Reading from his notes , Miklaszewski quoted Rumsfeld as saying five hours after the terrorist attacks : ' My interest is to hit Saddam Hussein at the same time we go after al - Qaida . ' "
Excerpts from article : # " We ought not to look only " at Osama bin Laden , Rumsfeld allegedly said before holding a conference call with President Bush .
During the conversation , " Rumsfeld says not to focus solely on al - Qaida , consider all those range of options .
And the president 's response was yes . "
Said Miklaszewski : " So there is no question that Tenet got the time wrong [ with meeting Perle in the White House ] but there is no question in my mind , and with subsequent conversations I had with officials in the Pentagon , that the Bush administration had their sights set on attacking Saddam Hussein and Iraq long before there was even an effort to gather any evidence ... that Saddam Hussein was involved in the attack .
And all the evidence says quite the opposite . "

But people could n't believe how much butter went in them .
" Six sticks ! " said Craig , after Raife and Alex consumed five cupcakes between them .
" Six sticks of butter ! "
( For the record : that 's three sticks in the batter , three sticks in the icing . )
The article mentioned that people attack Ina for her weight and I 'm not here to talk about how much Ina weighs , but it is remarkable how much fat Ina uses in her recipes .
On one hand I really admire her for it : while the rest of the world is Atkins-ing and South Beach-ing , Ina 's having a butter party on her Hamptons estate .
On the other hand , though , watching her on TV I sometimes want to scream out : do n't you ever cook anything that does n't require a cardiologist ?
Not every recipe needs a gallon of fat to make it taste good .
Why is Ina so undisciplined in the fat department ?
I have an answer and you will find it in the next paragraph .
One word : caterer .
Think about it .
Ina worked as a caterer at the start of her career and when you 're catering a party or event you do n't care about health , you care about umph .
You want people to groan with pleasure as they eat your coconut cupcakes and vow to hire you for their son 's Bar Mitzvah , wedding , and funeral ( all of which , if they keep eating your food , may happen at the same time . )
Ina knows that fat makes food taste good so she uses lots of it .
Lots and lots of it .
It 's a business decision .
It sells cookbooks because people see your recipes on TV , they try them , and they come out great and they buy your books and call you a genius .
Hell : that 's exactly what I did when I started this blog ;
The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook is the most used cookbook on my shelf .
I love it .
But I 'm starting to realize a Barefoot Contessa diet is unsustainable , unless I want to go to an early grave .
Am I exaggerating ?
Let me whip out her book and go through it recipe by recipe to see how much fat there is .
Ok , her roasted eggplant spread has only 3
Tbs olive oil , her lobster salad had 1 /2 cup of mayonnaise , her crab cakes have 4
Tbs of butter and olive oil plus 1/2 cup mayonaisse and 2 - extra large eggs .
Maybe that 's not so bad .
That seems reasonable , normal proportions for those recipes .
But then we get to her pan - fried onion dip : 4
Tbs butter , 1/ 4 cup vegetable oil , 4 ounces cream cheese , 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayonnaise .
Jeesh !
Her sun -dried tomato dip : 8 oz cream cheese , 1 / 2 cup sour cream , 1/2 cup mayonnaise .
Her cheddar corn chowder has 8 oz .
bacon , 1/ 4 cup olive oil , and 2 cups of half and half plus 1/2 pound sharp white Cheddar cheese .
Are you getting the picture ?
Sure there are healthy recipes scattered around -- fat - free gazpacho , for example -- but those are n't the ones you 're going to make .
You 're going to make her outrageous brownies which have 1 POUND of butter and 1 POUND of chocolate .
Or her pecan squares which ( oh my God , I never even noticed how much fat there is in this recipe ) have 1 1/4 pounds butter in the crust and 1 pound of butter in the topping .
No wonder I 've been cooking these recipes for so long : I 've been fooled by fat .
Look , I do n't begrudge Ina her old catering habits .
They work .
They make food taste good and that 's a great way to get people cooking .
But now that I 've been cooking for three years I need to cook things that I can eat every day .
Curried cous cous salad ?
That 's ok .
But lamb sausage in puff pastry ?
I 'll save that for my last rights .
And I 'll eat that along with her lobster pot pie , which has 8 Tbs of butter and 8 Tbs of lard in the crust .
Today I saw Heidi Swanson 's beautiful new cookbook , Super Natural Cooking at Barnes & Noble and I 'm ready for it to change my life .
Only there are two cakes cooling right now in my kitchen .
They 're filled with lemon zest and sugar and buttermilk and , oh yeah , two sticks of butter .
Oh , Ina , you 've got me wrapped around your bejeweled little finger .
You lured me in with fat and now I never want to leave .

According to a recent poll on Daily Fuel Economy Tip , nearly 80 % of people believe that oil and gasoline companies have manipulated the supply of gas in order to cause prices to shoot through the roof .
When asked , “ Do you believe oil and gasoline companies have manipulated the supply of gas to cause prices to increase ? ” 79 % of respondents stated yes ; 16 % stated no ; and 5 % stated that they were unsure .
It ’s pretty easy to see how so many people could believe that gasoline prices have been manipulated :
The price of oil has remained relatively constant since the beginning of the year while gas prices are up over 40 % – and it seems we set a new record high with each passing day .
Sporadic problems at refineries throughout the country that have caused major supply issues , not to mention there have n’t been any new refineries built ( which would increase capacity / supply ) in many years .
These huge multi-national corporations continue to rake in record billion dollar profits in the face of rising energy costs .
I think it ’s this last item – the record profits – that ’s causing so many people to be upset by the rising price of gasoline and lead them to believe that we ’re just being gouged .
It would be one thing if profits decreased or even remained flat in the face of rising costs to produce gasoline , however these profits have seemingly increased , both in percentage and dollars .
If it were n’t for these incredibly high profits , I think people would still be upset about paying more at the pump , however , they ’d probably be a lot less suspicious too .
Personally , I ’m in the minority here because I do n’t think that oil companies have purposefully reduced supply to increase prices .
While I voted that I was n’t sure , I think the increased prices have more to do with the continued world - wide increase in demand for gasoline than it does with any conspiracy .
While there seems to be a lot of evidence pointing towards gouging , I think much of it is circumstantial .
However , the one thing that keeps me believing in the possibility of price manipulation is the fact that these companies know that even as prices shoot up we ’re still going to drive our cars just as much as we did before .
That being said , this probably would have also been the case 15 years ago when we were paying $ 1.25 per gallon .
Why did n’t they jack up prices then too ?
Long story short , I have no idea what to believe , but it certainly seems like most of us feel that we ’re being screwed .
WASHINGTON – An odd- looking Canadian coin with a bright red flower was the culprit behind the U.S. Defence Department 's false espionage warning earlier this year , the Associated Press has learned .
The odd - looking – but harmless – " poppy coin " was so unfamiliar to suspicious U.S. Army contractors travelling in Canada that they filed confidential espionage accounts about them .
The worried contractors described the coins as " anomalous " and " filled with something man-made that looked like nano - technology , " according to once - classified U.S. government reports and e-mails obtained by the AP .
The silver - coloured 25 - cent piece features the red image of a poppy – Canada 's flower of remembrance – inlaid over a maple leaf .
The unorthodox quarter is identical to the coins pictured and described as suspicious in the contractors ' accounts .
The supposed nano - technology actually was a conventional protective coating the Royal Canadian Mint applied to prevent the poppy 's red color from rubbing off .
The mint produced nearly 30 million such quarters in 2004 commemorating Canada 's 117,000 war dead .
" It did not appear to be electronic ( analog ) in nature or have a power source , " wrote one U.S. contractor , who discovered the coin in the cup holder of a rental car .
" Under high power microscope , it appeared to be complex consisting of several layers of clear , but different material , with a wire like mesh suspended on top . "
The confidential accounts led to a sensational warning from the Defence Security Service , an agency of the Defence Department , that mysterious coins with radio frequency transmitters were found planted on U.S. contractors with classified security clearances on at least three separate occasions between October 2005 and January 2006 as the contractors travelled through Canada .
One contractor believed someone had placed two of the quarters in an outer coat pocket after the contractor had emptied the pocket hours earlier .
" Coat pockets were empty that morning and I was keeping all of my coins in a plastic bag in my inner coat pocket , " the contractor wrote .
But the Defence Department subsequently acknowledged that it could never substantiate the espionage alarm that it had put out and launched the internal review that turned up the true nature of the mysterious coin .
Meanwhile , in Canada , senior intelligence officials expressed annoyance with the American spy-coin warnings as they tried to learn more about the oddball claims .
" That story about Canadians planting coins in the pockets of defence contractors will not go away , " Luc Portelance , now deputy director for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service , wrote in a January e-mail to a subordinate .
" Could someone tell me more ?
Where do we stand and what 's the story on this ? "
Others in Canada 's spy service also were searching for answers .
" We would be very interested in any more detail you may have on the validity of the comment related to the use of Canadian coins in this manner , " another intelligence official wrote in an e-mail .
" If it is accurate , are they talking industrial or state espionage ?
If the latter , who ? "
The identity of the e-mail 's recipient was censored .
Intelligence and technology experts were flabbergasted over the warning when it was first publicized earlier this year .
The warning suggested that such transmitters could be used surreptitiously to track the movements of people carrying the coins .
" I thought the whole thing was preposterous , to think you could tag an individual with a coin and think they would n't give it away or spend it , " said H. Keith Melton , a leading intelligence historian .
But Melton said the Army contractors properly reported their suspicions .
" You want contractors or any government personnel to report anything suspicious , " he said .
" You can't have the potential target evaluating whether this was an organized attack or a fluke . "
The Defence Security Service disavowed its warning about spy coins after an international furor , but until now it has never disclosed the details behind the embarrassing episode .
The U.S. said it never substantiated the contractors ' claims and performed an internal review to determine how the false information was included in a 29 - page published report about espionage concerns .
The Defence Security Service never examined the suspicious coins , spokeswoman Cindy McGovern said .
" We know where we made the mistake , " she said .
" The information was n't properly vetted .
While these coins aroused suspicion , there ultimately was nothing there . "
A numismatist consulted by the AP , Dennis Pike of Canadian Coin & Currency near Toronto , quickly matched a grainy image and physical descriptions of the suspect coins in the contractors ' confidential accounts to the 25 - cent poppy piece .
" It 's not uncommon at all , " Pike said .
He added that the coin 's protective coating glows peculiarly under ultraviolet light .
" That may have been a little bit suspicious , " he said .
Some of the U.S. documents the AP obtained were classified " Secret / Noforn , " meaning they were never supposed to be viewed by foreigners , even America 's closest allies .
The government censored parts of the files , citing national security reasons , before turning over copies under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act .
Nothing in the documents – except the reference to nanotechnology – explained how the contractors ' accounts evolved into a full - blown warning about spy coins with radio frequency transmitters .
Many passages were censored , including the names of contractors and details about where they worked and their projects .

But there were indications the accounts should have been taken lightly .
Next to one blacked - out sentence was this warning : " This has not been confirmed as of yet . ''
The Canadian intelligence documents , which also were censored , were turned over to the AP for $ 5 under that country 's Access to Information Act.
Canada cited rules for protecting against subversive or hostile activities to explain why it censored the papers .
Associated Press writer Beth Duff - Brown contributed to this story from Toronto .
Most of the nation remained in the grip of a heat wave today , with high temperatures in the 90’s and 100 ’s prevailing across all but the northernmost states , straining electric power grids and disrupting some transportation links .
Meanwhile , a tropical depression formed today off the coast of North Carolina , and a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern part of the state .
Meteorologists said the depression could strengthen into a tropical storm as early as this evening , and would be named Beryl if the wind reaches 39 miles per hour .
Relief was expected in the Northeast later in the day as a cold front was expected to move into the region .
But the interaction of cooler air with the hot humid air mass now hanging over region may produce strong to severe thunderstorms in the afternoon and evening .
Cooler weather and thunderstorms were also expected in the upper Midwest and Great Lakes regions .
Temperature will range from the 70’s in northern Minnesota and Michigan ’s Upper Peninsula to over 100 in parts of South Dakota , Kansas and Nebraska .
One of the more difficult decisions to make in an IT development project is how much analysis of requirements is required before any actual coding is done .
Actually , I ’ll make a minor adjustment to that statement : in a perfect world , knowing how much analysis and discussion of requirements is required is not a completely straightforward decision .
I am deeply suspicious of anyone who resides at either end of the spectrum of this dilemma – all the more so when they prove to be intractable in their views .
Whether there ’s an Agile / XP evangelist saying let ’s just jump in and start coding without actually analysing what we ’re trying to achieve or some hidebound bureaucrat who is n’t happy until everyone is bleeding from the eyes ( and probably still wants to keep going even then ) – sticking to some orthodoxy no matter what is likely to end badly .
So what does this BA think is the ideal amount of analysis ?
You should do as much analysis as is required but no more than that .
That statement is n’t half as glib as it might seem .
The real issue is that “ how much analysis is required ? ” is the wrong question .
The right question is “ What are we trying to achieve ? ”
And just to head off the Agile zealots , I ’m not talking about definitively answering “ what will the end product be ” before starting any coding .
The important thing for the business to know before they start wasting developers ’ times is what are the desired outcomes ?
Not how it ’s going to be done but what the business needs to achieve for the project to be a success .
As a BA , it ’s a constant struggle to stop people on the business side from leaping straight to “ We should use this software and have this sort of widget and all the buttons should be cornflower blue . ”
At the early stages when the scope of a project is being set , the analysis should ideally be limited to “ what do we want to achieve and why is it important ? ”
In almost all cases these conversations can and should be completely technology - neutral so there ’s no need to drag developers into endless brain - storming sessions .
When it comes down to it , the non -IT side of a business should almost never consider technology when analysing requirements for IT projects .
That ’s the role of the technical team .
Scope - level discussion should almost always steer clear of technical issues ( apart from any mandatory compatibility issues ) but even documentation of detailed Business Requirements and Functional Specifications can be done without focusing on technical details .
These documents should be telling you exactly what their names suggest : outcomes the business requires and what functions the system will have to perform to deliver on those requirements .
Both of these can be analysed in depth without dictating the technology to be used .
So at the end of the day , the “ right ” amount of analysis is going to differ from situation to situation .
If you ’re following an Agile - type approach with rapid iterations then analysis probably only needs to progress to the scope level .
Define what outcomes you want at the level of “ this is in – this is out ” and go for it .
But be very wary of anyone telling you any up - front analysis or design is too much .
How can you possibly know when you have succeeded if you have nothing to measure your output against ?
While I lean towards much more analysis that the average Agile devotee would advocate , I ’d run a mile from anyone who wants to saddle me with crippling never - ending design and analysis processes .
Nothing will crush the life out of a worker like a death march with no end in sight .
If you ca n’t define what it is you actually want to achieve then you need more analysis .
If you are in the 10th hour of meetings to discuss what particular shade of green will most inspire customers without having developed a functional prototype to see if the solution is even viable then you are wasting valuable time and brain power with analysis paralysis .
Do what is required .
Nothing more .
Nothing less .

Archbishop
Tutu said there were more pressing issues
He said they should spend time on more pressing issues in the region .
Speaking to the BBC World Service , the South African bishop said Zimbabwe , HIV / Aids and the crisis in Darfur were not getting sufficient attention .
Zimbabwe 's Anglican church also lacked courage to stand up to President Robert Mugabe 's regime , he said .
' So many issues '
This was the 76 - year - old Nobel peace laureate touching raw nerves for the Anglican church in Africa on very sensitive subjects .
In his usual forthright manner , Archbishop Tutu told the BBC that the Anglican communion was spending too much of its time and energy on debating differences over gay priests and same sex marriages - a subject , he said , that had now become " an extraordinary obsession " .
He said : " We've , it seems to me , been fiddling whilst as it were our Rome was burning .
At a time when our continent has been groaning under the burden of HIV / Aids , of corruption .
The church had " kow - towed " to Mr Mugabe 's regime , he said
" There are so many issues crying out for concern and application by the church of its resources , and here we are , I mean , with this kind of extraordinary obsession . "
For Archbishop
Tutu , the crisis in Zimbabwe was one such issue that had been eclipsed by the sexuality debate .
He said he was saddened by the muted response other African governments had shown to the Mugabe regime .
Growing tensions
But he also said that leaders of his own Anglican Church in Zimbabwe had failed to show more courage in dealing with the Zimbabwean president .
" One seems to have to say they have kow - towed to President Mugabe .
Certainly there 's not been anything like the same kind of standing up to the evil and exercising the prophetic ministry that one would have expected from the church , and that has been very distressing . "
There are growing tensions within the worldwide Anglican communion - pitching liberals against conservatives - mainly over the issue of sexuality .
But as Archbishop
Tutu recognised , there are other points of contention that need to be resolved and other issues that the church , especially in Africa , needs to turn its attention to .
Two years after the stock ownership deal , the company sold General Motors a complicated security that effectively gave it a 26 percent stake in Avis .
Apart from that , Avis ’s employee ownership experiment lasted nine years , until 1996 , when Avis sold itself to a company called HFS .
Employees got an average of $ 26,000 each .
Eighty or 90 current and former Avis executives got an average of $ 1.75 million each .
A year later , in 1997 , HFS took Avis public .
( The initial public offering raised just over $ 330 million .
The banker Bear Stearns charged $ 15 million for its services . )
In 1999 , Avis bought PHH .
Remember PHH ?
That was the company Avis sold its fleet leasing operation to in 1987 .
PHH was owned by Cendant , a company that had been formed in 1997 by the merger of HFS — right , the company that had spun off Avis in 1997 — and another company called CUC .
HFS had retained 19 percent of the company ’s stock when it took Avis public .
With the stock portion of Avis ’s purchase price for PHH , Cendant now owned 34 percent of Avis .
A couple of years later , Cendant bought the roughly two - thirds of Avis that it did n’t already own and made Avis a wholly owned subsidiary .
In 2006 , Cendant split itself into four independent companies , one of which was the Avis Budget Group .
( Somewhere along the line , Cendant had also acquired Budget Rent a Car. )
The Avis Budget Group became the parent company of Avis Budget Car Rental .
Modern capitalism has two parts : there ’s business , and there ’s finance .
Business is renting you a car at the airport .
Finance is something else .
More and more of the news labeled “ business ” these days is actually about finance , and much of it is mystifying .
Even if you can understand — just barely — how it works , you still wonder what the point is and why people who do it need to get paid so much .
And you strongly suspect that the swirl of financial activity around Avis for the past six decades has had little or nothing to do with the business of renting cars .
Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) have outlined a system to transmit power wirelessly to electronic devices in the home .
The project is being developed by Assistant Professor Marin Soljacic from the Department of Physics and Research Laboratory of Electronics , who is collaborating with graduate student Aristeidis Karalis and Professor John Joannopoulos .
The team has not yet built a test system , but their plan is based around physics that have been around since the 19th century , and computer simulations of the system indicate that it would work .
Other wireless power systems include Nikola Tesla 's long - range wireless energy experiment , the Wardenclyffe Tower ( which ended when he ran out of funding ) ; directional energy transfer such as lasers ; and induction - based energy transfer systems such as the charger for electric toothbrushes .
MIT 's team hopes to improve upon these existing systems with their own solution , a type of longer - range induction , based on the resonance of an electromagnetic field .
Outside of smaller applications , such as charging your toothbrush , this is something typically used in radio antennas .
However , a radio antenna is inefficient for transferring energy because it broadcasts radio waves in all directions regardless of other devices — a waste of energy if used for powering devices wirelessly .
To remedy this , the researchers designed an emitter to make use of long - lived resonances with " non-radiative " objects .
This keeps the energy close to the antenna until another object with a similar resonance comes within range — no broadcasting into space is necessary .
The two resonating objects can sync their frequencies easily , which would then cause energy to " tunnel from one object to another , " Professor Soljacic told the BBC .
When not transferring energy to another device , " most " unused energy simply gets reabsorbed into the emitter .
The MIT team 's system is designed for use in a home or office , as it can transfer energy to other devices within 3 to 5 meters of the emitter .
However , the antenna 's range does n't have to be limited to just that , says Professor Soljacic .
" This would work in a room let 's say but you could adapt it to work in a factory , " he said , adding that it could also be scaled down to be used on a microscopic level as well because the range would be determined by the size of the emitter .
The applications for such a system are obvious : laptops , cell phones , and other battery - powered devices that need constant recharging would be able to recharge themselves .
Soljacic theorizes that one emitter in every room of the house would be enough to power most household devices in your home .
There are other , perhaps less obvious uses for the emitter though .
Soljacic is also apparently the proud owner of a Roomba ( the vacuuming robot ) , which he feels would be able to make good use of such a powering mechanism .
" It does a fantastic job but , after it cleans one or two rooms , the battery dies , " he said , adding that more sophisticated , freely - roaming robots in , say , a factory pavilion could also recharge themselves wirelessly while within range of an emitter .
And we thought that we'd be able to stop the robots when they ran out of power ...

The Flow Caml system is a prototype implementation of an information flow analyzer for the Caml language .
It has been publicly announced on 2003 - 07 -01 .
It consists in an extension of the OCaml with a type system tracing information flow .
Its purpose is basically to allow to write " real " programs and to automatically check that they obey some confidentiality or integrity policy .
In Flow Caml , standard ML types are annotated with security levels chosen in a user - definable lattice .
Each annotation gives an approximation of the information that the described expression may convey .
Because it has full type inference , the system verifies , without requiring source code annotations , that every information flow caused by the analyzed program is legal with regard to the security policy specified by the programmer .
Technically speaking , Flow Caml is also one of the first real - size implementations of a programming language equipped with a type system that features simultaneously subtyping , ML polymorphism and full type inference .
Flow Caml handles a large part of the OCaml language , including datatypes and pattern - matching , imperative features ( mutable objects , exceptions , ... ) , and the module language .
It can be used either as a standalone , batch - oriented compiler that produces regular OCaml code , or as an interactive , toplevel - based system .
If you are interested in experimenting Flow Caml , but you encounter some difficulties , please feel free to contact me .
Distribution
The source distribution of version 1.07 is available for download .
It should compile on almost any UNIX machine ( including the Cygwin environment ) , where GNU Make and OCaml 3.12 are installed .
More information about installation can be found in the files README and src-flowcaml / INSTALL of the distribution .
A binary distribution of version 1.01 for Windows operating systems is also provided .
It should run " out of the box " , without installing any extra software : uncompress the ZIP archive somewhere in your file system and run flowcaml .exe to start the toplevel .
Read - only CVS access to the whole sources is available through the Caml anonymous CVS server .
The Flow Caml system is distributed under the terms of the Q Public License ( see the LICENSE file of the distribution for the details ) .
Documentation
A documentation of the Flow Caml system is available on this server .
It includes a comprehensive tutorial which introduces the various features of the language and its type system .
It has been written in the purpose to be understable by everyone who has some knowledge in programming in Caml ( or another ML dialect ) .
Sarah Silverman tosses her long black hair and bares her perfect teeth .
She steps up to the microphone , demure as a schoolgirl on the witness stand .
The crowd tenses .
' I do n't want to belittle the events of September 11 - they were devastating .
They were beyond devastating ....'
She stops ; words can't express her pain .
' I do n't want to say especially for these people , or especially for those people but ... especially for me .'
She lowers her sleek eyebrows .
The audience in the little North Hollywood theatre takes a nervous breath .
Her voice gets gritty : ' Because it happened to be the same exact day that I found out that the soy chai latte was , like , 900 calories . '
There 's a titter .
I 'm thinking - you can't do this in America ?
Can you ?
' I had been drinking them every day . '
She shakes her head .
' You know , you hear soy , you think healthy ...
And it 's a lie . '
Words fail her .
Pause .
Regather .
' It was also the day we were attacked ...'
The audience pauses , on the brink : they could go one way or another .
Then the laugh comes .
Silverman has been booed off stage for this gag , but here on the West Coast this stuff works .
You can sense the crowd patting itself on the back at its unshockability .
So she pushes them a bit further : ' Positive spin !
Take something tragic and make it something good !
If American Airlines were smart their slogan would be : American Airlines .
First through the towers .'
I was raped by a doctor ...
Which is so bittersweet for a Jewish girl .
Her default persona is goofy Jewish American Princess .
It makes the material all the more shocking : no one so dopey - cute and girl - next - door has ever been so nasty .
She does Holocaust jokes , Martin Luther King jokes , Aids jokes and lots on Jewish girls and sex - chiefly anal sex and abortion .
If she has a staple comedic form , it 's obscenity delivered with a cosy flirtatiousness .
' Last night I was licking jelly off my boyfriend 's penis ' - big kooky smile - ' and all of a sudden I thought - Oh my God !
I 'm turning into my mother !'
Her first broadcast gag was about the US legislation imposing a 24 - hour cooling - off period after someone seeks to terminate a pregnancy .
' I think it 's a good law , ' she said .
' The other day I really , really wanted to get an abortion .
I totally did .
But then I thought about it and it turned out I was just thirsty ...'
Those teeth work hard for her act : the super - clean smile takes the toxic edge off the jokes .
With each gag that the audience masters , she makes it a little harder , like you train a dog to do tricks .
Many Silverman fans ( and the people who think she is the best thing happening today in American comedy include a range of slightly off - centre stars , from Moby to Mandy Moore and Jack Black ) hold up one song she does to explain their love for her .
It shows just how far she 'll go into the dangerous swamps where irony meets racism - and what fun she has splashing around there .
It starts like this :
' I love you more than bears love honey , I love you more than Jews love money , I love you more than Asians are good at math , I love you more than black guys do n't tip ...'
You can find a clip on the net of her doing the song , strolling across a car park in a mini-dress strumming her guitar like a pop video from 1982 .
Just as she blithely delivers the line : ' Maybe it 's like when black guys call each other niggers ...' she finds herself face - to - face with two big , unsmiling black guys .
The guitar stops , her grin drops , they stare her out , she looks like she 's going to cry , they start to laugh , she laughs too , they stop laughing and fix her with the stare again .
She crumbles .
It 's an epic of white urban angst encapsulated in 20 seconds .
I do n't care if you think I 'm racist , I just want you to think I 'm thin .
Silverman 's big break came as a result of America 's problem with defining what racism actually is .
The story 's a good a lesson , too , in the rule that if you want to get on in showbiz , you might consider getting into trouble .
It 's 2001 .
Sarah Silverman is an LA circuit comic trying to get a big break .
She 's known for being enterprisingly obscene .
She 's 30 and has been on the scene over a decade , doing OK : lots of stand - up , morsels of TV work ( Seinfeld , The Larry Sanders Show , Star Trek : Voyager ) some bit parts in good movies ( The Way of the Gun , There 's Something About Mary ) .
Usually she plays the supporting star 's girlfriend .
Her real - life boyfriends are always comics and usually more famous than her .
But because she 's cute and talks dirty she gets regular guest spots on late - evening network TV talk shows - she makes those middle - aged male presenters blush .
So in July 2001 she 's doing a third - guest spot on Conan O'Brien 's show .
She tells how she got selected for jury duty , which was a pain - she did n't want to do it .
' So I 'm filling out the form .
And my friend said , " Why do n't you just write something really inappropriate , like I hate Chinks ? "
And I said , " Yeah , that 's a good idea . "
But I do n't want people to think that of me , you know ?
I just wanna get out of jury duty .
So I just filled out the form , and I wrote , " I love Chinks . "
And who does n't ? '
O'Brien buried his head in his hands but rode over it .
However , within days the NBC network , inundated by complaints , had to make an abject apology .
As the row brewed , Silverman appeared on a televised face - off with Guy Aoki , the chair of an Asian - American lobby group which maintained that the ' racial slur ' had offended millions of people .
She said that the joke was not racist , but about racism , and then , unusually , lost her cool and called Aoki ' a douchebag ' .
Aoki was generally judged to have won the encounter : Silverman says she will never again make the mistake of defending her material .
Though Silverman came off worse in that run-in with the PC nation , the episode gave her career a crucial push forward .
Suddenly , in the welter of LA wannabes , she had an identity .
She was the Jewish comic who does racism .
And she was an underdog liberal , bullied by the politically correct .
In the blog world and in the media Sarah Silverman was suddenly a player in America 's great cultural war .
Naturally enough , the episode became a part of the stage act .
She tells the North Hollywood audience how she got into trouble for saying the word ' Chink ' on a talk show and how the Asian - American watchdogs called her a racist and it was reported everywhere .
' It hurt .
Yeah .
As a Jew - as a member of the Jewish community - I was really concerned that we were losing control of the media .
Right ?'
She became a regular on the cable channel Comedy Central .
Better movie parts arrived - like in the 2003 hit School of Rock : sure , she 's still playing girlfriends ( Jack Black 's room - mate 's here ) , but she has a real ( and nasty ) character .
Silverman performed on last year 's documentary The Aristocrats , which watched comedians telling the legendary , obscene gag of that name that has for decades been a secret handshake among comics .
Silverman 's version was the rawest , not least because in it she announces , in the tone of someone ' recovering ' a traumatic memory in therapy , that a grand old showbiz figure , Joe Franklin ( think Jimmy Savile ) , molested her as a child .
Franklin subsequently threatened to sue .
Conscious of the gains to be had from offending Middle America , her next touring stage show was titled ' Jesus is Magic ' and the mainstream papers - never much interested in stand - up - came to review her .
' Sarah Silverman is the funniest woman alive ! ' announced Rolling Stone .
The LA Times and the other critics could find only one comedian for comparison - the tragic Sixties baiter of the bourgeoisie , Lenny Bruce , who was driven to suicide after being persecuted by the authorities for his ' obscene ' stage show .
Silverman started getting better work - suddenly she was a comedian 's comedian , in the club .
If my boyfriend [ who's a Catholic ] and I ever have a kid , we 'll just be honest with it .
We 'll say that Mommy is one of God 's chosen people , and Daddy believes that Jesus is magic !
Last November a feature - film version of Jesus is Magic , featuring sketches and footage from that North Hollywood live show of 2004 , got a limited release in the States ( not in the Bible Belt ) and some acclaim in the liberal media .
Entertainment Weekly put her on its ' Entertainers of the Year ' list and Rolling Stone put her on its cover .
Profiles and essays resulted in publications as august as The New Yorker and The American Prospect .
What the movie does reveal is two distinct comedians : a navigator of highly complex landscapes of irony who is also a gross - out , bottom - burp - loving comic to rival Adrian Edmondson or the Little Britain team .
The Sarah Silverman who has essayists hailing her experiments with taboo as post - modern performance art is the same Sarah Silverman who closes her stage act with a rousing Amazing Grace in three - part harmony - with three microphones .
The first is at her mouth , the second at her groin .
Her bum sings the bass part .
Among the more solemn dissections of her act , one stood out as quite sensible .
Sam Anderson , writing for online magazine Slate , announced a label for her ( along with Ali G and the kids from South Park ) : meta - bigot .
' Meta - bigots work at social problems indirectly ; instead of discussing race , rape , abortion , incest , or mass starvation , they parody our discussions of them .
They manipulate stereotypes about stereotypes .
It 's a dangerous game : if you 're humourless , distracted , or even just inordinately history - conscious , meta - bigotry can look suspiciously like actual bigotry . '
I dated a guy who was half - black , but he totally dumped me because I 'm such a loser .
Wow !
I just heard myself say that .
I am such a pessimist ...
He 's actually half - white .
Silverman is the third of four sisters from a liberal , middle - class New Hampshire Jewish family .
Her mother was a drama teacher and encouraged her to perform : her father , who had a clothing shop chain , taught her off - colour jokes .
( ' My dad is one of those dads who thought it was hilarious to teach his daughter swear words , you know .
The first thing I said was " bitch , bastard , damn , shit " - that was what my dad taught me ...
I got such a positive reaction at such an early age ! ')
One of her sisters became a rabbi , and wrote a book called Jewish Family & Life : Traditions , Holidays and Values for Today 's Parents and Children .
Her parents divorced when she was seven .
Sarah was a teenage bed - wetter - she announces this gleefully in her act - and she is pretty open too about the acute panic attacks she used to suffer .
She did some serious drugs , too , as a teenager and in her early twenties .
She 's still a four - times - a - week pot smoker and , since she was 24 , 11 years ago , she has never been off anti-depressants .
As a schoolgirl she did am - dram - she played the title role in Annie - and watched all the comedy she could .
' I love Steve Martin ' was painted on her bedroom ceiling .
She started doing stand - up gigs in her teens - her family remembers a performance at a local Mexican restaurant whose highlight was a song ' Mammaries ' , to the tune of ' Memories ' , about her lack of breasts .
She left New York University after just a year , a move sanctioned by her father , to pursue a life as a stand - up on the comedy circuit .
Three years later , in 1993 and aged 22 , she had a big break - too early , perhaps , and too big .
She was hired by the TV show Saturday Night Live , then , as now , American comedy 's prime forcing - ground for new talent .
She worked with Mike Myers and Adam Sandler , but her jokes rarely made the show and she was sacked .
She moved to LA , and began the hard labour of TV bit-parts and gigs at the Hollywood Improv comedy club that eventually led to that night on Conan O'Brien .
Most American comics hail their British antecedents - the Pythons , Cleese , Benny Hill ( always more popular beyond these shores ) , Rowan Atkinson .
But Sarah 's heroes are Woody Allen and Steve Martin .
Asked to name women , she comes up with Joan Rivers , Paula Poundstone , Barbra Streisand and Ellen DeGeneres , but her ' all - time favourite funny woman , no contest ' was the character actress Ruth Gordon , best known for the movie Harold and Maude , who died in 1985 .
The only Brits she admires are Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders .
Silverman has never been to Britain - she told me in an e-mail conversation we had that she 's been studying Madonna to try and get the British accent right , should Jesus is Magic get a release here .
' I 'm dying to go .
Though I 've been told I should pack a lunch ...'
If she comes , she 's of course welcome to stay with us ( my wife says I 'm obsessed ) and the first thing I want to show her is BBC3's godawful Tittybangbang , possibly the duffest women - comics ' sketch show in history .
We 'll watch the grim repetitive sketches about nymphomaniac pathologists having sex with corpses and a woman whose silicone - filled breasts leak and women who are fat ( Silverman does n't do fat - women jokes - it 's the only place she wo n't go : ' Because all women feel like they are fat women inside , in America anyway .
And also because fat women are seen so differently as fat .
Like fat men still deserve love . ')
And then I will begin a short lecture - which I 'm sure Sarah will find interesting - titled :
What happened to women 's comedy in Britain ?
An opinion poll carried out last year by BMRB to list Britain 's funniest women came up with 20 , four of them dead ( anyone for Hylda Baker ? ) , and none under 40 .
The youngest was Caroline Aherne , co-writer and star of the late - Nineties hit , The Royle Family , who has done little since .
Other than Aherne and the actress Kathy Burke , every woman on the list had peaked in the Eighties or earlier .
Again and again women stars seem to rise from stand - up , burn fast in TV comedy , then disappear .
Pamela Stephenson was the first such example from the modern age ; Doon Mackichan and Rebecca Front represented the best of groundbreaking Nineties TV comedy like The Day Today and its spin - offs .
They were teamed with names like Steve Coogan , Patrick Marber , Armando Iannucci and Chris Morris - but of all of those , the women have progressed least .
It 's a long - standing curse - what happened to Connie Booth , Monty Python regular and co-writer and co-star of Fawlty Towers ?
There was a golden age of the female stand - up which coincided with the latter years of Britain 's only female prime minister .
Women comics do well in politically charged times and , in the late Eighties and early Nineties , stand - ups driven by the fierce engines of feminism and anti-Toryism seemed for a moment to be at the cutting edge of humour in this country .
' There was a tiny crack and the doors opened , ' says Jenny Eclair , perhaps the funniest and certainly the fiercest of the ' hairy armpit ' wave , comics like Jo Brand , Jo Caulfield , Hattie Heyridge and Rhona Cameron , now more often found on the safer shores of Radio Four .
' We changed female comedy , ' says Eclair , ' and for a while it was very modern and fashionable .
It was our job and we did it well .
But people get tired of that - " Jenny Eclair talking about periods and Jo Brand talking about fat " - and I got jaded of being this sour monkey jumping about increasingly desperately .
Women 's stand - up has never got out of the ghetto - there 's no female Eddie Izzard , able to go beyond sexuality , boyfriends , periods and weight .
Though I still think there 's room for a great period joke ...'
Some other great funny women whose careers were born in that era have done better - but most comics would call Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French primarily character actors .
Victoria Wood , who was a stand - up with a penchant for considerable obscenity , according to legend , is now best known for writing middle - aged TV sitcom with Dinnerladies and Acorn Antiques .
Stand - up comedy is even more a masculine domain than television .
Women are a tiny part of the scene .
For instance , the bill for March 's Glasgow International Comedy Festival features four women solo acts among over 30 male ones .
Some of the men , too , have been around a very long time - Arnold Brown , for instance , is on the bill : he won the Perrier Comedy Award when I was on the judging panel for it at the Edinburgh Festival 19 years ago .
Only two solo women ( Eclair and , in 2005 , Laura Solon ) have ever won the Perrier in its 25 - year history .
If anything , women stand - ups are becoming rarer - in the nine years before Solon 's victory , 36 men and only one woman were nominated .
Women 's short shelf - life in comedy is in part explained by the fast track offered by TV to female talent - any woman whose head rises over the parapet of ' actually quite funny ' on the stand - up circuit is instantly nabbed by TV execs desperate to improve the gender balance of their comedy line - ups .
They do n't often come back .
Comedy critic Bruce Dessau deplores the trend , but can understand it .
' TV is a safe haven , there 's a guaranteed paycheck , and lots of stand - ups have to take it .
There 's two female comics in the cast of Coronation Street at the moment . '
With TV taking the cream , says Dessau , the material done by women on the stand - up circuit is ' pretty safe and bland ' .
( Jenny Eclair is ruder : ' I think it 's become very light , very frothy - very pixyish . ')
Dessau sees a few bright sparks - Shazia Mirza , for instance .
But generally men are taking the form forward .
And what I 've seen on the stand - up circuit backs that up .
There are a lot of women trying to out - bloke the blokes , with gross - out comedy the model - try Debra - Jane Appleby .
There 's some good work in the ' my life ' story - telling genre , exemplified by Glasgow landlady Janey Godley .
Some of the funniest traditional , free - form stand - up comes from visiting Australians like Kitty Flanagan .
Men outnumber women similarly in stand - up in the States , but women seem to make more of a splash .
This is part explained by the fact that American mainstream television is far less welcoming to potentially offensive comedy than it is in Britain - it wo n't take the risks .
So American comics like Silverman and Elizabeth Cho , who want to do material about sex and drugs , stay on the circuit much longer , polishing and refining , dipping their toe into TV with bit - part work to pay their bills , but using DVD and now cable TV as a means of circulating their adult stage material more widely , just as Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy did with their ' in - concert ' videos before them .
Silverman has two advantages comics here perhaps do n't - she performs to a nation still a little more innocent , still capable of being challenged by comedy .
Her other is that she does n't do characters - or rather she does only one character - the beyond - Sarah , the Frankenstein Sarah .
' I actually think of it as a character , ' she says .
' I mean , I do n't have a weird voice or always have to be angry .
I 'm completely myself on stage .
I talk the way I talk and I move the way I move , but inside , I think she 's more obnoxious , ignorant yet arrogant . '
Silverman achieves something no British female stand - up since Victoria Wood has done , which is to create a wholly feasible comic persona , a stage self , who remains intact from show to show .
Male comics like Eddie Izzard do it all the time - female comics , it seems , are n't given the the chance .
I 've got a long neck .
It 's the best of my many good features .
Swan - like .
It 's six inches , when flaccid .
The key to the character is that it has nothing to do with realism .
She is a monster .
Silverman seems keen to make sure you realise that .
Which is why Jesus is Magic , the movie version , has a framing device that pictures Sarah squarely as an egocentric freak with scarily schizo tendencies .
It ends with a scene where Sarah , having finished the stage show , arrives in her dressing room .
' You 're fucking amazing ! ' she breathes at herself , in a dressing - room mirror , and then starts to kiss her reflection .
' You 're a star - and I 'm a star - fucker ! '
Soon the two Sarahs are snogging so hard that you expect them to start undressing each other .
It 's a surprisingly raunchy moment .
It 's a way of saying : Laugh but do n't touch ; I 'm weirder than you think .
And watching it you realise that Silverman has put something back into contemporary comedy that it badly needed - fear .

Klar , diese Statistik ist nicht repräsentativ , da bei heise .
de hauptsächlich Fachleute , PC - Freaks u.ä. vorbeischauen .
Aber das sind genau die Leute , die sich auskennen .
Und von denen nutzt die Mehrheit , wie man hier sehen kann , inzwischen nicht mehr den Internet Explorer – mit einer eindeutigen Tendenz .
Das ist die interessante Aussage daran .
Aber auch bei Websites wie spiegel .de kommt der Firefox auf über 30 % Anteil , am Wochenende sogar auf über 40 % .
Man beachte aber auch , dass solche Statistiken generell ungenau sind .
Vom Internet Explorer rate ich ab , da dieser veraltet und fehlerhaft ist , bei den Standards hinterher hinkt und deutlich weniger Komfort und Funktionen bietet .
Mit Version 7 verbesserte sich das zwar , aber das Niveau der anderen Browser erreicht er immer noch nicht .
Das sehen auch Fachmagazine so :
„ Alles in allem ist Firefox ein kompakter , einfach zu bedienender , aber schneller und erweiterbarer Browser , der den Internet Explorer locker in die Tasche steckt . “ – c't Magazin 21/04
„ Internet Explorer 7 schließt im Vergleich zum Vorgänger ein paar Lücken , bleibt aber deutlich hinter anderen Browsern zurück . “ – c't Magazin 22/06
„ Firefox 2.0 ist die beste Firefox - Version aller Zeiten und baut den Vorsprung zum Internet Explorer [ 7 ] erneut aus . “ – onlinekosten .de , 24.10.2006
Der Internet Explorer 8 hat „ im Vergleich zu den anderen Browsern noch nicht die Spitzenposition erreicht , sondern lediglich den Abstand zu den Führenden verringert . “ – iX 3/2009

My sixty - fifth podcast is up , recorded on the floor RailsConf2007 here in Portland , Oregon .
In this episode I sit down with Martin Fowler of Thoughtworks and David Heinemeier Hansson of 37signals and talk about beauty , making developers happy , the death ( or life ) of HTML , the future of Microsoft , and I ask if we should care about Rich Internet Applications .
DHH is the creator of the Ruby on Rails framework , and Martin Fowler is the Chief Scientist at ThoughtWorks , well - known systems architect and Extreme Programming expert .
This episode is chock full of goodness and good guests , so it 's double the ordinary length , clocking in at over 40 minutes , so forgive me , as all three of us tried not to waste the listener 's time .

This Is Very Important
George Tenet claims in his new book that the Downing Street Memo " misquoted " Richard Dearlove .
Dearlove , then - head of British intelligence , is referred to in the memo as " C " :
C reported on his recent talks in Washington .
There was a perceptible shift in attitude .
Military action was now seen as inevitable .
Bush wanted to remove Saddam , through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD .
But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy .
Sidney Blumenthal has now written something about this that — if true — is a giant bombshell :
Tenet 's account of the July 20 , 2002 , meeting of CIA officials and British intelligence officers in Washington is misleading , according to a former high CIA official with firsthand knowledge , who described it to me as " total bullshit . "
That meeting was important as the basis of the subsequent briefing of Prime Minister Tony Blair that took place at Downing Street three days later , summarized in the famous so - called Downing Street memo .
In the memo , Sir Richard Dearlove , chief of MI6 , is quoted : " Military action was now seen as inevitable ...
Bush wanted to remove Saddam , through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD . "
Even more ominously , Dearlove warned that " the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy . "
Tenet writes that Dearlove told him he was misquoted and that Tenet " corrected it to reflect the truth of the matter . "
" Tenet does n't say what the truth of the matter is , " the former CIA officer told me .
" Dearlove just did n't want to be blamed . "
Dearlove , the former CIA official emphatically insists , claiming direct knowledge , was accurately relating what Tenet had personally told him .
The former CIA official explains that the Washington meeting was an annual U.S. - U.K. event ... After a daylong briefing in the director 's conference room and private dining room , Tenet took Dearlove into his office .
According to the CIA source , " That 's where Dearlove asked where the intelligence was going , was it heading to war , did it matter what the intelligence was .
Tenet said , that 's the way things are heading , they are looking for intelligence to fit into this . "
Dearlove 's " fix " was simply the British version of " fit . "
He was not misquoted ; he was spot on .
You do n't get much more momentous than the head of the CIA and MI6 discussing how the " intelligence " used to justify a war is being falsified .
Of course , it 's difficult to judge the accuracy of this — not in the sense that Blumenthal might be making it up , but that it's hard to guess whether the CIA official had firsthand knowledge ... and if not , how he / she knows it .
But figuring out that kind of thing is what Congressional committees are ( theoretically ) good for .
It would be entertaining to see this person testify on live national television .
Feb. 22 , 2006  -- Several Marines from Camp Pendleton have been arrested in San Diego on charges of providing stolen body armor -- intended for troops in Iraq -- that was later sold on the Internet .
U.S. Customs officials teamed with the Navy 's Criminal Investigative Service to break the ring .
Nine people have been arrested , including several Marines ; additional arrests are expected .
The ongoing investigation has identified 12 other Marines and several civilians as suspects .
Sources told ABC
News that several of those Marines suspected are currently serving duty in Iraq .
Among those arrested was Erika Jardine , who was sentenced today to six months in prison by a federal judge in Philadelphia .
Jardine had pleaded guilty in November to one count of arms exportation and another count of selling stolen government property .
EBay Sales Exposed
Them
Jardine first drew the attention of investigators in June 2004 after they discovered she had been selling the vests on the Internet auction site eBay .
Customs investigators said Jardine sold 18 of the vests to customs agents posing as international arms dealers .
Jardine 's arrest led investigators to several U.S. Marines based at Camp Pendleton in California who had previously sold her the vests and their highly protective ceramic inserts .
The vests are the best protection available to U.S. troops in Iraq .
The outer tactical vest provides protection from shrapnel , and the ceramic plates , known as small arms protective inserts are what actually protect troops from bullets .
A main concern of investigators was to protect the technology involved in making the lifesaving vests .
As a result of the investigation , $ 63,000 worth of stolen gear has been recovered , including 104 protective ceramic plates , 14 outer tactical vests , seven Kevlar helmets , two gas masks and M - 16 ammunition .
This is not the first time that federal officials have broken up the sale of body armor destined for Iraq .
In April , 2004 federal prosecutors announced " Operation High Bidder , " an undercover investigation targeting eBay sales of body armor .
More than 150 sellers in 33 states were identified , including several current and former military members .
Seven people were charged in that operation , including one Marine staff sergeant , who was found to possess 100 pieces of stolen body armor .
He was court - martialed and sentenced to 10 years in prison .

It is astonishing how little Americans understand their own nation .
Recently , the president of the Council on Foreign Relations , a man long on intellect and government experience , opined that the Iraq war has generated so much controversy because it is such an aberration :
“ The emphasis on promotion of democracy , the emphasis on regime change , the war of choice in Iraq – all of these are departures from the traditional approach . ”
Many Europeans would certainly like to believe that Iraq was the product of aberrant “ neo- conservative ” ideas about foreign policy and that a traditional America lies just around the corner .
Many Americans would like to believe this , too .
We prefer to see ourselves as a peace - loving , introspective lot , a nation born in innocence and historically never choosing war but compelled to war by others .
This self - image is at odds with reality , however .
Americans have gone to war frequently in their history , rarely out of genuine necessity .
Since the cold war , America has launched more military interventions than all other great powers combined .
The interventions in Somalia , Haiti , Bosnia and Kosovo were wars of choice , waged for moral and humanitarian ends , not strategic or economic necessity , just as realist critics protested at the time .
Even the first Gulf war in 1991 was a war of choice , fought not for oil but to defend the principles of a “ new world order ” in which aggression could not go unpunished .
The US might have drawn the line at Saudi Arabia , as Colin Powell , then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , proposed .
The first US military intervention of the post - cold war era , the 1989 invasion of Panama , was a war for “ regime change ” and democracy .
President George H. W. Bush sent 22,500 troops to oust Manuel Noriega and , as he declared , “ to defend democracy ” in a conflict “ between Noriega and the people of Panama ” .
The conservative columnist George Will favoured this “ act of hemispheric hygiene ” even though American national interests , “ narrowly construed ” , did not justify war .
That was an argument “ against the narrow construing of national interests ” .
Americans , in fact , have always defined their interests broadly to include the defence and promotion of the “ universal ” principles of liberalism and democracy enunciated in the Declaration of Independence .
“ The cause of America is the cause of all mankind , ” Benjamin Franklin declared at the time of the American revolution , and as William Appleman Williams once commented , Americans believe their nation “ has meaning … only as it realises natural right and reason throughout the universe ” .
This is the real “ traditional approach ” : the conviction that American power and influence can and should serve the interests of humanity .
It is what makes the US , in Bill Clinton ’s words , the “ indispensable na­tion ” , or as Dean Acheson colourfully put it six decades ago , “ the locomotive at the head of mankind ” .
Americans do pursue their selfish interests and ambitions , sometimes brutally , as other nations have throughout history .
Nor are they innocent of hypocrisy , masking selfishness behind claims of virtue .
But Americans have always had this unique spur to global involvement , an ideological righteousness that inclines them to meddle in the affairs of others , to seek change , to insist on imposing their avowed “ universal principles ” usually through peaceful pressures but sometimes through war .
This enduring tradition has led Americans into some disasters where they have done more harm than good , and into triumphs where they have done more good than harm .
These days , this conviction is strangely called “ neo-conservatism ” , but there is nothing “ neo ” and certainly nothing conservative about it .
US foreign policy has almost always been a liberal foreign policy .
As Mr Will put it , the “ messianic impulse ” has been “ a constant of America ’s national character , and a component of American patriotism ” from the beginning .
The other constant , however , has been a self - image at odds with this reality .
This distorted self - image has its own noble origins , reflecting a perhaps laudable liberal discomfort with power and a sense of guilt at being perceived as a bully , even in a good cause .
When things go badly , as in Iraq , the cry goes up in the land for a change .
There is a yearning , even among the self - proclaimed realists , for a return to an imagined past innocence , to the mythical “ traditional approach ” , to a virtuous time that never existed , not even at the glorious birth of the republic .
This is escapism , not realism .
True realism would recognise America for what it is , an ambitious , ideological , revolutionary nation with a belief in its own world - transforming powers and a historical record of enough success to sustain that belief .
Whether the US conducts itself successfully or stumbles in the coming years will depend on the wisdom and capacity of the statesmen and women the American people choose to shape and carry out their foreign policy .
But the broad direction of that foreign policy will remain much as it has been for over two centuries .
Anything else would be an aberration .
The writer is an author , most recently , of “ Dangerous Nation , ” a history of American foreign policy ( Knopf )

In an exclusive interview with the Guardian , Geoff Hoon reveals that Britain disagreed with the US administration over two key decisions in May 2003 , two months after the invasion - to disband Iraq 's army and " de - Ba'athify " its civil service .
Mr Hoon also said he and other senior ministers completely underestimated the role and influence of the vice - president , Dick Cheney .
" Sometimes ...
Tony had made his point with the president , and I 'd made my point with Don [ Rumsfeld ] and Jack [ Straw ] had made his point with Colin [ Powell ] and the decision actually came out of a completely different place .
And you think : what did we miss ?
I think we missed Cheney . "
Giving the most frank assessment of the postwar planning , Mr Hoon , admits that " we did n't plan for the right sort of aftermath " .
" Maybe we were too optimistic about the idea of the streets being lined with cheering people .
Although I have reconciled it in my own mind , we perhaps did n't do enough to see it through the Sunni perspective .
Perhaps we should have done more to understand their position . "
He said history would have to decide whether the coalition should have anticipated the Sunni -Shia violence .
" Given what we know now , I suppose the answer is that we should , but we did not know that at the time . "
Of the summary dismissal of Iraq 's 350,000 - strong army and police forces , Mr Hoon said the Americans were uncompomising : " We certainly argued against [ the US ] .
I recall having discussions with Donald Rumsfeld , but I recognised that it was one of those judgment calls .
I would have called it the other way .
His argument was that the Iraqi army was so heavily politicised that we could n't be sure that we would not retain within it large elements of Saddam 's people . "
Mr Hoon , now minister for Europe , accepted that the sacking of so many Iraqis in possession of weapons and military training had been catastrophic , allowing " Saddam 's people to link up with al - Qaida and to link up ultimately with Sunni insurgents " in fomenting suicide attacks and sectarian violence .
He added that the military advance on Baghdad had been so rapid that " Saddam 's people had been left in its wake , who were not defeated .
Partly because they were not wearing uniforms and they did n't line up and fight ... classically what was happening was that the advance went forward and the insurgents were coming in at the back ... simply picking off , at the sides , the people they could attack .
" And that created this situation in which it was possible for Saddam 's people to link up with al - Qaida and to link up ultimately with Sunni insurgents , and ... this has grown " .
The dismantling of several ministries and removal from office of all state employees with Ba'ath party membership was also an error , Mr Hoon says .
The decision is widely seen to have paralysed the country 's infrastructure .
" I think we probably saw it in a different way [ to the US ] .
I think we felt that a lot of the Ba'ath people were first and foremost local government people , and first and foremost civil servants - they were n't fanatical supporters of Saddam . "
Describing the task of dealing with the US administration as a " multi- dimensional jigsaw puzzle , " Mr Hoon accepted that Britain had greatly underestimated the influence of the neo-con vice - president Mr Cheney and had lacked a comparable figure able to engage him regularly over the war .
And he admitted that as Mr Powell became more marginalised by the White House and Mr Rumsfeld 's Pentagon , Britain 's coordination of its position through his state department left its influence greatly diminished .
Mr Hoon also expressed regret over the government 's claim in the run-up to war that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction , which , he now accepts , turned out to be false .
He said he had " gradually come to the acceptance " the weapons did not exist .
But he insisted the government had acted in good faith .
He still does not understand why the intelligence proved to be false .
" I 've been present at a number of meetings where the intelligence community was fixed , and looked in the eye and asked are you absolutely sure about this ?
And the answer came back ' Yes , absolutely sure ' . "
Mr Hoon added : " I saw intelligence from the first time I came into office , in May 1999 - week in , week out - that said Saddam had weapons of mass destruction ...
I have real difficulty in understanding why it was , over such a long period of time , we were told this and , moreover , why we acted upon it . "
Mr Hoon accepted that the public hostility towards Mr Blair is considerable .
" No one 's interested in subtleties of judgment or what was the case at the time .
I think , especially when British soldiers are being killed , that the public have got to be pretty confident as to why .
I think they 're not any longer confident , and want us out of Iraq .
That 's why Tony gets the blame . "
" Whatever else I did , even if say people say it was catastrophically wrong , I would n't agree with it , but I could live with it .
But I can't live with the idea that I was telling lies , because I was n't . "
On the question of an apology , he says : " That 's the whole thing about apologising , and saying we were wrong .
- it 's quite hard .
You can say " it did not turn out as we expected " and " we made some bad calls " , but at the end of the day I defy anyone to to go through what we went through and come to a different conclusion " .
Really ?
Really ?!
I mean really , are you kidding me ?
I just paid my taxes , and I have to say , I always take pride when I do so .
I do n’t like having less money to spend , of course , and the complexity of the process is really upsetting .
But I am proud to pay for democracy , and I feel when I do send money to the DC Treasurer and the US Treasury that that is what I am doing .
The right - wing likes to pretend as if taxes are a burden instead of the price of democracy .
And I suppose , if you hate democracy , as the right - wing does , then taxes are the price for paying for something you really do n’t want .
Personally , I find banking fees , high cable and internet charges , health care costs , and credit card hidden charges much more abrasive than taxes , because with those I ’m just being ripped off to pay for someone ’s summer home .
You like it that much , huh ?
Want to pay mine ?
If you love democracy that much , you should certainly give it extra voluntary contributions , to offset those of us who do n’t love democracy .
Yep …
You heard me .
I do n’t love democracy .
Democracy is a horrible form of government .
Democracy has its place , but unless you restrain its scope , you ’re looking for trouble .
Of course , I do n’t expect Mr. Stoller to understand that .
After all , he ’s interested in socialism , not liberty .
And if you ’re interested in socialism , democracy is a wonderful tool to chain those above you on the economic ladder into the machine .
Democracy is an incredibly effective tool of authoritarians , and socialism cannot exist without authoritarianism .
But I ’m not interested in socialism , I ’m interested in liberty .
I like democracy when compared to , say , monarchy or oligarchy , as a method to decide who will control a tightly constitutionally - limited government .
But the key is n’t democracy , the key is limited government .
Because when government grows , liberty shrinks .
I do n’t ask much from government , only to leave me the hell alone .
And when they ’re taking 50 % of my income , that ’s not leaving me alone .
But I have another question for Mr. Stoller …
Are you getting your money ’s worth ?
I am proud to pay taxes because I take pride in America , and paying some tiny burden to keep our society running is an extremely small price to pay for being able to call myself an American citizen .
The old expression ‘ you get what you pay for ’ is apt for all sorts of situations .
Now , if you ’re paying a “ tiny burden ” , you ’re poor and probably getting a pretty good deal .
Government is probably giving you a good deal of “ stuff ” in order for your “ tiny ” burden .
But , as we pointed out here , many of us are n’t getting what we pay for .
After all , my burden is n’t “ tiny ” .
I ’m getting screwed , and you ’re telling me to lie back with a smile and enjoy it .
The only way I could be getting what I pay for from “ our ” government is if I were a masochist , but I ’m not one to willingly pay for pain .
When the penalty for not paying is a stint in a jail cell , government does n’t have to give you services commensurate with your contribution .
They do n’t have to give you what you pay for .
Because if you do n’t pay , they put the screws to you .
It ’s called extortion and theft , and the only reason I still pay taxes is because I ’d rather be a slave for 50 % of my time than in a cage for 100 % .
Hat Tip : QandO
In the world of nanotechnology , which is measured in molecules , engineers crafted some nifty miniature machinery this year .
Different teams created the world 's smallest car refrigerator and fountain pen .
One hope is that these tiny machines , invisible to the human eye , will one day be used to deliver drugs into cells , perhaps to destroy cancer or cure other ills .
Technology tasks are envisioned too .
In one nifty breakthrough , researchers merged microbe and machine for the first time , creating gold - plated bacteria that sense humidity .
Using the parts inside a single molecule , scientists have constructed the world 's smallest car .
It has a chassis , axles and a pivoting suspension .
The wheels are buckyballs , spheres of pure carbon containing 60 atoms apiece .
It 'd be a real squeeze to take it for a spin , however .
The whole car is no more than 4 nanometers across .
That 's slightly wider than a strand of DNA .
A human hair is about 80,000 nanometers thick .
Other groups have made car - shaped nanoscale objects .
But this is the first one that rolls " on four wheels in a direction perpendicular to its axles , " the researchers reported Thursday .
What 's the point ?
Nanotrucks , of course .
Eventually the researchers want to build tiny trucks that could carry atoms and molecules around in miniature factories .
" We 'd eventually like to move objects and do work in a controlled fashion on the molecular scale , and these vehicles are great test beds for that , " said James Tour , a Rice University research who co-led the work .
" They 're helping us learn the ground rules . "
The setup will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Nano Letters .
The scientists had to use " scanning tunneling microscopy " to see the thing and prove that it rolls like a car .
" It 's fairly easy to build nanoscale objects that slide around on a surface , " said Tour 's colleague Kevin Kelly .
" Proving that we were rolling – not slipping and sliding – was one of the most difficult parts of this project . "
So just how do you make a nanocar go ?
At room temperature , strong electrical bonds hold the buckyball wheels tightly against the gold , but heating to about 200 degrees Celsius frees them to roll .
The breakthrough is one of many recent successes in the world of the very small :

id. planet has been created .
ja.planet got translations but needs feed URLs .
there now is # wikimedia - planet on Freenode IRC that outputs all planet feeds ( unfortunately currently broken again due to wm - bot issue )
How do I get in ? [ edit ]
In order to be included , your RSS feed must either be filtered to on - topic posts ( e.g. by tagging all relevant posts with " wikimedia " and providing a feed to this tag ) , or your blog must be almost exclusively focused on this topic .
The very occasional off - topic post is permitted , but given that Planet Wikimedia is intended to scale to hundreds of blogs , please exercise appropriate self - restraint .
Common blogging engines like Wordpress and Blogger support label - specific feeds .
In both cases , these are not obvious .
For Wordpress , the feed URL is something like < http://example.com/blog/?cat=9&feed=rss2> or < http://example.com/blog/category/wiki/feed>.
For Blogger , see this help entry .
If you specify the URL of your blog , and make sure to add the category / tag / label " wiki " to your posts , we will help you to try to figure out whether a category - specific feed exists for your blog .
Blogs can be listed under your real name , your user name ( which will be prefixed with " User : " in the list of authors ) , or both , e.g. Alan Smithee ( Dogmaster3000 ) .
Please indicate your preference ; if you indicate none , only the real name ( if available ) will be used .
For group blogs the blog title will be used .
In the spirit of Wikimedia 's commitment to free content , we encourage you to consider putting your blog content under a free license .
In the spirit of Wikimedia 's commitment to an unnecessary inflation of userboxes , you can also add a Planet Userbox to your userpage . ;-)
Requests for inclusion [ edit ]
To be included in the planet , simply list your blog below , together with a feed URL ( preferably to a filtered feed ) , and your signature .
If you want to display a different name for your blog than the default ( e.g. your Wikipedia username ) , please indicate that here as well .
Any developer with access to the Git server ( path : operations / puppet ./modules/planet/templates/feeds/en_config.erb ) can suggest the addition of your feed , and one of the roots can approve that change .

Noé , I 've stumbled upon this page and decided to do a clean - up of old requests .
Is this still relevant ?
Is this available in an RSS format ?
If it is , what would be the URL ?
-- Amir E. Aharoni ( talk ) 09:56 , 4 June 2020 ( UTC ) Hi , Amir !
Such a long time , I totally forgot about this idea !
Thanks for getting back to it .
Actualités is still published monthly , so it is still relevant .
The 5th anniversary was last month and the last issue was wrote by 14 people .
Quite a success for wikipress .
Since we never had feed - backs for our English translation we stopped them .
It is only in French now .
I do n't know for a RSS format , I guess we do n't have any .
The URL for the last issue is https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionnaire:Actualités/062-mai-2020
so , the number is incremented with each issue , and the following word is the name of the month in French ( mai is French for May ) , and finally the year .
It is quite regular .
It is almost always published on the first day of the month .
Anyway , I could help by providing a list of the future pages if it could be of some help .
Noé ( talk ) 10:32 , 4 June 2020 ( UTC )
Noé , you can easily create an RSS feed on any modern blogging platform , such as wordpress.com .
Just create a blog there and copy the content from the wiki page to a new blog post .
-- Amir E. Aharoni ( talk ) 11:29 , 4 June 2020 ( UTC )
Well , the publishing steps are already quite time - consuming , I am not kin to add more steps , and if I do , I have to recreate all templates I use for a new css templates , that would be long .
I will evaluate this idea with the other contributors .
Besides , the idea of having the publication on - wiki is to invite the people to explore all internal links , it is less interesting in another space .
If you may think about another option without cross-posting , I am interested .

Thanks to support from Governor Bill Richardson , New Mexico is on the verge of becoming the latest state to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes .
Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson , poised to sign a bill making New Mexico the 12th state to legalize medical marijuana , said Thursday that he realizes his action could become an issue in the presidential race .
If this actually goes through , this will be great news for the residents of New Mexico who would require this product to treat any ailments they are dealing with .
With this being said , it is not as easy as just turning up to a dispensary .
You ’ll need a medical marijuana card before anything can happen .
To find out more information , it may be worth checking out something like this HerbCEO guide , just so you have an understanding of all things related to medical marijuana .
If you are planning on taking medical marijuana then it ’s important to make sure that you get the right one for you .
For example , you could easily check out something like this gods green crack .
However , the decision is up to you .
“ So what if it ’s risky ?
It ’s the right thing to do , ” said Richardson , one of the candidates in the crowded 2008 field .
“ What we ’re talking about is 160 people in deep pain .
It only affects them . ”
The legislation would create a program under which some patients — with a doctor ’s recommendation — could use marijuana strains such as purple rhino provided by the state Health Department .
Lawmakers approved the bill Wednesday .
The governor is expected to sign it in the next few weeks .

If there was any remaining doubt that the BBC reported the collapse of Building 7 over 20 minutes before it fell then it has now evaporated with the discovery of footage from the BBC ’s News 24 channel that shows the time stamp at 21:54 ( 4:54 PM EST ) when news of the Salomon Brothers Building is first broadcast , a full 26 minutes in advance of its collapse .

By Spencer Kelly
Reporter , BBC Click Online
When you fire up your browser , do you go straight to a search engine , like Google , or do you go to a portal , like Yahoo or MSN ?
Spencer Kelly finds the battle for the number one spot is playing into our hands .
Branching out into music or video is key to many search engines now
Getting us to come back to any one site on a regular basis is certainly a tall order , but that is exactly what some of the web 's big players want us to do .
Google , Yahoo and MSN are just some of the companies which would love us to make them our homepage .
After a year of trying to impress us with enormous e-mail accounts - Gmail is still constantly upping the amount of storage you get with an account - the big hitters are now hoping to dazzle us with increasingly glamorous products .
It is a very exciting time , says MSN's Stuart Anderson .
" Generally if you are someone using the internet , you 've never seen more innovation than you 've seen in the last year , and quite honestly the pace is not going to stop .
" We 're going to see more and more innovation in the next 12 months . "
Race for change
Yahoo has recently bought Konfabulator , a download which gives you small widgets on your desktop .
These can be used to display just about any information you want , from the current time to the latest news .
It is also hoping to build on its online music radio service , Launchcast , which includes a personalised music selector that learns the types of music you like and streams you different tracks accordingly .
As broadband take - up increases , MSN is embracing the increasing video content on the web .
You can now compose and watch playlists of certain video content , interspersed , of course , with adverts .
Other search engines have imitated Google 's uncluttered style
Google 's Lorraine Twohill says : " We started with 10 TV networks .
We 've pulled in all their programmes plus the data , the tags that go around those programmes , so they 're easily searchable .
Most of them you can play . "
Naturally , search in general will always be a big web application , and after Google 's enormous success it seems that everyone now agrees that a clean and simple search interface is a good thing .
First came the MSN no -frills Search , and now we have Yahoo's new - look search , which has unashamedly been Googled .
Even Jeeves the butler has put the duster round and had a clean - out .
With many search results , he will even show you a preview of the page to make sure it is the right one before you click on it .
Personal service
But the key to winning our favour may not be just a nice empty search window with lots of empty space .
It may not be video playlists , or widgets .
It might not be the individual features at all .
All the main search engines are now offering personalised services
We do not just access the web from one place anymore .
We can go online at home , at work , in an internet café .
It would be nice if our favourite features followed us , wherever we were .
Lisa Jones , the editor of Net magazine , says : " Because much of our lives now revolves around web services and things that we can do there , we need to be able to move our information around and not start from scratch every time we want to do a search .
" So it 's increasingly about building this customisable , personalised web interface that remembers us and that we can take anywhere . "
Create a Yahoo user ID and you not only get free e-mail , but you also get a chance to create your own homepage , to which you can add your own elements : calendar , e-mail inbox , news stories , weather , change the colour scheme , etc .
Your homepage now really starts to become your homepage .
Since imitation is the new innovation , it is not just a Yahoo thing .
AskJeeves have MyAskJeeves , MSN has MyMSN , and in the last few weeks even Google have started testing its own personalised homepage service .
MyGoogle , perhaps ?
You can also personalise your search options .
Yahoo's MyWeb allows you to save and organise any search results you like into online folders , to be recalled at a later date .
No free lunch
All these facilities are free to us , so the web big guys will have to make their money elsewhere , namely advertising .
By giving us a personal login and customisable homepage , it is hoped that we will start treating it like home , and keep coming back .
But if we want free homes , we may just have to put up with a few adverts .
Yahoo's Nick Hazell says : " Our revenue comes from a number of sources : media advertising , paid for searches , and our subscription services , where we have about 10 million subscribing customers to various of our premium services .
" We see all of those businesses as quite complementary , and a range of businesses which add up to the whole and fund the kinds of services that we 're able to offer to customers . "
In the next two weeks Click Online will look at the big areas in which the big players think there is money to be made : communications and sharing information .
Click Online is broadcast on BBC News 24 : Saturday at 2030 , Sunday at 0430 and 1630 , and on Monday at 0030 .
A short version is also shown on BBC Two : Saturday at 0645 and BBC One : Sunday at 0730 .
Also BBC World .

Sign outside Cape Canaveral says , " Cape Canaveral Formerly Cape Kennedy Formerly Cape Arbuckle " Cape Canaveral was formerly named Cape Kennedy , and before that was named Cape Canaveral ( yes , the name was changed , then changed back ) .
But it was never named Cape Arbuckle .
Fatty Arbuckle was a popular silent - movie comedian whose career was ruined after he was tried for the rape & murder of actress Virginia Rappe at a wild party .
Even though he was found not guilty , he was essentially blacklisted , and his very name became disreputable .
So , the writers were making fun of the Cape 's name - changing by IMAGINING that it was once called Cape Arbuckle in honour of Fatty , but changed to Canaveral after the scandal .
There is also an implicit comparison between Kennedy 's sexual scandals and Arbuckle's .
Episode : 1F13 Deep Space Homer

A " Berliner , " however , is not only someone from Berlin , but also a German word for Jelly Donut .

Excerpted from Software Conflict 2.0 : The Art and Science of Software Engineering , from developer . *
Books
The question I want to deal with here is " What is software design ? "
That may strike you as an odd question to ask .
After all , people have been designing software for 30 + years now .
And do n’t we have all the design methodologies and design languages common sense says we need ?
So why , now , ask " What is software design ? "
Well the point I want to make is that all this time , when we ’ve talked about design , we ’ve been playing around on the periphery of the subject .
Methodologies are n’t design ; they ’re frameworks for organizing our design efforts .
Languages are n’t design ; they ’re representations for writing down the design once we get it .
Design is something that happens inside the head , inside the brain , and it happens at a speed faster than lightning .
It ’s that concept of design that I want to pursue here .
I ’ve done my share of software design over the years , and I ’ve taught the subject a few times , but I want to confess something to you .
I ’ve never felt that I really understood what design was , and whether what I was doing was the right approach to design .
In recent years , I ’ve found I am not alone .
While I was teaching software engineering in the graduate program at Seattle University , some of us avoided teaching design because we felt we did n’t know what is really was , and therefore we did n’t know how to teach it .
Then I ran into some people during my year at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon who not only did n’t feel they knew how to teach design , but in fact felt that no one knew how to teach it !
At that point , I felt less alone , but I was still no closer to understanding what design really was .
Empirical Research Findings
All that is beginning to change .
Other computer people who also felt that design is often an elusive subject have been conducting research into what it is .
And they ’re beginning to come up with answers .
To understand what follows , you may have to loosen your grip on a few ideas that have become tradition in the short history of software .
Quit thinking of external representations as what design is all about , and focus on mental process .
Inside the mind lies the secret of design .
I still remember the occasion when that became clear to me .
I was attending a class in the Ada language at the Air Force Academy .
It was the last day of the week - long class , and the instructors had divided us into teams and given us a problem to solve .
They had just finished laying out the requirements for us when one of my teammates , a bright young man from Boeing , came up with a design solution .
Here I was , still trying to grasp the problem statement , and he had whipped through a design solution in his mind !
It was then that I realized that design happened lightning fast inside the mind , and incidentally that some people ’s lightning struck much faster than others !
But what really happened inside that bright young man ’s mind ?
Answers to that question , at least the general question behind it , are beginning to emerge .
Before I talk about what those answers are , let me explain a little about where they ’re coming from .
There ’s a new thrust emerging in software - related research , and it ’s from that thrust that the answers are finally coming .
Researchers such as Bill Curtis at the Microelectronics and Computing Consortium ( MCC ) and Elliot Soloway of the University of Michigan ( formerly of Yale ) have long been interested in the idea that the study of software was at least as much about studying programmers as it was about studying programs .
They ’ve called this field of research " empirical studies of programmers , " and the latest focus of this research area is on software design .
Confronted with the same question that I posed at the beginning of this article ( " What is software design ? " ) , these researchers laid out a plan for finding out .
What they needed to do was to capture the thought processes of designers doing actual design work without intruding on , and therefore perturbing , the process .
That ’s easier said than done .
But with the methods of a field called " protocal analysis " they have managed to do that .
They have sat quietly with designers at work and prodded them to think aloud , recording what they say .
They have audio taped design sessions .
They have video taped group design processes .
They have poured over the results of the recording process .
And they have begun to formulate a theoretical description of what designers do .
The first set of things they learned was n’t all that illuminating .
They found that design involved :
understanding the problem
decomposing the problem into goals and objects
selecting and composing plans to solve the problem
implementing the plans
reflecting on the product and the process
All that was not very helpful .
With a little tweaking of the words , in fact , that sequence is not much more than what we call the software life cycle , a thing we ’ve known about and wrestled with for years .
It was n’t until they delved more deeply into " selecting and composing plans " from the preceding list that they finally struck pay dirt .
Lurking inside that generic category was a simple set of steps that is the essence of design .
The Essence of Design
What were those steps ?
The designers , mentally and at lightning speed , were doing the following things :
They constructed a mental model of a proposed solution to the problem .
They mentally executed the model — in essence , running a simulation on the model — to see if it solved the problem .
When they found that it did n’t ( usually because it was too simple ) , they played the inadequate model back against those parts of the problem to see where it failed , and enhanced the model in those areas .
They repeated steps 1 - 3 until they had a model that appeared to solve the problem .
Now , since those four steps are the key to the answer to our original question , let ’s spend a little more time on them before we move on .
What we see here is a mental process , a very rapid process , an iterative process , a process in fact of fast trial and error .
The mind forms a solution to the problem , knowing that it will be inadequate because the mind is not yet able to fully grasp all the facets of the problem .
That problem solution , the mind knows , must be in the form of a model , because it is going to be necessary to try sample input against the model , run a quick simulation ( inside the mind ) on the model using the sample input , and get sample outputs ( still inside the mind ) from that simulation .
The essence of design , then , is rapid modeling and simulation .
And a key factor in design is the ability to propose solutions and allow them to fail !
It is interesting to mention in passing that these same researchers have explored the problems of people who are not very good at design .
Those people tend to build representations of a design rather than models ; they are then unable to perform simulation runs ; and the result is they invent and are stuck with inadequate design solutions .
One of my favorite thoughts connected with these findings is that failure is an essential part of successful design !
The end of every one of the previous iterations is a failed model , one shown to be inadequate to solve the problem ; and that in turn suggests that an integral part of success is the ability to fail and to recover from it .
I find that thought has intriguing implications from the point of view of teaching design , or any other subject for that matter .
Where do we teach failure and how to recover from it ?!
Several famous software designers have articulated some of these same ideas about design .
In Programmers at Work , published by Microsoft Press from interviews conducted by Susan Lammers , they commented on the design process as they saw it , saying things like :
" The first step in programming is imagining .
Just making it crystal clear in my mind what is going to happen .
In this initial stage , I use pencil and paper .
I just doodle . . . because the real picture is in my mind . "
( Charles Simonyi , creator of Multiplan )
" At some point , the [ design ] gets explosive and I have everything inside my brain at one time .
. . .
All sorts of things go on in my brain that I ca n’t put on paper because I ’m always changing them . "
( Gary Kildall , creator of CP /M )
" You have to simulate in your mind how the program ’s going to work .
. . .
When you ’re creating something . . . and you have that model in your mind , it ’s a lonely thing . "
( Bill Gates , chief executive of Microsoft )
It is fascinating that the findings of the researchers in many ways match these informal quotations from well - known designers .
Some Other Findings
There is one other key finding about design that enters into this .
Other researchers , such as Willemien Visser of Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique , France , have found that " designers rarely start from scratch . "
That is , they use an existing model from a prior solution of a similar problem , as that first cut at the model that begins the simulation process .
In fact , in retrospect , I think that ’s how the young man from Boeing ran such mental circles around me at the Ada class .
He ’d solved that class of problem before , and he had a tentative solution already lurking in his mind !
( Is n’t it amazing how well we can rationalize our personal inadequacies ?! )
Now so far , this has all been about individuals doing design .
But as we know , design in the 1980s has evolved into a team process .
Problems have gotten too big for individual designers , and interdisciplinary problems cause a need for multiple and diverse skills among designers .
Those same researchers have been looking into team design .
And they ’ve found that , in many ways , it ’s a shared form of individual design :
The teams create a shared mental model .
Team members , sometimes in their own minds and sometimes in the group , run simulations against the shared model .
The teams evaluate the simulations and prepare the next level of the model .
But in some ways these efforts are unlike individual design :
Conflict is an inevitable part of the design process .
It must be managed rather than avoided .
Communication techniques become a vital part of the design process .
Issues sometimes " fall through the crack " because no individual claims responsibility for them .
These teams of designers are typically 3 to 6 people .
Sometimes , for enormously complex tasks , even that is not enough people .
Then , design becomes an organizational problem .
Typical organizational design evolves into a hierarchy of design teams , each with its own assigned problem subdomain , with an additional special team of chief architects whose job it is to hold the whole design effort together .
But design in team and organizational settings creates its own problems .
Design can easily evolve into committee work , with all the disadvantages that implies ( remember that the " camel is a race horse designed by a committee " ) .
Fred Brooks , of The Mythical Man-Month and the more recent Silver Bullet paper , has pointed out that the best products we see , the ones that we agree have conceptual integrity ( like Pascal and Unix ) , were designed by individuals .
There are successful team designs , like Ada and COBOL and the IBM mainframe operating systems , but they are generally looked down on as being successful but clumsy , as Brooks points out .
Where Do We Go From Here ?
So we have some new understandings .
There is a well - defined process that goes on inside the mind during design .
It begins with an existing or simplified new model , runs a simulation on that model , and continues iteratively until the design solution meshes with the problem to be solved .
If the problem is big enough or complex enough , then teams or even organizations may do design .
They use many of the same techniques as individuals but also use group process , a clumsy but sometimes necessary way to do business .
What do we do with these new understandings ?
It seems to me that there are three categories to deal with that : the implications on the teaching of design , the implications on the doing of design , and the implications on the managing of design .
In teaching design , it is no longer enough to teach one or two or three methodologies and representations .
Those older topics must be taught within a framework that includes the new concept of design as a mental process .
In doing design , it is helpful for the designer to understand that the heart of design is not what he or she thought it was supposed to be , and that the clumsy iterative process of trial and error that the designer is probably pursuing is actually the way it is supposed to be .
That may give designers the confidence to pursue these appropriate design approaches without guilt .
( Could we dare call this a " guilt - free " approach to design ?
No , that would be too much psychobabble ! )
In managing design , managers can focus on communication facilitation and conflict resolution as their contribution to design .
The empirical studies researchers further suggest that management of design should be the management of the key issues that arise during the design process .
In pursuit of these goals of better design education , practice , and management , several tool concepts are proposed by the researchers .
We do not know how to build all of these tools yet , but if we did it would go a long way towards assisting the now - better - understood design process .
Modeling and simulation packages to support the mental process .
Idea archive and retrieve packages to prevent thoughts from falling through the cracks .
Strategic assumption surfacers that keep track of key requirements and pop them up when a candidate design is about to violate one .
Issue - based conflict resolution support .
Unresolved issue recording / tracking .
Mediated discussion support .
Group idea collection and coordination .
It may be premature , however , to talk about tools to support this process .
We are just beginning to understand what design is really all about , after thinking we knew what it was about for over 30 years .
Perhaps just that should be enough to absorb us for awhile .
Figuring out what to do with that knowledge may be an issue for a later time .
We probably ought to have a handle to attach to this new understanding .
The researchers call it " cognitive processes in design . "
I like that .
It says the things that I believe should be said about design being a mental process .
This article , then , has been a look at the cognitive aspects of software design .
A Retrospective Afterword
Wow !
A lot of things have changed since I wrote that essay some 15 years ago .
It refers to the pioneering design studies of Bill Curtis and Elliot Soloway as " recent " ( they happened in the late 1980s ! ) .
It presents the thoughts of such sterling technologists as Charles Simonyi , Gary Kildall , and Bill Gates .
( But who has ever heard of them recently ?
Well , I 've heard of this guy Gates , but I can't remember the context ! )
It discusses such " modern " programming tools as Pascal and Unix .
But the really funny thing about this essay is this :
The technical essence of what I said there , I believe , remains valid today .
First of all , there has been no follow - on research that would obsolete what Curtis and Soloway learned about design in practice way back then .
In fact , there is every reason to believe that their empirical studies of programmers at work captured some vitally important and still - true facts about how real programmers do real design .
I present these same findings in classes and lectures all the time to practitioner audiences , and not one person has said " hold it , those ideas are totally ( or even partially ) out of date . "
If there are classic findings and classic publications in the computing field , this report on the work of Curtis and Soloway belongs in that category ( he modestly said ! ) .
You might be interested in the bottom line to the Curtis / Soloway research .
The original intent of their studies was to result in a toolset that designers would be able to use to improve the way they did business .
I hinted at that , in fact , in my essay .
But that bottom line was to be dashed .
Because the nature of design , as they discovered , is so intensely cognitive , happening inside the mind at mind speed , the researchers could conceive of no useful tools to help in that process !
Eventually , their efforts were disbanded and they moved on to what I prefer to think of as browner pastures !

Native American Courts : Precedent for an Islamic arbitral system *
Issa Smith
In the United States today , there is a system of courts which is just outside of the federal and state court systems , known as the American Indian Tribal Courts .
The Tribal Courts deal with criminal , civil and family court issues , and have their own lawyers , judges , and court officials .
The Muslim Community can learn from the experience of the American Indian Tribal Court System as we attempt to implement Muslim Family Law in North America .
I will use the terms “ Indian ” or “ American Indian ” to describe the descendants of the people indigenous to North America , who are also sometimes referred to as “ Native Americans . ”
The complex and confusing legal relationships between the United States and the American Indians begins with the U.S. Constitution which in Article 1 , section 8 states : “ The Congress shall have the power …to regulate Commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes . ”
Since the constitution was accepted and implemented in 1789 , Indian tribes have been treated as “ quasi - sovereign governments ” , dependent on the United States for support and protection .
The treatment of American Indians during the last 200 years has been tragic and shameful .
In 1789 , it was estimated that 10 million Indians lived in the area now part of the United States .
Today there are less than 2 million , half of whom live in urban areas and a third of whom live on reservations .
There are currently about 300 Indian tribes that are recognized by the federal government , and dozens more that have state recognition .
In addition , there are more than 200 recognized “ native villages ” in Alaska .
Every year , there is legislation in Congress , which recognizes new tribes or takes away recognition of existing tribes .
Only about half of these tribes have tribal courts , and most of these were created during the past twenty years .
Each court is independent of the others .
The Bureau of Indian Affairs , which is part of the Department of Interior , has regulatory control over Indian Tribal Courts .
Jurisdiction
The question of jurisdiction has been a major and continuous problem for Indian Tribal Courts , and the source of conflict between state courts and tribal courts .
Basically , tribal courts have jurisdiction over tribal members , or non-Indians .
Jurisdiction generally does not extend beyond the border of the reservation .
In a landmark decision in 1990 , the U.S. Supreme Court held that an Indian tribe may not assert criminal jurisdiction over an Indian who is not one of its members .
The case , known as Dura vs. Reina , involved the killing of an Indian youth on the Salt River Pima - Maricopa Reservation in Arizona .
The accused , Albert Duro , was an enrolled member of another tribe .
The tribe prosecuted Duro for the misdemeanor crime of illegally firing a weapon , since federal law dictates that major crimes such as murder must be tried in state or federal courts .
Duro was convicted , but appealed and sought dismissal of the case on the basis of his not being a tribal member .
The Supreme Court justices , in a 7 - 2 decision , agreed .
They reasoned that non-members or non-Indians should not be subject to an alien and potentially discriminatory tribunal .
The decision also meant that non-member Indians are to be considered as non-Indians in tribal courts .
Family Courts
Since our concern is primarily with family law , let us examine some issues of family law in tribal courts .
The same matters considered to be part of Muslim family law ( marriage , divorce , support , custody , adoption , legitimacy , abuse etc. ) are covered in tribal courts .
A major concern of Indian tribes used to be the large number of Indian youths from broken homes who were adopted into non-Indian families .
Often a state court would assume jurisdiction and rule that the reservation environment was not in the best interest of the child .
The Indian tribes strongly opposed this idea .
Although they agreed that the environment of the reservation was harsh and poverty - stricken , they wanted the children to be raised by their extended families , as was the custom in Indian culture .
In 1978 , the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act , which radically changed the relationship between state courts and tribal courts .
One result was that tribal courts had greater jurisdiction in the placement of adopted Indian children .
Many tribal courts were created just to take advantage of the greater powers given then by the Indian Child Welfare Act .
Marriage is one of the most common issues faced by tribal courts .
A marriage conducted by a tribal court is valid anywhere in the U.S.
An Indian couple wishing to divorce , and who live off the reservation , have the option of going to the state courts in the same manner as non-Indians , or returning to the reservation for a divorce .
The second option is usually much quicker and cheaper .
Which support institutions and organizations have arise to work with Indian tribal courts ?
As mentioned , tribal courts have their own lawyers , judges and court officials .
The requirements for filling these posts are determined by the tribe .
This means , for example , that to be a lawyer or judge in the tribal court you do not necessarily have to have a law degree , or even a college diploma .
I have spoken to a chief judge of a tribal court who had only finished high school .
She has been in her post for eight years and is highly respected by tribal members .
As a matter of fact , a degree from the average law school is of little use to someone wishing to practice law in a tribal court .
Only two or three law schools offer courses in American Indian law .
Many reservations have saved up and sent their most talented youth away to law school , only to find upon graduation that the new layers had to be completely re-oriented to tribal law .
The situation is somewhat analogous to a Muslim law school graduate trying to practice Islamic family law .
To assist those interested in working in tribal courts , the National Indian Justice Center was created in 1983 .
The center is an Indian - owned and operated non-profit organization based in California , and conducts training sessions around the country .
It has also developed an Associate in Arts degree in Indian Justice at the New College of California in San Francisco .
The center evaluates tribal courts and has developed a voluntary certification program for court officials .
It also publishes a newsletter and monographs .
The American Indian Law Center in Albuquerque , NM , provides similar servics , with an emphasis on legal research .
The Institute for the Development of Indian Law is based at Oklahoma City University ’s law school .
It provides courses in Indian Law as part of a law degree .
There are numerous professional organizations for those in the field of Indian Law .
The National American Indian Court Judges Association has several regional affiliates .
The American Indian Bar Association represents many of the over 700 Indian lawyers .
The American Indian Law Students Association has chapters on many of the larger law schools such as Harvard .
The Native American Rights Fund is a civil rights organization based in Colorado which deal with Indian issues and has a board of directors composed of Indians from across the country , including native Hawaiians .
The American Indian Law Review is an academic journal devoted to the study of tribal courts .
There are many non-Indian groups interested in tribal courts as well .
Interfaith Impact , a Washington based coalition of more than 30 religious advocacy groups including the American Muslim Council , has a task force on Native American civil rights which monitors tribal court legislation .
National organizations such as the American Bar Association and the National Child Support Enforcement Association have hosted educational conferences on tribal court issues .
Numerous local and regional social service organizations have been created to address problems of American Indians and work with tribal courts .
In short , a vast network of support organizations has been developed which strengthens the tribal court apparatus .
Although the Muslim community in North America is vastly different from the Indian community , I feel that in developing a plan for the implementation of Muslim family law , we can in some ways imitate the paradigm of the tribal court system and its supporting network .
In particular , I recommend that as a first step , supporting organizations dealing with Islamic family law be established immediately .
A professional association of Muslims in the law field ( of whatever specialty ) is a must .
A law school students ’ support group should be formed , and Muslim youth should be encouraged to enter this field .
A second step would be to establish institutes in the U.S. which can supplement legal education with courses in Islamic family law .
At the same time , pressure should be put on law schools to include courses in Shariah taught by Muslims .
An idea suggested in several quarters and being developed by the American Muslim Council , is the
moot court
where students and legal experts can act out Muslim family court scenarios .
There is a serious lack of Muslim social service agencies .
Muslim Family Services in Brooklyn , New York is one of the oldest and best - known — an example to be emulated elsewhere .
These organizations will have to be in place when we start asking for control of our family court issues .
The process of implementing Muslim family law will not be accomplished overnight .
Changes of their type take place very slowly in American society , and our community is far from being prepared for this tak .
I commend the continental council of Masajid for organizing this conference , and bringing together so many workers and thinkers .
I pray to Allah the real decisions are made here that can be implemented by those ready to work .
However , I strongly urge that consideration be given to political realities and the sensitivities of the American public .
Such a radical change in American law — allowing Muslims to take control over their family law issues - must be initiated from the indigenous Muslim community here in the United States .
To have it seem that this initiative is originating from overseas or from organizations financed overseas , would create a very negative impression that would likely destroy this effort .

e Bay is banning sellers from requesting payment through Google Checkout .
The online auction giant updated its Safe Payments policy this week to add Google 's new payment service , Google Checkout to its list of online payment methods not permitted on eBay .
A spokesperson for Google said it has no restrictions regarding marketplace use .
" We want to work with everybody , " she said on Wednesday .
e Bay 's Safe Payments policy states that a payment service must have a " substantial historical track record of providing safe and reliable financial and / or banking related services . "
Google 's spokesperson said yesterday , " Google Checkout is not a beta product .
Google has a long history in billing and payments for AdWords and for premium services , such as Google Video . "
Two multi-channel eBay - management services announced integration with Google Checkout - Marketworks and ChannelAdvisor .
Both worked with Google during initial development and testing .
But eBay sellers may not accept banned services on their customized eBay checkout systems , according to eBay spokesperson Hani Durzy last week .
e Bay also appears to have renamed the policy this week .
Introduced as the Safe Payments Policy in October 2005 at http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/safe-payments-policy.htm, the page now redirects to a policy called Accepted Payments Policy at http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/accepted-payments-policy.html.

Large crowds have gathered to celebrate Michelle Bachelet 's win
Her rival , conservative businessman Sebastian Pinera , has admitted defeat .
Giving a victory speech to cheering supporters , Ms Bachelet said : " Who would have said , 10 , 15 years ago , that a woman would be elected president ? "
The election is the fourth since Chile returned to democracy in 1990 after 17 years of military rule .
Outgoing President Ricardo Lagos hailed the election of Chile 's first woman leader as a " historic triumph " .
Pay homage
Mr Pinera , who had 46.5 % of the vote with 97.5 % counted , was also quick to congratulate Ms Bachelet .
Ms Bachelet thanked the thousands of enthusiastic supporters who gathered outside her campaign headquarters in the capital , Santiago .
She called on the whole country to work together to solve its problems and repeated her promise to bring more jobs and social justice to Chile .
The BBC's Daniel Schweimler in Santiago says thousands of people have been waving flags , blowing whistles and chanting slogans in the streets , with many more honking their horns as they drive round the city .
It took less than three hours after the polls closed for it to became clear the 54 - year - old would be the next president and for the celebrations to begin .
Ms Bachelet has promised continuity , as head of the coalition which has led Chile for the past 16 years , but has also pledged change .
She has said she is keen to bridge the gap between rich and poor and to give a greater voice to women and indigenous people .
And , our correspondent says , more women are expected to be appointed to public office .
Unusual choice
The second round of voting was called after no candidate secured the 50 % required for outright victory in the first round in December .
SOUTH AMERICAN WOMEN PRESIDENTS
Michelle Bachelet - elected Chile 's first woman leader , 2006 Janet Jagan - elected Guyana 's leader in 1997 after the death of her husband , the previous president Lidia Gueiler Tejada - served as interim president of Bolivia following a coup , 1979 - 80 Isabel Martinez de Peron - sworn in as interim president of Argentina in 1974 when husband Juan Peron fell ill and died ; kept power until 1976 Rosalia Arteaga - briefly acted as president of Ecuador in 1997
Ms Bachelet , who won 46 % of the vote then , went into the run - off ballot leading the opinion polls .
The former defence minister will become the fourth consecutive president from the centre - left coalition known as the Concertacion , which has governed Chile since the end of military rule in 1990 .
A doctor and a single mother , Ms Bachelet was seen as an unusual choice for the presidency in a country considered one of the most socially conservative in South America .
Mr Pinera - who polled 25 % in December - was given the backing of third - placed candidate , Joaquin Lavin , who received 23 % in that vote .
However , the billionaire businessman and former senator appears not to have picked up all the right - wing vote previously given to Mr Lavin .
2007 rsync.net Code Bounties
rsync.net is built on open standards and , largely , on free , open - source software .
In the course of our work and interaction with customers , we often come across requirements not yet met by our community .
We have chosen to respond to these needs by actively soliciting professional programmers to resolve them .
We have chosen five projects for 2007 and are contributing an initial $ 500 bounty to each project .
Projects listed below that have not been adopted will ( presumably ) be adopted as the bounty grows larger , so we encourage the community to contribute funds to these projects .
See below for details on supporting a particular project .
The Projects
Vmware 6.x on FreeBSD
Years ago , Vmware 3.x would run quite well on FreeBSD 4.x .
Unfortunately , Vmware 3.x has long since fallen out of support ( one cannot obtain a license from Vmware ) and even if it did still work on current versions of FreeBSD , the feature set of Vmware 3.x is somewhat obsolete .
The Goal : A fully functioning Vmware 6.x running on FreeBSD 6.x OR 7.x as a host operating system .
A roadmap for support of future Vmware releases on FreeBSD ( especially support for 3d hardware virtualization ) , the creation of a /usr / ports / emulators / vmware5 , and an official maintainer of this port .
Current Bounty : $ 3500
Contributors : rsync.net ( $ 500 ) , Michael Koerner ( $ 120 ) , Hellmuth Michaelis ( $ 100 ) , Stefan Zehl ( $ 50 ) , Randy Bush ( $ 500 ) , Doug Poland ( $ 50 ) , J. Gill ( $ 150 ) , John Doherty ( $ 50 ) , Robert Eckardt ( $ 270 ) , Paul Hoffman ( $ 100 ) , Trent Nelson ( on behalf of OnResolve Ltd ( www.onresolve.com)) ( $ 1110 ) , Nakata Maho ( $ 500 )
Status : CLAIMED by Orlando Bassotto - currently in progress .
Updating Duplicity and establishing a maintainer
Duplicity is a very elegant mash - up of librsync , gpg and tar .
Normally a gpg-encrypted file would not be " rsync- able " because even a small change in the file would cause the ciphertext to be completely random in relation to the previous ciphertext .
Duplicity combines librsync and gpg in a way that makes it possible to send bandwidth - efficient " changes only " backups of an unencrypted dataset to an encrypted dataset on the remote host .
Unfortunately , duplicity has been stuck at version 0.4.2 for over a year and does not have a current maintainer .
The Goal : Immediately release a new 0.4.3 version with existing patches for known issues .
Then create a 0.5 development release that , after testing , will be released as a stable 0.5.x .
Establish a maintainer for the duplicity project .
Current Bounty : $ 500
Contributors : rsync.net ( $ 500 )
Status : Adopted by Kenneth Loafman ( kenneth@loafman.com ) - COMPLETE
Working Unison support and long options support in scponly shell
The scponly shell is a very useful Unix tool that allows one to restrict remote SSH usage to the ability to run scp while denying innteractive logins .
Although Unison support has been listed as a feature for some time , that support is broken .
Further , there are problems with option handling that ( effectively ) make it impossible to run rsync over scponly .
The Goal : Fix Unison support in scponly and implement long options support as described here .
Current Bounty : $ 500
Contributors : rsync.net ( $ 500 )
Status : Adopted by Kaleb Pederson ( kibab@icehouse.net ) - COMPLETE
FreeBSD UFS2 problem resolution and standardized UFS2 stress testing
In the course of running rsync.net , we have discovered a fair number of problems with FreeBSD UFS2 - especially relating to quotas , snapshots and large ( > 2TB ) filesystems .
We will be publishing problem reports for these issues over the next few weeks .
In addition , we would like to propose the creation of a standardized UFS2 stress testing application ( or suite of applications ) that could be used by the FreeBSD release engineering group to identify problems before versions are released .
The Goal : Write and implement patches for UFS2 problem reports that rsync.net will submit , and develop standardized UFS2 stress test application (s ) .
Current Bounty : $ 650
Contributors : rsync.net ( $ 500 ) , Doug Poland ( $ 50 ) , High Speed Rails Inc. ( $ 100 )
Status : UNCLAIMED

SpaceX 's first Falcon 1 rocket to fly sits atop its launch pad at the U.S. Army 's Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll as a C - 17 aircraft flies in the distance .
It was astructural issue , not high winds , which scrubbed the private launch firmSpaceX 's second attempt to send its first Falcon 1 rocket into orbit Monday .
SpaceXofficials found the problem with the rocket 's first stage almost three hoursinto the rocket 's eight - hour launch window .
Prior to the discovery , winds inexcess of 24 knots at its island launch site looked set to delay liftoff .
Therocket 's spaceflightdebut has been pushed into early 2006 .
" The launchis scrubbed for the year , " said SpaceX chief Elon Musk in an e-mail update tothe firm 's El Segundo , California headquarters .
" We noticed a structural issuewith the first stage fuel tank that will require repair . "
Furtherdetails on the structural glitch will be provided a soon as they are available , SpaceX officials said , adding that the rocket must be made safe for groundcrews before engineers can track the problem at the launch pad .
" I expect that the earliest that launch would occur is late January , " Musk said .
" Third time 's the charm . "
Secondscrub
Monday ' slaunch attempt marked the second scrub for SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket and itsU.S. Air Force ( USAF ) cadet - built satellite payload FalconSat - 2 .
SpaceXofficials calledoff a Nov. 26 launch attempt after exhausting a four - hour launch window , during which the Falcon 1 rocket experienced a computer reboot and loss ofliquid oxygen supply .
Monday 'sscrub announcement came at about 2:30 p.m. EST ( 1930 GMT ) , half an hour afterthe window opened for the Falcon 1 space shot at its Omelek Island launch padat the U.S. Army 's Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site .
The testsite sits on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean 's Marshall Islands chain nearthe equator .
" We 'regoing to get back on the pad as soon as we possibly can , " Gwynne Shotwell , SpaceX vice president of business development , during a teleconference withreporters .
" Structural repairs can be done on the ground and we can test them , so I 'm comfortable with this . "
Shotwellsaid the Kwajalein facility was available during the third week of January , butwhether SpaceX will choose to target that time for a new launch attempt isstill undetermined .
The Falcon1 rocket is the first of a three - booster family planned by SpaceX to offercommercial launch services to consumers , governments and the military .
Thetwo - stage rocket stands about 68 feet ( 21 meters ) and is designed to launchpayloads of up to 1,256 pounds ( 570 kilograms ) into low - Earth orbit .
Its firststage is also designed to parachute to the ocean and be reused on subsequentflights .
Each Falcon1 launch is slated to carry a $ 6.7 million price tag , SpaceX officials havesaid .
A longerwait
Monday 'sscrub does mean that cadets at the USAF Academy in Colorado will have to wait abit longer to see their space plasma measuring satellite fly .
Cadetsdesigned and built the $ 800,000 FalconSat - 2 spacecraft by January 2003 under aprogram to provide students practical experience developing spacecraft .
Thelaunch is supported by the USAF and the Defense Advanced Research ProjectsAgency ( DARPA ) .
" You wanteverything to be absolutely perfect on a launch like this , " academyspokesperson John van Winkle told SPACE.com , adding that there was some disappointment - as expected - at the academy following the scrubbed launch attempt .
But many ofthe cadets who helped design and build FalconSat - 2 were unable to watchMonday 's launch attempt due to final exams , van Winkle said .
A delay untilJanuary would give them another chance .
Also , theacademy 's ground control station did not plan to take initial telemetry datauntil the start of the Spring semester in January anyway , van Winkle said .
" This has verylittle impact on us over the long term , and may actually end up better for us , " he added .
LONG a human dumping ground , Kazakhstan is used to mass shifts of population .
Josef Stalin sent his enemies to gulags on the steppe , and during the second world war deported millions of people there : Volga Germans , Chechens , Ingush , Meshketian Turks and others .
Even when some were allowed to return home after his death in 1953 , 2 m Russians and Ukrainians were brought in to turn the harsh steppe into farmland .
Kazakhs were a minority in their homeland .
When the Soviet Union collapsed , about 800,000 ethnic Germans and more than 1 m Russians left the newly independent Kazakhstan .
The population fell from 16.5 m in 1989 to 14.9 m in the late 1990s .
But these days , as economic meltdown has turned to oil - fuelled boom , the human flow has reversed .
A World Bank report now ranks Kazakhstan as the world 's ninth - biggest destination for migrants .
Kazakhstan is still an exporter of people , mostly ethnic Russians and Germans returning to their homelands .
But it has started to draw large numbers of migrants from the impoverished neighbouring Central Asian countries of Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and above all Uzbekistan , as well as a few from the frontier regions of Russia and from China .
They work mainly on building sites , as well as in tobacco and cotton fields and in the bazaars .
Russia , the world 's second - largest recipient of migrants , continues to be the country of first choice for Central Asians , but its appeal is waning thanks to the open discrimination against non-Russians .
Kazakhstan is closer and enjoys , in the south , a warmer climate .
Its people are seen as more tolerant and their language , Kazakh , is closely related to Kyrgyz and Uzbek .
Politically , the regime remains authoritarian .
But it has pursued market reforms and these , combined with the development of oil reserves once neglected by Moscow and high oil prices , are transforming Kazakhstan .
Its economy has grown by close to 10 % a year since 2000 .
There are an estimated 400,000 illegal migrants among a population of 15.2m .
Economic growth is changing Kazakhstani attitudes .
In the south , it has become almost the norm for Kazakh farmers to keep Uzbek servants to work their land .
In the view of Yekaterina Badikova , of the International Organisation for Migration in Almaty , Kazakhstan 's biggest city , some are in effect kept as slaves .
The government is trying to lure these armies of Gastarbeiter , the German word commonly used for the migrants , out of the shadow economy .
At the end of 2006 , the Ministry of Interior completed a five - month pilot programme during which over 160,000 migrants were legalised .
This was a third more than they had expected and brought in more than $ 8 m in taxes .
Just a few years ago , Kazakhstanis were tickled by the news that two dozen freezing Sri Lankans had been detained by police in the middle of winter after wandering aimlessly across the snow - covered steppe in the north of the country for four days .
They had been dumped there by traffickers and told they had arrived , as they had been promised , in Germany .
These days traffickers might no longer need to lie .
As a destination for migration , Kazakhstan is good enough for many .
Hackers briefly overwhelmed at least three of the 13 computers that help manage global computer traffic Tuesday in one of the most significant attacks against the internet since 2002 .
Experts said the unusually powerful attacks lasted as long as 12 hours but passed largely unnoticed by most computer users , a testament to the resiliency of the internet .
Behind the scenes , computer scientists worldwide raced to cope with enormous volumes of data that threatened to saturate some of the internet 's most vital pipelines .
The Homeland Security Department confirmed it was monitoring what it called " anomalous " internet traffic .
" There is no credible intelligence to suggest an imminent threat to the homeland or our computing systems at this time , " the department said in a statement .
The motive for the attacks was unclear , said Duane Wessels , a researcher at the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis at the San Diego Supercomputing Center .
" Maybe to show off or just be disruptive ; it does n't seem to be extortion or anything like that , " Wessels said .
Other experts said the hackers appeared to disguise their origin , but vast amounts of rogue data in the attacks were traced to South Korea .
UltraDNS may have been target
The attacks appeared to target UltraDNS , the company that operates servers managing traffic for websites ending in " org " and some other suffixes , experts said .
Officials with NeuStar Inc. , which owns UltraDNS , confirmed only that it had observed an unusual increase in traffic .
Among the targeted " root " servers that manage global internet traffic were ones operated by the Defence Department and the internet 's primary oversight body .
" There was what appears to be some form of attack during the night hours here in California and into the morning , " said John Crain , chief technical officer for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers .
He said the attack was continuing and so was the hunt for its origin .
" I do n't think anybody has the full picture , " Crain said .
" We 're looking at the data . "
Crain said Tuesday 's attack was less serious than attacks against the same 13 " root " servers in October 2002 because technology innovations in recent years have increasingly distributed their workloads to other computers around the globe .
Not - yet - airborne Virgin America invited us to check out the way - decked Airbus A320 with Red prototype in - flight entertainment system that 's parked at SFO right now .

DIGG THIS
In recent weeks , since the naming of new ministers in Sweden and the revelation that some of them had n’t paid the special tax on television sets called “ TV - license ” and had hired black market nannies , there have been increased discussion of the morality of tax evasion .
Stefan Swärd , an Evangelical leader , claimed [ In Swedish ] that tax evasion is “ theft ” and said that not paying the excessive taxation imposed on work efforts is equivalent to going to a municipal building and take money out of their pay office .
The fallacy here should be apparent .
When one performs a black market activity one does not make the State or anyone else worse off .
If you hire someone to clean your house , the State will receive no less income than had you cleaned the house yourself or had no cleaning taken place and the house remained a mess .
Nor can the State legitimately claim credit for the activity .
The State had no role in initiating or performing the activity and so it could not in any way claim moral credit for creating the activity .
Perhaps one could argue that the State ’s implicit police protection for the fulfillment of obligations ( even that is dubious not least considering that we ’re talking about a black market transaction ) gives them a small right to revenue , yet even assuming that , that would be more than paid for anyway by the taxes that even black market workers are likely to pay in their official market dealings .
If there is any “ theft ” involved here , then it is outrageously excessive taxation imposed by the Swedish government where hardworking people are deprived of the fruits of their labor .
It must also be emphasized that when it comes to many of these particularly labor intensive activities , the high tax rates now imposed make it necessary to perform them underground  or else they wo n’t be performed at all .
Consider the case of , say , an accountant who produces a value of $ 50 per hour with his work and a would - be nanny who is willing to work if she receives at least $ 10 per hour .
In a free society they would undoubtedly make a mutually beneficial deal where the accountant pay the nanny somewhere between $ 10 and $ 50 per hour to perform some household services , allowing the accountant to either work more or to have more spare time .
Even had there been a modest level of taxation , like the 15 % flat tax in Hong Kong , there would be no trouble making a deal , as the marginal value of work as an accountant for the accountant would have been $ 42.50 and the minimum pay for the would - be nanny would cost the accountant $ 11.80 .
But with the Swedish levels of taxation , where the total tax wedge is more than 70 % for high - income earners and 60 % for low - income earners , no such mutually beneficial exchange will take place .
This is because the net income for the accountant is just $ 15 per hour , while the minimum pay for the nanny will cost the accountant $ 25 per hour .
This will induce the accountant to reduce his hours and perform these household services himself , as this will be economically rational for him under these conditions .
The end result : the state will receive no tax income for the household services .
Meanwhile , the accountant will produce less of his highly productive services and the would - be nanny will go unemployed .
From what perspective would it then be immoral to pay the would - be nanny $ 10 in a black market transaction with money received from a highly taxed job and so give the accountant more time to perform his highly productive services or the spare time he needs to endure his job and at the same time give the would - be nanny more income ?
The rest of society will certainly not lose , if anything they will win , while the two involved parties will both benefit .
The high tax rates that in effect forbid the legal performance of these mutually beneficial exchanges should be recognized as the immoral element here  not the “ black market ” performance of these mutually beneficial exchanges .

The Best of Stefan M.I. Karlsson
Washington DC - ( Ass Mess ) : Following Jimmy Carter 's statement last weekend that George Bush is the worst US President ever it's now Al Gore 's turn to remind the world what the vast majority of non-US oil and arms industry - pimping people think of the White House Butcher of Baghdad .
In his new book ' An Assault of Treason '
Gore says that the GOP 'has engaged in an unprecedented and sustained campaign of mass deception ' .
Pandering to the very fears and insecurities that it consistently engendered into its rabid homophobic , racist , gun-slinging , superstition - peddling customer base , it used decades of planted psychotic client - dictators in oil - rich , democracy - poor hotspots to terrify US voters .
As a PR diversion from warmongering , a smokescreen of domestic faith - based initiatives was nothing less than cunning determination to get away with destroying the US Constitution - while hiding behind a zealous exterior sanitising a campaign to impose dictatorship by stealth on the American people .
" Sure Saddam sucked .
The GOP ensured that thirty years ago when they paid him to wage war against the Old Shah of Persia .
" But the Bush kleptocracy does n't do negotiation .
It suffocates , without being able to spill the blood of US soldiers .
" It 's the only thing that makes it look good : presiding over the ceremonials when the stars and stripes - draped coffins return home for burial .
" Their greatest regret was that Democrats were in charge of annihilating Hitler , and not the GOP .
" Inventing a foreign horror to wage war at was always their ambition when they could n't trump FDR and Harry S Truman .
" And inflicting 9/11 ?
Just the icing on the cake - the yellowcake that was force - fed to the masses like the two fish and five loaves in a Biblical story .
" The prosecution rests . "
Remember how Google introduced a link bomb fix in January that , among other things , finally got US President George W. Bush out of first page of results for searches on miserable failure and failure at Google ?
Bush is back , at least for failure , and the White House has only itself to blame .
Someone reading our article about the fix — Google Kills Bush ’s Miserable Failure Search & Other Google Bombs — commented yesterday about Bush ’s return to the results .
I did n’t see Bush ’s page ranking myself when I checked yesterday , but now I do .
What happened ?
The White House used the word “ failure ” on Bush ’s page , which resulted in the page becoming relevant for the query again .
If the White House was smart , they ’d have realized it can never ever ever ever use the words “ miserable ” or “ failure ” or both of them together without risking showing up in Google ’s top results for searches on those words .
More on why in a moment .
But first , we know already that the White House is n’t smart when it comes to search engines .
That ’s because it tried to stop the link bomb once before , back in September 2006 .
My article above explains more about what the White House did .
As a result , any future US President now has this “ miserable failure ” search threat hanging over them , rather than it just being isolated to George W. Bush , as it once was .
Now for the science bit .
Google ’s never explained how its link bomb fix works .
However , it ’s widely assumed that Google looks for an unusually high number of links using certain words pointing at a page that does n’t use those words .
If lots of people link to a particular page at the White House site using the word “ failure ” in the anchor text — but the White House page itself does n’t use that word —
Google guesses there ’s a link bomb happening and defuses it .
If the page DOES contain the word , then Google assumes there ’s no link bombing going on and does n’t tap into its automatic link bomb algorithm .
That ’s where the White House misstepped .
Currently on the page is this text :
In a time of war , it ’s irresponsible for the… Democratic leadership in Congress to delay for months on end while our troops in combat are waiting for the funds .
The bottom line is this : Congress ’s failure to fund our troops on the front lines will mean that some of our military families could wait longer for their loved ones to return from the front lines .
And others could see their loved ones headed back to the war sooner than they need to .
That is unacceptable to me , and I believe it is unacceptable to the American people .
I ’ve bolded the word “ failure , ” where it is used .
That single use of the word was enough to reactivate the link bomb , which for the word “ failure ” had been happening since September 2005 .
When the words goes off the page , as it will , you should see the page quickly drop out of the rankings once again .
For the records , here ’s how things stand across all the major search engines from what I see ( it ’s possible others will see slightly different results ) :
Sudos & Sudon'ts
Systems can offer security ; it 's up to you to take advantage of it .
A system only needs security if it either is or has something to protect .
As security cannot be built into a system after the fact - vis Microsoft 's dilemma with Windows - a good system has to have proper security at the user 's disposal .
A good system must foremost protect itself without waiting for a nod from its user .
If the system goes down no one benefits .
It must be assumed the system will stand .
A good system must also offer adequate means for a user to protect personal data .
Somewhere between the one and the other the user at times will assume the role of the system itself .
But as this role is coveted by black hats and as errors committed when in this role can have dire consequences it 's necessary to think first before leaping .
But back to basics first .
It 's All Files
Everything on Unix is a file .
Directories are files just like ordinary files .
Other arcane objects such as sockets and symbolic links are just files too .
Every file belongs to a user and a group and every file - and directory - has r ead w rite and e x ecute permissions for its u ser , group , and the o thers .
For a program file or a script to run it must have the e x ecute bit set for the appropriate field - u ser , g roup , or o ther .
What read and write mean in this context is obvious .
For directories it 's a bit different : if a read bit is set for you ( as user , group , or other ) you 'll be able to read it - list its contents .
And if its e x ecute bit is set you 'll be able to physically ' enter ' it - change directory into it .
If its write bit is set then you 'll be able to modify it .
Directories contain lists of file names and corresponding inodes .
An inode is an index into an ilist ( volume control block ) with all information about a file .
Being able to modify a directory means being able to write to it - to remove , add , or change file names or their inodes .
If you can't write to a directory you can't add files , remove them , rename them , or anything .
[ Protecting files is of course another matter : simply because a directory is write protected does n't mean its files also are . ]
Root & Sudo
Unix is a multiuser system .
Every Unix user has an account .
And one account on Unix can do and get at almost anything .
root .
root is n't the name of the ' root ' account ; the ' root ' account can have any name and ' root ' is most common ; but by definition any account with a user ID of 0 ( zero ) and a group ID of 0 ( zero ) is a ' root account ' .
Thus it is possible to have any number of root accounts on a system , or to redefine ' root ' as a low privilege account and rename the old root account ' foo ' .
And so forth .
% cat /etc / passwd | grep 0:0 root :*:0:0 : System Administrator :/ var/root:/ bin/tcsh
The second field in the above is for the password for the root account ; the encrypted password is supposedly an asterisk (' * ' ) .
But Unix uses DES encryption and no password regardless of length is reduced to a single character with DES .
The root account on the above system is therefore effectively disabled .
There 's a reason for this : the recurring ' shoot oneself in the foot ' syndrome coupled with the threat of having your system compromised : any program a user runs will normally have the access rights of that user - and that includes rogue programs .
We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System Administrator .
It usually boils down to these two things : # 1 ) Respect the privacy of others . # 2 ) Think before you type .
Running the root account - even from the command line - is dangerous ; running GUI apps as root is even more so .
So some distros such as OS X and Ubuntu have the root account disabled ' out of the box ' in the above way .
Yet root access is sometimes necessary ; there must therefore be some way of getting root access even if the root account is disabled .
That way is often sudo .
sudo is a program residing commonly in /usr / bin .
% ls - ailno /usr / bin/ sudo 24466 ---s--x--x 1 0 0 - 96384 Aug 7 2005 /usr/bin/sudo
The zeros in the above denote the user and group of the file ; /usr / bin / sudo belongs to user 0 and group 0 .
The string ' --- s--x--x ' is a representation of the access rights for the file .
Dashes represent ' no attribute ' .
The first dash can be replaced by a ' d ' to denote a directory ; the next two dashes are for read and write access respectively for the user ( owner ) of the file .
The ' s ' in the next position represents a so called ' set UID ' bit .
This bit assumes e x ecute rights but adds something to the mix .
The remaining four dashes denote no read or write access respectively for either the group the file belongs to or for anyone else .
/usr / bin/sudo may be run by anyone but not even root can read it or modify it .
And then of course there 's that ' s ' bit .
The set UID bit .
The set UID bit is a way to change the effective user of a program .
sudo has the bit set and it's owned by root ; anyone is allowed to run sudo ; therefore anyone running sudo is effectively running it as root .
sudo may therefore be described as a privilege escalation trampoline : you hop on as yourself and bounce off as root .
But that 's where the code in sudo comes in : it performs a number of authentication checks before it lets you bounce back off again .
But if you pass all the tests your command will effectively run as root and not as you .
Sudo Syntax
sudo does n't just escalate you to root : it ' substitutes a user ' - which by default as with its earlier counterpart su is root .
SYNOPSIS sudo - V | -h | -l | - L | -v | -k | - K | -s | [ - H ] [ - P ] [ - S ] [ - b ] | [ - p prompt ] [ - c class|- ] [ - a auth_type ] [ -u username| #uid ] command
Anyone can invoke sudo but only after passing the authentication checks will sudo run the command it 's given .
By default on OS X a user must be a member of the admin group and be able to supply the user 's password .
[ This can be changed . ]
sudo determines who can do what by consulting the protected file /etc / sudoers .
% ls - ailo /etc/ sudoers 24465 -r--r----- 1 root wheel - 341 Jul 14 2004 /etc/sudoers % sudo cat /etc / sudoers Password : # sudoers file .
# #
This file MUST be edited with the ' visudo ' command as root .
# #
See the sudoers man page for the details on how to write a sudoers file .
# #

sudo also does quite a lot to protect you - from threats you probably did n't even consider .
sudo tries to be safe when executing external commands .
Variables that control how dynamic loading and binding is done can be used to subvert the program that sudo runs .
To combat this the LD_* , _RLD _* , SHLIB_PATH ( HP - UX only ) , and LIBPATH ( AIX only ) environment variables are removed from the environment passed on to all commands executed .
sudo will also remove the IFS , ENV , BASH_ENV , KRB_CONF , KRBCONFDIR , KRBTKFILE , KRB5 _CONFIG , LOCALDOMAIN , RES_OPTIONS , HOSTALIASES , NLSPATH , PATH_LOCALE , TERMINFO , TERMINFO_DIRS and TERMPATH variables as they too can pose a threat .
If the TERMCAP variable is set and is a path name , it too is ignored .
Additionally , if the LC_ * or LANGUAGE variables contain the / or % characters , they are ignored .
If sudo has been compiled with SecurID support , the VAR_ACE , USR_ACE and DLC_ACE variables are cleared as well .
The list of environment variables that sudo clears is contained in the output of sudo - V when run as root .
$ sudo sudo -V Password : Sudo version 1.6.8p12 Authentication methods : ' pam '
Syslog facility if syslog is being used for logging : local2 Syslog priority to use when user authenticates successfully : notice Syslog priority to use when user authenticates unsuccessfully : alert Send mail if the user is not in sudoers Lecture user the first time they run sudo Require users to authenticate by default Root may run sudo Allow some information gathering to give useful error messages Visudo will honor the EDITOR environment variable

Note that there is one thing sudo will not ignore .
To prevent command spoofing sudo checks '.' and '' ( both denoting the current working directory ) last when searching for a command in $ PATH .
The actual $ PATH variable is not modified and is passed unchanged to the program that sudo executes .
[ For more on $ PATH see below . ]
The Four Bins
Unix programs are traditionally found in four locations .
There are four locations because originally there was only one and as time went on each successive location accumulated too many files .
The first location for Unix programs was / bin right under root .
This was always part of the first ( default ) mountable file system : it had to be present when the system started up .
And as / bin grew a new location was created for less critical files : /usr / bin was commonly mounted on a separate physical device .
[ /usr was where all user accounts originally were located - eg /usr / bwk , /usr / dmr , /usr / ken .
/usr / bin was therefore regarded informally as a repository for ' user ' programs rather than system programs . ]
After a while two new locations came about : / sbin and /usr / sbin .
[ Think of them if you will as repositories for system commands but there 's no thorough distinction . ]
What 's important about these four bins is that they 're locked down tight - they 're ' hermetically sealed ' .
And this is important for you and your security .
Hermetically Sealed
The four ' bin ' locations should be ' hermetically sealed ' : the files themselves are owned by root ( or in rare cases by another almost equally inaccessible account ) and their directories are owned by root as well .
And no one else is allowed to modify their contents .
% ls - adilno / bin / sbin /usr / bin /usr / sbin 6757 drwxr-xr-x 35 0 0 - 1190 May 20 2005 / bin 6890 drwxr-xr-x 60 0 0 - 2040 Aug 12 2005 / sbin 6954 drwxr-xr-x 548 0 0 - 18632 Jan 24 20:06 /usr /bin 7083 drwxr-xr-x 171 0 0 - 5814 Jan 24 00:30 /usr/sbin
Thus you do n't have to worry much about any of these commands being hijacked .
And as long as you only use commands in these four protected locations you run no risk when invoking sudo if you specify full paths for all programs involved .
$ PATH
When invoking commands the Unix shell must first find them .
It will know where to look thanks to an ' environment variable ' known as $ PATH .
$ PATH will typically contain the four ' bin ' directories ( in perhaps an arbitrary order ) .
% echo $ PATH
/ bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
The directories are searched in the order given ; the colon (' : ') is used as a field separator .
As soon as the shell finds a match it stops its search .
If the program foo is found in both / sbin and / bin and $ PATH is as above only the copy in / bin will be seen ( and run ) .
Running sensitive commands requiring privilege escalation is relatively safe as long as $ PATH has not been tampered with and as long as all program files referenced in the commands are to be found in one of the four ' bin ' directories .
Some systems add further directories to the standard $ PATH variable ; it 's important to check these directories are also locked down just as tightly .
Alternative Sudo Authentication
By default sudo will require the password of an admin user already logged in .
This has one drawback : if an interloper acquires the admin password the interloper by default also has access to the root account .
It is possible to configure sudo to instead demand the password for the root account , but this would necessitate enabling the root account - something better avoided .
But the last field in a user record denotes the program ( ' shell ' ) that will be run on a successful login ; were this shell set to /usr / bin / false the successful login would immediately exit again , incapable of causing any harm or doing anything at all .
[ /usr / bin / false is a program that simply exits with a non - zero error code . ]
And set the second last field - the login directory - to / var / empty to be doubly sure .
[ That 's what it 's there for . ]
And finally you give root a password - and of course not the admin password .
root : tNzaRKtRg7Xyf:0:0 : Revolving Door Root Account:/ var / empty:/usr/bin/false
[ Of course this can - and should - be done differently today .
On OS X Tiger systems or earlier it 's NetInfo Manager . ]
Once that 's done you change the authentication requirements in /etc / sudoers .
Add ' Defaults : rootpw ' with visudo .
[ Take a crash course in vi before attempting this . ]
MOAB : Collateral Damage
One of the benefits of the Month of Apple Bugs was to make OS X users understand that security is up to them - that they themselves must be aware of security issues in their systems and things they should n't be doing or condoning in third party applications .
Again : a system only needs security if it either is or has something to protect .
As security cannot be built into a system after the fact - vis Microsoft 's dilemma with Windows - a good system has to have proper security at the user 's disposal .
And a good system must foremost protect itself without waiting for a nod from its user .
If the system goes down no one benefits .
It must be assumed the system will stand .
Thus a good system must offer adequate means for a user to protect personal data .
Third party applications for OS X have been both naïve and lax in their treatment of this data , often requiring admin passwords and thereafter storing them in the clear or at best with the negligible speed bump known as ' base64 ' .
Now that OS X users are aware of how their security was outsourced they can do something about it .
And as a system becomes more complex there will be more ways to exploit it due to the interaction between the various components and software designers not seeing the full ramifications of the changes they make .
Even clerical error can play a part as was noted here during that month .
Where the Buck Stops
At the end of the day security is the responsibility of the person who owns or runs the system .
As ordinary users grow to understand more about how attackers can get at their systems and their information they become more capable of meeting the threats and eliminating them .
sudo is a powerful and above all very convenient facility in Unix but it can be used carelessly - and therefore it can also be compromised .
And while the danger most people fear most is the worm outbreak the great majority of exploits occur with the black hat in a more direct contact with the target machine - ' inside the company ' .
Attacks of today - the new professional kind - do n't exhibit much ambition to cause widespread worm outbreaks anyway .
There was very little money to be gained by the ILOVEYOU worm , the AnnaK worm , or Code Red .
They caused a lot of damage but they were n't written with the dollar sign in mind .
Today 's new generation of attacks are of a completely different breed -s they single out specific computers or LANs and go for pure profit and nothing else .
It 's therefore not enough to kick back and relax in the comfort that a worm outbreak is unlikely - for a concerted focused attack is , and today more than ever before .
It 's not particularly difficult to take any Unix distro out of the box and set it up so it becomes the sorry part of a turkey shoot within minutes .
For any of these systems to work adequately ( and protect your data ) you have to make sure they 're configured properly and that you do n't go do something you 're not supposed to .
The Dos and Don'ts
Do n't ' sudo ' execute a script unless you can guarantee the contents of the script .
Your scripts are normally not owned by root and they 're writable .
Meaning anyone can corrupt them .
And when they 're run through a sudo command you 're toast .
Watch out for sudo calls in scripts .
The same thing applies : you might not see changes made to your scripts and suddenly the bread is burning .
Make sure your Terminal is invoking a second login when you use it .
Your Terminal settings are in an unprotected file in your user area ; they can be modified to effect an ' ordinary ' shell session - something you generally do n't want .
Do n't run scripts requiring your password unless you check their contents .
This can't be stressed enough : it takes five minutes to write a password harvester that behaves exactly like sudo .
Check your running environment regularly .
$ PATH can be compromised in a number of ways - and as pointed out above sudo wo n't do anything about it .
Live without ~/.bash_profile and ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist .
Both of these files can be used to compromise you by corrupting $ PATH .
If you find the former : remove it and close Terminal before using Terminal again .
If you find the latter : remove it and log back in .
Make a habit of checking for their existence before doing anything with sudo .
Eliminate your sudo time stamp entirely .
This will mean you have to authenticate each and every time but it also means nothing else can ' piggyback ' in on your grace period .
[ By default the grace period is set to five minutes - click here for further info . ]
Enable TTY tickets .
This thwarts another compromise : each interface will instead run in its own sudo context .
[ Click here for further info . ]
Kill your time stamp when exiting Terminal .
Do this by executing either ' sudo - K ' or ' sudo - k ' .
Disable remote login .
By default this is on ; turn it off .
CLIX & Sudo
CLIX and the ACP perform a number of checks and functions to protect you against command spoofing and $ PATH hijacking .
CLIX automatically clears your sudo time stamp after every completed command .
time stamp after every completed command .
CLIX automatically clears all vestiges of your password when your computer goes to sleep .
CLIX only allows commands in the traditional four locations to be accessed without their full paths .
CLIX performs internal consistency checks on itself to make sure nothing is compromised .
The ACP ' Resolve Path '
Text service can check all paths before you run a command .
When you can write nearly perfect versions of PacMan and Space Invaders in your favorite productivity application , you know it 's crossed the boundary .
Of course , treating cells like pixels and implementing the game by changing the background colors probably was n't what the Excel developers had in mind , but frankly , that 's not much different than what the guys writing the original games had to deal with .

While his handlers worked assiduously Tuesday to ensure that U.S. President George W. Bush did not run into his Iranian nemesis , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in the corridors of the UN , a legendary fixer for the Bush family announced that the White House had cleared him to meet with a “ high representative ” of Tehran ’s government .
Former Secretary of State James Baker , who co-chairs a bipartisan , congressionally appointed task force called the Iraq Study Group ( ISG ) , said that the timing of the meeting with that representative , whom he declined to name , had yet to be arranged but that permission for such a meeting to take place has been granted .
“ I ’m fairly confident that we will meet with a high representative of the [ Iranian ] government , ” he said at a press conference at the U.S. Institute of Peace ( USIP ) , one of several think tanks , including the Center for Strategic and International Studies , the Center for the Study of the Presidency , and Baker ’s own Houston - based Institute for Public Policy , that are supporting the Study Group ’s work .
Such a meeting would no doubt feed speculation here that Baker , a consummate “ realist ” who reportedly has been privately critical of the administration ’s Middle East policies , could help tilt the balance of power within the administration in favor of fellow realists , centered in the State Department .
They generally support greater flexibility in dealing with perceived U.S. foes in the region , and against right - wing hawks led by Vice President Dick Cheney who have steadfastly opposed engagement with both Iran and Syria .
Indeed , Baker also announced Tuesday that his task force will meet later this week with the foreign minister of Syria , against which the administration has mounted a diplomatic boycott for almost two years .
The task force has already met with Damascus ’ ambassador here , as part of a series of meetings with Washington - based envoys from Iraq ’s Arab neighbors .
The ISG was launched by Congress and quietly endorsed by the White House last April at the suggestion of a senior Republican lawmaker , Rep. Frank Wolf , who expressed growing concern about both the increasingly obvious deterioration of the situation in Iraq  and the threats it posed to the larger region  and the increasingly rancorous and partisan tone of the domestic debate about the war here .
Baker , who served as Washington ’s chief diplomat under President George H. W. Bush , agreed to the appointment after gaining the personal approval of the younger Bush himself .
The ISG is co-chaired by former Democratic Rep. Lee Hamilton , who also serves as the head of the Wilson International Center for Scholars here , and consists of eight other members divided equally among prominent Republicans and Democrats , including several former senior members of the Reagan , elder Bush , and Clinton administrations .
Aiding the task force , which spent four days in Iraq earlier this month , are some five dozen policy experts and Middle East specialists from think tanks , academic institutions , and the private sector .
They range from neoconservative hawks , such as Clifford May of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies , to outspoken foes of the original decision to invade Iraq , such as the president of the Middle East Policy Council , retired ambassador Charles Freeman .
They in turn are divided into four working groups : economy and reconstruction ; military and security ; political development ; and strategic environment .
All participants have been ordered repeatedly by Baker not to talk to the press or anyone else about the ISG ’s deliberations until its work was concluded , probably some time early next year , so as not to influence the mid-term congressional elections in November .
Hamilton said the group ’s final report and recommendations will be made public immediately after they are submitted to Congress and the president .
In their remarks Tuesday , the ISG ’s first public appearance since its formation , both Baker and Hamilton stressed that the group had not yet begun discussing those recommendations .
Hamilton , however , also stressed the urgency and the Iraqi government ’s responsibility for reversing negative trends .
“ No one can expect miracles , but the people of Iraq have the right to expect immediate action , ” he said , adding , “ The next three months are critical . ”
Unlike the elder Bush ’s other top “ realist ” foreign policy aide , national security adviser Brent Scowcroft , with whom he remains close , Baker has been discreet about his criticism of the younger Bush ’s Middle East policies .
“ He has never overtly criticized Bush , ” noted Steve Clemons , director of the American Strategy Project at the New America Foundation .
Unlike Scowcroft , “ he has essentially kept a foothold in the administration . ”
Indeed , Baker , who led lead a major diplomatic effort for Bush in 2004 to reduce Iraq ’s staggering foreign debt , has confined his public criticism to the way the Pentagon handled the Iraq invasion and its aftermath .
Nonetheless , Baker , whose law firm has long represented some of the U.S. ’s biggest oil companies , is widely believed to agree with Scowcroft ’s criticisms of Bush ’s virtually unconditional alignment with Israel and his refusal to engage Iran and Syria , not only with respect to stabilizing Iraq  the ISG ’s focus  but also on a variety of other regional issues .
“ He ’s always been a proponent of dialogue , ” said Trita Parsi , an Iran expert and author of Treacherous Triangle : The Secret Dealings of Iran , Israel , and the United States , who suggested that the Baker talks may offer an opportunity for “ informal talks ” with Iran and , in any event , “ should help reduce the negative trend and the loss of trust ” between Tehran and Washington .
“ I think the fact that the talks will take place is quite significant in and of itself , ” he added .
Indeed , during last month ’s conflict between Israel and Hezbollah , the director of the Baker Institute , Edward Djerejian , who also served as a former ambassador to Damascus and as Baker ’s top Middle East adviser in the State Department during the 1991 Gulf War , called explicitly for the administration to engage in direct talks with both Syria and Iran on a range of issues .
“ Despite the tragedy we see unfolding in the region on all sides , this crisis does represent an opportunity to get on with the real core issues in the region , and this will require contacting and dealing with all the players .
All the players , ” Djerejian , who has advised Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and mentored her public - diplomacy chief and longtime Bush adviser , Karen Hughes , told an interviewer on National Public Radio in early August .
Rice , who has tried with limited success to move U.S. policy in a more flexible direction , particularly with respect to Iran , has reportedly come to largely share that view , but has been thwarted by Cheney and other senior officials , including Elliot Abrams , the neoconservative director of Middle East affairs in the National Security Council , in implementing it .
Whether Baker , in his work on the ISG or alongside , might help establish the kind of dialogue publicly advocated by Djerejian is speculative at this point .
Many observers believe that , at the very least , a strong recommendation by him or the group as a whole that Washington directly engage Tehran would be difficult for the administration to resist , particularly if current trends are not reversed .
“ It seems to me that Rice has gotten the latitude from Bush to pursue this sort of alternative course with Iran and the broader Middle East , ” Clemons said , adding “ But it does n’t mean that the president has bought into the process . ”
Ten months ago , the administration in fact agreed to a suggestion by its ambassador in Baghdad , Zalmay Khalilzad , to initiate talks with Tehran about the stabilizing Iraq , but Washington subsequently backed away from the idea .

Dabblers And Blowhards
I actually worry a lot that as I get " popular " I 'll be able to get away with saying stupider stuff than I would have dared say before .
This sort of thing happens to a lot of people , and I would * really * like to avoid it
- Paul Graham , posting on lemonodor.com
About two years ago , the Lisp programmer and dot - com millionaire Paul Graham wrote an essay entitled Hackers and Painters , in which he argues that his approach to computer programming is better described by analogies to the visual arts than by the phrase " computer science " .
When this essay came out , I was working as a computer programmer , and since I had also spent a few years as a full - time oil painter , everybody who read the article and knew me sent along the hyperlink .
I did n't particularly enjoy the essay â€ ” I thought the overall tone was glib , and I found the parallel to painting unconvincing â€ ” but it did n't seem like anything worth getting worked up about .
Just another programmer writing about what made him tick .
But the emailed links continued , and over the next two years Paul Graham steadily ramped up his output while moving definitively away from subjects he had expertise in ( like Lisp ) to topics like education , essay writing , history , and of course painting .
Sometime last year I noticed he had started making bank from an actual print book of collected essays , titled ( of course ) " Hackers and Painters " .
I felt it was time for me to step up .
So let me say it simply - hackers are nothing like painters .
It 's surprisingly hard to pin Paul Graham down on the nature of the special bond he thinks hobbyist programmers and painters share .
In his essays he tends to flit from metaphor to metaphor like a butterfly , never pausing long enough to for a suspicious reader to catch up with his chloroform jar .
The closest he comes to a clear thesis statement is at the beginning " Hackers and Painters " :
" [ O ] f all the different types of people I 've known , hackers and painters are among the most alike .
What hackers and painters have in common is that they 're both makers . "
To which I 'd add , what hackers and painters do n't have in common is everything else .
The fatuousness of the parallel becomes obvious if you think for five seconds about what computer programmers and painters actually do .
Computer programmers cause a machine to perform a sequence of transformations on electronically stored data .
cause a machine to perform a sequence of transformations on electronically stored data .
Painters apply colored goo to cloth using animal hairs tied to a stick .
It is true that both painters and programmers make things , just like a pastry chef makes a wedding cake , or a chicken makes an egg .
But nothing about what they make , the purposes it serves , or how they go about doing it is in any way similar .
Start with purpose .
With the exception of art software projects ( which I do n't believe Graham has in mind here ) all computer programs are designed to accomplish some kind of task .
Even the most elegant of computer programs , in order to be considered a program , has to compile and run [ 1 ] .
So just like mechanical engineers and architects , computer programmers create artifacts that have to stand up to an objective reality .
No one cares how pretty the code is if the program wo n't work .
The only objective constraint a painter has is making sure the paint physically stays on the canvas ( something that has proven surprisingly challenging ) .
Everything beyond that is aesthetics - arranging colored blobs in a way that best tickles the mind of the viewer .
This difference is what makes programming so similar to engineering , which also tries to create beautiful things in the face of objective constraints , but it 's a parallel that really rankles Graham .
He interprets it as implying that there should be limits on the creative control programmers exercise over their work : [ 2 ]
Doug Kaye :
In what ways do you think to program is more like painting than it is like some of our more common metaphors such as engineering ?
Paul Graham : [...] in buildings , for example there is this distinction between architects and engineers .
Architects decide what the building is going to look like basically and then they say to an engineer , " Can I do this ?
And then how ? "
And the engineer figures out how .
So architects figure out " what , " engineers figure out " how . "
Well painters do both .
Painters decide what to paint and then have to paint it .
And hackers in the best case also do both [ 3 ] .
You can safely replace " painters " in this response with " poets " , " composers " , " pastry chefs " or " auto mechanics " with no loss of meaning or insight .
There 's nothing whatsoever distinctive about the analogy to painters , except that Paul Graham likes to paint , and would like to feel that his programming allows him a similar level of self - expression .
The reason Graham 's essay is n't entitled " Hackers and Pastry Chefs " is not because there is something that unites painters and programmers into a secret brotherhood , but because Paul Graham likes to cultivate the arty aura that comes from working in the visual arts .
Having been both a painter and a programmer , I can certainly sympathize with him .
Great paintings , for example , get you laid in a way that great computer programs never do .
Even not - so - great paintings - in fact , any slapdash attempt at splashing paint onto a surface - will get you laid more than writing software , especially if you have the slightest hint of being a tortured , brooding soul about you .
For evidence of this I would point to my college classmate Henning , who was a Swedish double art / theatre major and on most days could barely walk .
Also remark that in painting , many of the women whose pants you are trying to get into are n't even wearing pants to begin with .
Your job as a painter consists of staring at naked women , for as long as you wish , and this day in and day out through the course of a many - decades - long career .
Not even rock musicians have been as successful in reducing the process to its fundamental , exhilirating essence .
It 's no surprise , then , that a computer programmer would want to bask in some of the peripheral coolness that comes with painting , especially when he has an axe to grind about his own work being ' mere engineering ' .
Yet while this might be charming or quirky in the abstract , it gets seriously annoying when real facts start getting butchered :
" " When oil paint replaced tempera in the fifteenth century , it helped painters to deal with difficult subjects like the human figure because , unlike tempera , oil can be blended and overpainted . " [ 4 ]
" The paintings made between 1430 and 1500 are still unsurpassed . "
" Compositional symmetry yields some of the most memorable paintings " "
It is not merely an accident of history that the great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of people .
If they had n't been , painting as a medium would n't have the prestige that it does . "
" Worse is Better is found throughout the arts .
In drawing , for example , the idea was discovered during the Renaissance . "
" What made oil paint so exciting , when it first became popular in the fifteenth century , was that you could actually make the finished work from the prototype . "
" Most painters start with a blurry sketch and gradually refine it . "
" Line drawings are in fact the most difficult visual medium [ 5 ] " "
The point of painting from life is that it gives your mind something to chew on : when your eyes are looking at something , your hand will do more interesting work . "
" Hackers need to understand the theory of computation about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry .
You need to know how to calculate time and space complexity and about Turing completeness .
You might also want to remember at least the concept of a state machine , in case you have to write a parser or a regular expression library .
Painters in fact have to remember a good deal more about paint chemistry than that . " [ 6 ]
All of these statements are wrong , or dumb , or both , and yet they are sprinkled through various essays like raisins in a fruitcake , with no further justification , and the reader is expected to enjoy the chewy burst of flavor and move on to the next tidbit .
I am not qualified to call bullshit on Paul Graham when he writes about programming , history , starting a business , or even growing up as a social pariah , but I do know enough about art to see when someone is just making shit up .
In Paul Graham 's world , as soon as oil paint was invented , painting techniques made a discontinuous jump from the fifteenth to the twentienth century , fortuitously allowing Renaissance painters to paint a lot like Paul Graham .
And the difficult problems the new medium supposedly helped painters solve just happened to resemble the painting problems that confront an enthusiastic but not particularly talented art student .
I hope I am not the only to find this highly suspicious .
I blame Eric Raymond and to a lesser extent Dave Winer for bringing this kind of schlock writing onto the Internet .
Raymond is the original perpetrator of the " what is a hacker ? " essay , in which you quickly begin to understand that a hacker is someone who resembles Eric Raymond .
Dave Winer has recently and mercifully moved his essays off to audio , but you can still hear him snorfling cashew nuts and talking at length about what it means to be a blogger [ 7 ] .
These essays and this writing style are tempting to people outside the subculture at hand because of their engaging personal tone and idiosyncratic , insider 's view .
But after a while , you begin to notice that all the essays are an elaborate set of mirrors set up to reflect different facets of the author , in a big distributed act of participatory narcissism .
The whole genre reminds me of the the wooly business books one comes across at airports ( " Management secrets of Gengis Khan " , the " Lexus and the Olive Tree " ) that milk a bad analogy for two hundred pages to arrive at the conclusion that people just like the author are pretty great .
This is a shame , both because Graham is an excellent author when he sticks to topics that he knows well , and because there are real books out there that address the connections between computer programming and visual art .
The best of these is called Light and Color in the Outdoors .
You may see my copy on a subway train somewhere , where it was liberated into greater New York by my roommate , the Bulgar of Fortune .
Minnaert never specifically mentions painting or computer science , but the book is all about the optics and physics of outdoor phenomena , and you will never look at a sunset the same way again .
From a more cultural studies angle , there is the unparalleled The Birth of the Modern : World Society 1815 - 1830 by Paul Johnson , which describes the historical moment when engineering and art bifurcated in Western culture , and is full of revealing character sketches of people you will immediately want to run out and read up on .
John Ruskin is a Victorian art critic and enthusiast who is on my perennial to - read list , since he seems to have bridged a number of worlds and was a supremely effective popularizer of high art .
He was also a talented draughtsman and watercolorist in his own right .
And of course , the canonical art - and - computer book is Douglas Hofstadter 's GÃ¶del , Escher , Bach , which successfully makes the kind of extended analogy that Paul Graham can only dream of , and does so in a way that is both intellectually honest and mind - broadening .
Any of these books will give you more in a page than Paul Graham can offer across the whole broad and aggressively expanding corpus of his online essays , and none of them will leave you with that dissatisfied , preached - at - in - the - corner - by - your - uncle feeling that has become a hallmark of Graham 's less technical writing .
As for the mystical connection between painters and programmers , the famous Lloyd Bentsen put - down keeps coming to mind .
Unless you are actually making art with computers - something that can be perfectly wonderful - being a hobbyist programmer is not going to let you in to art club .
You can look up to the guys who made the Boeing 747 , the original Macintosh , the Verazzano Narrows bridge , and other beautiful artifacts of engineering and design .
And you can aspire to walk in the footsteps of Faraday , Edison , Telford , Benjamin Franklin , and any other number of inspired tinkerers and builders .
But you , sir , are no painter .
And while you hack away at your terminal , or ride your homemade Segway , we painters and musicians are going to be right over here with all the wine , hash , and hot chicks .
Hee hee .
------
[ 1 ] Some Arc hackers may disagree with this .
[ 2 ] Paul Graham is a weenis .
[ 3 ]
Yes , these notes are a parody .
[ 4 ]
It 's hard to understand how fatuous this statement is unless you 've tried your hand at painting , which is one reason Graham gets away with this stuff .
The allusion here is to a sketchy , iterative style of painting that used to be called " alla prima " , where you block shapes in in oil paint and then swoosh them around the composition as the painting progresses , perhaps repainting entire sections of the picture .
This is the way Graham and I were taught to paint , but it has nothing whatsoever to do with painting in the fifteenth century , where you had a superprecise underdrawing and underpainting that were covered with thin glazes of color .
And it has equally little do with the difficulty of your subject matter .
Being able to blend and overpaint has as much to do with being a skilled draughtsman as having an eraser on your pencil has to do with being a good writer .
The Greeks did pretty well with the human form despite having to work in stone .

The three million unpaid volunteers for the Red Cross are an able , well - intentioned bunch … and they certainly do a lot of good .
But recently the Red Cross organization itself has undergone some close scrutiny , and there are some troubling findings .
According to Richard M. Walden ( president and CEO of Operation USA ) , it is estimated that 70 % of the $ 1.2 Billion donated to Katrina - related donations went to the Red Cross , yet the Red Cross is fully reimbursed by the government for any shelters or emergency services they provide .
Repeatedly , the Red Cross has run into trouble for spending much less on disaster recovery than they collect , shuffling the extra funds into their “ national disaster account , ” where it can be used for purposes other than that it was collected for .
That ’s the sort of trouble they saw in the aftermath of the 1989 San Francisco Bay Area earthquake , and after 9/11 .
Despite landing in trouble for soliciting more donations than they need and squirreling the rest away , the Red Cross continues to operate this way .
The organization makes a total of about $ 3 billion annually , about half of which is from selling donated blood .
Some of this surplus money ends up in disaster relief , but it seems that much does not .
Last year alone , the Red Cross spent $ 111 million in fund raising , and their CEO Marsha Evans made just under $ 652,000 .
It seems the the main value they offer is the free help of their volunteer force .
From the LA Times article :
The Red Cross expects to raise more than $ 2 billion before Hurricane Katrina - related giving subsides .
If it takes care of 300,000 people , that ’s $ 7,000 per victim .
I doubt each victim under Red Cross care will see more than a doughnut , an interview with a social worker and a short - term voucher for a cheap motel , with a few miscellaneous items such as clothes and cooking pots thrown in .
[ snip ]
Giving so high a percentage of all donations to one agency that defines itself only as a first - responder and not a rebuilder is not the wisest choice .
Americans ought to give a much larger share of their generous charity to community foundations , grass - roots nonprofit groups based in the affected communities and a large number of international “ brand name ” relief agencies with decades of expertise in rebuilding communities after disasters .
The Red Cross also has some disturbing caveats in the agreement form which every volunteer is required to sign .
From the BoingBoing article :
Every volunteer for the American Red Cross is required to sign on to an agreement that covers things like proper conduct , confidentiality , and includes a requirement for all volunteers to sign over all copyright / trademark / patent rights in any work - related writing , art and inventions come up with during their term , and for a full year afterward .
Why the hell does the Red Cross need to own the copyrights in the work - related blog postings you make for a year after you stop spending your free evenings handing out cookies to blood - donors ?
If you write a novel and include some real - life details gleaned from volunteering in a disaster - relief efforts , does the Red Cross really deserve to take all rights to it ?
So has the Red Cross become little more than a massive PR engine which takes advantage of millions of well - meaning volunteers , and capitalizes on disasters ?
It ’s an unpleasant conclusion , but it may just be the truth .
Any evidence to the contrary is welcome , because this story is far too depressing if it ’s true .

it might explode when charging .
Fast forward to 2006 and the
Flickr account of Rogier Mulder , a user who initially posted images of his PowerBook carnage .
When I came home today , I found that the magsafe connector was melted .
Thank god the cats disconnected the Macbook pro during the day ( they were probably chasing each other and tripped over the wire ) .
Apple was quick to replace the damaged PowerBook .
Apple support responded very well ( thanks Klaas ) and fast .
Before I called our local Apple support line , the dutch engineers were already contacted by their US collegues ( who saw the pics ) to inquire if I already called in .
I 'm getting a new Macbook asap and I will return my current one .
And , not surprisingly , Apple was also quick to request the images be taken down .
They have now been blurred to " protect the innocent , " along with an editorial comment .
For those whose immediate reaction is along the lines of ' censorship ' and other big words : I do n't care .

In the Fusiliers ' newsletter Major John Swift , a commander in Afghanistan , said political rather than military imperatives are driving the operation .
Casualty numbers were very significant and show no signs of reducing , he said .
It comes just days after Des Browne , the Defence Secretary , said the operation was harder than expected .
UK troops in Afghanistan are coming under sustained attack
The major pointed out that some have argued many casualties are being treated in the field and , therefore , were not getting into the official statistics for wounded in action .
Conservative defence spokesman Liam Fox said : " If the government fail to tell the public the truth and the truth comes out , as the truth tends to come out , I think that will undermine the public 's trust in the government 's handling of this whole issue . "
Maj Swift also suggested that political , rather than military , imperatives were driving the campaign .
He was referring to the Afghan government 's demand for British troops to move to isolated fire bases in northern Helmand where they are now under siege by the Taleban .
This was not the original plan but the Commander of the Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan , Colonel Stuart Tootle , said his troops were coping .
" We 've probably fired hundreds of thousand of rounds of ammunition which has had an effect on the enemy , quite a significant effect and it's been hard - but it 's been within our abilities to deal with it , as we 've expected , " he said .
" It 's what we 've trained for , we 're well equipped for it and so people have coped and they 've coped very well . "
Intense fighting
Maj Swift 's comments were published in the internal Royal Fusiliers newsletter and initially placed on a regimental website , but taken down soon afterwards .
However , a Ministry of Defence spokesman denied it had ordered the comments be removed from any site , or tried to " gag " Major Swift .
And , insisting that all serious casualties were recorded openly , he added : " We publish our casualty figures , and they cover all serious injuries .
" We 're not going to go and capture [ figures for ] everybody who gets a cut . "
Recent weeks have seen intense fighting between the Taleban and British troops - particularly in the Helmand province , where most of the servicemen are based .
He said the allure of treasure hidden under the sea seemed to blind the public to the ethical implications .
“ If these guys went and planted a bunch of dynamite around the Sphinx , or tore up the floor of the Acropolis , they ’d be in jail in a minute , ” Mr. Crisman said .
Anticipating such comments , John Morris , the chief executive of Odyssey , said in a statement : “ We have treated this site with kid gloves , and the archaeological work done by our team out there is unsurpassed .
We are thoroughly documenting and recording the site , which we believe will have immense historical significance . ”
Robert W. Hoge , a curator at the American Numismatic Society in New York , questioned the secrecy surrounding the discovery and said that while it might be perfectly legitimate , the findings would have been better preserved in the hands of archaeologists .
“ Whenever these finds are made by treasure hunters , their first thought is to sell instead of preserving , ” Mr. Hoge said .
“ They need to make money because they ’re a corporation with enormous expenses .
They ’re not there to preserve history . ”
The find , which was announced on the same day that the publicly traded Odyssey held its annual stockholder meeting , came four years after the company found thousands of coins worth $ 75 million after excavating the Republic , a steamship lost in 1865 off Savannah , Ga .
The company , which had reported losses for 2005 and 2006 , saw its stock rise almost 81 percent to $ 8.32 by the time the market closed on Friday .
This year , Odyssey received permission from the Spanish government to resume a search that had been suspended on the wreck of the Sussex , a British warship that sank in the Mediterranean in 1694 with a cargo of coins that may be worth billions of dollars .
The company has not disclosed the methods or equipment it used in the Black Swan find .
The largest documented previous find occurred in 1985 , when the treasure hunter Mel Fisher found the Nuestra Señora de Atocha , a Spanish galleon that sank off the Florida Keys in 1622 .
The treasure included thousands of silver coins worth more than $ 400 million .
Keanu Reeves : ' I Want to Get Married '
Deal or No Deal 's April to Play Daisy Duke
Keanu Reeves , a self - described " vagabond , " is ready to settle down , he says – and that includes having a family .
" I'm trying not to be alone so much , " the actor , 41 , who costars with Sandra Bullock in this summer 's , tellsmagazine in its June 11 issue .
" And man , it 's a struggle .
I want to get married .
I want to have kids .
That 's at the top of the mountain .
I 've got to climb the mountain first .
I 'll do it .
Just give me some time .
" In the interview , Reeves talks about his father , who abandoned the family when Reeves was a toddler , and his much - married mother , who moved the family numerous times – a lifestyle Reeves adopted himself .
" I 've had a vagabond life , " he says .
" There is a bit of the gypsy in me , and living that way seemed to make sense .
I could n't settle down .
I liked going to new places – renting apartments , staying in hotels .
Then I turned 40 .
That birthday is hard , perhaps because you know you 're grown - up .
So now it 's a makeover for me .
I have bought my first house .
I wanted a home .
" Reeves has faced a number of tragedies in his life .
His best friend , River Phoenix , died of a drug overdose in 1993 at the age of 23 , and Reeves 's sister , Kim , 39 , is battling leukemia .
He also talks about his late girlfriend Jennifer Syme , whom he met in 1998 and who later gave birth to their stillborn baby daughter .
Reeves and Syme remained best friends until April 2001 , when Syme died in a car crash .
" Damn it !
It 's not fair !
It 's absurd , " Reeves tells the magazine .
" Grief changes shape , but it never ends .
People have a misconception that you can deal with it and say , ' It 's gone , and I 'm better . '
They 're wrong .
When the people you love are gone , you 're alone .
" He goes on to say , " I miss being a part of their lives and them being a part of mine .
I wonder what the present would be like if they were here – what we might have done together .
I miss all the great things that will never be .

We decided to go with a Southerner and someone more reminiscent of Catherine Bach , " producer Bill Gerber tells PEOPLE about the final casting .
Bo and Luke Duke 's sexy cousin was played by Bach in the original 1979 - 85 TV series and by Jessica Simpson in the 2005 movie remake .
Earlier , Gerber had said of 19 - year - old Cavallari , " She 's at the top of the list .

Dark Hero of the Information Age : In Search of Norbert Wiener , the Father of Cybernetics by Flo Conway and Jim Siegelman Basic Books , 423 pp. , $ 27.50
Norbert Wiener was famous at the beginning of his life and at the end .
For thirty years in the middle during which he did his best work , he was comparatively unknown .
He was famous at the beginning as a child prodigy .
His father , Leo Wiener , the first Jew to be appointed a professor at Harvard , was a specialist in Slavic languages .
Leo was also an extreme example of a pushy parent .
He drove Norbert unmercifully , schooling him at home in Greek , Latin , mathematics , physics , and chemistry .
Fifty years later Norbert described , in his autobiography , Ex-prodigy : My Childhood and Youth , 1 how the prodigy was nurtured :
He would begin the discussion in an easy , conversational tone .
This lasted exactly until I made the first mathematical mistake .
Then the gentle and loving father was replaced by the avenger of the blood … .
Father was raging , I was weeping , and my mother did her best to defend me , although hers was a losing battle .
At age eleven , Leo enrolled Norbert as a student at Tufts University , where he graduated with a degree in mathematics at age fourteen .
Norbert then moved to Harvard as a graduate student and emerged with a Ph.D. in mathematical logic at age eighteen .
While he was growing up and trying to escape from his notoriety as a prodigy at Tufts and Harvard , Leo was making matters worse by trumpeting Norbert ’s accomplishments in newspapers and popular magazines .
Leo was emphatic in claiming that his son was not unusually gifted , that any advantage that Norbert had gained over other children was due to his better training .
“ When this was written down in ineffaceable printer ’s ink , ” said Norbert in his autobiography , Ex-prodigy , “ it declared to the public that my failures were my own but my successes were my father ’s . ”
Miraculously , after ten years of Leo ’s training and seven years of tortured adolescence , Norbert settled down to adult life as an instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and became a productive mathematician .
He climbed the academic ladder at MIT until he was a full professor , and stayed there for the rest of his life .
For thirty years , roughly from age twenty to age fifty , he faded from public view .
He remained famous in the MIT community for his personal eccentricities .
He liked to think aloud and needed listeners to hear what he was thinking .
He made a habit of wandering around the campus and talking at great length to any colleague or student that he encountered .
Most of the time , the listeners had only a vague idea of what he was talking about .
Colleagues and students who valued their time learned to hide when they saw him coming .
At the same time , they respected him for his achievements and for his encyclopedic knowledge of many subjects .
Wiener was unusual among mathematicians in being equally at home in pure and applied mathematics .
He made …

特別な医療機関を紹介してくれる場合もあるため、交通事故にあった時に利用しやすいです。交通事故を得意にする法律事務所は、初回の相談が無料でできる所が少なくありません。無料で相談できるので自分に合っているか、確認してから仕事を頼める特徴があります。
Asterix vs. the Romans A German Town Tries to Live Without Big Energy
Börnsen , a village in northern Germany , is spoiling energy giant E.on 's business by creating its own electricity and natural gas supply .
The idea could catch on elsewhere .
I have only read Time.com 's excerpt of Al Gore 's new book , " The Assault On Reason . "
But there was enough in it that echoes and resonates with my own political evolution on this blog over the past few years that I just ordered it from Amazon .
In many ways , I think Gore 's career in public life has really taken off since he abandoned the electoral path in politics .
He is a thinker and a loner - and the task of electoral politics , something I think he felt obliged to follow because of his father 's legacy , never truly suited him .
Now , freed to participate in political life as an unelected crusader , he has found his role at last .
I hope he does n't abandon it .
He has done more to raise awareness of a critical issue - climate change - as a private citizen than he ever managed as vice - president .
I can't help but feel that the death of his father liberated him as well .
He seems much happier because he has stopped trying to be someone he is n't .
On the plane ride back from L.A. , I also found myself reading Adam Gopnik 's diverting essay on Lincoln in the new New Yorker .
Am I the only one to see some resonances in their convictions ?
No , I 'm not comparing Gore to Lincoln as statesmen .
Please .
But I do see their mutual understanding of the critical importance of reason in wartime to be a very important message for our time .
Perhaps the most critical message we now need to hear .
Check out the echoes between the two .
Gore first :
For the first time in American history , the Executive Branch of our government has not only condoned but actively promoted the treatment of captives in wartime that clearly involves torture , thus overturning a prohibition established by General George Washington during the Revolutionary War .
It is too easy and too partisan to simply place the blame on the policies of President George W. Bush .
We are all responsible for the decisions our country makes .
We have a Congress .
We have an independent judiciary .
We have checks and balances .
We are a nation of laws .
We have free speech .
We have a free press .
Have they all failed us ?
Why has America 's public discourse become less focused and clear , less reasoned ?
Faith in the power of reason the belief that free citizens can govern themselves wisely and fairly by resorting to logical debate on the basis of the best evidence available , instead of raw powerremains the central premise of American democracy .
This premise is now under assault .
Now read this passage from Adam Gopnik 's piece about Honest Abe :
Lincoln believed in legalism .
One of his first public speeches , the Address Before the Young Men 's Lyceum , in Springfield in 1837 , declared a radical insistence on " reason " to be the only acceptable form of public discourse ; the cure for the prevalence and epidemic of violence in American life would be " hewn from the solid quarry of sober reason " : " Passion has helped us , but can do so no more .
It will in future be our enemy .
Reasoncold , calculating , unimpassioned reasonmust furnish all the materials for our future support and defence . "
We must revive this vision - this quintessentially American vision .
Before it is too late .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

The world wants China 's cheap goods
It said the rise of the world 's fourth - largest economy was mainly fuelled by investments and exports .
The figure was above the 10.5 % that officials had predicted .
The government is worried that such high levels of growth may be unsustainable , and has taken a series of measures to try to slow it down .
The Chinese economy has now enjoyed four consecutive years of at least 10 % growth , the NBS said .
The expansion in 2006 topped the 10.4 % rate a year earlier , and is the highest since 1995 , when the economy grew by 10.9 % .
" In 2006 , the national economy maintained steady and fast growth , " NBS commissioner Xie Fuzhan told reporters in Beijing .
China 's economy continues to be powered by a huge appetite for investment , and a boom in exports that generated a trade surplus of $ 177.47 bn last year .
But the government is concerned that some parts of the economy are becoming overheated .
Beijing has taken a number of steps in order to cool things down .
" These policies and measures proved to be effective and helped economic development avoid moving from speedy growth to overheating , " Mr Xie said .
Pollution problems
A lot of the money that China is making from exports has ended up in Shanghai 's stock exchange .
China had a huge trade surplus in 2006
It has turned from being one of the world 's worst performers to one of the best , says the BBC's Quentin Somerville in Shanghai .
But some experts are worried that the government has swapped a property bubble for a stock market bubble , our correspondent says .
He adds that China 's success is thanks to low wages , good infrastructure and enormous amounts of pollution .
Factories can almost pollute at will , and the economic cost to the environment and to the health of the Chinese people has not been properly recorded , our correspondent says .
China 's growth figures themselves come with a health warning , he adds .
Halfway through last year the government discovered that the economy was $ 100 bn bigger than previous estimates .

CSS Tips
1. Color shortcuts and color conversions
In CSS , you can write color values in a variety of ways , e.g. " RGB ( 0,0,0 ) " , " black " , and " #000000 " all result in black .
However , you can also use a shortcut for hexadecimal values that follows this form : " #000 " . # 0 BC for example means # 00BBCC but is a little quicker to write .
Sometimes when you need to feed color values into forms , e.g. for tools such as Google AdSense where you can define a border and background color , you need to provide hexadecimal values only .
However , as you may want to mirror an existing RGB value in your CSS file , you need a color converter .
Some years ago I created desktop tool WebCol to convert between the different CSS color formats and I 'm still using it for those occasions ... and there are also online converters .
2. CSS bug hunting
Your stylesheet does n't seem to do what you want it to do ?
There 's a variety of approaches you can use to debug the problem now :
Make sure your HTML validates .
Validation is the basis for the actual debugging process , because if you have an open tag somewhere , the whole file may be screwed .
So jump to the W3C HTML validator and do a quick check if every element is in place .

So jump to the W3C HTML validator and do a quick check if every element is in place .
Make sure you 're running the CSS in compliant mode .
Many browsers support two rendering modes ; a backwards compliant " quirks mode " and a " standards compliance mode . "
For example , in Firefox you can right - click any HTML page and select " View page info " to check the render mode value .
If you are having CSS problems , do n't even start to tweak and debug before you 've ensured you 're running in the standards compliance mode ( e.g. having a Strict doctype in your HTML ensures this ) .

Use a deeper selector .
Sometimes , the styling you want to achieve is overridden by another selector somewhere else in the CSS file you 're working on ( or another CSS file ) .
A quick fix is to use a deeper selector – e.g. " body div#foo .bar { ... } " instead of just " .bar { ... } " to give your current styling more importance in the cascading .

Confused about the box model you 're currently working with ?
CSS can get confusing if you 're working with deeply nested HTML elements .
One quick visualization of what you 're actually looking at is to use something like " div { border : 2 px dotted red ; } " to give every div element on the page a red border , and then refresh the HTML page ( you want to remove the border after you found the bug , of course ) .

Someone told you your page is broken on Mac Safari ... but you run Windows !
How do you check how well your CSS file works in different browsers , different browser versions , and different operating systems ?
One easy way is to use BrowserPool .
This little free download lets you select from a variety of OS 's and browser versions , and you can then upload your ( trade - secret - cleansed ! )
HTML to your server to give it a quick check through the eyes of this " virtual PC . "
3. Media separation
One bonus of using external CSS files instead of inline stylesheets is that you can serve different layouts to different media – like a mobile layout vs a screen layout .
So you 'll be using something like ...
< link rel=" stylesheet " href = " default.css " type =" text / css " media= " screen , projection , print " /> < link rel=" stylesheet " href=" mobile.css " type =" text / css " media= " handheld " />
( If you do n't add " projection " to the default media mix , Opera users who switch to full - screen mode are in for a surprise – a page deprived of layout ! )
But whooopsie – this wo n't even work as intended in some mobile browsers ( hint : Microsoft ) !
Oh well , it still makes sense to use external CSS files , because it 's easier to maintain and allows for neat caching of files .
On a side - note , I 'm always using my ( old ) free Netpadd so I do n't have to manually type lines like the " link " stuff above ( I just type " < link " and the rest can be selected from an auto - complete box ...
I can then hit F9 to jump straight to the CSS file , or Ctrl + F9 to jump to the JS in a new Netpadd window ) .
Netpadd , which basically looks like Notepad , also has CSS auto - completion , so I can type " bor " ( for " border " ) , hit Ctrl+F5 , and have a CSS reference pop up .
4 . Center the thing
You 'll often want to have a " page " - or " content " - class div to center everything .
One way to do so is to use " margin - left : auto ; margin - right : auto ; position : relative " .
You can even use absolutely positioned layers inside this div .
5. Anti-aliased PNG files
I was in for a surprise recently when I checked the CSS code for Google 's new personalized homepage themes ... the logo was using cross - browser anti-alias for a varied background !
As you probably know , anti-alias is giving rough pixel lines a softer border by blending in some pixels with the background .
However , with GIF files this only worked on a background of a static color , because you have to decide beforehand into which color you want to blend those pixels .
In theory , PNG files do support varied levels of transparency ; however , an Internet Explorer 6 bug prevents this from working cross - browser ( and when it does n't work , we call it " ghosting " – take a very close look at some of the Picasa Web Albums buttons and you 'll spot it ) .
But back to Google – here 's what I saw in their CSS ( slightly reformatted for readability ) :
# regular_logo { background :url ( ' test.png ' ) ; width : 150 px ; height :55 px ; } /* \ */ * html # regular_logo { background : none ; float : left ; width : 150 px ; filter : progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='test.png ' , sizing Method= ' scale ' ) ; } /* */
So instead of outputting the image in the HTML , they use a ( semantically slightly incorrect ) empty div which then receives a background PNG file .
That PNG file includes varied transparency ( it softly blends into the background , including some shadow effect ) .
Now in the CSS they use two selectors , a " normal " one and one that is shielded by some hack that serves some browsers only .
And you can see there 's a line starting with " filter : progid " which does the magic of fixing the IE6 PNG bug .
6. Quick ' n ' dirty rounded box corners
If you want to have a very quick way to give something rounded corners , and you do n't really care if the effect is lost on some browsers , you can use a definition like the following : " - moz - border - radius : 8 px " .
It 's a Firefox thing that 's playing around with CSS3 , but it only takes a couple of seconds to write , and if the effect is not important to the overall layout – and you do n't mind that the borders are n't anti-aliased – I think it 's better than nothing ( for example , I use it at the " Game Over " dialog of this game , where I do n't consider the rounded borders crucial in any way ) .
7. Opacity
To make a div layer ( or mostly anything else ) blend in with the background , you can use the following property - value pairs :
- moz - opacity : .5 ; filter : alpha( opacity=50 ) ;
The first is for Firefox , the second for Internet Explorer .
This effect can also create neat shadows – just use an empty shadow layer ( that is , a div of the class " shadow " ) , give it a slight offset , a black background , and put it behind another box .
PS : You want to access a " moz " value in JavaScript ?
Use something like this ( note the upper- case " m " and " o " ) :
var elm = document.getElementById(" myElm " ) ; myElm.style.MozOpacity = .5 ;
8. Cross - browser padding
In the CSS box model , " padding " is the distance from a box edge to its inner stuff , whereas " margin " is the distance to stuff outside the box .
Now , when you give something a specific width , say " 200 px " ( 200 pixels ) , and you add a padding of " 10 px " , this means that the box has a width of 220 pixels ( 200 + 10 at the left side and + 10 at the right side ) .
Probably not the most intuitive , and the programmers of older versions of Internet Explorers got it wrong and will not add the padding to the overall box size ( so in IE5 , the width is 200 pixels , even if there 's a 10 pixel padding ) .
So if you need very precise box dimensions , one solution is to use a browser hack .
It increases the maintenance efforts for your file , so use CSS hacks sparingly , and only when really needed .
We can use this hack :
. navigation { padding - left : 10 px ; padding - right : 10 px ; } .navigation { width : 200 px ; } .navi\gation { width : 220 px ; }
The first selector is for all browsers and defines the basic box .
The second selector is for conforming browsers who we hope to get the padding / width calculation right .
And the third selector is for older versions of Internet Explorer which we " hope " get the calculation wrong ( per the W3C guidelines ) , so we help out a little by using a backslash preceding a selector letter that 's in the range from g-z .
9. CSS hacks
A CSS hack basically means you 're trying to " split " a portion of your stylesheet to target a specific ( e.g. broken ! ) browser .
There are many of these hacks around – maybe you want to target IE5 + with something , or maybe you want to target everything but Firefox 2 , and so on .
One way to search for new hacks is to go to Google Code Search and use the query lang : css hack .
You 'll quickly find some inspiration .
But do n't let the dark side of the force corrupt you , Luke ...
10 .
Moving layers
When you add animation to your page , and you do n't go for Flash , you 're typically using DHTML – the combination of HTML , JavaScript and CSS .
One way I find to be neat for handling moving div layers – which can wrap anything , like animated sprites , a help monologue , and what - not – is to use a Sprite class in your JavaScript file .
Yep , JavaScript allows you to create objects , only that they 're calling it prototypes .
Now , your sprite object will mirror some of the values that exist in the world of CSS ; for example , the sprite will have x and y properties ( the " left " and " right " of the CSS ) .
Other values , like speedX or speedY ( the object 's velocity ) , or something more exotic like " mood " ( the object 's current behavior pattern , e.g. " aggressively hunting player sprite " vs " calmly moving towards the edge of the screen " ) , can be unique to your specific sprite class .
You can then use a sprite array in your JavaScript file , let each object of this array " grab " its element – using document.getElementById(" sprite " + i ) – and create a global setTimeout event to iterate over all sprites every few microseconds .
Here 's some excerpted code to illustrate this with a living example from this game ( also check out this type of sprite object JS in other games ) .
Basically I just needed to have a little king walk around at the bottom of the game , from left to right , showing different animation cells so it looks like he 's moving his feet :
var g_avatars = new Array ( ) ; .... function initAvatars ( ) { var i = 0 ; g_avatars [ i ] = new Avatar ( ) ; g_avatars [ i ].x = 60 ; g_avatars [i].speedX = 6 ; g_avatars [ i ].y = 500 ; g_avatars [ i] . type = 1 ; g_avatars[i].limitX2 = 415 ; } ... function moveAvatars ( ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < g_avatars.length ; i++) { g_avatars [ i].speedX *= .8 ; g_avatars [ i].move ( ) ; g_avatars [ i].render ( ) ; } setTimeout ( " moveAvatars ( ) " , g_avatarsDelay ) ; } ... Avatar.prototype.move = function ( ) { var isMoving = this .speedX != 0 || this .
speedY != 0 ; if ( isMoving || getRandomInt ( 0 , 100 ) <= 10 ) { if (-- this.cellCounter <= 0 ) { this.cellCounter = 5 ; if ( ++this.cell > 2 ) { this .
cell = 1 ; } } } this .x += this .speedX ; this .y += this .
speedY ; if ( this .x > this.limitX2 ) { this .x = this.limitX2 ; } else if ( this .x < this.limitX1 ) { this .x = this.limitX1 ; } } function Avatar ( ) { this .x = 0 ; this .y = 0 ; this .speedX = 0 ; this .
speedY = 0 ; this .cell = 1 ; this.cellCounter = 0 ; this .
type = 1 ; this.limitX1 = 80 ; this.limitX2 = 1000 ; this.elm = document.getElementById(" avatar " + gAvatarId ++ ) ; }

Currently , under the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , individuals have to be associated with a foreign terrorism suspect or a foreign power to fall under the auspices of the FISA court , which can grant the authority to institute federal surveillance .
The White House proposes expanding potential targets to include non-citizens believed to possess , transmit or receive important foreign intelligence information , as well as those engaged in the United States in activities related to the purchase or development of weapons of mass destruction .
The proposed revisions to FISA would also allow the government to keep information obtained “ unintentionally , ” unrelated to the purpose of the surveillance , if it “ contains significant foreign intelligence . ”
Currently such information is destroyed unless it indicates threat of death or serious bodily harm .
Well , at least I ’ll give Bush credit for one thing .
He ’s finally understanding that he might actually have to ask Congress for some authorization of power .
But look at what he ’s asking about here .
People that have no association with a foreign terrorist suspect would become legitimate targets for surveillance .
Note that they can be investigated if they might possese “ foreign intelligence information ” , a phrase which does n’t included any mention of terrorism .
Now , I ’m not sure if that was deliberately phrased that way , or was sloppy writing by the author , but that would entail a wide increase in investigative scope .
Where could it be used ?
Maybe someone who might have a connection to a drug dealer could be watched under FISA ?
Maybe an immigrant from Venezuela that might have information about things going on in the Chavez regime .
This appears to open the door one more step for big brother .
And , of course , it would n’t be the Bush administration if he did n’t make the law retroactive to cover past wrongdoing :
And they provide for compelling telecommunications companies and e-mail providers to cooperate with investigations while protecting them from being sued by their subscribers .
The legal protection would be applied retroactively to those companies that cooperated with the government after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
Yep …
Even if I had just cause to sue a telecom company for illegally providing personal data to the government , well — poof ! — no crime was committed !
And if that was n’t enough , our tax - cutting president is — as usual — threatening to veto a bill if it does n’t include the spending he wants .
The White House , in a “ statement of administration policy ” sent to the Senate on Thursday , questioned the 4 percent reduction in funding that the intelligence committee applied to national intelligence programs and its threat of prohibiting funding for several classified projects pending reports to the panel .
What sort of Republican will pass along any pork - barrel spending the Congress gives him ( such as the Transportation bill he threatened to veto if it was over a certain size , then backed off and signed it ) , and then when Congress tries to reduce spending , vetoes the bill ?
Fiscally liberal and socially conservative , that sounds to me like the worst of both worlds for a libertarian .

Once upon a time , back when a global pandemic
It is also unacceptable that these British captives should be made to talk on television and say things that they may regret later .
If the Iranians put duct tape over their mouths , like we do to our captives , they would n't be able to talk at all .
Of course they 'd probably find it even harder to breathe - especially with a bag over their head - but at least they would n't be humiliated .
And what 's all this about allowing the captives to write letters home saying they are all right ?
It 's time the Iranians fell into line with the rest of the civilised world : they should allow their captives the privacy of solitary confinement .
That 's one of the many privileges the US grants to its captives in Guantánamo Bay .
The true mark of a civilised country is that it does n't rush into charging people whom it has arbitrarily arrested in places it 's just invaded .
The inmates of Guantánamo , for example , have been enjoying all the privacy they want for almost five years , and the first inmate has only just been charged .
What a contrast to the disgraceful Iranian rush to parade their captives before the cameras !
What 's more , it is clear that the Iranians are not giving their British prisoners any decent physical exercise .
The US military make sure that their Iraqi captives enjoy PT .
This takes the form of exciting " stress positions " , which the captives are expected to hold for hours on end so as to improve their stomach and calf muscles .
A common exercise is where they are made to stand on the balls of their feet and then squat so that their thighs are parallel to the ground .
This creates intense pain and , finally , muscle failure .
It 's all good healthy fun and has the bonus that the captives will confess to anything to get out of it .
And this brings me to my final point .
It is clear from her TV appearance that servicewoman Turney has been put under pressure .
The newspapers have persuaded behavioural psychologists to examine the footage and they all conclude that she is " unhappy and stressed " .
What is so appalling is the underhand way in which the Iranians have got her " unhappy and stressed " .
She shows no signs of electrocution or burn marks and there are no signs of beating on her face .
This is unacceptable .
If captives are to be put under duress , such as by forcing them into compromising sexual positions , or having electric shocks to their genitals , they should be photographed , as they were in Abu Ghraib .
The photographs should then be circulated around the civilised world so that everyone can see exactly what has been going on .
As Stephen Glover pointed out in the Daily Mail , perhaps it would not be right to bomb Iran in retaliation for the humiliation of our servicemen , but clearly the Iranian people must be made to suffer - whether by beefing up sanctions , as the Mail suggests , or simply by getting President Bush to hurry up and invade , as he intends to anyway , and bring democracy and western values to the country , as he has in Iraq .

A surprising report has emerged from Japan 's Ultra One monthly technology magazine .
The magazine 's July issue reports that Sony will be achieving backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 3 not through software emulation , as previously announced , but through physical hardware .
< b> Free+with+every +PS3 ?</b>
The magazine states that the PS3 hardware , in its current form , includes the core PlayStation 2 chipset .
This presumably means that initial PS3 units will include the single Emotion Engine ( the PS2 CPU ) and Graphic Synthesizer ( the PS2 graphics chip ) combo chip that powers the slim model PS2 .
Of course , including the extra hardware drives up costs .
The magazine adds that Sony plans on removing the PS2 chipset from future revisions of the PS3 hardware once it has finished development of a proper software - based PS2 emulator .
Such a removal would help bring down costs for the system .
Sony has repeatedly stated that PS2 software would run on the PS3 through software emulation , leaving many to believe that the company had developed a powerful emulator for the older hardware .
This would have been a particularly impressive feat , considering that even the PlayStation 2 originally used a combination of hardware and software to maintain backwards compatibility with original generation PlayStation games .
If the Ultra One report is true , the use of hardware emulation casts some doubts on what kind of visual updates we can expect for PlayStation 2 games .
PlayStation 1 games saw a few marginal upgrades when running on the PlayStation 2 due to the PlayStation graphics chip being emulated entirely through software running on the PS2's Graphics Synthesizer .
On the other hand , hardware emulation pretty much guarantees that every game that runs on the current PS2 will do so on the PS3.
A few other revelations appear in the Ultra One report , an investigative story into the reasons for the PS3's high price point .
Izumi Kawanishi , head of Sony 's Software Platform Development Division , commented to the magazine that one difference between the PS2 and the PS3 is that the PS3 , as it was announced , is " nothing more than just the basic system . "
Sony is considering releasing models with larger volume hard disks and upgraded network features in the future .
However , Kawanishi noted ,
Sony wo n't be changing CPU clock speed or memory amounts , as all PS3s have to run the same games .
The PS3 comes equipped with , in addition to a default hard disk , a " large amount of flash memory , " the magazine reveals .
This is used to house the operating system and all future system updates .
Based on the wording in the magazine , it seems that the hard disk is to be used exclusively for multimedia content and will not contain any system features ; users will , after all , be able to swap the built in hard drive out with any standard drive they pick up at a computer hardware store .
The magazine also provides an assurance about the PS3's compatibility with its own games .
The PS2 lost compatibility with older titles as new models were released featuring updated chip designs .
This wo n't be a problem with the PS3 , as the magazine reveals that in the event that problems are discovered following an updated chip design , the system will be able to connect Online to download any required patches , which will then be stored on the hard disk .
Finally , the magazine gives a solid price estimate for the high - end PS3 model in Japan .
Sony officially lists the price as " open , " meaning retailers will have to determine their own pricing , but Ultra One says that the price is " expected " to be 73,000 yen .
Who exactly is expecting this price is anyone 's guess , as the magazine does n't give specifics .
We 'll wait for official word from Sony on that price point , and on the other details in the Ultra One article , before considering this report confirmed .
WPF for Laggards
Recently I was annoyed to discover that Charles Petzold does not have an imdb record .
Since he is not an actor , I guess that makes sense , but a part of my subconscious mind expects that all big - name celebrities will have a record on imdb.com .
Besides , imdb lists plenty of other celebrities who are not really actors , including Bruce Springsteen , Dan Marino , and William Shatner .
Why not Charles Petzold ?
And why was I looking for Petzold on imdb ?
Well , I often check imdb when I want to find out how old someone is .
A week or two ago Chris Sells described Petzold as " one of this generation 's best technical writers " ( italics mine ) .
My immediate reaction was that Chris was flattering Petzold not once , but twice .
I mean really .
Was n't the first edition of Programming Windows published back in the eighties when I was in high school ?
How could Petzold be considered a part of the same generation as Chris and I ?
Anyway , all this got me thinking .
Petzold is currently writing a new book about WPF ( " Windows Presentation Foundation " , formerly code - named " Avalon " ) , the next - generation Windows API for graphics and user interfaces .
But I do n't know anything about WPF !
If a man of his advancing years is still learning new technologies rapidly , then what 's wrong with me ?
I 'm not old enough to be a laggard yet .
I like to think of myself as an early adopter .
But the fact is that WPF is in beta 2 now .
All the cool early adopter people have been working with this technology for quite a while .
It 's time for me to get a clue , especially if I want to have any chance of impressing other geeks with my technical knowledge at TechEd in June . :-)
So , just as I used to cram for my exams in college , I 've been trying to digest as much WPF knowledge as possible in a very short time .
And I thought perhaps if I wrote down my first impressions of this technology it might be helpful for other laggards like myself .
Ten Things to Know About WPF in June 2006
1 . It 's part of WinFX .
Since around 1995 , the primary API for Windows development has been Win32 .
Sometime in the next year or so , that will change .
The new API is called WinFX .
WPF is just one part of it .
If you remember the transition from 16 - bit Windows programming to Win32 , it helps to think of this transition in a similar way .
This is a very fundamental shift .
Back when .NET was introduced , Microsoft gave us managed code , a new way of developing for Windows .
Now , with WinFX , managed code is no longer just another way of developing for Windows , but rather , it is THE way of developing for Windows .
WinFX completes the transition started by .NET , the transition to managed code .
People have been wondering for years why the .NET runtime components are not a required upgrade in the Windows Update service .
I do n't know why , but if I had to guess , I would say that the WinFX runtime will be a required update .
2. XAML is like HTML .
XAML is a markup language .
It is associated with WPF , but strictly speaking , the two are independent .
It looks to me like a major goal of WPF is to blur the line between web development and desktop development .
For users , WPF wants web applications to be more like desktop applications .
For developers , WPF wants desktop applications to be built more like web applications .
It is for this latter reason that XAML was born .
XAML is a markup language which can be used for setting up WPF user interfaces .
Right now , XAML does n't feel like HTML to me , but maybe it will when I get more up to speed .
3 . There is no HWND .
This one is kind of weird if you think about it .
I learned Win32 programming without a framework , so HWND and WndProc are old friends for me .
Since then I 've used higher level frameworks like MFC , wxWidgets , and Windows Forms .
Each of these frameworks tries to hide HWND , keeping it out of sight lest its ugliness cause public embarrassment .
But under the layers of abstraction , HWND is always there .
In WPF , it 's not .
When WPF first came out , people said it is not built on top of Win32 .
Now I understand what they meant .
WPF is not another abstraction layer on top of the core Windows API .
It is something else entirely .
So what is WPF built on ?
It 's a very high - level API , so it has to be built on top of something , right ?
The answer is that WPF is built on DirectX , and if you 've never really thought about the fact that DirectX is not built on Win32 , now would be a good time to just sit down and think it all through . :-)
4 . The " Cider " is n't ready yet .
There 's an early preview available of a tool which allows visual development of WPF user interfaces in Visual Studio .
Its code - name is " Cider " .
Do n't bother with it .
I have no doubt that eventually Visual Studio will offer outstanding support for WPF .
But right now , it 's just too early to even try to use this thing .
Rather than get your hopes up , just do n't even install it .
Face the fact that WPF development today requires you to use your keyboard .
You can still use Visual Studio of course , but you 'll be typing XAML and C# code rather than having a visual UI designer create it for you .
If that 's unappealing to you , then you might want to just wait .
Personally , I kind of like the idea of learning WPF without the visual tool .
It 's good to know how things work under the hood .
5. XAML Cruncher is Neato .
For early experimentation and learning of XAML and WPF , try XAML Cruncher , a utility by Charles Petzold .
It 's a two - pane app :
The pane on the left allows you to type XAML markup .
The pane on the right displays the result .
The right pane gets refreshed every time the left pane changes , so it feels very instantaneous .
You can grab chunks of XAML from various places and paste them in .
6. Chris Sells ' book is good .
Petzold 's book will probably end up being the definitive work .
But the book by Chris Sells and Ian Griffiths is available today , and it 's very good .
7 . You can use Windows XP .
WPF is usually associated with Windows Vista , the next major release of the Windows operating system .
But if you want to do development with WPF now , you do n't have to be using Vista .
Just install the latest versions ( beta 2 ) of two things :
The WinFX Runtime Components .
This basically empowers your system to run WinFX applications .
If you build a WPF application and want normal people to be able to use it , they 'll need this .
.
This basically empowers your system to WinFX applications .
If you build a WPF application and want normal people to be able to use it , they 'll need this .
The Windows SDK .
This is the core stuff necessary for development of WinFX applications .
If you want the easiest possible start , just install the runtime components and play with XAML Cruncher .
8 . But you have to use IE .
I 'm a Firefox user .
When I started fiddling with WPF , stuff just was n't working .
So I was sad . :-)
WPF is supposed to offer some very cool new forms of " web applications " .
I have n't figured out the fine points and distinctions yet , but if you think about Java applets and Flash and SVG and ActiveX and Ajax , WPF has some stuff that is trying to solve the same set of problems .
( For WPF , the buzzwords seem to be ClickOnce and Express . )
And it 's really quite cool .
On Petzold 's blog is an entry about an all - XAML clock .
If you have the WinFX runtime components and you click on the link in that blog entry , you 'll get a nice analog clock in your browser window .
Resize the window and the clock resizes cleanly .
It 's easy to imagine how this technology could move beyond demos like a clock and be used for real applications running in a browser with truly rich user experience .
But it does n't work in Firefox .
Hopefully someday it will .
9. Rod Paddock is right .
Previous jokes aside , anybody using WPF today is a very early adopter .
I 'm no expert , but I would have to agree with Rod Paddock when he says that WPF is not ready for prime time .
It 's still beta .
Presumably it wo n't be a shipping product until Vista ships , and that 's not happening until sometime in 2007 .
The supporting tools are weak or non-existent .
The API is missing some rather important stuff .
Deploying any WPF app will require that your users install the WinFX Runtime Components , a big download .
WPF shows us a very interesting future for Windows developers , but the key word here is " future " .
10 .
There is no Windows Telephony Foundation .
In the last few years , Microsoft 's habit has been to replace great code names with incredibly mediocre official names .
Avalon was a great name .
Windows Presentation Foundation is , well , less than memorable .
In its abbreviated form , WPF , I suppose it 's not so bad .
Note that the WPF acronym was part of a set .
Along with WPF they announced WCF ( Windows Communication Foundation ) and WWF ( Windows Workflow Foundation ) .
But alas , every time I see that set of abbreviations , it makes me wish they had included a new API with a T in the middle , like Windows Telephony Foundation . :-)
PS
Aha !
Wikipedia came to the rescue : Charles Petzold is 53 , younger than I thought , and definitely not old enough to be my dad .
I suppose that means that he and I actually are of the same generation . :-)
However , the police now appear to be investigating money - related disputes .
The local news media have focused on a four - year - old clash between Mr. Shiroo and the city of Nagasaki over a car accident .
In that dispute , Mr. Shiroo visited City Hall about 30 times from 2003 to 2005 to demand up to 2.7 million yen , or about $ 23,000 , for damages to his car that he claimed were from an accident at a city construction site , city officials said .
Lawyers said such requests for reimbursement were a common form of extortion .
However , the small amount of money involved , and the fact that Mr. Shiroo had not raised the matter with city officials for two years , made many wonder if there was not some larger , hidden issue .
Adding to the mystery was the fact that Mr. Ito was in the final stretch of campaigning for re-election in Sunday ’s mayoral election , which he was widely expected to win .
“ We really have no idea what was the reason ” for the slaying , said Yoshinobu Hashida , chief of the city ’s personnel section , which advises city officials on how to deal with gangster threats .
“ There ’s no clear - cut explanation . ”
Another possibility is a dispute over public works projects , which lawyers and other organized crime experts call a common source of revenue for criminal groups .
A letter signed by Mr. Shiroo and sent to a Tokyo - based broadcaster just before the shooting reportedly expressed anger at Nagasaki for denying a contract to a construction company with links to him .
On Thursday , the broadcaster , TV Asahi , turned over the letter to the Nagasaki police .
It is also unclear why Mr. Shiroo chose the mayor as his target .
Mr. Shiroo did not name the mayor during the traffic accident dispute , said city officials , and the TV Asahi letter reportedly mentioned him only briefly .
Toshiaki Hayashida , the mayor ’s chief secretary , said he believed that Mr. Ito had never met Mr. Shiroo .
Some experts said the killing might have been an act of desperation by gangsters , who have come under increasing pressure as Japanese companies and local governments have stepped up efforts to end dealings with organized crime .
In recent years , Nagasaki has passed new regulations requiring companies to report all contact with organized criminal groups , or be barred from bidding on public works contracts .
Organized crime has also felt the pinch as Japan has reduced public works spending to rein in runaway budget deficits , say experts like Takashi Ozaki , a lawyer in Tokyo specializing in organized crime cases .
Criminal groups have responded by increasingly turning to violence to intimidate local officials , Mr. Ozaki said .

In functional programming , programs are often written in a compositional style .
There are many advantages to this , such as clarity and modularity , but the resulting programs can be inefficient in terms of space , due to the use of intermediate data structures .
These structures may be removed using deforestation techniques , but whether the space performance is actually improved depends on the structures being consumed in the same order that they are produced .
In this paper we explore this problem and suggest a solution , in particular for lists and then generalising to trees .
Since the paper discusses many examples , it is quite enjoyable to read and can even serve as an introduction to folds .

Something old is now something new , thanks to Lamar University researcher Jim Westgate and colleagues .
The scientists ' research has led to the discovery of a new genus and species of primate , one long vanished from the earth but preserved in the fossil record .
Westgate is a professor of earth and space sciences at Lamar and a research associate in the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory , Texas Natural Science Center , University of Texas - Austin .
He and his research colleagues , Dana Cope , professor of anthropology , College of Charleston , and Chris Beard , curator , Vertebrate Paleontology Section , Carnegie Museum of Natural History , announced their discovery at the annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists in Philadelphia , Pa. , Thursday , March 29 .
Molar , pre-molar and incisor teeth from the new primate genus and three other new primate species were recovered from 42 million - year - old tropical , mangrove palm swamp deposits of the Eocene age Laredo Formation exposed in Lake Casa Blanca International State Park in Laredo .
The association of primate fossils with the skeletal remains of oysters , sharks , rays , giant aquatic snakes and crocodiles , along with mangrove palm fruits and pollen , indicates that the middle Eocene shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico lay 150 miles inland of its present position , Westgate said .
The team is preparing detailed manuscripts describing the new Omomyid primates .
One of the spoils of discovering a new species is the opportunity to give it a name .
The formal name of the new genus , which means " primate of the coastal lagoons " , will be released at publication time , Westgate said .
Omomyids ( members of the extinct taxon Omomyidae ) lived 34 to 50 million years ago during the Eocene Epoch and were one of two groups of known Eocene primates .
The other , adapids , were more lemur - like .
Fossils of these Eocene primates have been found in North America , Europe , Asia , and Africa .
The Eocene primates are the earliest known primates .
Omomyids had large eye orbits , long grasping fingers and short snouts .
They weighed around one kilogram , or close to two pounds and were likely nocturnal , with large eyes for seeing better at night .
Like most modern - day primates , the omomyids used their long fingers for climbing .
They had small mouths , and it is likely that insects were a part of their regular diet .
The presence of a diverse primate community with four species living on the Texas coast during late middle Eocene time is significant because at that time primate diversity in the northern interior of North America had diminished greatly because of global climatic cooling and uplifting of the Rocky Mountains , Westgate said .
The tropical environment on the Texas coast appears to have allowed primates to thrive locally while their relatives in the continental interior faced near extinction .
Lamar University , the University of Texas Geology Foundation , the National Geographic Society and the Geological Society of America provided funds for field excavations in Laredo .
Matthew was playing with a lighter when his hair caught fire
Matthew Moore , 15 , of Purbeck , Dorset , had just applied the lotion when he started playing with a cigarette lighter , which ignited his hair .
Matthew and his mother , Lesley , blame the Hedrin lotion but its manufacturers insist it is not flammable and failed to ignite in their laboratory tests .
Matthew is recovering in the burns unit at Salisbury District Hospital .
The product is not flammable
Hedrin lotion manufacturers
The teenager , who suffered severe burns to his face , ears , neck and arms in the incident on 10 April , said : " The gas must have found a reason to burn and it jumped and it must have caught my hair .
" I tried to put my fringe out but it went all over my hands and set my hands alight . "
His mother called for the product to be recalled and for warnings to be added to the labelling .
In a statement , manufacturers of the lotion Thornton & Ross said : " It 's the very first incident of its kind .
" The product is not flammable .
It 's been fully approved by various regulatory authorities . "
The company added that nobody should ever put a naked flame close to their hair .
A spokesman for Dorset Fire and Rescue Service added : " Do n't play with lighters close to your hair and that goes generally when you have applied any type of hair product . "
According to a top paparazzo , amateur camera - phone photographers are putting the squeeze on celebrity photographers .
German Hans Paul , who says he once earned $ 120,000 for a picture of a then - pregnant Julia Roberts , said fees for paparazzi had been driven to new lows as even fans and autograph hunters now know how to market their pictures .
The advancements in camera - phone technology have made camera - phones cheap enough and the quality of the photographs good enough to be used widely and be useful at the same time .
Furthermore , online outlets have made it incredibly easy for ordinary people to be linked with newspapers and other media to sell pictures to them directly .
We covered one such outlet last December .
Mr Paul highlighted the example of the pictures of the execution of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein as evidence of how images captured on a mobile phone can create news in any media .
He said : “ There is no doubt that we paparazzi are suffering from this .
There is hardly any money to be made in the everyday business . ”

It 's hoped human trials of the bird flu antibody could begin soon
The discovery could lead to treatments that complement flu vaccines in the event of a human epidemic of the virus .
The H5N1 bird flu virus is estimated to have killed more than 180 people around the world since 2003 .
Some countries are already stockpiling vaccines for a possible bird flu outbreak in humans , but no one knows how effective they might be .
' Emergency antidote '
This is because the particular strain of bird flu that might eventually spark a human pandemic is unknown .
But scientists working in Switzerland , Vietnam and the United States say they have isolated antibodies that they hope could offer protection against several different strains of the virus simultaneously .
Antibodies are used by our immune system to neutralise bacteria and viruses - in this case , the scientists have isolated antibodies that bird flu survivors in Vietnam produced to fight off the disease .
Professor Antonio Lanzavecchia , at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Switzerland , says the antibodies have already proven effective in the lab and in mice and he is confident that they could be used in humans .
" We in a way exploit the immune response of an individual who has been infected and has survived the infection and of course has made antibodies that neutralise these viruses , " he said .
" And using this technique , we can isolate the cells that make these antibodies so that this antibody can now be reproduced in vitro and eventually massively produced to treat other individuals . "
The antibodies could be used to protect key workers , such as nurses and doctors , in countries where a bird flu epidemic strikes .
The researchers say it could also be used as an emergency antidote in people who have already been infected with bird flu - if administered within a few days .
It is hoped human trials could begin shortly .
The eurozone will in 2007 take over from the US as the driver of world economic growth , according to Paris - based think tank the OECD , with a strong performance by Germany giving Europe the edge .
The 13 - state strong European currency union will see 2.7 percent GDP growth this year compared to 2.1 percent in the US , the OECD predicted in a report out Thursday ( 24 May ) .
Last year the euro states lagged 0.5 percent behind the US .
" Europe [ is ] taking over the baton from the United States , " OECD chief economist Jean - Philippe Cotis said .
" A vibrant German - led recovery has remained on track ...[ and ] the so - far lagging Italian economy has been sharing in the upswing . "
The bounce - back stems from a gradual increase in household and corporate spending , as well as robust exports .
Falling unemployment - from 7.8 percent last year to 7.1 percent this year - is another " noticeable bright spot , " the study says .
By contrast , US results are being held back by problems in the housing market , which is suffering from an excess of supply .
But the OECD predicts a " progressive return to economic normality " that should see America again nose ahead of the eurozone in 2008 .
The European upswing could spell good news for political projects , such as Germany 's attempt to revive the EU constitution - at the time of the EU 's 50th birthday in March , some analysts said stagnating economies had contributed to euroscepticism in recent years .
But the European picture is not entirely rosy : unemployment still remains much higher than in the US ; inflation risks are likely to see the European Central Bank hike rates again this year and an ageing population is increasing pressure on the public purse .
" The balance of risks to inflation is towards the upside , " the OECD says , recommending another 0.5 percent increase in the cost of borrowing in two tranches of 0.25 percent by the end of the year .
Looking at the economic dangers of ageing , the think tank forecasts that Belgium , Greece , Ireland , Luxembourg , Portugal and Spain will all be spending over 10 percent of their GDP on pensions and geriatric health care by 2050 .
DOWN a rough track , glowing silver under the moon , rolls a black pick - up truck carrying a 500 lb bomb .
The white walls of the American army base loom , but no shout or shot comes .
Your correspondent fingers his detonator .
Unchallenged , the truck drives alongside the base , then we blow ourselves up .
The first blast , in a yellow flash , lights up a guard - tower and the anxious face of a young GI .
The second , after we bombers have scrambled for safety , is much bigger — a hollow boom and an explosion of orange fire that soars 100 feet into the night sky , lighting up skinny pines all around .
As the flames fall , The Economist 's fellow suicide - bomber shouts to the sentry : “ Go tell your buddies , you 're all dead . ”
That should teach them not to leave open the approach to their perimeter , a mistake that cost many American lives in the early stages of Iraq 's insurgency .
But these soldiers will live .
Their white walls are chipboard , the bomb is a “ reduced - blast ” special effect , and although fictionally in the Afghan region of “ Talatha ” , they are at Fort Polk in southern Louisiana , 200,000 acres of pine forest which the army uses for training .
The soldiers , members of a 3,500 - strong infantry brigade in the final stage of preparation for a mission to Afghanistan , will be extracted from the woods for 24 hours and then , chastened , reinserted to fight again .
Car bombs are not the only bit of Iraqi - Afghan verisimilitude the brigade experienced at Fort Polk 's Joint Readiness Training Centre ( JRTC ) last month .
Attacks with simulated roadside bombs ( known as improvised explosive devices , or IEDs ) , rockets , mortars , rocket - propelled grenades ( RPGs ) and small arms , using special effects and lasers , are unrelenting .
The assailants — 160 American soldiers dedicated to the task , and dressed accordingly — come in two forms : al - Qaeda terrorists , based in an off - limits bit of the wood called Pakistan , and Taliban insurgents living in 18 mock villages .
Another 800 role - players live with them , acting as western aid workers , journalists , peacekeepers , Afghan mayors , mullahs , policemen , doctors and opium farmers , all with fake names , histories and characters .
Some 200 bored - looking Afghan - Americans are augmented by local Louisianans in Afghan garb .
A clutch of Vietnam - veterans with missing limbs , splashed with fake blood , make terrific bomb victims .
Fort Polk has seen huge changes in the past two years .
Designed for light infantry and special - forces troops , it has always dealt with some parts of guerrilla warfare , such as booby - traps and RPG attacks .
But in the past the “ insurgents ” wore blue armbands to distinguish themselves , a tactic strangely shunned by America 's enemies in Iraq and Afghanistan .
There also used to be no more than 50 civilian role - players on the battlefield .
The changes are expensive — the basic cost per brigade of a month at the JRTC has gone up from $ 2 m to $ 9 m .
And similar changes are under way at the army 's two other Combat Training Centres ( CTCs ) , where the army simulates battalion - and brigade - sized battles .
Fort Irwin , California , used to be dedicated to tank battles .
Two years ago , not a single building dotted its 600,000 acres of desert .
Now there are a dozen mock villages and plans for a $ 50 m mock city .
Two Hollywood companies have been hired to improve the army 's flashes and bangs , and to give acting classes to the role - players .
A catalogue of blunders
Stung by its setbacks in Iraq and Afghanistan , the American army is trying to change .
The challenge is immense , and the army 's recent past suggests reasons for cynicism .
Since quitting Vietnam in 1973 , America has fought dozens of counter - insurgencies and small wars .
But most of those , in Central America , were mainly special - forces operations .
And in places like Somalia and Haiti it often made the same blunders as against the Viet Cong .
If the army 's rules of engagement were stricter , there were still too many strikes on innocent targets , too much use of firepower and too little effort to understand the culture .
Faced with a counter - insurgency , the American army 's preferred tactic was attrition .
Of course , all wars are different .
No previous campaign could have provided a blueprint for success in Iraq .
Suicide - bombers are a different threat from Marxist guerrillas .
But history can suggest a few solid principles for successful campaigns against insurgents ; and too often , in Iraq , American troops have ignored them .
A pre-Iraq comparison between the American and the British armies is instructive .
In their routine planning and training , the British expected to find civilians on their battlefield ; the Americans did not .
The British taught the virtue of restraint , to limit civilian casualties and the strategic damage they cause .
American soldiers were trained to wipe the enemy out .
British soldiers were trained in crowd control and basic forensic skills ; American soldiers rarely were .
In April 2003 , nervous American soldiers fired into a crowd of protesters in Fallujah , killing and maiming scores .
Within weeks , the Iraqi town had risen against the occupation , culminating in two terrible battles last year .
In more peaceable southern Iraq , meanwhile , the British acted on their training .
Their first aim was to win the civilian population 's trust .
One way was through information operations ( IO ) , which means , at the crudest level , generating good public relations for the army .
“ The Brits do this as a matter of course ; they had a much finer appreciation of the culture in Iraq , ” says Lieutenant - Colonel Chuck Eassa , deputy - chief of IO at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas , the home of the army staff college and other cerebral institutions .
For the American army in Iraq , he says , IO was a “ low - density skill set ” .
Each division of 19,000 soldiers had only two IO officers .
Giving grief , Iraqi style
Another way to win trust is the British habit of doffing helmets and patrolling on foot .
This is not always possible : when a Shia insurgency flared in southern Iraq last year , the British hunkered down behind armour and killed wave upon wave of fanatics .
But when the violence ebbed , they had the flexibility to revert to friendlier tactics .
To see a British sergeant in southern Iraq dismount from a Land Rover fully kitted for war , assess the local mood , then call , “ Right lads , hard hats off , ” is impressive .
According to Lieutenant - General Sir John Kiszely , formerly deputy - chief of coalition forces in Iraq and now head of the British Defence Academy : “ In future , probably nine out of ten operations will not be purely war - fighting .
The soldier of the future will have to be a warrior — but much more as well . ”
In part , the American army 's unreadiness for dealing with civilians stemmed from a reliance on signal , not human , intelligence .
As a battle raged in Iraq 's northern capital of Mosul last year , shortly after its police force had collapsed , an American lieutenant - colonel showed this correspondent his control room .
On a cluster of computer screens , he could see , in real - time , where each of his Stryker armoured vehicles was and what it was seeing .
“ It 's like Sun Tzu said , ” he enthused , recalling an ancient Chinese military strategist , “ to win a war you need three things : to see the battlefield , to see yourself ... so now I guess I just need to see the enemy . ”
If the enemy is hidden among the general population , technology can help , but it will not complete the task .
In a recent comparison of the British and American approaches , “ Counter - insurgency lessons from Malaya and Vietnam , ” John Nagl , a retired American marine officer , argues that Britain 's relative expertise was not merely the result of its imperial history .
In Vietnam , after all , America had ample experience of acting as an occupying power .
Moreover , in both Malaya and Northern Ireland , the British were at first heavy - handed and unsuccessful .
The difference , says Mr Nagl , is that the small British army was able to learn from its mistakes and change , while the bigger American army was not .
Can it really be doing any better in Afghanistan and Iraq ?
Tips from the ground
The signs are mixed , but encouraging .
Take , for instance , the way the army is involving all its soldiers in setting TTPs — the tactics , techniques and procedures that define how it acts on the battlefield .
The idea is that every TTP — be it the appearance of a new sort of bomb in Baghdad or a new way to disable one — holds lessons for army doctrine , training , appropriations , research and development and so forth .
Every brigade in Iraq and Afghanistan now has a secure intranet page , which soldiers are encouraged to fill with observations and queries .
Early this year a secure online chat-room , the Battle Command Knowledge System , appeared .
Besides circulating thousands of tactical questions and answers , it can help soldiers find technical experts , learn foreign languages , contact counterparts in the war zone , or squint through the web camera of an armoured vehicle in Iraq .
At Fort Leavenworth , the rather wonderfully named Centre for Army Lessons Learned ( CALL ) has catalogued 6,200 battlefield and training - ground observations in the past four years and produced 400 reports on them .
Its staff has tripled .
“ They 've been pumped full of steroids , ” says Lieutenant - General David Petraeus , Fort Leavenworth 's commander , who has recently returned from Iraq .
Cynics spot some familiar aspects to all this .
Although the Pentagon is spending a fortune on bureaucratic processes , some think it remains weak on analysis and incapable of self - criticism .
“ Lessons Learned ” is , after all , not the same as lessons learned — as CALL 's boss , Colonel Larry Saul , admits .
Mr Saul says a key lesson from Iraq and Afghanistan is that American soldiers must know a smattering of the local language .
When assured that almost no American soldier knows six words of Arabic , Dari or Pushtu , he admits : “ I can take a horse to water but I can't make him drink . ”
The evidence is indeed mixed , but there are many signs of progress , even in Iraq .
The American army has trained more than 100 Iraqi battalions in little over a year ; fighting alongside them , it has come to understand their culture better .
It is also more restrained ; atrocities like the killing in Fallujah would be less likely now .
In an example recently praised by George Bush , the 3rd Armoured Cavalry Regiment carried out a model attack on insurgents in the northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar in September , first emptying it of civilians , then giving Iraqi soldiers the lead in the offensive .
This success was , in large part , a response to failure , according to the regiment 's commander , Colonel H.R. McMaster .
On a previous deployment to Iraq , in western Anbar province , the unit had done terrible damage with random and aggressive house - to - house searches , mass arrests and thuggish crowd control .
Since arriving in Tal Afar last April it had patrolled often and on foot , looking for human intelligence , and had avoided making indiscriminate arrests .
But Colonel McMaster was relatively lucky .
He had seasoned troops , and enough of them , to control his area .
The marine division currently in Anbar , Iraq 's most violent province , is too thinly spread and too shot - at to develop such nice behaviour .
Unable to get control of the rebellious towns in the Euphrates river valley , often supported by air strikes but rarely by Iraqi troops , the marines are fighting a mid-intensity war .
There are other impediments to the army 's improving counter - insurgency skills .
One is the dismal record of many civilian agencies in Iraq .
Some $ 20 billion has been spent on restoring Iraq 's basic services , but with little noticeable improvement — hardly the way to win hearts and minds .
Another snag is the army 's fixation with self - protection .
In Mosul , your correspondent strolled through a souk with a dynamic and thoughtful American captain who chatted and waved to the shoppers , trying to win trust .
But with his face hidden behind helmet , headset and mirrored - shades , women and children saw him and fled .
Changing an army 's approach takes time .
The warrior spirit , as Americans call their propensity for macho soldiering , or killing people , is deep in their military culture .
In Afghanistan 's violent Helmand province , an American special - forces captain — with broad experience of counter - insurgency — analysed his furtive Taliban enemies thus : “ They 're cowards .
Why do n't they step up and fight like men ? ”
Apparently , he had not considered how he might fight if he had no armour , no radio , an ancient rifle and the sure knowledge that if he fought like a man , he would be obliterated in minutes .
Revising doctrine
Off the battlefield , the army 's lesson - learning is easier to measure .
At Fort Leavenworth , big changes have been made .
The 1976 edition of “ Operations ” , the standard manual of best practice in warfare , did not mention counter - insurgency , and the army 's dedicated counter - insurgency doctrine manual was last rewritten in 1965 .
But the section of the current edition of “ Operations ” dealing with counter - insurgency is now being revised , and a new version of the counter - insurgency manual , written with British help , was distributed as an interim draft on October 1st .
Next time , it 's real
According to the new doctrine 's authors , at Leavenworth 's Combined Arms Doctrine Directorate , key changes will stress the strategic importance of civilian populations .
The army 's basic doctrinal aim is to move from high - intensity offensive to low - intensity security and stability operations — from creating shock and awe to winning hearts and minds .
The new doctrine will emphasise that , where possible , the two levels should co-exist — where possible , for example , the army should exercise restraint in its offensive operations .
In addition , the revised “ Operations ” will stress the need to protect civilians from external threats ( such as Islamic terrorists ) and internal disorder ( such as looters ) , while ensuring the provision of “ central services ” , including power and water .
The interim counter - insurgency manual also reflects recent failings .
It suggests ways to stop a conventional war turning into an insurgency .
One way is to avoid upsetting civilians , among whom insurgents can hide , by being more sensitive to ethnic , tribal and religious differences .
Other corners of Fort Leavenworth bustle with change .
A “ Red University ” has been established to teach “ red teaming ” , or second - guessing enemies and allies ; it will accept its first students in January .
A “ red team ” , dedicated to predicting future threats and to replicating them in training , has been doubled since 2002 .
Courses in IO have been increased from two to ten weeks .
At the army staff college and a more select school for army planners , the School for Advanced Military Studies , the biggest change is that 45 % of the students have recent combat experience .
This fully professional army is much likelier to remember its lessons than the conscript army that withdrew from Vietnam .
But it is at the CTCs , including that bomb - blasted patch of Louisiana pine woods , that the army 's effort to change its ways is most visible .
Two years ago , with few civilian role - players on the mock battlefield , the soldiers ' main objective was to bypass them and kill the enemy .
Now most training involves civilian role - players .
Even when launching an attack , the soldiers must bear in mind the overarching need for stability .
According to Brigadier - General Michael Barbero , Fort Polk 's commander , “ We 're working hard at instilling shades of grey , at teaching commanders not to just kick in doors , to get among the population and gather intelligence . ”
This change , incidentally , makes the CTCs extremely similar to the British army 's Operational Training Advisory Group , which has used role - playing for two decades .
The biggest difference is money .
American soldiers at the CTCs are shot with lasers and Hollywood - quality special effects ; in mock battles at Tin City , a fake town in the Kentish countryside , unlucky British soldiers are ignited with petrol bombs .
A favourite buzz - phrase at Fort Polk is “ consequence management ” , or weighing the goal of an operation against its other results .
During daily meetings , the training officers discuss , often in staggering detail , the brigade 's latest actions , and plan their reactions accordingly .
Thus , for example , a company commander has failed to deliver medicines to a village clinic , run by a “ Dr Jihad ” , as promised .
In response , a “ journalist ” is commissioned to report the story for the Talatha Times .
This prompts al - Qaeda fighters to deliver medical supplies to the clinic , and , in the process , they forge ties with the local Taliban .
The two groups collaborate in a fierce attack on the offending American company , using car bombs , IEDs and indirect and direct fire , killing and wounding dozens .
That will teach them to keep their promises .
It is unclear how long the CTCs will keep their lavish resources .
Since early 2003 , every training rotation has been geared to preparing a brigade or battalion for a mission in Iraq or Afghanistan .
As America withdraws its troops from Iraq — whenever that will be — non - mission - specific training will resume , and the training budget will be cut .
But Brigadier - General Barbero says he hopes to retain enough cash for a decent number of role - players on his mock battlefield .
And he expects , culturally , that they will remain Islamic .
The merely superrich buy land .
The ultrarich make their own , using special ships called trailing suction hopper dredgers .
These leviathans can hoover up to 835,000 cubic feet of sand per hour from the ocean floor and spit it out in a new location with the precision of an engineer .
The vessels were originally designed to dredge waterways and repair storm - damaged coastlines .
But the Rotterdam , owned by Dutch dredging firm Van Oord , is " rainbowing " sand into the Persian Gulf off the coast of Dubai to help build The World , an artificial archipelago of privately owned islands that will eventually resemble a map of Earth .
Next up : Van Oord will terraform Palm Deira , another island destination for Dubai 's elite .
" Instead of buying half of Manhattan or London , they 've decided to invest in their own country , " says Bert Groothuizen , Van Oord 's marketing and PR manager .
When it 's finished , Palm Deira will cover 57 square miles – requiring a cool 35 billion cubic feet of sand .
The cost : $ 3.2 billion .
But check out the location !

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. Senator John McCain said in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday he misspoke in his recent upbeat comments about security in Baghdad , where he traveled under heavy military protection .

The Arizona senator , who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination , maintains progress has been made in the U.S. - led war in Iraq , according to comments to be aired on CBS ’ “ 60 Minutes . ” Excerpts were released on Friday .
McCain said he regrets comments he made after a tour of Baghdad last Sunday , when he said he could see progress and the American people were not being told the “ good news ” about the war , according to excerpts of his comments and a press release provided by “ 60 Minutes . ”
“ Of course I am going to misspeak and I ’ve done it on numerous occasions and I probably will do it in the future , ” said McCain , according to “ 60 Minutes ” .
The excerpted quotes provided by “ 60 Minutes ” did not indicate which comments McCain thought were misspoken .
A strong supporter of President George W. Bush ’s plan to send nearly 30,000 more troops into Iraq , McCain said last week after his tour : “ I believe we have a new strategy that is making progress .
That is not to say things are well everywhere in Iraq .
Far from it , we have a long way to go . ”
McCain had been upbeat about his drive from the Baghdad airport into the city and his visit to a market where multiple car bombings killed 71 people in February as signs of improved security .
“ Never have I been able to drive from the airport , never have I been able to go out into the city like I did today .
The American people are not getting the picture of all that is happening here .
Things are better ... but I am not saying mission accomplished , ” he said at the time . ”
After he spoke , Iraqi citizens , merchants and others said security had been stepped up for the choreographed visit .
Once seen as the Republican frontrunner for 2008 , McCain has been overtaken by former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , in part because of his support for Bush ’s unpopular Iraq war policy .
In fund - raising reports released this week , McCain raised about $ 12.5 million , well behind Republican Mitt Romney who raised more than $ 20 million in the first quarter and behind Giuliani , who raised more than $ 15 million .
McCain acknowledged in this “ 60 Minutes ” interview that he had been accompanied by heavy security during his trip .
“ I can understand why ( the Army ) would provide me with that security , but I can tell you that if it had been two months ago and I ’d asked to do it , they would have said , ‘ Under no circumstances whatsoever , ’ ” he said .
“ I view that as a sign of progress . ”
McCain also acknowledged many Americans do not agree with his position on the war .
“ I believe we can succeed and I believe that the consequences of failure are catastrophic , ” he said .
Got any chronic complainers where you work ?
It seems like every workplace has them – the people for whom the weather is always too warm or too cold , the boss is a jerk , the food is lousy , work sucks and … you fill out the list .
No matter how good things get they still only see the bad – and they go to huge lengths to point it out to everyone around them .
I ’m not saying we should outlaw complaining , but workplaces need to do something about the chronic complainers because they tend to make people around them unhappy at work .
It ’s a fact that negative people are highly contagious and one chronic complainer can easily get an entire department down .
We try many different strategies to deal with complainers – one german IT company even bans whiners from the workplace .
Yep – if you have a bad day you are not allowed to come in .
But most of the strategies we normally use on complainers do n’t help and often make matters worse .
I ’ve outlined these strategies below .
And then at the end of the post , theres a simple , devious trick that works amazingly well .
Try it !
The things we normally do about complainers and why they do n’t work
There are several strategies people use around complainers , none of which really work .
1 : Cheering them up does n’t work
As in “ Oh , it ca n’t be that bad ” , “ Come on , cheer up ” or the perennial favorite “ Time heals all wounds ” .
Saying things like this shows the complainer that you ’re not taking their pain seriously .
When you tell a complainer “ it ’s not that bad ” , he will often complain even harder to convince you ( and himself ) that his problems are very serious indeed .
2 : Suggesting solutions does n’t work
“ Why do n’t you … ” , “ have you tried … ” or even worse “ You should really have … ”
The complainers ’ problems are really serious and ca n’t be solved by a few smart - ass suggestions from you .
Or so they ’ve convinced themselves .
The more you try to suggest solutions , the harder they will work to convince you and themselves that these solutions could never possibly work for them .
3 : Telling them to pull themselves together does n’t work
“ Quit complaining and do something about it ” or one of my favorites : “ You either want the problem or you want the solution ” .
Yeah , telling them that their problems are trivial and they just need to pull themselves together is going to work juuuuust fine .
All complainers magically stop complaining at this .
Or do they ?
4 : Complaining about the complainers does n’t work
“ Damn , that Sally complains a lot does n’t she ? ”
Guess what , you just became a complainer :o )
5 : Ignoring them / avoiding them does n’t work
This makes complainers clamor for attention even more – which usually makes people ignore them even more .
That ’s a vicious cycle right there .
6 : Complaining along with them does n’t work
“ You know what , you ’re right , the boss IS a jerk .
And the weather sucks .
In fact everything sucks . ”
This can be kind of cosy because it creates bonding and an us - against - the - world feeling .
But ultimately it ’s a bad idea because the more people complain the less prone they are to doing something about their problems .
I remember one of the first jobs I had where my manager was a complete dolt .
My co-workers and I could n’t start a meeting , go out for a beer or just meet in the hallway without spending 15 - 20 minutes complaining about him and his stupid ways .
But all those man-hours spent complaining changed nothing and none of us ever did anything about it .
Except quit the company one by one :o )
7 : Confronting them does n’t work
You can drive the complaints underground where you do n’t see them , but they will probably still be going on .
And repressed complaining is worse than open complaining because it gets to stew and grow while it ’s hidden .
A trick that does work
So what does work ?
Here ’s a simple but very effective trick :
A friend of mine who ’s a dentist told me about an elderly , grouchy patient of hers .
Every time he came in for an appointment he ’d complain about the weather , his children , his car , taxes , society , and any other topic that might come up .
Now you might think “ Hey , she ’s a dentist , fill his mouth with gauze and cotton and let ’s see him complain then ! ” but my friend is a naturally happy person and would instead try to cheer him up .
Did n’t work , just made him complain even more .
So I taught her this trick and the next time he came in for an appointment she was ready .
He went in the chair , and immediately started complaining .
After listening to his usual litany for a while my dentist friend said , with deep sympathy in her voice , “ You know , that sounds terrible .
I do n’t know how you deal with all of these problems . ”
You know what he said ?
“ Weeeeell , it ’s not THAT bad ! ”
This approach works because it gives the complainer what he ’s really after : Empathy .
Not cheering up , not solutions , not egging - on .
Just understanding of what is , for him , a difficult situation .
There are two important things to notice here :
Do n’t be sarcastic when you say it .
Be sincere .
You do n’t have to agree that these are huge problems .
Even if everything the complainer says sounds trivial to you , remember that it feels like a huge problem to him or her would n’t go on about it .
What seems trivial to one person can be a huge problem for others .
So you ’re not saying “ Yes , I agree that ’s a huge problem ” .
And you ’re certainly not saying “ Oh , poor poor you ” in a sarcastic voice .
You ’re just acknowledging the fact that this is a huge problem for that person .
Which undeniably it is .
Does this make the complaining go away ?
Only sometimes .
But it keeps you from being part of a vicious cycle of responses that just makes the complainers complain more and more and more .
The cycle is cut at the point you take their distress seriously .
So try this approach on your favorite complainer and tell me how it goes .

RIO DE JANEIRO - 19 people fell dead in Rio de Janeiro as a result of the drug wars taking place in the Brazilian city .
Two rival groups are fighting for controlling the drug supply to one of the poorest districts ( called ' favela ' ) of the city .
Two shootings shoot - outs took place in different regions of the biggest Brazilian city , where 19 people found their death .
In one of the cases two rival groups initiated a shooting in one of the central regions of the city .
The gang members tried to find cover on a cemetery , where many funeral processions were taking place at that very moment .
Local television broadcasted video clips , where one could see how people were trying to hide from the shooting .
A man was seriously injured , while being in one of the funeral buses .
The result of this shoot - out was 13 dead bodies collected by the police .
The bodies were officially recognized as drug dealers .
Many fire arms and grenades were found on site .
The other incident took place on the other end of the city , where the police was involved in a shoot - out with drug - dealers .
They killed 6 gang members and collected about 3,000 small foliage containers with cocaine .
The police has also reported to have arrested some of the gang members , involved in the shooting .
The Brazilian Government is currently revising the request of the Rio governor about dispatching military troops in the city to help the police fight the drug wars .
A few months ago , after one of the shoot - outs , a special force team from the Federal Police was sent to the region .
By the end of this year there will be additional forces directed into the city , as the city will host the Panamerican games .

Gardening Less is Mower
The positive effects of our lawns and gardens can quickly be negated if we are not careful about the tools we use to maintain them .
By Sean Burak
Published April 30 , 2007
A lawnmower graveyard - in a more perfect world , lawnmower disposal would be a more lucrative business than lawnmower manufacturing .

The sun is shining , the birds are singing , the smell of blooming flowers is in the air , and your neighbour starts up his mower , filling the block with the sounds and odours of belching two - stroke engine .
Yes indeed , the arrival of spring has been obnoxiously announced .
North Americans are addicted to their lawns .
We collectively spend vast amounts of time , energy and money trying to force non-native grass species to grow where nature did not intend .
We adhere to the despicable concept of putting our drinking water on the lawn , along with chemical fertilizers so that it grows faster , and then mowing it down a week later with one of the least efficient gas powered devices available to hummankind .
We remove the clippings in the summer and the fallen leaves in the autumn , choosing to send this natural plant food to the landfill instead of letting it feed next year 's crop .
The time has come to bring down the gas - powered lawn care habits that have spread across the entire continent .
Our yards are choking us to death
Summer is on its way , and with the number of smog days on the rise , we could all benefit from an improvement in air quality .
While vehicular emissions and industrial pollution are constantly in the climate change spotlight , we can't just stop driving and shut down the factories overnight .
However , cutting back on lawnmower use is something that we can all do right now , and it can make an enormous difference .
A 2001 Swedish Study found that running a gas - powered lawnmower for one hour is the emisions - equivalent of driving 160 kilometres in a car - and older lawnmowers are even worse , producing the same pollution in an hour as a 1992 - era automobile emits over a 1000 kilometre ride !
According to the California Resource Board , " Gallon for gallon ... the 2006 lawn mower engines contribute 93 times more smog - forming emissions than 2006 cars " .
Stop the Insanity !
Pictured is a 6 horsepower Snapper brand leafblower which retails for over $ 500 and weighs over 100 pounds ( Image Credit : Snapper )
Come fall , I constantly see individuals and lawncare companies blowing leaves from one place to another .
To these people I say :
If you are so obsessed with moving leaves around , buy a rake and use your muscles .
Gas - powered leaf - blowers are even worse than lawnmowers : an hour of use emits the same amount of pollution as an automobile traveling 560 kilometres .
Whereas cars spread their tailpipe gases over a great distance , the polluting effect of landscaping machines is worsened still since they concentrate the emissions in very small areas which tend to have a concentrated population .
From the landscape to the landfill
Last year , a neighbour asked me to cut down a mature tree in my yard ( a tree which is probably older than our houses ) because it was too difficult for her to clean the leaves up .
This is nonsense .
To begin with , the leaves that fall from the tree will naturally turn to plant food for the next growing season .
They should be left alone ( or at least collected and composted for future use ) .
Second , trees provide many additional benefits - reduction of summer cooling costs , reduction of outside air temperatures under the tree by several degrees and tempering the heat island effect in cities to name a few .
As such we should be trying to plant more trees never mind removing the ones we already have .
Trees clean the air .
Trees improve water quality .
Trees save energy .
Trees raise real estate value .
Trees are good for business .
Trees help stop inner city violence .
The list goes on .

Finally , the city has a policy regarding removal of trees :
Trees are only removed when they become a liability to the New City and its residents .
Requests for tree removal due to seed production , leaves dropping and clogging eves troughs or the inability of the homeowner to continue raking leaves cannot be accepted as valid reasons for removal .
The subsequent homeowner may appreciate a shade or ornamental tree on their property .
Be sure to keep this in mind if you are ever faced with a similar request .
Grass clippings should be seen the same as fallen leaves -- as plant food .
Up to 10 % of municipal waste collection consists of grass clippings , meanwhile , disposal of clippings is completely unnecessary since they break down very quickly ( within days or at most , weeks ) .
What to do right now
A Northeastern Illinois program provides a good model for a used lawnmower buyback program .
Let your councillor know that you 'd like to see Hamilton implement something similar as soon as possible .
In the meantime , the Clean Air Foundation is supporting a lawnmower rebate program at Home Depot stores across Canada .
This is a great opportunity to get credit towards the purchase of an emissions - free push mower .
Today 's push mowers are lighter and easier to use than the ones our grandparents had -- and denser neighbourhoods ( which tend to have smaller lawns to mow ) would benefit most from eliminating power mowers completely .
If you want to keep your grass , be sure to use the most efficient lawnmower that you can find .
If you want to do even more , you can eliminate the need to mow altogether .
By replacing your grass with low maintenance native alternatives , you 'll relegate the lawnmower to nothing more than a distant memory .
This Xeriscape in Colorado shows the beauty of a grass - free yard .
No mower required !

The best part of the solutions to this lawn care epidemic is that most of them are cheaper and easier to implement than their current ( human- unfriendly ) counterparts .
If you can look past the fact that you wo n't have a golf - green - perfect lawn , you can save heaps of money ( and time ) by following a few simple rules and letting nature take its course .
This is one of the rare cases where doing nothing can actually help :
Do not water your grass with anything other than rain
Avoid dangerous ( and costly ) pesticides
Mow your lawn less frequently and with a non-polluting mower
Leave all clippings , fallen leaves and other yard waste on the ground
The bottom line
And after all of this , if your non-native grasses can't keep up with our climate , you can xeriscape your yard instead
Ample thriving greenspace is important within the city , especially in more population - dense areas .
Not only does it create a more pleasant space for living , it also counteracts the negative effects of our addiction to asphalt and automobiles ( both of which contribute to poor air quality and localized temperature increases ) .
However , the positive effects of our lawns and gardens can quickly be negated if we are not careful about the tools we use to maintain them .
So put away the gas can , grab a rake , and enjoy your yard the way it was meant to be : free of both noise and air pollution .

Environmentalists Classified as Terrorists , Get Stiff Sentences .
First two members of a radical environmental group are sentenced to prison .
May 25 , 2007  --
The first two members of a radical environmental group who admitted to setting a series of fires aimed at saving animals , were sentenced Thursday to 12 to 16 years in federal prison .
In an unusual move , the judge agreed with a prosecutor 's request to classify the crimes as acts of domestic terrorism , making them subject to harsher prison sentences .
U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken sentenced Stanislas Meyerhoffa to 16 years and Kevin Tubbs to 12 years , seven months .
The pair were part of a group that admitted to setting fire to a forest ranger station , a police substation , a dealership selling SUVs and a tree farm .
" Fear and intimidation can play no part in changing the hearts and minds of people in a democracy , " Aiken told Tubbs before sentencing him .
Meyerhoff , 29 , and Tubbs , 38 , are members of the Family , a Eugene , Ore. - based cell linked to the Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front .
The group is suspected of 20 arsons in five states that caused $ 40 million in damage .
Before his sentencing , Tubbs , his voice choked with emotion , read from a statement , saying he was deeply sorry for causing harm to others .
" I am disgusted , sickened , saddened and totally ashamed that I played any part in any of the incidents , " he said .
Since their arrests last year , members of the cell have all pleaded guilty to charges of arson and conspiracy .
They have insisted , however , that they would fight at their sentencing hearings the " terrorist enhancement " classification that could increase their prison terms and land them in supermax prisons .
The hearings are at the new center of an old storm about how to define a terrorist .
Radical environmental groups , including the Earth Liberation Front and an associate network , the Animal Liberation Front , have been called " the No. 1 domestic terrorism threat " in America by the FBI .
Their members include four of the Bureau 's 11 most wanted homegrown terrorists .
The groups and their supporters said that in more than 1,100 acts of arson and vandalism , the members have never killed a single person , and the " terrorist " label is intended only as a scare tactic and means of augmenting the government 's rolls of captured terrorists .
Federal agents arrested the 10 defendants last year in an action called Operation Backfire .
At the time of their arrest , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales called the cell 's $ 40 million dollar campaign of arson -- which targeted a horse slaughterhouse , SUV dealerships , a scientific research center , logging companies and a ski resort -- " a pattern of domestic terrorism activities . "
Lawyers and activists defending the saboteurs insisted that acts of arson and property damage have never been the stuff of terrorism indictments .
They said the label is intended by the government to stir public outrage and increase the length of their client 's prison terms .
Prosecutors on Monday called Meyerhoff the " leader , organizer and strategist " of the cell and sought to deflect his attorneys ' claims that the cell had intentionally committed acts in which no people or animals would be killed .
" How many violent acts does it take to call a person violent ? " asked assistant U.S. Attorney Kirk Engdall .
Meyerhoff , Engdall said , had committed " offenses that were clearly calculated to influence the conduct of government by intimidation , coercion and retaliation . "
The government said that combination of intimidation and coercion is what makes it terrorism , and the fact that no one has died is not the real issue .
The Green Scare
Last week federal prosecutors compared the acts of the saboteurs to those of the Ku Klux Klan .
" This is a classic case of terrorism , despite their protests of lofty humane goals , " said assistant U.S. Attorney Stephan Peifer .
" It was pure luck no one was killed or injured by their actions . "
But the defendants ' lawyers insist it is statistically impossible to have committed so many acts of arson with no deaths , unless they had taken abundant steps to prevent the loss of life .
Supporters of the environmental militants maintain that the government is going after " easy targets , " using witch - hunt tactics reminiscent of the McCarthy era " red scare " of the 1950s .
They accuse the government of trumping up charges in an effort to intimidate environmental and animal - rights activists -- in a " green scare . "
" People are being threatened with life in prison for property damage .
Michael Fortier , an accomplice in the Oklahoma City bombing , was released last year after less than 10 years in prison , " Lauren Regan , executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center , a group that monitors activist rights in Oregon , told ABC News .
" If you look at the legislative history of terror enhancement , it originally only applied to acts of international terrorism outside of the U.S. , " Regan said .
" In 1995 , after Oklahoma City , it could be applied to acts of murder or attempted murder .
Congress intended it to apply to things like PanAm 103 , or embassy bombings , not property damage . "
Since the attacks of Sept. 11 , and the passage of the U.S. Patriot Act , the definition of terrorism has widened and with it the size of the net the government can cast to catch suspects .
' People Are Scared '
But those who own the property that 's been damaged said they 've been terrorized and the people responsible should be treated as terrorists .
" There is no question that people are scared , " said Frankie Trull , president and founder of the National Association of Biomedical Research , a nonprofit that represents companies and research institutions that use animals for research .
" There is an extreme element in the animal - rights movement that has decided they are somehow on a higher moral plane and that they can take the law into their own hands , " she said .
" The Internet has made it easier to find out where scientists live and where their children go to school . "
Trull continued : " I think most people would define terrorism as leaving a Molotov cocktail on someone 's doorstep and thinking that 's OK .
…
Companies are concerned with trying to protect employees and employees ' families . "
The FBI 's current Most Wanted List of domestic terrorism suspects includes the names of 11 people currently at large .
Four of those 11 are affiliated with the Earth Liberation Front and are not accused of murder .
The others all committed violent crimes .
Activists see the list as proof that the government is targeting radical environmentalists rather than pursuing harder - to - find criminals bent on using violence to coerce the government .
" Some believe that the government is changing the terminology from acts of civil disobedience to acts of terrorism , because they can show concrete results by arresting domestic activists , " wrote the the authors of a National Lawyers Guild upcoming report .
The FBI , however , insisted that the radicals on the Most Wanted List are real terrorists .
And yet the FBI maintained , " One of the most serious domestic terror threats facing the country are special interest extremist movements that aim to use criminal direct action against people or companies , " according to spokesman Bill Carter .
" There is a distinction between constitutional advocacy and direct action .
Law enforcement only gets involved when people use force , violence or criminal activity . "

Most elementary school teachers will tell you a simple fact about the relationship between positive and negative attention and the continuation of behavior , good and bad .
When you acknowledge and give attention to negative behavior as much as you do to positive behavior , you tacitly endorse negative behavior .
In the end , the child becomes disinterested in the exact nature of attention , and simply pursues attention for its own sake .
Enter Paris Hilton and Ann Coulter , the quintessential attention whores .
While Hilton has the predisposition to open her legs on the moments notice of being in the proximity of a flash bulb , Coulter decidedly opens her mouth when the cameras are rolling .
For Hilton , doing coke , getting DUI ’s , and having blowjobs night - vision video taped is the standard ; for Coulter , it is insulting the widows of 9/11 , referring to Muslims as rag - heads , and most recently , calling John Edwards a ‘ faggot ’ .
The problem with the situation was n’t Ann Coulter necessarily , but the amount of response to her absurdity .
After years of hearing a neighbor ’s nocturnal dog , the media and blogospheres reaction was as if being unexpectedly stirred from slumber by the barks and yelps of the canine .
Much like a poorly trained dog or poorly raised child , the satisfaction of Coulter and Hilton grows as the uproar continues .
They suffer from the same disease of needing to satiate their egos with the media attention they believe is deserved .
In this addiction , they do not care who they hurt , what they say , or what they have to do , the end prize is the pursuit and capture of attention , no matter how negative or repugnant .
The lesson was learned apparently , later rather than sooner , by the Associated Press .
Reported by CNN , the AP decidedly ‘ blacked out ’
Paris Hilton from media reports for a week and promptly was arrested for driving under the influence the following week :
So you may have heard : Paris Hilton was ticketed the other day for driving with a suspended license .
Not huge news , even by celebrity - gossip standards .
Here at The Associated Press , we put out an initial item of some 300 words .
But it actually meant more to us than that .
It meant the end of our experimental blackout on news about Paris Hilton .
It was only meant to be a weeklong ban — not the boldest of journalistic initiatives , and one , we realized , that might seem hypocritical once it ended .
And it was n’t based on a view of what the public should be focusing on — the war in Iraq , for example , or the upcoming election of the next leader of the free world , as opposed to the doings of a partygoing celebrity heiress / reality TV star most famous for a grainy sex video .
No , editors just wanted to see what would happen if we did n’t cover this media phenomenon , this creature of the Internet gossip age , for a full week .
After that , we ’d take it day by day .
Would anyone care ?
Would anyone notice ?
And would that tell us something interesting ?
It turned out that people noticed plenty — but not in the way that might have been expected .
None of the thousands of media outlets that depend on AP called in asking for a Paris Hilton story .
No one felt a newsworthy event had been ignored .
The media , after years of getting humans like Paris Hilton wrong , finally got it right .
But it turned around in less than a month and got Ann Coulter wrong .
The reaction to Ann Coulter ’s ‘ faggot ’ episode was flawed not in the direction — almost everyone , left and right , denounced her words — but that the reaction was disparate , coming from all directions , and constantly replayed .
Rather than having isolated Coulter , the story found itself on the headlines of CNN and FoxNews website , on Bill O’Reilly ’s ‘ The Factor ’ , on MSNBC , and any blog with a political bent .
Essentially , Coulter was put on a pedestal — isolated but admired with attention that she did not deserve , aptly labeled by Slate as the press ’
Ann Coulter problem .
In the end , there is but one lesson to learn : do n’t feed the ego , especially of individuals who do n’t deserve it .
It ’s the only way Ann Coulter and Paris Hilton will go away .

Thermopainter
Osaka University researcher Daisuke Iwai has developed a new technology which allows people to paint using thermal vision technology .
ThermoPainter can detect temperature change regions on a sensing surface as touch regions when objects hotter or colder than the surface touch it .
In the system , users can use a physical paintbrush with hot water and an airbrush with cold water in spite of paint as they use in the real world , and even use their own fingers , hands , and breaths directly because of their own body heat .

I/O Brush
At first glance , it looks like your standard brush , but upon closer inspection you ’ll find integrated LEDs , touch sensors , and a camera .
The I/O Brush basically “ lifts up and captures photons ” , allowing artists to draw with “ special ink ” picked up from their immediate environment .
I/O Brush looks like a regular physical paintbrush but has a small video camera with lights and touch sensors embedded inside .
Outside of the drawing canvas , the brush can pick up color , texture , and movement of a brushed surface .

Thermoesthesia – Interactive Art
Thermoesthesia is basically “ interactive artwork with an original thermal sense display .
It has been developed to allow users feel the temperature of the visually displayed objects , which is cool or warm by directly touching .
What actually fascinated me was the simple idea of being able to create shapes , animation at the simple touch of your finger tips

WATERLOO – Outer space may not be a black void after all .
A team of scientists from Canada and other countries have discovered molecular oxygen in interstellar space .
The team of Canadian , Swedish , French and Finnish researchers has been seeking the elusive oxygen molecule with an orbiting space observatory .
Michel Fich , a University of Waterloo professor of physics and astronomy , says the molecule was found in a dense gas cloud in the constellation of Ophiuchus , about 500 light years away .
Astrochemists have long argued that the basic molecules of life – water and oxygen – are abundant in the denser regions of the interstellar medium .
The Canadian members of the team include Fich , Sun Kwok and Rene Plume of the University of Calgary , Christine Wilson of Hamilton 's McMaster University , and George Mitchell of Saint Mary 's University in Halifax .
The team 's findings are reported in the current issue of Astronomy and Astrophysics .

一部のプログラミング言語の背景として、圏論（カテゴリー論）が使われたりするせいか、以前に比べれば多少は圏論に興味を持つ人が増えたような気がしなくもないような。でも、安直な入門的文書はあまり見かけないですね。もちろん、シッカリした教科書や論説はあるんですが、どうもシッカリし過ぎているような。例えば、圏の例として「コンパクト・ハウスドルフ空間と連続写像の圏」とか言われてもねぇ（この例はいい例なんですけど*1）。かといって、空な圏0とか、単一元からなる圏1とか出されても「へっ？
それがなにか」つう感じだし。
そんなわけで、予備知識なしで理解できる圏の具体例を1つ紹介しましょう。
内容：
しりとりの 圏
ひらがな文字全体の集合 をHとします。つまり、H={ぁ , あ , ぃ , い , ... , ん , ー}。点々（ 「 ...」）でごまかしちゃったけど、ひらがなって何文字あるんでしょう？
http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3040.pdf
を眺めると93文字あるようです。が、文字番号3090から始まる16文字は、「を」「ん」以外は使う機会が少ないので除外すると81文字、これに長音記号「ー」（番号は30FC）を加えて82文字としておきます。
ひらがなを並べて出来る文字列全体の集合をHStr（Hiragana Stringのつもり）とします。例えば、" きゅーり " , " なす " , " ぴーまん " とか がHStrのメンバーです。野菜の名前じゃなくてもいいですよ。それどころか、日本語になっている必要もありません。" はれまけろ " , " んじゃびー " , " ーょょっ ん " も HStrに含まれます。ここで大事な注意、空文字列 " "
はHStrに入れません。HStrは1文字以上を含む文字列の集合です。
ひらがな文字列を引数として、ひらがな文字を値とする関数first , lastを次のように定義します。
first (s ) = 文字列sの最初の文 字
last (s ) = 文字列sの最後の文 字
例えば：
first ( " きゅーり " ) = き last ( " きゅーり " ) = り first ( " らん " ) = ら last ( " らん " ) = ん first ( " あ " ) = あ last ( " あ " ) = あ
HStrに " " は含まれてなかったので、firstもlastもちゃんと定義できます。
さて、ここ で “ しりと り ” をしましょう。 「こぶた、たぬき、きつね、ねこ」ってやつです。文字列sとtが（この順で）しりとりになっているのは、last(s ) = first (t ) のときです。sとtがしりとりになっているときに限り、しりとり結合という演算を定義します。しりとり結合をセミコロン「;」で表すとして、実例を以下に：
" こぶた " ; " たぬき " = " こぶたぬ き " " すいか " ; " からす " = " すいからす " " らいおん " ; " んじゃびー " = " らいおんじゃびー " " あ " ; " あか " = " あ か "
簡単ですね。s ;tは、sとtを（この順で）並べるのですが、sの最後とtの最初が同じ文字なので、その並んだ2文字を1文字にするのです。
「 " あ " ; " あか " = " あか " 」の例から分かるように、1文字だけからなる文字列（長さ1の列）は単位のような働きを持ちます。そこで、unit あ = " あ " のような書き方をすることにします。
以上に出てきた、H , HStr , first , last , unit , ; を合わせると圏になっています。名付けて「しりとりの圏」。
圏の定義を確認す る
圏の定義は、http://d.hatena.ne.jp/keyword/%B7%F7%CF%C0に書いておきましたが、形式的定義だけでは実感が湧かないですよね。で、しりとりの圏が確かに圏であることを確認しましょう。
まず、次の2種類の集合がありました。
H -- ひらがな文字全体の集合
HStr -- ひらがな文字列全体の集合（ただし空な列は除く）
それと2つの関数。
first , last : HStr → H （最初と最後の文字 ）
もうひとつ関数 。
unit : H → HStr （ 1文字からなる文字列）
そして一番重要なのは、しりとり結合演算 「 ; 」です。
s;t は last ( s ) = first ( t ) のときだけ定義され る2項演算
算数が足し算や掛け算を扱うのと同様に、圏論は結合演算（今の例ではしりとり結合演算）を扱います。圏論の結合演算（composition ;
合成とも呼ぶ）は、いつでも定義できるわけではなくて、条件付きで定義されます。その条件を正確に述べるために、（しりとりの例では）first , lastが必要でした。足し算の0、掛け算の1の役割を演じるのはunit
x です。ここで、xは任意のひらがな文字でいいので、単位はたくさん（この例では82個）あります。
次は、定義からすぐにわかるでしょう。
first ( unit x ) = last ( unit x ) = x （x∈H ）
) = last ( unit ) = x （x ∈H） first ( s ; t ) = first ( s ) 、last ( s ; t ) = last ( t ) （s , t∈HStr、sとtが結合可能 ）
例を挙げれば ：
first ( unit あ ) = first ( " あ " ) = あ last ( unit あ ) = last ( " あ " ) = あ first ( " こぶた " ; " たぬき " ) = first ( " こぶたぬき " ) = first ( " こぶた " ) = こ last ( " こぶた " ; " たぬき " ) = last ( " こぶたぬき " ) = last ( " たぬき " ) = き
たいていの演算で成立している法則である結合（associative）法則と単位法則は、しりとり結合演算でもやはり成立しています。
( s;t ) ; u = s;( t;u )
x = first ( s ) , y = last (s ) なら、unit x ;s = s;unit y = s
これも例を挙げれば ：
( " たぬき " ; " きつね " ) ; " ねこ " = " たぬきつね " ; " ねこ " = " たぬきつね こ " " たぬき " ; ( " きつね " ; " ねこ " ) = " たぬき " ; " きつねこ " = " たぬきつねこ " unit き ; " きゅーり " = " き " ; " きゅーり " = " きゅーり " " きゅー り " ; unit り = " きゅーり " ; " り " = " きゅー り "
もうこれで、圏の定義は全部述べきってしまったのですが、圏論で一般的に使われる用語／記法と、しりとりの例で使った用語／記法を並べておきます。
So what is an Enterprise system ?
Standard definitions go from the almost tautological :
A system that supports enterprise - wide or cross-functional requirements , rather than a single department or group within the organization .
And into the circular :
Enterprise System — Enterprise Software running on an Enterprise Platform ( which , by implication , has the Attributes of an Enterprise System as defined below ) Enterprise Platform —
A set of computing and networking resources which enable installed Enterprise Software to exhibit the full attributes of an Enterprise System ( most often referring to availability , scalability , and reliability )
Even the definitions are over engineered :
A software product designed to integrate computer systems that run all phases of an enterprise 's operations to facilitate cooperation and coordination of work across the enterprise .
The intent is to integrate core business processes ( such as sales , accounting , finance , human resources , inventory and manufacturing ) .
The ideal enterprise system could control all major business processes in real time via a single software architecture .
Enterprise software is expanding its scope to link the enterprise with suppliers , business partners and customers .
I 've generally preferred a slightly different definition :
An enterprise system is one which will have a major impact on a business whether it fails or works
The sort of major impact that I mean here is generally measured in dollars .
It 's the sort of major impact that has to be discussed at a board meeting and the sort of major impact that causes notes to appear in the company 's annual accounts .
By fail I do n't mean a system that goes down for a few hours , although that sort of downtime could of course cause a wider business failure .
By fail what I really mean is a systematic failure of the system to manage to perform the task that it needs to do .
This in term causes the business to suffer an operational failure which often means the business itself fails .
Of course when these systems work they enable new business areas , or greater efficiency leading to greater profits .
Occasionally enterprise systems are required for compliance reasons , but these are much rarer than operational systems .
One consequence of this definition is that the same software in one company would be considered enterprise , whilst in another it may not be .
Enterprise systems have a very bad press these days .
A quick read through the posts on http://thedailywtf.com/
shows a huge number of mistakes made in the service of making things enterprisey .
Many of the most egregious errors are caused by a simple failure — people thinking that enterprise systems are about technology .
The big news , which really is no news , is that enterprise systems , as much as any other kinds of system are about the users and the business context .
They are n't about clever technology , clever programmers or clever anything else .
They are all about a ruthless focus on the business goals and helping the users of the system achieve those goals .
The moment that a project team loses sight of that the game is over .

When asked about the new data , Barham Salih , an Iraqi deputy prime minister , said in an interview that the troop increase was having a positive impact in specific neighborhoods in Baghdad , particularly in the Shiite - dominated eastern half of the city .
But he said Iraqi intelligence had concluded that Al Qaeda was in effect surging at the same time in Iraq to counteract the American program , damping any immediate gains .
Mr. Salih also said that insurgents had to some extent fled Baghdad , where the increase is concentrated , to outlying areas like the northern cities of Mosul and Kirkuk , the Kurdish north and the ethnically mixed province of Diyala , north and west of Baghdad , where major attacks have taken place in recent weeks .
“ Al Qaeda has adapted , first by pushing a surge of its own , and by escalation of its own attacks across Iraq , ” Mr. Salih said .
“ It is a deliberate attempt by Al Qaeda , an escalation , to get us to change our tactics . ”
Over all , the attack statistics , which the accountability office has been compiling since the early days of the conflict , paint a sobering picture of where the country is headed .
The number of daily attacks remained low through 2003 and the early months of 2004 , but then began a relentless climb even as the United States promoted what it saw as important political milestones in Iraq .
Image On April 2 , a suicide bomber blew up a truck near a school in Kirkuk , wounding dozens of children .
The daily attack figure for April was 149 .

Those milestones included the transfer of the country to a sovereign Iraqi government , several elections and eventually the creation and ratification of a new Iraqi Constitution .
Despite those developments , the statistics show , the number of attacks averaged 71 a day in January 2006 , and rose to a record high of 176 a day in October 2006 .
Poll : Most think Bush is failing second term President ' looking forward ' to congressional campaigning RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS George W. Bush or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A majority of Americans are more likely to vote for a candidate in November 's congressional elections who opposes President Bush , and 58 percent consider his second term a failure so far , according to a poll released Thursday .
Fewer people consider Bush to be honest and trustworthy now than did a year ago , and 53 percent said they believe his administration deliberately misled the public about Iraq 's purported weapons program before the U.S. invasion in 2003 , the CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll found .
Pollsters interviewed 1,006 American adults Friday through Sunday .
Most questions in the survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
( Poll ) Bush is preparing for his State of the Union address , set for next week , and told reporters Thursday that he is " looking forward " to campaigning for Republicans in November 's elections .
( Full story )
But the latest poll indicated Americans remain in a pessimistic mood .
Fifty - eight percent of those polled said Bush 's second term has been a failure so far , while 38 percent said they consider it a success .
A smaller number -- 52 percent -- consider his entire presidency a failure to date , with 46 percent calling it successful .
( Complete poll results )
In the latter case , the numbers fall within those two questions ' margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
Bush defended his performance Thursday , pointing to an improved economy despite higher prices for gasoline , heating oil and natural gas .
He said the November elections would be about " peace and prosperity . "
" We 've got a record , and a good one , " he said .
" That 's what I intend to campaign on and explain to people why I made the decisions I made , and why they 're necessary to protect the American people , and why they 've been necessary to keep this economy strong -- and why the policies we 've got will keep this economy strong in the future . "
But 51 percent of those polled said they were more likely to vote for a candidate in congressional elections who opposes Bush , while 40 percent said they were likely to vote for a candidate who backs the president .
Bush 's own approval rating remained at 43 percent , unchanged since mid-December , according to results released earlier this week .
Another 54 percent disapproved of his job performance , that survey found .
Nearly two - thirds of those surveyed in the latest poll -- 62 percent -- said they were dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States , while 35 percent said they were satisfied .
And 64 percent said things in the United States have gotten worse in the past five years , while 28 percent said things have improved .
For the first time since Bush took office in 2001 , a majority of those polled said the president -- who campaigned as " a uniter , not a divider " -- has been a divisive leader .
Fifty - four percent called Bush a divider , while 41 percent called him a uniter .
Just over a third -- 34 percent -- said Bush had a clear plan for solving the nation 's problems , and 44 percent agreed that he cared about the needs of people like them and shared their values .
A narrow majority of 51 percent said they consider Bush to be a strong and decisive leader , compared with 48 percent who disagreed .
Although those totals fall within the margin of sampling error , they mark a decline from a year ago , when 61 percent called the president strong and decisive .
Split on honesty Americans were divided evenly -- 49 - 49 -- on the question of Bush 's honesty .
The number of those polled who consider Bush trustworthy improved from a November survey , when only 46 percent rated him honest .
But the figure is down from a year ago , when 56 percent considered him honest and trustworthy , and only 41 percent disapproved .
Specifically , 53 percent said they believe his administration deliberately misled the public about whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction , as Bush and other top officials argued on the eve of the March 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein .
Once Hussein was overthrown , U.S. inspectors concluded that Iraq had not kept stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons , long - range missiles and a nuclear weapons program , though Iraq had concealed weapons - related research from the United Nations .
U.S. troops are battling a persistent insurgency in Iraq , with two soldiers killed in combat Wednesday , raising the American death toll to 2,238 .
More than 2,000 of those have died since Bush declared an end to " major combat operations " May 1 , 2003 .
The war in Iraq topped the list of respondents ' concerns going into 2006 , with 58 percent calling it extremely important .
Terrorism was next with 57 percent , followed by health care with 47 percent , the economy at 46 percent and corruption at 45 percent .
Most of those polled said they believe the United States will have a " significant number " of troops in Iraq for more than a year , with 47 percent believing the U.S. commitment will last one to three years and 33 percent believing the U.S. presence will last longer than that .
Thirty - four percent said they considered economic conditions good and 5 percent excellent , while 41 percent rated the economy fair and 18 percent poor .
Asked which way the economy was headed , 35 percent said they believed it was improving ; 54 percent said it was getting worse .
Economic growth has picked up in recent months , and unemployment has declined since 2003 .
But gasoline prices remain well over $ 2 a gallon on average , and natural gas and heating oil bills have gone up since 2005 .

Why do n’t they get it ?
All of the major vote - rigging sites have sold off or are in the process of being sold .
A new one pops up , destined to fail and be sold ( Buyer beware , there is a reason why such a seemingly profitable venture always gets sold in a couple of months ) .
SpikeTheVote – Sold . UserSubmitter – On The Auction Block .
Why is it that all of the buy - a - vote sites fail ?
And why will they continue to fail ?
It is actually quite easy to catch and marginalize these sites .
Super - History Tracking
If you havent seen this yet , then you need to .
Using a simple CSS + Javascript hack , it is quite easy for a website to determine your browser history , or at least check to see if you have visited certain sites .
Every time you load a page , your browser changes the way that links look if you have previously been to that page ( you know , it turns the blue link purple ) .
Using javascript , a web page can inject a large number of links and check to see if your browser changes the style .
If it does , it knows you have been there .
Thus , in a matter of a second or two , a site like Digg , Reddit , Slashdot or any of the other web 2.0 sites can not only check to see if you have visited a site like Subvert and Profit , it can even check to see if you have been to pages that you can only reach by logging in !
Digg can know not only that you have been to the bad guys ’ sites , but that you have logged in there as well .
It . Is .
That .
Easy .
Quick Example :
1. Visit Here … http://ha.ckers.org/weird/CSS-history-hack.html
2 . Now , imagine , instead of just printing out the links you have visited , it prints out img src=’tracker.php?site=www.digg.com’.
Now , his server can use that image call to record both your ip and that you have visited digg.com before .
Timing is Everything
There is a natural pattern for how people vote .
When a story goes up , it has 30 minutes to 1 hour to get most of it ’s votes , before it gets shuffled off several pages deep and wo n’t be seen again for a long time .
When stories stop meeting this pattern ( ie : votes cast over several days with different referers and no early adoption ) things start to become obvious .
This kind of timing issue along can destroy the effectiveness of Digg - spamming networks where voting is based solely upon when the user decides to log in .
Do n’t you think it is pretty obvious that some guy logs in every day , votes on 5 new stories and 1 that was submitted 13 hours ago ?
Spam Reporting Lowers Reputation of Network Users
After a while of voting on crappy enough Paid - for - Digg stories , the simple reputation algorithms will devalue user votes so heavily that they will become utterly usesless .
After a while , the ineffectiveness and expensiveness , plus the pattern of low - reputation , flagged users voting heavily on their stories , will make the program a waste of cash .
Maybe that is why sites like SpikeTheVote and UserSubmitter decided to cash - out so early .
Where You Vote Matters Most voters / diggers / redditors vote on the story headline , not visiting the unique comments page on the site and voting for it that way .
These services provide direct links to the comments pages .
Voters are n’t perusing through the site , they did n’t perform a search and find a story , they went directly to the comments page and voted .
This kind of pattern easily sets apart vote manipulation .
Yet another easy reason why these Buy - A - Vote sites will and , do , fail .
Cheney ’s speech in Sydney :
An ominous silence on Iran from the US vice president
By Peter Symonds
23 February 2007
The most significant aspect of the US Vice President Dick Cheney ’s keynote speech in Sydney today was what he did not say .
Cheney defended the American occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan , justified the US military “ surge ” in Baghdad , questioned whether North Korea could be trusted to stick to the recently signed agreement with the US and expressed criticisms of China ’s military buildup .
He also hailed the US - Australia alliance and even found time to praise Prime Minister John Howard for the Australian interventions in the tiny Pacific states of East Timor , the Solomon Islands and Tonga .
But Cheney made not the slightest reference to Iran or to the menacing US military build - up in the Persian Gulf .
The vice president and his staff have taken the lead in placing a confrontation with Iran at the top of the Bush administration ’s agenda .
His own national security advisor John Hannah is reported to have told a staff meeting that 2007 would be “ the year of Iran ” .
Cheney made one of his very infrequent trips abroad last November to Saudi Arabia to secure the support of the monarchy for the US strategy in the Middle East , including against Iran .
The purpose of the current trip to Japan and Australia — two of the Bush administration ’s few remaining dependable allies — has been to secure similar backing .
The stated purpose of Cheney ’s visit was to thank the Australian and Japanese governments for their military assistance in the subjugation of Iraq and Afghanistan .
In the days before the vice president ’s arrival , the Howard government made a series of announcements designed to demonstrate its unstinting loyalty to the Bush administration ’s militarist agenda — a new US military base in Western Australian , an additional 70 Australian military instructors for Iraq , and a possible doubling of Australian troops in Afghanistan .
Yet Cheney expressed no thanks for these new commitments : he had bigger things on his mind .
The topic of discussion will undoubtedly be different tomorrow behind closed doors when Cheney meets with the Howard government ’s top - level cabinet security committee .
Iran ’s refusal to meet this week ’s UN deadline to shut down its uranium enrichment facilities , the US propaganda war against Tehran ’s alleged support for anti-US insurgents in Iraq and the arrival this week of a second US aircraft carrier group in the Persian Gulf are certain to be on the agenda .
The Howard government was one of a handful to unconditionally support the criminal US invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Cheney expects the same unswerving political backing for any new US war against Iran .
Cheney ’s policy speech was delivered to the Australian - American Leadership Dialogue at Sydney ’s Shangri-la Hotel behind an unprecedented wall of security .
The two other speeches of his trip were delivered to audiences of US military personnel — aboard the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk at the Yokosuka naval base in Japan and at the Andersen air force base on Guam .
The settings reflect a US administration under political siege , broadly hated and despised by the vast majority of people around the world , including in America and Australia .
Even from the handpicked audience at the Shangri-la Hotel , Cheney ’s ravings about the fictitious “ global war on terrorism ” could evoke only the smallest smattering of applause , let alone a standing ovation .
Cheney ’s basic message in all three countries was the same : the civilised world , led by the US , confronts an unprecedented challenge from globally organised terrorism that has set its sights not only on conquering the Middle East but the world .
“ Terrorist attacks , ” he said , “ are not merely criminal acts by tiny bands of men .
Instead they represent a movement that is global in scope , that formed over a period of decades and that is determined to sow chaos and destruction within civilised countries . ”
Conjuring up the vision of a titanic struggle for world domination between good and evil , Cheney declared that the goal of “ the terrorists ” was to seize control of countries in the Middle East “ so they can have a base from which they can launch attacks against governments that refuse to meet their demands .
Their ultimate aim , and the one they boldly proclaim , is to establish a caliphate covering a region from Spain across North Africa across the Middle East and South Asia , all the way around to Indonesia .
And it would n’t stop there . ”
Cheney ’s delusional invocation of a global terrorist plot recalls nothing so much as the rantings of Nazi leaders in the 1930s about an international Jewish Bolshevik conspiracy .
In both cases , the propaganda is designed to whip up a climate of fear and prejudice , stifle rational debate and obscure the real purpose of militarist aggression .
The transformation of a tiny minority of Islamic extremists — which the US played no small part in financing and arming in the 1970s and 1980s — into a global threat to the most powerful imperialist country is simply absurd .
Cheney is attributing to “ global terrorism ” the grandiose aims of world domination held by the extreme right - wing layer of the American ruling elite that he directly represents .
Former US national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski , who speaks for layers of the US ruling elite that are deeply concerned about the consequences of the Bush administration ’s reckless policies for America ’s global position , poured scorn on this “ war on terror ” in congressional testimony on February 1 .
“ A mythical historical narrative to justify the case for a protracted and potentially expanding war is already being articulated , ” he warned .
“ Initially justified by false claims about WMDs in Iraq , the war is now being redefined as the ‘ decisive ideological struggle ’ of our time , reminiscent of the earlier collisions with Nazism and Stalinism . ”
After noting that both the German Nazis and Soviet Stalinists had a powerful military state at their disposal , Brzezinski made the obvious point : “ In contrast , most Muslims are not embracing Islamic fundamentalism ; al Qaeda is an isolated fundamentalist Islamic aberration ; most Iraqis are engaged in strife because the American occupation destroyed the Iraqi state ; while Iran — though gaining in regional influence — is itself divided , economically and militarily weak .
To argue that America is already at war in the region with a wider Islamic threat , of which Iran is the epicentre , is to promote a self - fulfilling prophecy . ”
Cheney ’s speech , however , was not aimed at convincing , but intimidating .
While not specifically naming the Democrats , he took aim at all critics , even the most tepid , who questioned the wisdom of an open - ended US military aggression .
Elaborating on his theme of recent weeks ,
Cheney once again implied that anyone who equivocated , proposed a political or diplomatic solution , or criticised the escalating war in the Middle East gave succour to “ the terrorists ” .
“ No argument , no principle of moral law , and no appeal to reason or mercy can be expected to stop them , ” he declared , “ the only option for our security and survival is to go on the offensive ... to continue until the enemy is destroyed . ”
It is in this context that the strategic vision elaborated in Cheney ’s speech must be understood .
An unending war against an undefined enemy can be used to justify a US attack on anyone or any country at any time .
Cheney specifically cautioned against the agreement reached between the US and North Korea to resolve the longstanding conflict over Pyongyang ’s nuclear programs .
The vice president , who is well known for his opposition to the negotiations , declared : “ We go into this deal with our eyes open .
In the light of North Korea ’s missile tests last July , its nuclear tests in October , and its record of proliferation and human rights abuses , the regime in Pyongyang has much to prove . ”
If the words were not stronger , it was only because the Bush administration ’s prime focus is elsewhere for now — on Iran and the Middle East .
Cheney also fired a warning shot in China ’s direction .
While praising Beijing ’s role in the six - party talks over North Korea , he added : “ Last month ’s anti-satellite test , and China ’s continued fast - paced military buildup are less constructive and are not consistent with China ’s stated goal of a ‘ peaceful rise ’ . ”
The vice president immediately went on to praise the “ trilateral security structure ” — made up of the US , Japan and Australia — which is aimed at countering Chinese influence in the Asia - Pacific region .
He noted that Howard was due in Tokyo next month for talks on Australia - Japan strategic ties .
“ The growing closeness among our three countries sends an unmistakable message — that we are united in the cause of peace and freedom across the region . ”
Cheney specifically commended the Howard government for its aggressive neo-colonial interventions in the small Pacific states of East Timor , the Solomon Islands , Tonga , Fiji and Papua New Guinea .
Under conditions of a rising tide of opposition to Australian interventions throughout the region , Cheney ’s comments were designed to reinforce the message : anyone who challenges Canberra ’s bullying will inevitably face the full force of the United States as well .
The whole speech was bound together with hypocrisy and cant .
Cheney ’s appeals to the common values of democracy , tolerance and freedom belie the record of the Bush administration and the Howard government in destroying basic democratic rights and promoting anti-Muslim prejudice .
Pro-growth and pro-market policies , he declared , have meant that “ in this year 2007 , our two countries are enjoying wealth and prosperity on an unprecedented scale ” .
In fact , the unleashing of “ free enterprise ” has led to an unprecedented social divide in the US and Australia .
A tiny minority has benefitted at the direct expense of the vast majority of the population , which faces a continuing decline in living standards .
Cheney speaks for the billionaire bankers and speculators who gouged huge profits out of the restructuring , downsizing and slashing of American corporations in the 1990s .
This layer views the extension of US dominance in the oil - rich regions of the Middle East and Central Asia as the only means for offsetting the erosion of America ’s economic and strategic position .
These are the real backers of Cheney ’s “ war on terror ” — to justify military aggression abroad and the suppression of political opposition at home .
The vice president ’s glaring silence on Iran in his set - piece speech should fool no one .
It merely signifies that the Bush administration , with Cheney at the very centre , is still putting the pieces in place for the next target in the US “ war on terror ” .
A deceptive calm before the storm .
Roman gladiators were fat vegetarians
Agençe France - Presse
Roman gladiators were overweight vegetarians and not the muscle - bound men protrayed by actors like Russell Crowe , anthropologists say .
Austrian scientists analysed the skeletons of two different types of gladiators , the myrmillos and retiariae , found at the ancient site of Ephesus , near Selsuk in Turkey .
" Tests performed on bits of bone taken from the skeletons of some 70 gladiators buried at Ephesus seem to prove that they ate mainly barley , beans and dried fruit , " said Dr Karl Grossschmidt , who took part in the study by the Austrian Archaeological Institute
" This diet , which has been mentioned in the oral history , is rather sad but it gave the gladiators a lot of strength even if it made them fat , " said Grossschmidt who is a member of the University of Vienna 's Institute of Histology and Embryology .
The Austrian palaeoanthropologists relied on a method known as elementary microanalysis that allows scientists to determine what a human being ate during his or her lifetime .
With the help of a sonar , they could establish the chemical concentrations inside cells in the bone samples taken from the skeletons at Ephesus .
From this , they could deduce how much meat , fish , grains and fruit made up the diet of the Roman fighting machines .
A balanced diet of meat and vegetables leaves equal amounts of zinc and strontium in the cells , while a mainly vegetarian diet would leave high levels of strontium and little zinc , Grossschmidt said .
Fabian Kanz , from the university 's department of analytical chemistry , said the gladiators ' bone density gave us clues to how they lived .
" The bone density here was higher than usual , as is the case with modern athletes , " he said .
This line of testing allowed the scientists to debunk another myth , that gladiators wore strappy Sparticus sandals in the arena .
" The bone density is particularly high in samples taken from the feet , which would suggest that the gladiators fought with their bare feet in sand , " Kanz said .
He believed that because some gladiators fought with little more than their bare hands , they could have " cultivated layers of fat to protect their vital organs from the cutting blows of their opponents " .
A gladiator 's life
In ancient Rome , the classical battle of gladiators usually pitted a myrmillo armed with a sword , a helmet and a round shield , against the lightly armed retiarius who carried only a net and a dagger , or a samnite who wore a visor and a leather sheath protecting his right arm .
They were mostly slaves who volunteered to fight because sometimes the victor would be freed as a reward , or poor Romans who fought for pay .
The Austrian scientists are still carrying out further tests , but if their initial findings are confirmed it would change the glamorous image of the men immortalised in Spartacus , the 1960 movie starring a young Kirk Douglas , and the more recent Gladiator with Crowe in the main role .
" It seems that the gladiators tried to put on some weight before their battles , " Kanz said .
" But this does not mean that they did not work hard to lose it again once they stepped out of the ring , " he added .
The archeological site of Ephesus is one of the most important in Turkey .
The Greeks founded the city but it was the Romans who made it the capital of their Asian province and turned it into one of the wealthiest cities of their empire .

For the first time , investigators are saying the chemical that has sickened and killed pets in the United States may have been intentionally added to pet food ingredients by Chinese producers .
Food and Drug Administration investigators say the Chinese companies may have spiked products with the chemical melamine so that they would appear , in tests , to have more value as protein products .
Officials now suspect this possibility because a second ingredient from China , rice protein concentrate , has tested positive for melamine .
So has corn gluten shipped to South Africa .
That means there is a possibility for another round of recalls .
The FDA 's top veterinarian , Stephen Sundlof , says finding melamine in so many products " would certainly lend credibility to the theory that it was maybe intentional . "
Melamine , which is used to make plastics in the United States and as a fertilizer in Asia , contains nitrogen .
Nitrogen can appear to boost the level of protein in products .
The revelations have led the FDA to expand the number of products it is testing as they enter the United States .
So far , those inspections at the border have not turned up any melamine in wheat gluten .
Tainted wheat gluten used by Menu Foods is suspected in sickening hundreds , if not thousands of pets .
Some of the tainted pet food has apparently made it into feed for hogs .
Federal agencies are trying to determine if it was actually fed to animals and whether it may have reached the human food supply .
" Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion , and you allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose , and you allow him to make war at pleasure .
Study to see if you can fix any limit to his power in this respect , after having given him so much as you propose .
If to - day he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada to prevent the British from invading us , how could you stop him ?
You may say to him , ' I see no probability of the British invading us ; ' but he will say to you , ' Be silent : I see it , if you do n't . '
" The provision of the Constitution giving the war making power to Congress was dictated , as I understand it , by the following reasons : Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars , pretending generally , if not always , that the good of the people was the object .
This our convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions , and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us .
But your view destroys the whole matter , and places our President where kings have always stood , " - Abraham Lincoln , in a letter to William H. Herndon , Feb. 15 , 1848 .
( Herndon , Lincoln 's law partner , had written him arguing that the president as commander - in - chief possessed the right to initiate a war against Mexico without specific Congressional authorization .

We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
At Google , all code must be reviewed before you can check it in .
This means that another engineer needs to look over your change and give it their approval .
Traditionally we 've done it via email and some wrapper scripts , but more recently people have been switching to Guido 's fancy tool
When I first started doing this I was a bit skeptical .
On many other projects I 've worked on , you instead use post - commit emails ( or equivalents ) to watch what everyone is doing .
You can contact the submitters if something went wrong , so it seemed to me to be more or less equivalent to review without the overhead .
But in practice , I find that after - the - fact emails let a lot more shady code to get through .
It 's surprisingly common ( both in the code I write and the code by others I review ) for something to be written in a slightly messy way -- like with an unclearly named variable , or with an overlong function that could be split into two -- and even though the author knows it 's not ideal they 'll still submit it .
Then , in a post - commit email world , others will see the commit and not be happy with it , but they wo n't be unhappy enough to warrant requiring a subsequent change for cleanliness .
Instead , in a code - review world , nothing 's been committed yet so it seems like it's not that much more trouble to just get it right in the first place .
My most common sort of feedback in a review is a request to clarify a bit of code by either restructuring or with comments .
Especially when you have a lot of people consuming the same code , this sort of polish is really quite nice and worth the pain of reviewing .
I now fully endorse this sort of workflow .
One of the things that Mondrian ( linked above ) adds to the process is that each attempted commit is a sort of microbranch .
Perforce is actually pretty weird as compared to all the other VCSes I 've used , but you can sorta map the code review process to more " normal " systems and call sending code for review just sending someone a diff .
In the past , when the submitter then updates their code in response to feedback , the reviewer just gets a second diff , and does n't get any sort of diff - diff to see what changes were actually made between the diffs .
Mondrian adds this diff - diff feature by actually snapshotting the file state at different review points and ( within its own UI ) letting you see diffs between the files at different points in the review .
In fact , what 's it 's done is implement its own sort of VCS outside of Perforce !
It even identifies the different file states with hashes instead of changelist numbers ( a Perforce - ism ) .
Identifying file states with hashes and micro-branches are the bread and butter of monotone , and in writing this post I could immediately sorta imagine how you could implement this sort of code - review process completely within monotone : you 'd add an extra cert on revisions that had passed the review process , and then make it so all the normal commands ( like " update " ) only pull revisions that passed review .
And then I remembered that they had already done exactly this .
( There are a lot of details necessary to making this not be totally painful , and since I have n't looked at their implementation I can't vouch for it .) monotone is a seriously sweet piece of software , primarily in its powerful design .
I wish there was some way to make it less confusing and complicated .
I wonder how much of its complexity is just fundamental to the problem space it attacks ...

Okay .
So I 'm at work , being bored and hungry .
I decided to order a pizza .
I order the pizza , wait the 45 minutes and finally the pizza arrrives !
( halleluja plays in the background ) I sign for the pizza and it's all mine .
I take the box .
Oh , the glorious smell of Papa John's .
How I love thee .
I open the box .
Hmm .
Somethings missing from my pizza .
The sausage ?
No .
The tomatoes perhaps ?
Nope .
Maybe ... the cheese ?
What , are you silly ?
No. No. No . Not sausage or tomatoes or cheese .
You know what 's missing from my pizza ?
A WHOLE FUCKING SLICE !!!
And I know you 're thinking " You 've gotta be shitting me " because that 's how every single person that has heard about this has reacted .
No .
I 'm not kidding .
A whole god - dammed slice was missing from my pizza .
And just in case you do n't believe me , here 's a re-creation of what I opened my pizza box to find ...
So , I do what any red - blood American would do after discovering that their dilectable pseudo - italian concoction had be tampered with : I call the manager of Papa John's .
Pizza Girl # 1 : Thank you for calling Papa John's .
Just to let you know we have a special .
Two large pizzas ....
Me : I 'm calling to complain .
Pizza Girl : Oh ?
What seems to be the problem .
Me : Well , my pizza got here and there 's a slice missing .
Pizza Girl :
Are you serious ?
Me : As a heart - attack .
There 's a whole slice ... gone .
Pizza Girl starts telling the manager about my situation .
Pizza Girl :
She says there 's a slice missing from here pizza .
Manager : What ?
Are you serious .
Pizza Girl :
She says she 's serious .
The manager starts laughing hysterically .
Manager : Hello , ma'am ?
Me : Hi .
Manager :
So , there 's a slice * giggle * missing from your pizza ?
* laughter *
Me : Yes .
I got the pizza , opened the box and there was a slice gone .
Manager :
Well , how many slices does your pizza have ?
Me : * pauses *
You 've gotta be fucking kidding me ... SEVEN !
There are seven slices on an EIGHT slice pizza .
I am NOT RETARDED .
Okay .
I did n't say that , but I sure as hell thought it .
Me : There are 7 slices .
Manager : Oh .
Well , umm , I do n't ... this has never happened before .
So , it got there like that ?
Me : FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S HOLY ... No .
I ate the fucking slice of pizza and was like " oh , wtf . my slice of pizza is gone "
Does she think I 'm stoned ?
I do n't sound stoned !!!
Yes .
It got here like that .
Manager :
Do you want us to send you another pizza ?
Now , this is where it gets tricky .
What am I to do ?
At this point , I 'm famished .
I need something to eat .
Should I wait another 45 minutes for another pizza ?
Fuck no .
Me : Well , I 'm sorta hungry now .
Manager :
Well , how about I leave this credit on your account for a free pizza for your next order ?
Me : Will it have all eight slices ?
Manager : * laughs *
Yes , it will have all eight .
Me : Okay .
Thanks .
* CLICK *
Alright .
So , the mystery of the mising slice goes unsolved , but I got a free pizza out of the deal .
I 'm still wondering WTF happened to the 8th slice on this one .
Did some mysterious creature intercept my pizza in - transit , eat a slice , and then put it back in it 's box ?
Did the delivery person eat my slice ?
Maybe it was the chef .
Maybe it was Colonel Mustard in the Library with a candlestick .
Damn that Colonel Mustard !
Well , to whoever you are , you pizza stealing son-of - a- bitch : SCREW YOU !

Most cats do not like getting wet - as anyone who has tried to bathe a moggie will know .
But as these pictures show , there 's always the exception to the rule .
For the cat in question is a large male white Bengal tiger called Odin .
Six years old , and at the prime of his life , Odin lives at the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom Zoo in Vallejo , near San Francisco .
He is about 10ft long from nose to tail , and is an excellent swimmer .
Scroll down for more
White tigers - the colour is caused by an unusual genetic combination - are rare in the wild , although there are several dozen in zoos .
Odin was hand - raised at the zoo .
And after he was weaned , his British trainer Lee Munro discovered his remarkable skill : when a lump of meat was thrown into a pool of water , Odin would happily dive in after it .
Scroll down for more
In fact , although Big Cats generally do not like water , tigers of all types have been spotted taking to the water to hunt and even to bathe for pleasure .
Odin can now be observed in action - a large pool with glass walls has been constructed at the zoo to allow visitors to watch him gliding through the water with all the grace of a polar bear .
Scroll down for more
Tragically , within our lifetimes , zoos might be the only places left to see these magnificent animals .
A century ago there were about 100,000 tigers in the wild .
Now there are just 2,500 adults , with the Bengal variety almost extinct .
As of 2004 California employed almost 30 % of all foreign born workers
in the U.S. and was the state with the largest percentage of immigrants
in the labor force .
It received a very large number of uneducated
immigrants so that two thirds of workers with no schooling degree in
California were foreign - born in 2004 .
If immigration harms the labor
opportunities of natives , especially the least skilled ones , California
was the place where these effects should have been particularly strong .
But is it possible that immigrants raised the demand for California ’s
native workers , rather than harming it ?
After all immigrants have
different skills and tend to work in different occupations then natives
and hence they may raise productivity and the demand for complementary
production tasks and skills .
We consider workers of different education
and age as imperfectly substitutable in production and we exploit
differences in immigration across these groups to infer their impact on
US natives .
In order to isolate the " supply - driven " variation of
immigrants across skills and to identify the labor market responses of
natives we use a novel instrumental variable strategy .
Our estimates
use migration by skill group to other U.S. states as instrument for
migration to California .
Migratory flows to other states , in fact ,
share the same " push " factors as those to California but clearly are
not affected by the California - specific " pull " factors .
We find that
between 1960 and 2004 immigration did not produce a negative migratory
response from natives .
To the contrary , as immigrants were imperfect
substitutes for natives with similar education and age we find that
they stimulated , rather than harmed , the demand and wages of most U.S .
native workers .
In other words , if lots of Mexican carpenters move to California , we do n’t see the non-Mexican carpenters leaving in droves , due to lower wages .
Here is the paper .
Here is a non -gated version .
The article makes the interesting observation that if California were counted as a nation ( and the U.S. not ) , it would receive the second largest number of immigrants per year of any country , with only Russia beating it out .
One of the beliefs that most distinguished the fascists , Nazis , and communists of the 20th century was their organic view of society .
Proponents of all three ideologies thought of society as an organism  and of each of you , dear readers , as simply a cell in some part of the organism .
And just as our cells have no importance outside their ability to serve our whole body , in the aforementioned three ideologies , our whole beings had no importance aside from their ability to serve the whole society .
So , of what value was the individual ?
He was simply a tool for the ends of others , none of whom have importance either because they , also , were tools .
And if society was an organism , then it made sense for the head to run things , right ?
Government was thought to be the head .
And , of course , because there were many people within government , the true head was leader of the government  Mussolini , Hitler , and Lenin or Stalin .
Why is all this relevant to an article by “ The Wartime Economist ? ”
Because the organic view of society , though hostile to the basic principles of individual rights on which the United States of America were founded ( I use “ were ” on purpose ; “ states ” is plural ) has crept into our language and has distorted much thinking on the issues of the day , including war .
It is particularly important in discussions of war because people are more likely to fall into the trap of seeing war as a conflict between two organisms rather than what it is , a conflict between two governments that , in most cases , have dragooned their countries ’ resources with little or no consent from their citizens .
So , for example , most people who discuss U.S. foreign policy , including , distressingly , most libertarians , talk about what “ we ” did when it was , in fact , not you or I , but specific government officials , who took the actions they ’re describing .
They say , “ We dropped the bomb on Hiroshima , ” not “ Harry Truman decided to send a small number of people in the military to drop a bomb on Hiroshima . ”
“ The Japanese [ or , more commonly , “ the Japs ” ] bombed Pearl Harbor , ” rather than “ The Japanese government decided to send hundreds of pilots in airplanes to bomb Pearl Harbor . ” Etc .
George Orwell wrote a famous essay , “ Politics and the English Language , ” and a famous novel , 1984 , making the point that language really does affect thinking .
In 1984 , he focused on the fact that , without certain words , certain thoughts could not be expressed  thus the importance of the government ’s “ memory hole , ” down which certain words went .
In his “ Politics ” essay , Orwell also pointed out the other side : using words can affect how we think .
And that is my point here .
Specifically , if we use the word “ we ” to refer to what specific governments have done and will do in the future , we are adopting the organic view of society , which most definitely will affect how we think .
I saw this in a conversation my wife and I had recently with a well - traveled man we met while in San Antonio .
In response to an innocent question about what his favorite place in the world was , he lit into an attack on George Bush and Bush ’s foreign policy .
At some points in his rant , he personalized the issue  for example , when he talked about “ Bush ’s war . ”
There ’s nothing wrong with speaking that way : it is Bush ’s war .
But then he went on to say that the Sept. 11 attack was “ self - inflicted . ”
It was a predictable result of the U.S. government ’s meddling in the affairs of other countries , he said .
Now , as it happens , I agree with this last statement .
But he then went on to minimize the loss of 3,000 people on Sept. 11 : what did the lives of 3,000 people matter when millions have been murdered throughout the world ?
That I do n’t agree with .
I thought then , and still think , that the loss was horrific and that the people who did it were among the most evil people in history .
But that ’s because I see each of the 3,000 - plus people as an individual who matters .
He does n’t .
Why ?
Because he has the organic view of society .
Go back to his statement that the Sept. 11 attacks were “ self - inflicted . ”
How did the young kid and the 40 - something businessman on one of the flights inflict it on themselves ?
They did n’t .
So , what did this man really mean ?
He meant that the U.S. government had helped to bring on the Sept. 11 attacks .
But his organic view of society  society is an organism with government as the head  led him to say that the killings were “ self - inflicted . ”
The great tragedy of collectivism , the organic view of society , is that it makes people heartless  they become incapable of seeing the real losses and hurts inflicted on innocent people because they stop seeing them as individuals .
The example above is one of someone who could n’t see the hurt that individual innocent Americans suffered in the Sept. 11 attacks .
Another example is how hard it is for Americans to see the hurt that the U.S. government inflicts on many foreigners .
Two instances come to mind .
While reading a draft of one of my students ’ thesis chapters a few years ago , I came across the statement , “ Fewer than 150 people were killed in the 1991 Gulf war . ”
I wrote in the margin that the number killed was likely in excess of 100,000 people , three orders of magnitude higher than the number he mentioned .
When we went over his chapter together , he said that when he wrote “ people , ” he had meant “ Americans . ”
His mistake was an innocent one , but it was an innocent consequence of a selective collectivism : seeing Americans as individuals , but people of other societies  particularly ones living in countries on which the U.S. government had made war  as part of an organism .
My second example is like that of the man who thought Sept. 11 was “ self - inflicted . ” Kevin S. , a Navy officer and former colleague of mine at the Naval Postgraduate School , was burned by fuel from the airplane that flew into the Pentagon on Sept. 11 .
It looked as if he would n’t live , but he did .
It was a heroic story that was written up in his local Virginia newspaper .
The article talked about his recovery and had me cheering for him and his spirit .
But then the article stated that Kevin had contacted some of his buddies in the Air Force and asked them to write on one of the bombs to be dropped on people in Afghanistan , “ Kevin sends . ”
As much as I sympathized with Kevin , I was equally sympathetic toward some of the people whom “ Kevin ’s ” bomb would injure or kill , who were at least as innocent as he was .
Unfortunately , Kevin ’s collectivist thinking prevented him from distinguishing between those who had hurt him and those who had not .
Collectivism is the ugliest ideology in the world .
It has been directly responsible for well over 100 million deaths in the 20th century .
Let ’s do our part by not participating in it , even  maybe especially  in our language .
The only hope we have for a peaceful world is to hold guilty people responsible for their actions and to treat the innocent people in all countries as innocent .
Let ’s quit talking about governments whose horrific actions we detest as “ we . ”

Why do we keep falling for this ?
Once in every second - term presidency , the chief executive lectures the country about the impending disaster of a shortage of mathematicians and scientists .
People think : oh no , we 'd better get on the stick and create some in a hurry !
Thus does the President want to spend $ 50 billion over 10 years — a figure these people made up out of whole cloth — and we are all supposed to submit , cough up , and turn our sons and daughters into natural - science brainiacs .
And the President is just sure that his great job - training mission is not limited to Silicon Valley but extends to all cities , rural areas , and ghettos in America .
He is not only raising false hopes , diverting career paths , and wasting money , he is raising a non-problem and purporting to solve it with a non-solution .
The central - planning approach to boosting science was tried and failed in every totalitarian country , and the same will be true in nominally free ones as well .
Still , it seems that megalomaniacs just can't resist the urge to push the idea , which is why mathematicians and scientists leftover from Soviet days are driving cabs and tending bars in today 's Russia .
Let 's say the president made a huge stink about the shortage of teeth cleaners , web designers , dancers , or piano tuners .
We might more clearly recognize the error .
Professions are things chosen by individuals as they follow market signals .
If there is a shortage , the wages of the people with these specializations would go up , thereby drawing more people into the profession .
People would rush to study teeth cleaning and the like .
This influx of new labor would push wages down again .
When the wages get too low , people leave these professions and find others .
Thus does the market for labor specializations work rather well , here , there , and everywhere .
Wages are n't the only consideration for why people go into some fields and not others , but it is a major factor .
The market provides a helpful signaling mechanism to assist people in the development of certain skills .
Shortages and surpluses resolve themselves .
No presidential speeches are necessary .
No commission needs to be established .
No taxpayer dollars need to be expended to make it all happen .
We need only pay attention to the signals of the market and follow our own self - interest .
The shortages and surpluses are systematically driven toward equilibrium , provided there is no government intervention to spoil the process .
Think of how jobs have changed .
We have fewer people around today who know how to farm because fewer people are necessary to do the job .
More kids than ever are going into computer sciences because of the perception that these fields will be lucrative in the future .
In neither case was a government program necessary .
People entering the job market find out quickly what is in demand and what is n't and compare that to their own capacity for doing the job .
The reason the whole math and science racket bamboozles us again and again has to do with our own limitations and our perceptions of foreign countries .
We think : heck I know nothing of these subjects , so I can believe that there is a shortage !
And surely math and science are the keys to just about everything .
And look at those Japanese kids in school that we see on television .
They can run circles around the tattooed bums that populate American public schools .
We are surely " falling behind ! "
In the first place , it would n't actually matter if it were true .
The whole point of the international division of labor is that we benefit from the skills of everyone around the world .
If there were one country in the world where everyone knew math and science — call it Nerdistan — and one other country in the world where everyone specialized in art and literature — call it Poetistan — both countries would enjoy the benefits of both talents provided they were engaged in trade .
The Nerds could enjoy poetry and the Poets would have lots of hand - held contraptions .
And since the professions in both countries were presumably chosen by market means and voluntary choice , that configuration of talent yields the best of all possible worlds .
Apart from that , however , there is another consideration : none of the past predictions of a math - and - science shortage have ever come true .
In fact , when Al Gore raised the same frenzy some years ago , some commentators noted that it is actually easier to make a case that we face a shortage of less skilled workers : people to drive trucks , work in warehouses , clean kitchens and hotels , take care of kids , and work on docks .
Here is probably where we are going to see the wage growth in the future .
In any case , people who have studied this in detail have reached an inconclusive verdict , except to observe that current unemployment rates among math and science people with PhDs are higher than the general population .
Also , as Daniel Greenberg writes , " Average salary scales for professors show the marketplace value of different disciplines : law , $ 109,478 ; business , $ 79,931 ; biological and biomedical sciences , $ 63,988 ; mathematics , $ 61,761 . "
He points out that the editor of Science Magazine even noted the absurdity : " Why do we keep wishing to expand the supply of scientists , even though there is no evidence of imminent shortages ? "
Actually , Donald Kennedy 's entire article is worth a read .
He points out that the worst thing that could happen is for government to attract people into a technical field that they really can't handle .
They only end up working outside the area in which they are trained , or adding to the ranks of the unemployed .
The scientists themselves know how hard the job market is , and of course they do n't want more people in their field driving down wages .
But the point stands : if wages were high enough , good people would be attracted to these fields without subsidies , badgering , and lecturing .
And what pretense does government have for purporting to know better than the market what jobs are necessary in the future ?
Somehow it seems especially egregious for the political class to get into this act , for this group is probably the least well educated in technical fields .
Their specializations are in duplicity , glad handing , and handing out other people 's money to those who are willing to participate in the racket of the redistributivist state .
What do they know about the market for mathematicians ?
So why does government continually badger us about the impending shortage of mathematicians and scientists ?
Maybe it is just a big excuse for getting and spending our money , and one excuse is as good as another .
But maybe there is something more sinister at work .
Perhaps government would like to create a glut of mathematicians and scientists who cannot find work in the private sector , and so these people would have no alternative but to go to work for the Pentagon and other warfare state agencies .
Here , politicians imagine , they would create great gizmos to spy on people , centrally plan , and create smart bombs and other toys for politicians to play with .
Sound crazy ?
I 'm open to any explanation , and perhaps this " conspiracy " view supposes the political class to be smarter than it really is .
Regardless of the real reason , let us not suppose that the real reason is the one they give : that we face an imminent shortage .
We do n't .
And if we did , the political class would be the last to know about it .
To the extent they succeed , they will end up wasting people 's time and money , and the person repainting your house might just have a PhD in mathematics .
A couple of weeks ago , our IT stock analyst , Melanie Hollands , came upon an article called “ The Stock Market ” written by Mark Cuban on his weblog .
Cuban sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo at the height of the bubble in 1999 for $ 2 billion and now owns the Dallas Mavericks .
The article is a great account of his experiences as a technology entrepreneur in the market during the 1980s and 1990s , and a blunt look at the ponzi scheme that the stock market has become .
“ I like Cuban ’s style of writing — blunt , to the point ; he calls it like he sees it with no frills or window dressing , ” Hollands said .
“ During this time , and based on my own vantage point on the Street , I can only say how right I believe his observations and conclusions are . ”

The Stock Market
By Mark Cuban
I get asked all the time to write a book about business and my approach to it .
I ’m not ready to take that leap yet , but along the way , when I find a book that really impresses me , I try to help it find an audience .
In this case , it was n’t long ago I read my now favorite book about the stock market called “ The Number ” by Alex Berenson .
I liked it so much , I volunteered to write the forward for the paperback edition .
Here is the forward I wrote for “ The Number . ” I recommend that anyone with an interest in the market jump at the chance to buy it .
In 1990 , I sold my company , MicroSolutions — which specialized in what at the time was the relatively new business of helping companies network their computer equipment — to CompuServe .
After taxes , I walked away with about $ 2 million .
That was going to be my nest egg , and my goal was to protect it at all costs , and grow it wisely .
I set about interviewing stockbrokers and settled upon a broker from Goldman Sachs , Raleigh Ralls .
Raleigh was in his late 20s , and relatively new to Goldman .
But we hit it off very well and I trusted him .
As we planned my financial future , I made it clear that I wanted my nest egg to be invested not like I was 30 years old , but as if I were 60 years old .
I was a widows and orphans investor .
Over the next year I stuck to my plan .
I trusted Raleigh , and he put me in bonds , dividend - paying utilities and blue chips , just as I asked .
During that year , Raleigh began asking me a lot of questions about technology .
Because of my experience at MicroSolutions , I knew the products and companies that were hot .
Synoptics , Wellfleet , NetWorth , Lotus , Novell , and others .
I knew which had products that worked , did n’t work , were selling or not .
How these companies were marketed , and whether or not they were or would be successful .
I could n’t believe that I would have an advantage in the market .
After all , I had read “ A Random Walk Down Wall Street ” in college .
I truly thought that the markets were efficient , that any available knowledge about a company was already reflected in its stock price .
Yet I saw Raleigh using the information I gave him to make money for his clients .
He finally broke me down to start using this information to my advantage to make some money in the market .
Finally after more than a year , I relented .
I was ready to trade .
Notice I did n’t use the word invest .
I was n’t an investor .
I just wanted to make money .
The reason I was ready to try was that it was patently obvious that the market was n’t efficient .
Someone like me with industry knowledge had an advantage .
My knowledge could be used profitably .
As we got ready to start , I asked Raleigh if he had any words of wisdom that I should remember .
His response was simple .
“ Get Long , Get Loud . ”
Get long , get loud
As we started buying and selling technology stocks , most of which were in the local area networking field that I had specialized in at MicroSolutions , Raleigh put me on the phone with analysts , money managers , individual investors , reporters , anyone with money or influence who wanted to talk technology and stocks .
We talked about token ring topologies that did n’t work on 10 BaseT .
We talked about what companies were stuffing channels — selling more equipment to their distributors than the distributors really needed to meet the retail demand .
We talked about who was winning , and who was losing .
We talked about things that really amounted to the things you would hear if you attended any industry trade show panel .
Yet after hanging up the phone with these people , I would watch stocks move up and down .
Of course as the stocks moved , the number of people wanting to talk to me grew .
I remember buying stock in a Canadian company called Gandalf Technologies in the early ’90s .
Gandalf made Ethernet bridges that allowed businesses and homes to connect to the Internet and each other via high - speed digital phone lines called ISDN .
I had bought one for my house and liked the product , and I ’d talked to other people who ’d used it .
They had decent results , nothing spectacular , but good enough .
I had no idea Gandalf was even a public company until a friend of Raleigh ’s asked me about it .
What did I think about Gandalf Technologies ?
It was trading at the time at about a buck a share .
It was a decent company , I said .
It had competition , but the market was new and they had as much chance as anyone to succeed .
Sure , I ’ll buy some , and I would be happy to answer any questions about the technology .
The market size , the competition , the growth rates .
Whatever I knew , I would tell .
I bought the stock , I answered the questions , and I watched Gandalf climb from a dollar to about $ 20 a share over the next months .
At a dollar , I could make an argument that Gandalf could be attractive .
Its market was growing , and compared to the competition , it was reasonably valued on a price - sales or price - earnings basis .
But at $ 20 , the company ’s market value was close to $ 1 billion — which in those days was real money .
The situation was crazy .
People were buying the stock because other people were buying the stock .
To add to the volume , a mid-sized investment bank that specialized in technology companies came out with a buy rating on Gandalf .
They reiterated all the marketing mishmash that was fun to talk about when the stock was a dollar .
The ISDN market was exploding .
The product was good .
Gandalf was adding distributors .
If they only maintained X percentage of the market , they would grow to some big number .
Their competitors were trading at huge market caps , so this company looks cheap .
Et cetera , et cetera .
The bank made up forecasts formulating revenue numbers at monstrous growth rates that at some point in the future led to profits .
Unfortunately , the bank could n’t attract enough new money to the stock to sustain its price .
It did n’t have enough brokers to shout out the marketing spiel to entice enough new buyers to pay the old buyers .
The hope among the “ sophisticated buyers ” was that one bank picking up coverage would lead to others doing the same .
It did n’t happen .
No other big investment banks published reports on the stock .
The volume turned down .
So I did the only smart thing .
I sold my stock , and I shorted it to boot .
Then I told the same people who asked me why I was buying the stock that I had shorted the stock .
Over the next months , the stock sank into oblivion .
In 1997 , Gandalf filed for bankruptcy .
Its shares were canceled — wiped out — a few months later .
I wish I could take credit for the stock going up , and going down .
I can’t .
If the company had performed well , who knows what the stock would have done ?
But the entire experience taught me quite a bit about how the market works .
For years on end a company ’s price can have less to do with a company ’s real prospects than with the excitement it and its supporters are able to generate among investors .
That lesson was reinforced as I saw the Gandalf experience repeated with many different stocks over the next 10 years .
Brokers and bankers market and sell stocks .
Unless demand can be manufactured , the stock will decline .
In July of 1998 , my partner Todd Wagner and I took our company , Broadcast.com , public with Morgan Stanley .
Broadcast.com used audio and video streaming to enable companies to communicate live with customers , employees , vendors , anyone with a PC .
We founded Broadcast.com in 1995 , and we were well on our way to being profitable .
Still , we never thought we would go public so quickly .
But this was the Internet Era , and the demand for Internet stocks was starting to explode .
So publicly traded we would become , and Morgan Stanley would shepherd us .
Part of the process of taking a new company public is something called a road show .
The road show is just that .
A company getting ready to sell shares visits the big mutual funds , hedge funds , pension funds — anyone who can buy millions of dollars of stock in a single order .
It ’s a sales tour .
Seven days , 63 presentations .
We often discussed turning up the volume on the stock .
It was the ultimate “ Get Loud . ” Call it Stockapalooza .
Prior to the road show , we put together an amazing presentation .
We hired consultants to help us .
We practiced and practiced .
We argued about what we should and should n’t say .
We had Morgan Stanley and others ask us every possible question they could think of so we would n’t look stupid when we sat in front of these savvy investors .
Savvy investors ?
I was shocked .
Of the 63 companies and 400 - plus participants we visited , I would be exaggerating if I said we got 10 good questions about our business and how it worked .
The vast majority of people in the meetings had no clue who we were or what we did .
They just knew that there were a lot of people talking about the company and they should be there .
The lack of knowledge at the meetings got to be such a joke between Todd and I that we used to purposely mess up to see if anyone noticed .
Or we would have pet lines that we would make up to crack each other up .
Did we ruin our chance for the IPO ?
Was our product so complicated that no one got it and as a result no one bought the stock ?
Hell , no .
They might not have had a clue , but that did n’t stop them from buying the stock .
We batted 1.000 .
Every single investor we talked to placed the maximum order allowable for the stock .
On July 18 , 1998 , Broadcast.com went public as BCST , priced at $ 18 a share .
It closed at $ 62.75 , a gain of almost 250 percent , which at the time was the largest one - day rise of a new offering in the history of the stock market .
The same mutual fund managers who were completely clueless about our company placed multimillion orders for our stock .
Multimillion dollar orders using YOUR MONEY .
If the value of a stock is what people will pay for it , then Broadcast.com was fairly valued .
We were able to work with Morgan Stanley to create volume around the stock .
Volume creates demand .
Stocks do n’t go up because companies do well or do poorly .
Stocks go up and down depending on supply and demand .
If a stock is marketed well enough to create more demand from buyers than there are sellers , the stock will go up .
What about fundamentals ?
Fundamentals is a word invented by sellers to find buyers .
Price - earnings ratios , price - sales , the present value of future cash flows — pick one .
Fundamentals are merely metrics created to help stockbrokers sell stocks and to give buyers reassurance when buying stocks .
Even how profits are calculated is manipulated to give confidence to buyers .
I get asked every day to invest in private companies .
I always ask the same couple questions .
How soon till I get my money back , and how much cash can I make from the investment ?
I never ask what the PE ratio will be , what the price to sales ratio will be .
Most private investors are the same way .
Heck , in Junior Achievement we were taught to return money to our investors .
For some reason , as Alex points out in “ The Number , ” buyers of stocks have lost sight of the value of companies paying them cash for their investment .
In today ’s markets , cash is n’t earned by holding a company and collecting dividends .
It ’s earned by convincing someone to buy your stock from you .
If you really think of it , when a stock does n’t pay dividends , there really is n’t a whole lot of difference between a share of stock and a baseball card .
If you put your Mickey Mantle rookie card on your desk , and a share of your favorite non-dividend paying stock next to it , and let it sit there for 20 years .
After 20 years you would still just have two pieces of paper sitting on your desk .
The difference in value would come from how well they were marketed .
If there were millions of stockbrokers selling baseball cards , if there were financial television channels dedicated to covering the value of baseball cards with a ticker of baseball card prices streaming at the bottom , if the fund industry spent billions to tell you to buy and hold baseball cards , I am willing to bet we would talk about the fundamentals of baseball cards instead of stocks .
I know that sounds crazy , but the stock market has gone from a place where investors actually own part of a company and have a say in their management , to a market designed to enrich insiders by allowing them to sell shares they buy cheaply through options .
Companies continuously issue new shares to their managers without asking their existing shareholders .
Those managers then leak that stock to the market a little at a time .
It ’s unlimited dilution of existing shareholders ’ stakes , death by a thousand dilutive cuts .
If that is n’t a scam , I do n’t know what is .
Individual shareholders have nothing but the chance to sell it to the next sucker .
A mutual fund buys 1 million shares of a company with your and your coworkers ’ money .
You own 1 percent of the company .
Six weeks later you own less , and all that money went to insiders , not to the company .
And no one asked your permission , and you did n’t know you got diluted or by how much till 90 days after the fact — if that soon .
When Broadcast.com went public , we raised a lot of money that certainly helped us grow as a company .
But once you get past the raising capital part of the market , the stock market becomes not only inefficient , but as close to a Ponzi scheme as you can get .
As a public company , we got calls every day from people who owned Broadcast.com stock or had bought it for their funds .
They did n’t call because they were confused during our road show , were too embarrassed to ask questions and wanted to get more information .
They called because they wanted to know if the “ fundamentals ” — the marketing points — they had heard before were improving .
And the most important fundamental was “ The Number , ” our quarterly earnings ( or in our case , a loss ) .
Once we went public , Morgan Stanley published a report on our company , as did several other firms .
They all projected our quarterly sales and earnings .
Would we beat The Number ?
Of course , by law , we were not allowed to say anything .
That did n’t stop people from asking .
They needed us to beat the forecast .
They knew if we beat The Number the volume on the stock would go up .
Brokers would tell their clients about it .
The Wall Street Journal would write about it .
CNBC would shout the good news to day traders and investment banks that watched their network all day long .
All the volume would drive up the stock price .
Unfortunately , patience is not a virtue on Wall Street .
Every day , portfolios are valued by at closing price .
If the value of your fund is n’t keeping up with the indexes or your competition , the new money coming in the market wo n’t come to you .
It just was n’t feasible for these investors to wait till the number was reported by companies each quarter .
The volume had to be on the stocks in you fund .
To keep the volume about a stock up , and the demand for the stock increasing , you needed to have good news to tell .
Volume , The Number , whisper numbers , insiders granting themselves millions and millions of options — these are the games that Wall Street plays to keep on enriching themselves at the expense of the public .
I know this .
I have tried to tell people to be careful before they turned over their life savings and their financial future to someone whose first job is to keep their job , not make you money .
Till I read “ The Number ” by Alex Berenson , I never had a book that explained how the market truly worked that I could tell my friends , family and acquaintances to read .
I never had a book that would truly warn them that the market was not as fair and honest as mutual fund and brokerage commercials made them out to be .
I may be a cynic when it comes to the stock market , but I am an informed cynic , and that has helped me make some very , very profitable decisions in the market .
If you are considering investing in the market , any part of it , or if you are considering giving your hard - earned money over to someone else to manage , please , please read “ The Number ” first .

What does a high Alexa rating mean to a web master ?
It should n’t mean that much as it ’s not accurate .
Alexa is a website that tracks a website ’s traffic history , and gives a ranking based upon the number of visitors .
However the fact that it requires a tool bar to work flaws it in many ways .
Alexa works by counting on users to download a tool bar for Internet Explorer .
It tracks what sites you go to , and compiles the data .
For each time you visit a website using Alexa tool bar it multiples that by ten , because it is assumed that for every one Alexa tool bar user there are nine non users .
This is also known as an estimate .
On the tool bar it will list the rank of a website , and what other sites a user of that site tends to go to .
The tool bar offers nothing else for the user except a search bar , which has terrible search results .
It ’s also an eye sore for Internet Explorer 7 .
Alexa has no support for FireFox , Opera or Safari at all .
They refuse to make a tool bar for any other browser .
But wait all is not lost – they offer solutions .
Build Your Own Alexa Toolbar .
Because Firefox is an open source browser , an enterprising developer might make use of that functionality and our Web Information Services Feed to create such a Toolbar .
Yes , build your own .
They want to compile user traffic data from people all around the world , and their advice is to build your own tool bar .
Their other solution is to ask FireFox developers to build one into FireFox .
Ask FireFox to include Alexa .
In 1998 , Alexa built a feature for both Netscape and Mozilla browsers called What ’s Related .
Unfortunately that feature is not included in the FireFox browser .
Write a note ( http://www.mozilla.org/contact/) to the folks at Mozilla / Firefox to let them know you want Alexa AND FireFox .
Apparently the folks at Alexa have never heard of any other browser besides Internet Explorer and FireFox .
This seems quite unprofessional coming from a company owned by Amazon.com .
What ’s the problem with this you ask ?
Well the results are skewed – totally inaccurate .
For instance if you look up the ranking for msn.com they are ranked # 2 .
Now on a default installation of Windows XP , which is what the majority of people use ; MSN is the homepage for Internet Explorer .
All those IE users going to the MSN homepage gives MSN an unfair advantage .
Take a site like Slashdot or Digg , with their user base being an incredible ~ 76 % FireFox users .
IE users on those sites are few and far between , and the Alexa tool bar and IE users are even more uncommon .
Another website being hit as hard with these inaccurate statistics is MacRumors .
Their site only has 13 % IE users total , while FireFox and Safari are used about the same .
Aside from being flawed to begin with , there will always be people trying to exploit or game the system .
AlexaSurf is a website designed to do just that .
Essentially you visit other people ’s websites with Alexa ’s tool bar , and they do the same for you .
Given enough time it could potentially increase your Alexa rating significantly .
With a growing amount of people using flawed and easily manipulated data in legitimate statistics there will always be someone to believe its accuracy .
EBay auctions are using Alexa as proof they are selling a high traffic domain , scripts are being made to calculate website value based on Alexa ratings , and reputable news websites are using Alexa data to write articles about the biggest website in the world !
In short , the Alexa ranking system is naturally flawed .
The data should never be treated as accurate , as it ’s easily manipulated , and not supported for most browsers in the world .
It ’s an estimate , and nothing more .
May 2007 , Joint report with Hamoked - Center for the Defence of the Individual , Summary
In recent years , Israel has openly admitted that ISA ( formerly the General Security Service ) interrogators employ " exceptional " interrogation methods and " physical pressure " against Palestinian detainees in situations labeled " ticking bombs " .
B'Tselem and HaMoked - Center for the Defence of the Individual have examined these interrogation methods and the frequency with which they are used , as well as other harmful practices .
The report 's findings are based on the testimonies of 73 Palestinian residents of the West Bank who were arrested between July 2005 and January 2006 and interrogated by the ISA .
Although it is not a representative sample , it does provide a valid indication of the frequency of the reported phenomena .
The Legal Framework
International law absolutely prohibits torture and ill - treatment .
States may not derogate from this prohibition even in the harsh circumstances of fighting terrorism .
The responsibility , in case of violation , rests not just with the state , but also with the individual abusers who may face prosecution in other countries .
In its ruling from September 1999 , the HCJ determined that the ISA did not have legal authority to use " physical means " against interrogees .
Pressure and a measure of discomfort are legitimate , according to this judgment , only as a side - effect of the necessities of the interrogation and not as a means for breaking the interrogees ' spirit .
However , it was established that ISA agents who abused interrogees in " ticking bomb " situations may avoid prosecution .
This ruling implicitly legitimized these severe acts , contrary to international law , which does not acknowledge any exceptions to the prohibition on torture and ill - treatment .
The " Softening Up " of Detainees Prior to Interrogation
The witnesses reported being subjected to beating , painful binding , swearing and humiliation and denial of basic needs at the hands of security forces personnel from the moment of arrest until being transferred to the ISA .
About two thirds of the witnesses ( 49 of 73 ) reported that they had undergone at least one of these forms of abuse , which are defined by international law as ill - treatment and may reach the level of torture .
This research did not examine the question whether this ill - treatment was intended to " soften up " the detainees for the ISA interrogations .
It is , however , its practical outcome .
The ISA Interrogation System : Routine Ill - treatment
The ISA interrogation system includes seven key aspects which harm , to varying degrees , the dignity and bodily integrity of the detainees .
This injury is intensified considering the combined exercise of these aspects during the interrogation period which , for the witnesses in the sample , lasted an average of 35 days :
Isolation from the outside world - prohibition on meetings between detainees and their attorneys or ICRC representatives ;
The use of the conditions of imprisonment as a means of psychological pressure - holding in solitary confinement and in putrid , stifling cells ;
The use of conditions of imprisonment as a means for weakening the body - preventing physical activity , sleep disturbance , inadequate food supply ;
Shackling in the " shabah " position - painful binding of the detainee 's hands and feet to a chair ;
Cursing and humiliation - cursing , strip searches , shouting , spitting etc. ;
Threats and intimidation - including the threat of physical torture , arrest of family members , etc . ;
The use of informants , " ' asafir " to extract information - this method is not harmful , as such , but its efficacy largely depends on the ill - treatment of detainees immediately preceding its implementation .
These methods were employed against the vast majority of witnesses included in the sample .
These measures are not inevitable side - effects of the necessities of detention and interrogation , but are rather intended to break the spirit of the interrogees .
As such , they deviate from the HCJ ruling and constitute , under international law , prohibited ill - treatment .
Moreover , under certain circumstances , these measures may amount to torture .
" Special " Interrogation Methods
In addition to routine measures , in some cases , probably those considered " ticking bombs " , ISA interrogators also use " special " methods which mostly involve direct physical violence .
The sample witnesses described seven such methods :
Sleep deprivation for over 24 hours ( 15 cases ) ;
" Dry " beatings ( 17 cases ) ;
Painful tightening of handcuffs , sometimes while cutting off blood flow ( 5 cases ) ;
Sudden pulling of the body while causing pain in the hand joints which are cuffed to the chair ( 6 cases ) ;
Sudden tilting of the head sideways or backwards ( 8 cases ) ;
The " frog " crouch ( forcing the detainees to crouch on tiptoes ) accompanied by shoving ( 3 cases ) ;
The " banana " position - bending the back of the interrogee in an arch while he is seated on a backless chair ( 5 cases ) .
These measures are defined as torture under international law .
Their use is not negligible , even if not routine .
The HCJ did rule that ISA interrogators who abused interrogees in " ticking bomb " situations may be exempted from criminal liability , but this only when the ill - treatment was used as a spontaneous response by an individual interrogator to an unexpected occurrence .
In practice , all evidence points to the fact that " special " methods are preauthorized and are used according a preset regulations .
Cover up and Whitewashing Mechanisms
The ill - treatment and torture of Palestinian detainees by soldiers and ISA interrogators do not take place in a void , but rather under the auspices of the Israeli law enforcement system .
Despite the fact that since 2001 the State Attorney 's Office received over 500 complaints regarding ill - treatment by ISA interrogators , it has not found cause to order the instigation of a single criminal investigation .
The State Attorney 's decisions on this issue are based on the findings of an examination conducted by the " Inspector of Complaints by ISA Interrogees , " who is an ISA agent , answerable to the head of the organization .
Even when the findings have shown that ISA interrogators did indeed abuse an interrogee , the State Attorney 's Office has closed the file based on a biased interpretation of the ruling regarding the applicability of the " necessity defense " in the HCJ 1999 judgment .
Most cases of ill - treatment of Palestinians by soldiers are not investigated at all , and few of those that do , culminate in an indictment .
In many cases , this is due to various institutional failings such as delays in instigation investigations .
Additionally , it may be assumed that without concerted and proactive efforts on the part of the authorities , the chances of detainees submitting complaints regarding injuries they have suffered during their arrest are quite low .
The ISA interrogation system is significantly aided by the HCJ , which serves as a rubber stamp on orders which regulate the isolation of the interogees from the outside world .
The HCJ did not accept even one of the hundreds of petitions brought before it against such orders .
The HCJ also routinely allows the ISA to conceal from the detainees the very fact that an order against them has been issued as well as the legal proceedings taking place in their case .
All this with the purpose of increasing the psychological pressure employed against them .
Recommendations
To instruct the ISA to halt immediately and completely the use of all interrogation methods that injure the dignity or physical integrity of interrogees ;
To initiate legislation strictly prohibiting torture and ill - treatment and preventing the possibility of the " necessity defense " being enjoyed by public employees suspected of such actions ;
To determine that any complaint filed against ISA interrogators on account of ill - treatment during interrogations will be investigated by an independent body , and prosecute those responsible where the complaint has been sustained ;
To document ISA interrogations by means of video filming and to open ISA interrogation facilities to objective external review , including review by the UN Special Rapporteur on torture ;
To ensure , in legislation and in practice , that every detainee receives minimum humane conditions of incarceration , and to abolish the provisions discriminating against " security " detainees in terms of such conditions ;
To abolish the military order permitting the ISA to prevent meetings between detainees and their attorneys , and to apply the same standards to Palestinian detainees as are established in the Israeli Detentions Law ;
To bring security forces personnel who abused Palestinian detainees to justice .
These measures are defined as torture under international law .
Their use is not negligible , even if not routine .
The HCJ did rule that ISA interrogators who abused interrogees in " ticking bomb " situations may be exempted from criminal liability , but this only when the ill - treatment was used as a spontaneous response by an individual interrogator to an unexpected occurrence .
In practice , all evidence points to the fact that " special " methods are preauthorized and are used according a preset regulations .

Google is blocking adverts where essays sell from £ 5 to £ 5,000 Google is to ban adverts for essay writing services - following claims that plagiarism is threatening the integrity of university degrees .
There have been complaints from universities about students being sold customised essays on the internet .
The advert ban from the Google search engine has been " warmly welcomed " by university authorities .
But it has angered essay writing firms which say this will unfairly punish legitimate businesses .
From next month , Google will no longer take adverts from companies which sell essays and dissertations - and the internet company has written to advertisers to tell them about the policy .
Plagiarism software Google 's forthcoming ban on adverts for " academic paper - writing services and the sale of pre-written essays , theses , and dissertations " means that essay websites join a blacklist of " unacceptable content " including adverts for weapons , prostitution , drugs , tobacco , fake documents and " miracle cures " .
The move has been applauded by universities which have struggled with the problem of students dishonestly submitting material copied from the internet .
Universities warn that plagiarism " devalues " higher education " Making life harder for these cynical web ' essay mills ' is a step in the right direction , " says Professor Drummond Bone , president of Universities UK .
" We welcome this move .
Essay writing sites claim that students pay hundreds of pounds for model answers - but do not then submit these as their own work .
We all know this claim is absurd . "
The universities organisation says that in particular there have been difficulties with essays bought by students from companies which sell tailor - made answers , where fees can be up to £ 5,000 for a single piece of extended work .
There have been reports of up to 12,000 essays being sold to students in a year , says Universities UK .
These essays and assignments can be written by freelance academics or other students - and it is less easy for plagiarism software used by universities to detect such work .
Google , commenting on the change , says its advertising policies are " developed and evaluated based on multiple factors , including legal and cultural considerations plus user and customer experience " .
And a spokesperson said that the advert ban was expected to be applied across Google 's global network .
Unfair ban ?
But one of the UK companies fearing that it will be prevented from advertising , Essaywriter.co.uk , is angry at the threat to its business - with 80 % of its customers coming through Google .
Managing director Matthew Wilson says this will punish the legitimate , transparent companies , which sell essays , but which warn students that they must not be used dishonestly .
Mr Wilson says that such a bespoke service , selling tailor - made essays at short notice , with prices around £ 70 and upwards , can be used as a guide for students wanting extra assistance .
Overseas students are frequently customers , he says - but the firm makes clear that essays should not be passed off as being written by the student .
And he says that such a blanket ban will not stop the search engine from generating links to rogue essay selling companies , which have been accused of scamming customers by providing poor quality material .

What are these ?
JIDDA , Saudi Arabia , Oct. 2 — A review of White House records has determined that George J. Tenet , then the director of central intelligence , did brief Condoleezza Rice and other top officials on July 10 , 2001 , about the looming threat from Al Qaeda , a State Department spokesman said Monday .
The account by Sean McCormack came hours after Ms. Rice , the secretary of state , told reporters aboard her airplane that she did not recall the specific meeting on July 10 , 2001 , noting that she had met repeatedly with Mr. Tenet that summer about terrorist threats .
Ms. Rice , the national security adviser at the time , said it was “ incomprehensible ” she ignored dire terrorist threats two months before the Sept. 11 attacks .
Mr. McCormack also said records show that the Sept. 11 commission was informed about the meeting , a fact that former intelligence officials and members of the commission confirmed on Monday .
When details of the meeting emerged last week in a new book by Bob Woodward of The Washington Post , Bush administration officials questioned Mr. Woodward ’s reporting .

Proof # 50 - Ask Jesus to appear
Just about everyone knows the story of Jesus ' death and resurrection .
The story is summarized in the Apostles ' Creed .
Jesus was crucified , died , and was buried .
He descended into hell .
On the third day he arose again from the dead .
There is only one way for Jesus to prove that he rose from the dead .
He had to appear to people .
Therefore , several different places in the Bible describe Jesus ' appearances after his death :
Watch the video Matthew chapter 28
Mark chapter 16
Luke chapter 24
John Chapter 20 and 21 1 Corinthians 15:3 - 6 provides a nice summary of those passages , as written by Paul : For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received , that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures , that he was buried , that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures , and that he appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve .
Then he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time , most of whom are still alive , though some have fallen asleep .
Then he appeared to James , then to all the apostles .
Last of all , as to one untimely born , he appeared also to me .
As you can see in this passage , Jesus appeared to hundreds of people a number of different times .
Being like Paul
This proof generated so many rationalizations and excuses that we had to create a separate page to rebutt them all .
See the Excuses page for a complete list .
When we look at 1 Corinthians 15:3 - 6 , there is a question that comes to mind -- why did Jesus stop making these appearances ?
Why is n't Jesus appearing today ?
It really is odd .
Obviously Paul benefitted from a personal meeting with the resurrected Christ .
Because of the personal visit , Paul could see for himself the truth of the resurrection , and he could ask Jesus questions .
So ...
Why does n't Jesus appear to everyone and prove that he is resurrected , just like he appeared to Paul ?
There is nothing to stop Jesus from materializing in your kitchen tonight to have a personal chat with you .
And if you think about it , Jesus really does need to appear to each of us .
If Paul needed a personal visit from Jesus to know that Jesus was resurrected , then why would n't you ?
It is an important question for the following reasons :
We are told by the Bible that Jesus appeared to hundreds of people .
We therefore know that it is OK for Jesus to appear to people -- it does not take away their free will , for example -- because it was OK for Jesus to appear to hundreds of other people .
We know that it would be easy for Jesus to appear to everyone all through history , since Jesus is all - powerful and timeless .
We know that , if Jesus did reappear to everyone , it would be incredibly helpful .
We could all know , personally , that Jesus is resurrected and that Jesus is God .
If Paul ( and all the other people in the Bible ) needed a personal visit to know that Jesus was resurrected , then why not you and me ?
Yet , we all know that Jesus has not appeared to anyone in 2,000 years .
In other words , there is nothing stopping Jesus from appearing to you , and several good reasons for him to appear .
In addition , Jesus promises that he will appear to you .
All that we have to do is pray to Jesus like this : " Dear Jesus , please appear to us , as you did to Paul and the 500 brethren , so that we can see the evidence of your resurrection .
In your name we pray , amen . "
Here is what Jesus has promised us in the Bible : Matthew 7:7 Jesus says : Ask , and it will be given you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and it will be opened to you .
For every one who asks receives , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks it will be opened .
Or what man of you , if his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
Or if he asks for a fish , will give him a serpent ?
If you then , who are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
In John chapter 14:14 : Whatever you ask in my name , I will do it , that the Father may be glorified in the Son ; if you ask anything in my name , I will do it .
In Matthew 18:19 : Again I say to you , if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask , it will be done for them by my Father in heaven .
For where two or three are gathered in my name , there am I in the midst of them .
Jesus is actually in our midst .
So he is right here already , supposedly .
Yet when we pray to him to physically materialize , as he did to hundreds of others , nothing happens .
Is n't it odd that Nothing happens , given the fact that Jesus promises us that something will happen ?
Is n't it odd that Nothing happens when , supposedly , Jesus is right here with us already , and materialization would be trivial for him ?
Is n't it odd that Nothing happens when , supposedly , Jesus was happy to appear to hundreds of others ?
What you will find , if you think about it , is that the situation we see here is the kind of unambiguous situation described Proof # 9 .
We have created a situation where coincidence cannot " answer " the prayer .
The only way for this prayer to be answered is for Jesus to actually , unambiguously , materialize .
In this situation , we also know that :
It is trivial for Jesus to materialize
There would be many benefits if Jesus did materialize Jesus has supposedly materialized to other human beings Jesus has promised to answer our prayer that he materialize
How do we explain the fact that this prayer goes unanswered , no matter who prays , despite Jesus ' promise that he will answer our prayers ?
As you think about this , you will realize that Paul 's story in the Bible is false .
Simply look at Paul 's story like any judge in a courtroom would .
What Paul 's story in 1 Cor 15 is suggesting is entirely unprecedented - a man dead three days with mortal wounds came back to life .
Yet there is no evidence that it is true , and there are many alternative explanations for what Paul is saying .
Paul could be fabricating the story , Paul could have hallucinated or dreamed the meeting , Paul could have seen an imposter , etc .
In addition , no one is seeing Jesus today , even though it would be trivial and obvious for Jesus to appear to people today just like he did with Paul , and Jesus promises in the Bible that he will answer our prayers .
What about Jesus ' famous statement in the Bible , " Happy are those who have not seen yet still believe " ?
What you realize is that this statement creates the perfect cover for a scam .
Let 's say you are Jesus , you are a normal human being , you realize that you are going to die ( everybody does ) and you want to cover for this fact .
Here is what you would say : " Happy are those who have not seen yet still believe . "
What you are saying is , " the way I am going to show you that I exist is by not showing that I exist . "
For every other object in the universe , the way that we know it exists is because the object provides evidence of its existence .
If there is no evidence for an object 's existence , we call it imaginary ( e.g. Leprechauns ) .
But with Jesus , the lack of evidence is turned into evidence .
Quite clever , but obviously a scam .
If the resurrection were true , then Jesus would be answering prayers as he promises in the Bible .
He would appear when people pray to see him .
The reason why he does not appear is simple : Both Jesus and God are imaginary .

With changes to Canada 's copyright laws expected as early as next month , these mundane 21st century activities could theoretically be open to prosecution — unless the Conservative government steps in with expanded " fair use " or " fair dealing " protections for consumers .
Close observers of the file say all signs point to a new regime that will improve safeguards for major music , film and media companies and artists for unpaid use of their material , but neglect to make exemptions for personal use of copyrighted content .
' About as market interventionist as you can get '
" We 're dealing with an industry minister [ Maxime Bernier ] that 's tried to extricate government from the telecom area with a very strong deregulatory focus , " said Michael Geist , the Canada Research Chair of Internet and E- commerce Law at the University of Ottawa .
" Yet the kind of copyright reform that is being contemplated is about as market interventionist as you can get . "
Amendments to the Copyright
Act are fraught with problems , since there are so many players with contradictory views .
Exacerbating the situation is intense pressure from the United States , where Canada is considered a rogue when it comes to copyright and intellectual property .
It still has n't ratified a 1997 World Intellectual Property Organization copyright treaty .
Sources say the new legislation is ready , but Bernier and Heritage Minister Bev Oda are struggling on final wording .
Two of the most controversial issues are called digital rights management and the closely related technological protection measures .
' People just assume it 's free '
Graham Henderson of the Canadian Recording Industry Association , one of Canada 's top lobbyists for stiffer copyright controls , notes that a variety of digital services have taken off in the United States and started to make up a large percentage of music revenues .
" In Canada , that 's not happening and it's not happening because we have a culture here where people just assume it's free , " said Henderson .
" It 's a big black market effect and so instead of 25 per cent [ of the market ] , it 's eight per cent here .
People are simply abandoning the marketplace altogether , and they 've made the decision they 'll just download the music and worry about how the artist gets paid later . "
Exemptions for consumers urged
But what does this mean for the consumer who legitimately buys a song or a film , and wants to use it on several different devices ?
Consumer advocates , such as Ottawa - based lawyer Howard Knopf , are urging the government to protect Canadians with wide exemptions in the Copyright Act for " fair use . "
As well , a group of Canadian musicians , including the Barenaked Ladies and Broken Social Scene , have come out against the technological protection measures , arguing they actually stifle creativity and their relationship with consumers .
Madeleine disappeared while her parents were at a nearby restaurant
Madeleine McCann 's parents , from Leicestershire , were at a restaurant near the Mark Warner Ocean Summer Club in Praia da Luz when she went missing .
Kate and Gerry McCann returned at about 2145 GMT to find an empty bed and the apartment door and window wide open .
The apartment has been cordoned off and local people are helping with a search .
' Devoted family '
Gill Renwick , a friend of the family , said Madeleine 's parents - both doctors - had been having a meal in a tapas restaurant a few hundred yards from the apartment and had been checking on the little girl and her younger brother and sister ( two - year - old twins ) every half hour .
" They 're a devoted family and love their children to bits .
They live for their children . "
Madeleine was reported missing at about 2200 BST on Thursday and tourists joined the police in an all - night search .
The McCann family had been holidaying with a larger group
Her aunt Trish Cameron , who lives in Glasgow , said she felt certain her niece had been abducted .
" They last checked at half past nine and they were all sound asleep , sleeping , windows shut , shutters shut .
" Kate went back at 10 o'clock to check .
The front door was lying open , the window had been tampered with , the shutters had been jemmied open or whatever you call it and Madeleine was missing ...
" She 's an absolutely beautiful , wee blonde girl , blue - green eyes - one distinguishing feature is that one of her pupils runs into the iris of her right eyes .
She 's an absolutely gorgeous wee girl . "
She added : " We feel that what 's been going on in Portugal has been ineffectual .
" My brother and sister - in - law are absolutely distraught . "
But the manager of the Mark Warner resort in Portugal , John Hill , said about 60 staff and guests at the complex had searched until 0430 GMT while police notified border police , Spanish police and airports .
Officers sealed off the area of the apartment for forensic checks and extra police teams were brought in from Lisbon .
' Sensitive case '
" As you can imagine Madeleine 's parents are distraught and not doing very well at all , " Mr Hill said .
" It 's still questionable as to whether it 's abduction , " he said .
" We are hoping that Madeleine is found as soon as possible and safe and well . "
The holiday firm has offered to fly other family members out to the resort .
A spokeswoman from the Portuguese police said they were being careful with the information being released .
" It is a sensitive case , it involves a child and we cannot give more information for now . "
The British Embassy confirmed it had been informed about the toddler 's disappearance .
The family was on holiday with a group of nine adults and eight children .
The toddler 's father is a consultant cardiologist at Leicester 's Glenfield Hospital .
Doug Skehan , another consultant cardiologist there , said : " ( Dr McGann ) is a popular hard working colleague , for whom we have great affection .
" The mood in the hospital is one of great concern and we hope that Kate and Gerry will have their daughter back very soon . "

Thrun is sitting in the passenger seat of a 2004 Volkswagen Touareg that 's trying to kill him .
The car hurtles down a rutted dirt road at 35 miles per hour somewhere in the Mojave Desert , bucking and swerving , kicking up a cloud of dust .
Thrun , the youngest person ever to head Stanford 's famed artificial intelligence laboratory , clings to an armrest .
Mike Montemerlo , a speed - coding computer programmer and postdoc , is wedged in the backseat amid a tangle of wires and cables .
No one is driving .
Or more precisely , the Touareg is trying to drive itself .
But despite 635 pounds of gear - roof - mounted radar , laser range finders , video cameras , a seven - processor shock - mounted computer - the car is doing a lousy job .
Thrun tightens his grip on the armrest .
He 's built plenty of robots , but he 's never entrusted his life to one of his creations .
He 's scared , confused , and above all furious that his algorithms are failing .
Suddenly the steering wheel spins itself hard to the left and the car speeds toward a ditch .
David Stavens , a programmer who is stationed in the driver 's seat in case of emergency , grabs the wheel and fights the pull of the robotic autopilot , which is insisting on a plunge into the gulley .
Stavens slams his foot down on the computer - controlled brake .
Thrun hits the big red button on the console that disables the vehicle 's navigation computers .
The SUV skids to a halt .
" Hey , that was exciting , " Thrun says , trying to sound upbeat .
It was n't supposed to be this way .
In 2003 , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency offered $ 1 million to anyone who could build a self - driving vehicle capable of navigating 300 miles of desert .
Dubbed the Grand Challenge , the robot - vehicle race was hyped for months .
It was going to be as important as the 1997 Kasparov - Deep Blue chess match .
But on race day in March 2004 , the cars performed like frightened animals .
One veered off the road to avoid a shadow .
The largest vehicle - a 15 - ton truck - mistook small bushes for enormous boulders and slowly backed away .
The favorite was a CMU team that , fueled by multimillion - dollar military grants , had been working on unmanned vehicles for two decades .
Its car went 7.4 miles , hit a berm , and caught fire .
Not a single car finished .
Back at Stanford ,
Thrun logged on to check the progress of the race and could n't believe what he was seeing .
It was a humiliation for the entire field of robotics - a field Thrun was now at the center of .
Only a year before , he'd been named head of Stanford 's AI program .
In the quiet halls of the university 's Gates Computer Science Building , the suntanned 36 - year - old German was a whirlwind of excitement , ideas , and brightly colored shirts .
He was determined to show what intelligent machines could contribute to society .
And though he had never considered building a self - driving car before , the sorry results of the first Grand Challenge inspired him to give it a try .
He assembled a first - rate team of researchers , attracted the attention of Volkswagen 's Palo Alto R&D team , and charged ahead .
But here in the desert , he 's facing the reality that the Touareg - dubbed Stanley , a nod to Stanford - is totally inadequate .
With only three months to go before the second Grand Challenge , he realizes that some basic problems remain unsolved .
Thrun gets out to kick the dirt on the side of the road and think .
While the car idles , he squints at the uneven terrain ahead .
This was his chance to lead the way toward his vision of the new vehicular order .
But for now , all he sees is mountains , sagebrush , and sky .
It started with a black - and - white videogame in 1979 .
Thrun , then 12 , was spending most of his free time at a local pub in Hannover , Germany .
The place had one of the first coin-operated videogames in town , and 20 pfennig bought him three lives driving at high speed through a stark landscape of oil slicks and oncoming cars .
It was thrilling - and much too expensive .
For weeks ,
Thrun scrutinized the graphics and then decided that he could re-create the game on his Northstar Horizon , a primitive home computer that his father , a chemical engineer , had bought for him .
He shut himself in his room and devoted his young life to coding the Northstar .
It ran at 4 MHz and had only 16 Kbytes of RAM , but somehow he coaxed a driving game out of the machine .
Though he did n't study or do much homework over the next seven years , Thrun ended up graduating near the top of his high school class .
He was n't sure what was next .
He figured he'd think about it during his mandatory two - year stint in the German army .
But on Juneé15 , 1986 - the last day to apply for university admissions - military authorities told him he would n't be needed that year .
Two hours later , he arrived at the centralized admission headquarters in Dortmund with only 20 minutes to file his application .
The woman behind the counter asked him what he wanted to study - in Germany , students declare a major before arriving on campus .
He looked down the list of options : law , medicine , engineering , and computer science .
Though he did n't know much about computer science , he had fond memories of programming his Northstar .
" Why not ? " he thought , and decided his future by checking the box next to computer science .
Within five years , he was a rising star in the field .
After posting perfect scores on his final undergraduate exams , he went on to graduate school at the University of Bonn , where he wrote a paper showing for the first time how a robotic cart , in motion , could balance a pole .
It revealed an instinct for creating robots that taught themselves .
He went on to code a bot that mapped obstacles in a nursing home and then alerted its elderly user to dangers .
He programmed robots that slithered into abandoned mines and came back hours later with detailed maps of the interior .
Roboticists in the US began to take note .
Carnegie Mellon offered the 31 - year - old a faculty position and then gave him an endowed chair .
But he still had n't found a research area to focus all his energy and skills on .
While Thrun was settling in at CMU , the hot topic in robotics was self - driving cars .
The field was led by Ernst Dickmanns , a professor of aerospace technology at the University of the Bundeswehr .
He liked to point out that planes had been flying themselves since the 1970s .
The public was clearly willing to accept being flown by autopilot , but nobody had tried the same on the ground .
Dickmanns decided to do something about that .
With help from the German military and Daimler - Benz , he spent seven years retrofitting a boxy Mercedes van , equipping it with video cameras and a bunch of early Intel processors .
On a Daimler - Benz test track in December 1986 , the driverless van accelerated to 20 miles per hour and , using data supplied by the videocams , successfully stayed on a curving road .
Though generally forgotten , this was the Kitty Hawk moment of autonomous driving .
It sparked a 10 - year international dash to develop self - driving cars that could navigate city streets and freeways .
In the US , engineers at Carnegie Mellon led the charge with funding from the Army .
On both sides of the Atlantic , the approach involved a data - intensive classification approach , a so - called rule - based system .
The researchers assembled a list of easily identifiable objects ( solid white lines , dotted white lines , trees , boulders ) and told the car what to do when it encountered them .
Before long , though , two main problems emerged .
First , processing power was anemic , so the vehicle 's computer quickly became overwhelmed when confronted with too much data ( a boulder beside a tree , for instance ) .
The car would slow to a crawl while trying to apply all the rules .
Second , the team could n't code for every combination of conditions .
The real world of streets , intersections , alleys , and highways was too complex .
In 1991 , a CMU computer science PhD student named Dean Pomerleau had a critical insight .
The best way to teach cars to drive , he suspected , was to have them learn from the experts : humans .
He got behind the wheel of CMU 's sensor - covered , self - driving Humvee , flipped on all the computers , and ran a program that tracked his reactions as he sped down a freeway in Pittsburgh .
In minutes , the computers had developed algorithms that codified Pomerleau 's driving decisions .
He then let the Humvee take over .
It calmly maneuvered itself on Pittsburgh 's interstates at 55 miles per hour .
Everything worked perfectly until Pomerleau got to a bridge .
The Humvee swerved dangerously , and he was forced to grab the wheel .
It took him weeks of analyzing the data to figure out what had gone wrong :
When he was " teaching " the car to drive , he had been on roads with grass alongside them .
The computer had determined that this was among the most important factors in staying on the road :
Keep the grass at a certain distance and all will be well .
When the grass suddenly disappeared , the computer panicked .
It was a fundamental problem .
In the mid-'90s , microchips were n't fast enough to process all the potential options , especially not at 55 miles per hour .
In 1996 , Dickmanns proclaimed that real - world autonomous driving could " only be realized with the increase in computer performance … With Moore 's law still valid , this means a time period of more than one decade . "
He was right , and everyone knew it .
Research funding dried up , programs shut down , and autonomous driving receded back to the future .
Eight years later , when Darpa held its first Grand Challenge , processors had in fact become 25 times faster , outpacing Moore 's law .
Highly accurate GPS instruments had also become widely available .
Laser sensors were more reliable and less expensive .
Most of the conditions Dickmanns had said were necessary had been met or exceeded .
More than 100 contestants signed up , including a resurgent CMU squad .
Darpa officials could n't hide their excitement .
The breakthrough moment in autonomous driving was , they thought , at hand .
In truth , some of the field 's biggest challenges had yet to be overcome .
Once
Thrun decided to take a crack at the second Grand Challenge , he found himself consumed by the project .
It was as though he were 12 again , shut up in his room , coding driving games .
But this time a Northstar home computer was n't going to cut it .
He needed serious hardware and a sturdy vehicle .
That 's when he got a call from Cedric Dupont , a scientist at Volkswagen 's Electronics Research Laboratory , just a few miles from the Stanford campus .
The Volkswagen researchers wanted in on the Grand Challenge .
They 'd heard that Thrun was planning to enter the event , and they offered him three Touaregs - one to race , another as a backup , and a third for spare parts .
The VW lab would outfit them with steering , acceleration , and braking control systems custom - built to link to Thrun 's computers .
Thrun had his vehicle , and Volkswagen executives had a chance to be part of automotive history .
It was history , however , that Red Whittaker planned on writing himself .
Whittaker , the imposing , bald , bombastic chief of CMU 's eponymously named Red Team , had been working on self - driving vehicles since the ' 80s .
Whittaker 's approach to problem solving was to use as much technological and automotive firepower as possible .
Until now , the firepower had n't been enough .
This time , he would make sure that it was .
First , he entered two vehicles in the race : a 1986 Humvee and a 1999 Hummer .
Both were chosen for their ruggedness .
Whittaker also stabilized the sensors on the trucks with gyroscopes to ensure more reliable data .
Then he sent three men in a laser - studded , ground - scanning truck into the desert for 28 days .
Their mission : create a digital map of the race area 's topography .
The team logged 2,000 miles and built a detailed model of the desolate sagebrush expanses of the Mojave .
That was only the beginning .
The Red Team purchased high - resolution satellite imagery of the desert and , when Darpa revealed the course on race day , Whittaker had 12 analysts in a tent beside the start line scrutinize the terrain .
The analysts identified boulders , fence posts , and ditches so that the two vehicles would not have to wonder whether a fence was a fence .
Humans would have already coded it into the map .
The CMU team also used Pomerleau 's approach .
They drove their Humvees through as many different types of desert terrain as they could find in an attempt to teach the vehicles how to handle varied environments .
Both SUVs boasted seven Intel M processors and 40 Gbytes of flash memory - enough to store a world road atlas .
CMU had a budget of $ 3 million .
Given enough time , manpower , and access to the course , the CMU team could prepare their vehicles for any environment and drive safely through it .
It did n't cut it .
Despite that 28 - day , 2,000 - mile sojourn in the desert , CMU 's premapping operation overlapped with only 2 percent of the actual race course .
The vehicles had to rely on their desert training sessions .
But even those did n't fully deliver .
A robot might , for example , learn what a tumbleweed looks like at 10 am , but with the movement of the sun and changing shadows , it might mistake that same tumbleweed for a boulder later in the day .
Thrun faced these same problems .
Small bumps would rattle the Touareg 's sensors , causing the onboard computer to swerve away from an imagined boulder .
It could n't distinguish between sensor error , new terrain , its own shadow , and the actual state of the road .
The robot just was n't smart enough .
And then , as Thrun sat on the side of that rutted dirt road , an idea came to him .
Maybe the problem was a lot simpler than everyone had been making it out to be .
To date , cars had not critically assessed the data their sensors gathered .
Researchers had instead devoted themselves to improving the quality of that data , either by stabilizing cameras , lasers , and radar with gyroscopes or by improving the software that interpreted the sensor data .
Thrun realized that if cars were going to get smarter , they needed to appreciate how incomplete and ambiguous perception can be .
They needed the algorithmic equivalent of self - awareness .
Together with Montemerlo , his lead programmer , Thrun set about recoding Stanley 's brain .
They asked the computer to assess each pixel of data generated by the sensors and then assign it an accuracy value based on how a human drove the car through the desert .
Rather than logging the identifying characteristics of the terrain , the computer was told to observe how its interpretation of the road either conformed to or varied from the way a human drove .
The robot began to discard information it had previously accepted - it realized , for instance , that the bouncing of its sensors was just turbulence and did not indicate the sudden appearance of a boulder .
It started to ignore shadows and accelerated along roads it had once perceived as being crisscrossed with ditches .
Stanley began to drive like a human .
Thrun decided to take the car 's newfound understanding of the world a step further .
Stanley was equipped with two main types of sensors : laser range finders and video cameras .
The lasers were good at sensing ground within 30 meters of the car , but beyond that the data quality deteriorated .
The video camera was good at looking farther away but was less accurate in the foreground .
Maybe ,
Thrun thought , the laser 's findings could inform how the computer interpreted the faraway video .
If the laser identified drivable road , it could ask the video to search for similar patterns ahead .
In other words , the computer could teach itself .
It worked .
Stanley 's vision extended far down the road now , allowing it to steer confidently at speeds of up to 45 miles per hour on dirt roads in the desert .
And because of its ability to question its own data , the accuracy of Stanley 's perception improved by four orders of magnitude .
Before the recoding , Stanley incorrectly identified objects 12 percent of the time .
After the recoding , the error rate dropped to 1 in 50,000 .
It 's half past 6 in the morning on October 8 , 2005 , outside of Primm , Nevada .
Twenty - three vehicles are here for the second Grand Challenge .
Festooned with corporate logos , lasers , radars , GPS transponders , and video cameras , they 're parked on the edge of the gray - brown desert and ready to roll .
The early morning light clashes with the garish glow of the nearby Buffalo Bill 's Resort and Casino .
Red Whittaker is beaming .
His 12 terrain analysts have completed their two - hour premapping of the route , and the data has been uploaded to the two CMU vehicles via a USB flash drive .
The stakes are high this year : Darpa has doubled the prize money to $ 2 million , and Whittaker is ready to win it and erase the memory of the 2004 debacle .
Last night , he pointed out to the press that Thrun had been a junior faculty member in Whittaker 's robotics lab at CMU .
" My DNA is all over this race , " he boasted .
Thrun wo n't be baited by Whittaker 's grandstanding .
He focuses on trying to calm his own frayed nerves .
The race begins quietly :
One by one , the vehicles drive off into the hills .
A few hours later , the critical moment is captured in grainy footage .
CMU 's H1 is in the middle of a dusty white desert expanse .
The camera slowly approaches - the image is pixelated and overexposed .
It 's the view from Stanley 's rooftop camera .
For the past 100 miles , the Touareg has been tailgating the H1 , and now it pulls close .
Its lasers scan the exterior of its competitor , revealing a ghostly green outline of side panels and a giant , sensor - stabilizing gyroscope .
And then the VW rotates its steering wheel and passes .
Darpa has imposed speed limits of 5 to 25 miles per hour , depending on conditions .
Stanley wants to go faster .
Its lasers are constantly teaching its video cameras how to identify drivable terrain , and it knows that it could accelerate more .
For the rest of the race , Stanley pushes up against the speed limits as it navigates through open desert and curving mountain roads .
After six hours of driving , it exits the final mountain pass ahead of every other team .
When Stanley crosses the finish line , Thrun catches his first sight of an undiscovered country , a place where robots do all the driving .
The 128 - mile race is a success .
Four other vehicles , including both of CMU 's entries , complete the course behind Stanley .
The message is clear : Autonomous vehicles have arrived , and Stanley is their prophet .
" This is a watershed moment - much more so than Deep Blue versus Kasparov , " says Justin Rattner , Intel 's R&D director .
" Deep Blue was just processing power .
It did n't think .
Stanley thinks .
We 've moved away from rule - based thinking in artificial intelligence .
The new paradigm is based on probabilities .
It 's based on statistical analysis of patterns .
It is a better reflection of how our minds work . "
The breakthrough comes just as carmakers are embracing a host of self - driving technologies , many of them barely recognizable as robotic .
Take , for example , a new feature known as adaptive cruise control , which allows the driver to select the distance to be maintained between the vehicle and the car in front of it .
On the Toyota Sienna minivan , this is simply another button on the steering wheel .
What that button represents , however , is a laser that surveys the distance to the vehicle ahead of it .
The minivan 's computer interprets the data and then controls the acceleration and braking to keep the distance constant .
The computer has , in essence , taken over part of the driving .
But even as vehicles are being produced with sensors that perceive the world , they have , until now , lacked the intelligence to comprehensively interpret what they see .
Thanks to Thrun , that problem is being solved .
Computers are nearly ready to take the wheel .
But are humans ready to let them ?
Jay Gowdy does n't think so .
A highly regarded roboticist , he has worked for nearly two decades to build self - driving cars , first with CMU and , more recently , with SAIC , a Fortune 500 defense contractor .
He notes that in the US , about 43,000 people die in traffic accidents every year .
Robot - driven cars would radically reduce the number of fatalities , he says , but there would still be accidents , and those deaths would be attributable to computer error .
" The perception is that in the majority of accidents today , those who die are drunk , lazy , or stupid and bring it on themselves , " Gowdy says .
" If computers take over the driving , any deaths are likely to be perceived as the loss of people who did nothing wrong . "
The resulting liability issues are a major hurdle .
If a robotically driven car gets in an accident , who is to blame ?
If a software bug causes a car to swerve off the road , should the programmer be sued , or the manufacturer ?
Or is the accident victim at fault for accepting the driving decisions of the onboard computer ?
Would Ford or GM be to blame for selling a " faulty " product , even if , in the larger view , that product reduced traffic deaths by tens of thousands ?
This morass of liability questions would need to be addressed before robot cars could be practical .
And even then , Americans would have to be willing to give up control of the steering wheel .
Which is not something they 're likely to do , even if it means saving 40,000 lives a year .
So the challenge for carmakers will be to develop interfaces that make people feel like they 're in control even when the car is really doing most of the thinking .
In other words , that small adaptive cruise control button in Toyota 's minivan is a Trojan horse .
" OK , we 're two of two , two of two , and one of one , no U - turn , speed advisory 25 , large divider , POI gas station on left . "
Michael Loconte and Bill Wong are creeping through a quiet suburb just north of San Jose , California .
They are driving a white Ford Taurus with a 6 - inch antenna on the roof .
Loconte wears a headset and mumbles coded descriptions of theésurroundings into the microphone - " two of two " means that he's in the right lane on a street with two lanes , and " POI " means point of interest .
Wong scribbles with a digital pen , making landmark and street address notations on a scrolling map .
" People think we 're with the CIA , " Loconte says .
" I know it kind of looks like that . "
But they are n't spies .
They 're field analysts working for the GPS mapping company Navteq , and they 're laying the foundation for the future of driving .
On this Friday afternoon , they 're doing a huge commercial extension of CMU 's ditch - and - fence mapping operation .
Navteq has 500 such analysts driving US neighborhoods , mapping them foot by foot .
Though Thrun has proven that extensive mapping is n't needed to get from A to B , maps are critical when it comes to communicating with robotic vehicles .
As automotive engineers build cars with increasing autonomy , the human interface with the vehicle will migrate from the steering wheel to the map .
Instead of turning a wheel , drivers will make decisions by touching destinations on an interactive display .
" We want to move up the food chain , " says Bob Denaro , Navteq 's VP of business development .
The company sees itself moving beyond the help - me - I 'm - lost gizmo business and into the center of the new driving experience .
That 's not to say that the steering wheel will disappear ; it will just be gradually de-emphasized .
We will continue to sit in the driver 's seat and have the option of intervening if we choose .
As Denaro notes : " A person 's role in the car is changing .
People will become more planners than drivers . "
And why not - since the car is going to be a better driver than a human anyway .
With the addition of map information , a car will know the angle of a turn that 's still 300 feet away .
Navteq is in the process of collecting slope information , road width , and speed limits - all things that bathe the vehicle in more data than a human could ever handle .
Denaro believes that the key to making people comfortable with the shift from driver to planner will be the same thing that made pilots comfortable accepting autopilot in the cockpit : situational awareness .
If a robot simply says it wants to go left instead of right , we feel uncomfortable .
But if a map showed a traffic jam to the right and the machine listed reasons for rerouting , then we would have no problem pressing the Accept Route Change icon .
We feel like we are still in control .
" Autopilot in the cockpit greatly extended the pilots ' skills , " Denaro says .
Automation in driving will do the same thing .

Thrun is standing in front of about a hundred of his colleagues and teammates at a winery overlooking Silicon Valley .
He has a glass of champagne in one hand and a microphone in the other , and everyone is in a festive mood .
Darpa just gave Stanford a $ 2 million check for winning the desert race , and Thrun is going to use a portion of the money to endow the Stanley fellowship for graduate students in computer science .
" Some people refer to us as the Wright brothers , " he says , holding up his champagne .
" But I prefer to think of us as Charles Lindbergh , because he was better - looking . "
Everyone laughs and toasts to that .
" A year ago , people said this could n't be done , " Thrun continues .
" Now everything is possible . "
There is more applause , and then the AI experts , programmers , and engineers take small , conservative sips of the champagne .
The drive home is curvy and dark .
If only the party were happening in Thrun 's future - then the champagne could flow unimpeded and the cars would take everyone safely home .
How Stanley Sees the Road
The SUV's hard drives boot up , its censors come to life , and it 's ready to roll .
Here 's how Stanley works .
- J.D.
1. GPS antenna
The rooftop GPS antenna receives data that has actually traveled twice into space - once to receive an initial position that is accurate up to a meter , and a second time to make corrections .
The final reading is accurate up to 1 centimeter .
2. Laser Range Finder
So - called lidar scans the terrain 30 meters ahead and to either side of the grill five times a second .
The data is used to build a map of the road .
3. Video camera
The video camera scans the road beyond the lidar 's range and pipes the data back to the computer .
If the lasers have identified drivable ground , software looks for the same characteristics in the video data , extending Stanley 's vision to 80 meters and permitting safe acceleration .
4. Odometry
To contend signals blocked by , say , a tunnel or mountain , a photo sensor in the wheel well monitors a pattern imprinted on Stanley 's wheels .
The data is used to determine how far Stanley has moved since the blackout .
The onboard computer can then track the vehicle 's position based on its last known GPS location .

Seven ways today 's cars are already robots .
- Brian Lam
1. Road Condition Reporting
When a car using BMW 's hazard system slips on ice , its sensors activate traction control .
Meantime , wireless technology alerts other cars in the area to the hazard .
2. Adaptive Cruise Control
Luxury cars made by Audi , BMW , Infiniti , and others now use radar - guided cruise control to keep pace with the car ahead .
3. Omnidirectional Collision System
GM has built an inexpensive collision detection system that allows GPS - equipped cars to identify each other and communicate wirelessly .
4. Lane - Departure Prevention
Nissan has a prototype that uses cameras and software to detect white lines and reflective markers .
If the system determines the vehicle is drifting , it will steer the car back into the proper lane .
5. Auto Parallel Park
Toyota has a technology that uses a camera to identify a curbside parking space and turns the wheel automatically to reverse you into the spot .
6. Blind -Spot Sensors
GM 's GPS - based collision detectors can warn you when another car enters your blind spot .
7. Corner Speed
An experimental Honda navigation computer anticipates upcoming turns and , if necessary , slows the vehicle to match predetermined safe speeds .

US forgets to build housing for reconstruction staff in Iraq Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday May 16 , 2007 Print This Email
This The State Department has failed to build enough housing in its new embassy in Baghdad to accommodate key staff dealing with the reconstruction of Iraq and other tasks .
The staff members must currently live in poorly secured housing that is not protected from attacks originating outside of the Green Zone .
The report appears in today 's Washington Post .
" Problem seems to be that the original plans did n't account for hundreds of staff working in reconstruction , development , the inspector general 's office and other security programs , who , though considered temporary , will need , at least for a few years , somewhere to live , " writes Al Kamen in his " In The Loop " column .
Kamen adds that the embassy staff are currently living in housing that is not secured from terrorist attacks .
" Embassy employees , now living in trailers with no overhead protection , are getting increasingly jittery over mortar and rocket attacks , " he writes .
" New guidelines tell them to wear helmets and flak jackets when walking in the open .
But some employees , sleeping in those tin-can trailers , apparently would actually like to take off the helmets and jackets while they 're in bed . "
The Post columnist seems to suggest that the Department of State could be hearing about the oversight in the near - term .
" Worst of all , there 's no provision for rooms for congressional delegations or other distinguished guests coming to shop in the famed markets , " he wrote .

AMERICA ’S MORAL standing in the world has precipitously declined since 2001 .
For starters , blame the Bush administration ’s go - it - alone tough talk after 9/11 , contempt for the Kyoto accord , war and then chaos in Iraq , secret prisons in Europe and alleged use of torture at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Democrats would have you believe that a new team -- theirs -- in Washington would change all this .
Not so fast .
Around the world , anti-Americanism is not simply the result of anger about President Bush ’s foreign policies .
Rather , it is deeply entrenched antipathy accumulated over decades .
It may take generations to undo .
Consider the causes :
* Cold War legacy : U.S. intervention in Vietnam , and covert attempts to overthrow governments in Iran , Guatemala and Cuba , among others , created profound distrust of U.S. motives throughout the developing world .
Europeans also disdain these policies and bemoan the cultural coarseness of Americanization sweeping their continent .
Advertisement
Americans , by contrast , tend to dismiss this side of the Cold War .
Gore Vidal famously referred to this country as the United States of Amnesia .
We ’re all about moving forward , getting over it , a nation of immigrants for whom leaving the past behind was a geographic , psychological and often political act .
As the last guy standing when the Cold War ended , in 1989 , we expected the world to embrace free markets and liberal democracy .
* Power and powerlessness : Power generates resentment .
But the United States has lost the ability to see its power from the perspective of those with less of it .
In Latin America , for example , U.S. policies -- whether on trade , aid , democracy , drugs or immigration -- presumed that Latin Americans would automatically see U.S. interests as their own .
And when denied deference , we sometimes lash out , as did Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld when he lumped Germany , a close U.S. ally , with Cuba and Libya because Berlin opposed the Iraq war .
* Globalization :
In the 1990s , our government , private sector and opinion makers sold globalization as virtually synonymous with Americanization .
President Clinton promised that open markets , open societies and smaller government would be the bridge to the 21st century .
So where globalization has n’t delivered , the U.S. is blamed .
* What we stand for : Bush is wrong to say that foreigners hate us because of our values and freedoms .
Quite the contrary .
U.S. credibility abroad used to be reinforced by the perception that our laws and government programs gave most Americans a fair chance to participate in a middle - class meritocracy .
But the appeal of the U.S. model overseas is eroding as the gap between rich and poor widens , public education deteriorates , healthcare costs soar and pensions disappear .
Most recently , the U.S. government ’s seeming indifference to its most vulnerable citizens in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina further undercut belief in the American social contract .
The immigration debates also have fostered the perception that the U.S. is vulnerable , hostile and fearful .
Advertisement
Nevertheless , the ideal of the United States as a beacon of justice , democracy , freedom and human rights still garners grudging respect abroad .
Despite the perverse appeal of anti-Americanism , its proliferation hurts not only the U.S. but global security .
For all the resentments that U.S. leadership generates , in the absence of an appealing alternative , it remains a much - desired resource .
That ’s why the U.S. could still get its global groove back .
But there is no quick fix .
Liberals tempted to out - Bush Bush in the battle against terrorism risk sowing the seeds of a future backlash in the developing world .
The U.S. will be no less powerful in the eyes of powerless nations if Democrats win control of Congress in November .
Harsh global competition is n’t going away either .
As a result , the wellsprings of anti-Americanism will not dry up anytime soon .
But anti-Americanism will begin to ebb if the new watchwords of U.S. policy and conduct are pragmatism , generosity , modesty , discretion , cooperation , empathy , fairness , manners and lawfulness .
This softer lexicon should not be construed as a refutation of the use of force against hostile states or terrorist groups .
Rather , a foreign policy that deploys U.S. power with some consideration for how the U.S. is perceived will gradually make legitimate U.S. military action more acceptable abroad .
Personalities do matter .
And not just the president ’s .
The global initiatives of private American citizens -- Bill Gates , Warren Buffett , Gordon Moore , Angelina Jolie , Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg -- carry the kind of message that government - sponsored public diplomacy can’t match .
Advertisement
And symbols matter too .
We should close Guantanamo .
Recovering our global standing will come not only from how we fight or prevent the next war , or manage an increasingly chaotic world .
Domestic policy must change as well .
Steering the body politic out of its insular mood , reducing social and economic inequalities , and decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels will help improve our moral standing and our security .
US soldier deletes AP photographer 's photos , threatens violence
Following a suicide bombing and ensuing gunfight between Afghan militants and American soldiers on Sunday , a US soldier demanded that an Associated Press photographer delete his photos .
The photographer , Rahmat Gul , did not witness the suicide attack or the gun battle , reports the AP , but was in the vicinity .
Gul and a video cameraman working for AP Television News were taking pictures of a vehicle inside which four people had been shot to death when a US soldier demanded that Gul delete his photos .
The report continues , " Gul said he later received permission to take photos from another soldier , but that the first soldier came back and angrily told him to delete the photos again .
Gul said the soldier then raised his fist as if he was going to strike Gul . "
The US military did not comment on the matter .
One common denominator in kids who cut themselves is an inability to express their feelings .
They either never learned how to do it or were invalidated when they tried .
They have gotten the idea , possibly from an abusive home life though not always , that certain feelings are wrong and not to be articulated .
They may have not had a role model for coping with troubling situations in a healthy way .
Cutting also gives the child a great sense of control .
Some kids do it as a form of self - punishment , but this is n't always the case .
Many cutters use it to express feelings that there are no words for .
Some kids are predisposed toward this kind of behavior and it may take very little to set it off .
Serotonin may be involved in making some kids more aggressive and impulsive than others , therefore more likely to self - mutilate .
Once a kid tries the behavior and realizes the immense stress relief it provides , it may seem like a good idea for the next time the child is under stress .
Cutting is not done , as frequently believed , to " fit in " or to garner attention .
Many teens will go to great lengths to hide the effects of the behavior in an attempt to avoid adding shame to their already fragile mental state .

Computing probabilities is one thing , understanding how and why questions of a probablisitic nature give rise to their resulting probabilities is another .
Consider , for example , the boys / girls riddle " Given that a family with two children has a boy , what is the probability that the other child is a girl ? "
It is not difficult to express this problem in PFP and compute the answer ( see the file Boys.hs in the distribution ) .
However , the result , namely 2/3 , is unintuitive to many , and an explanation why this answer is correct is not part of the computation .
The idea of Explanation - Oriented Programming addresses this problem by shifting the focus to the design of languages that not just produce results but explanations of how these results are obtained .
The explanation of probablistic reasoning is specifically addressed in the following two papers .

The famous Israeli diplomat Abba Eban once quipped that “ the Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity [ for peace ] . ”
With Israel ’s refusal to - date to accept the recently re-tabled Saudi Peace initiative offering Israel peace with the entire Arab World , it seems that it may be Israel this time that is guilty of Abban ’s charge .
For years there has been no substantive progress concerning the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
The Israeli position has been that there is no “ viable ” partner from the Palestinian side to negotiate with .
It seems as though the tide has changed in dramatic fashion over the course of the past few months .
Much of this is due to the assertion of the Saudis as the regional diplomatic powerhouse .
In February , Saudi King Abdullah helped facilitate the Mecca agreement between Fatah and Hamas that put an end to the internecine factional violence between the two parties .
The Arab League summit , hosted in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , reinvigorated the previously inert Saudi Initiative .
This is a window of opportunity that Israel must seize ; all 22 Arab countries are willing to normalize relations with Israel in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the Arab territories it occupied since 1967 .
So what is the problem ?
Israel is not willing to negotiate with the new Palestinian Unity Government that includes Hamas because it has yet to meet the Quartet ’s ( composed of the E.U , U.N. , U.S. , and Russia ) conditions ( recognize Israel , renounce violence , respect all previous agreements ) .
Furthermore , despite some positive pronouncements , Israel refuses to accept the Saudi Initiative because of clauses regarding the Palestinian refuges and borders .
This refusal is unwarranted because while the Initiative does call for a sovereign , independent Palestinian state with its capital in Arab East Jerusalem , it does so on the basis of the internationally recognized 1967 borders .
In terms of the Palestinian refugees , it calls for a “ just ” and “ agreed upon ” solution to the refugee problem .
Equally critical , the Arab League Initiative has stated that as long as Israel accepts the Initiative “ In Principle ” , then everything is open for negotiations
Israel ’s refusal to negotiate is contradictory to American economic interests and Israeli security interests .
By achieving regional peace , Israel can finally be fully integrated into the Middle East .
The Palestinians will have their state and the Israelis the security they have been unable to achieve since Israel ’s establishment .
One need only look at the Recent G.C.C. ( the Gulf Cooperative Council ) involvement in major economic outreach programs with Asian countries , such as India and China , to realize the economic potential of peace .
Billions of dollars are flowing back and forth between the oil rich Gulf States and Asia .
Instead of exploiting the new opportunity for peace presented by the Saudi Initiative , for peace in the region and a new epoch of economic prosperity for all parties involved , Israel is sitting on its diplomatic hands waiting for the ever important “ pre-conditions ” to be met .
The onus is often put on increasing weakness of the Olmert administration and its lack of political capital .
Yet , a majority of Israel citizens desire a two - state solution .
There is no other act that an Israeli Prime Minister could perform to galvanize more internal support .
For the U.S. , a serious and meaningful role as an honest mediator in the peace process could repair its dwindled and demonized image in the Middle East and Muslim world , with all the attendant benefits of Arab cooperation on Iraq .
King Abdullah is not calling for the Israelis to simply sign the Saudi Initiative .
Negotiations are expected over the Palestinian refugees , East Jerusalem and final borders before a final agreement is reached .
Israel ’s continuous claim that it wants peace stands tested by whether it accepts the Saudi Initiative in principle as the framework for a regional peace agreement .
The U.S. stands at a fork in the Mid-East and the path it chooses will have serious ramifications on its national security and future economic opportunities in the region .
Using our influence with our number one ally in the Middle East to reconsider the Saudi Initiative is our best hope today for securing both our interests and peace .

The Mongolian state on May 12th imposed what it has termed a " windfall profits " tax on mining carried out in that country .
The law constitutes a 68 % tax on profits from mineral sales when the copper and gold price are above US $ 1.18 a pound and US $ 500 per ounce respectively .
This tax is so punitive that its imposition is tantamount to nationalization .
Regardless of its intention , the new tax will destroy investment in mineral exploration and development in Mongolia .
It caused investor concern and net selling of Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. ( " Ivanhoe " ) , a Canadian firm listed on the Toronto , New York , and NASDAQ stock exchanges , which has found and developed a large resource of copper and gold in the remote hinterland of Mongolia .
To date Ivanhoe has spent over 370 million dollars on the project and has completed a preliminary assessment of the economics of mining , refining , and marketing the copper and gold .
The assessment shows that such an undertaking should be economic , but that it will require an initial capital investment of over US $ 2 billion .
There is no existing infrastructure such as power , railways , roads , or water resources , which will all need to be developed .
The tax represents the common view that mining companies are profiteering from a non-renewable resource — copper — which is transported away by foreign mining companies with little benefit to the inhabitants of the country where it was extracted .
This is a strong emotional argument largely emanating from the government proposing the bill , which would undoubtedly benefit politically by being able to dispense the proceeds of the royalty .
The problem with this argument is that it serves to discredit the benefit that people in places like Mongolia would receive from the development of natural resources , the costs of hindering development through taxation , the potential that it holds for them , and the risk undertaken by the mining industry that allowed for the benefit , not to mention the benefits locals would enjoy from any future mines that could be found .
Mining undertakes to provide the raw materials for many other industries with considerably higher risk .
An Overview of Mineral Exploration and Mine Development
Metal production and use is not new to modern times .
Civilizations have been measured by the metals that are produced and used ( i.e. , the Bronze and Iron Ages ) .
After more than five thousand years of recorded mining and metal use , prospectors have scoured the earth and discovered practically all exposed concentrations of metal in an effort to fill the demand .
Today finding a potential site to evaluate for mineral potential means having to go to some of the remotest areas of the planet , or using more advanced technology to evaluate the potential for unexposed mineralization .
Over the last 4,030 years , in response to increased demand and a dearth of easy - to - find mineral deposits , various technologies have been developed to guide the geologist in exploring areas where mineralization is not exposed .
This technology includes the science of geology itself where a wealth of information has evolved from the scientific study of mineral deposits and how they form .
This massive investment in knowledge now allows geologists to make predictions about where mineralization might occur beneath the surface .
Despite these developments , mineral exploration remains one of the riskiest of business ventures , based simply on the complexities of nature and the rarity of zones of concentrated metal .
Mineral value cannot be quantified until core samples are taken through a process called drilling , which enables mineral content to be evaluated in three dimensions .
Today geologists spend their efforts interpreting layers of expensively acquired scientific data and geological observations , evaluating hundreds of potential targets just to find an area prospective enough to risk the expense of drilling .
This expense dictates that many areas are evaluated that are never evaluated by drilling .
For every 500 to 1,000 mineral showings that are tested by drilling , one mineral deposit with sufficient value to mine is discovered .
[ 1 ]
This reality means that most mineral exploration companies never find a mine with the venture capital money they raise and spend .
The risk does not end with discovery , however .
Subsequent to the identification of a mineral resource many other factors have to be considered .
To determine the viability of a mining operation , a feasibility study is conducted , which considers costs of construction of the mine , including roads , power , and water supply .
Often the metallurgy , or the ability to extract the metal from the rock , render a mineral deposit uneconomical to mine due to the way the metal is naturally occurring in the rock .
There are the costs of mining , milling , and refining the ore and transporting the metal to the consumer .
There may be a cost in removing rock that is barren in order to access the mineral - bearing rock .
These costs often depend on the remoteness of the proposed mine and the access to preexisting infrastructure .
If the deposit still appears to be economical to mine , political risks and environmental costs need to be considered .
Many well financed NGO's are committed to stopping mining development and become active opponents to a proposed mine .
A significant investment in public relations is then required to combat negative public opinion .
This can be tantamount to bribery as the most successful mining firms settle with NGO 's by hiring them to conduct their local charity and environmental work programs .
In addition , government environmental regulations require that companies spend large amounts of money in the feasibility stage to determine environmental impact and to put significant money aside to rehabilitate the mine when production ceases .
Sentiments in the mining companies ' countries of origin demand that the companies invest in the local communities in the form of humanitarian aid , including the construction of schools and drilling of water wells in local communities .
Finally metal prices need to be considered and predicted over the life of the proposed mine .
Many mines have been rendered uneconomical by an unforeseen change in the price of metals .
Should the proposed mine pass this scrutiny and the government legislation described above , the money needs to be raised from investors to undertake the venture .
Few of the largest mining companies in the world have the funds to construct a mine and , as a result , do debt financing with large banks .
For example , the Antamina Copper - Zinc mine in Peru was recently put into production by a consortium of companies at a cost of US $ 2.2 billion , 1.3 billion of which was financed by bank loans . [ 2 ]
This money went towards construction costs as well as new infrastructure such as a port facility , 76 kilometers of new road , a new pipeline , 58 kilometers of new power line , and a switching station .
Costs also included environmental studies required to acquire over 300 government permits .
[ 2 ]
The mine is currently in operation and has a labor force of over 1,400 people only 28 of which are foreign staff .
Estimates of the time to pay back the entire investment vary up to 10 years of the projected 19 - year mine life .
These estimates depend on metal prices and assume that a hurricane wo n't destroy any infrastructure — and that the government wo n't decide to nationalize the mine .
Over the last 25 years , mining companies have had profits of about 5 % on average , which are net of costs and payments on loans . [ 3 ]
A profit margin of 5 % means that to get the metal out of the ground it costs on average 95 % of the value of the metal produced .
By far the largest shares of the costs are labor , power , and services .
The goods and services needed by a new mine are prolific in scale and encompass jobs such as mechanics , computer technicians , drivers , engineers , and cooks , all representing new economies created by the mine .
It should be noted that before the debts are repaid the profit , net of debt payments , is subject to the corporate income tax rate that exists .
BHP Billiton Ltd. , one of the largest mining companies in the world , paid US $ 1.5 billion in taxes to the Chilean government over the past 15 years .
[ 4 ]
Any profits that remain , the owners of the company keep .
To use BHP Billiton Ltd. as an example again , in 2001 the company paid US $ 751 million in dividends to the owners of the company : 298,000 shareholders , including pension funds that represent millions of people worldwide . [ 5 ]
The new infrastructure benefits many Peruvians in immeasurable ways , whether it is increased access to electricity , healthcare , and education , much reduced costs to any new mineral deposits found in the area , or other business ventures that might otherwise have been uneconomical .
The new port facility will have the same effect and enables the exporting and importing of new goods .
Despite the huge investments required and the financial risks they bring , the mining industry is miniscule compared to the added - value industries that depend upon the metal that mining produces .
The copper from the Antamina mine may be turned into wiring for electric motors , copper pipe for water , or the circuit board of a personal computer .
In each of these cases the copper is sold at many multiples of its value in raw form .
The term " sustainability " is often bandied about in intellectual discussion , but with respect to mining , it never accounts for the fact that the cost of finding , mining , and refining metal dictates that it is cheaper to recycle metal than start from scratch .
When one considers that practically all the copper ever mined is still in use , mining can be considered infinitely sustainable .
People with anti-development notions should also consider that over 50 % of the copper produced today goes to developing nations , owing to the fact that rich countries are already developed and recycle much of what they need ; nearly half of the copper consumed each year in the United States is recycled .
[ 6 ]
Stopping a mine in Mongolia may mean that people in China do n't get copper pipes to transport clean drinking water .
Ivanhoe 's Mongolian copper - gold deposit is located in a remote , uninhabited part of the world where nobody lives .
This land was not claimed by anybody else beforehand .
As a consequence nobody but those who have claimed and now own the land , and those who have voluntarily decided to cooperate with the owners through investing in the development of the mine , should benefit from any profits that might arise .
These people include the investors who have put up the $ 370 million to date and whoever will put up the more than $ 2 billion required to start up the mine .
They are millions of ordinary people from all over the world represented by banks , investment firms , and workers ' pension funds .
Local laborers would clearly also benefit .
The investors make the wages for the laborers of the potential mine possible by putting their savings into the development of the mine at the start , long before any profits will be returned .
Mongolian workers do n't have the money to find and develop a mine and , like workers worldwide , accept wages in return for labor right away before , and regardless if , any sales or profits are realized by the capitalist investors .
Ivanhoe estimated that over its life the project would provide 117,000 new jobs ( full and part - time workers ) , an 11.5 % increase in Mongolian per capita income and a $ 54 billion increase in exports . [ 7 ]
The new infrastructure , including power and water generation , roads , community development , and investment in local people in the form of training and skill development would be a boon to future investment and Mongolians alike .
The infrastructure will also stimulate further mineral exploration and possible mining development in the area and may make viable other business ventures that might otherwise have been uneconomical .
But the main beneficiaries of the mine would be the consumers of copper worldwide , for whom the entire endeavor would be undertaken in the first place .
Mongolia 's Dilemma
The Mongolian government consists of a small number of people elected to act on behalf of the populace of Mongolia .
This new tax and all taxes are not voluntarily given , but are exacted through threat of violence .
As such , taxation should be viewed as morally wrong .
Funds that are forcibly exacted are subject to misallocation and abuse because there is little need to be concerned about satisfying the tax payer , who will be forced to pay again next year , regardless .
But taxation is fundamentally flawed because it is based on the ridiculous assumption that someone in a position of authority is capable of deciding on behalf of others what is best for them , or what their needs and wants may be .
If Mongolia is to maintain this new tax , it would be satisfying an emotional argument that insists that Mongolians living in Ulaanbaatar , which is located 550 kilometers away , should benefit from the mining efforts through the exactions of the tax regime .
It is easy to see why Mongolians in Ulaanbaatar might think this would be a good idea , but harder to see the long - term costs , which have yet to materialize .
The easily identifiable resources have been found , and new mines in Mongolia will be increasingly expensive and difficult to find .
The deserts of Mongolia present difficult challenges to mineral exploration and development such as extreme climate and poor infrastructure that other areas of the world do not have .
The tax is conceived as a very real new cost to the already large cost of mineral exploration and mine development .
It will serve as a disincentive to the driving force of the market : entrepreneurship , which is based on real judgments and risk taking .
The tax increases the perceived risk for currently planned investments and creates uncertainty in what has recently been a very stable country to invest in and means that the likelihood that anyone will want to undertake the risk to find more mines for the mutual benefit of all goes down considerably .
The cost of the tax will be borne by the consumers of copper .
Copper , an essential building block of society , will be more expensive for poor people , including Mongolians .
The beneficiaries of the royalty would be the Mongolian state and the privileged groups to whom it would decide to dispense the proceeds .
Mongolians would be better off building on the new wealth created by a potential copper mine , rather than discouraging risk - takers from finding and developing new mines .

How Obtuse Is the U.S. Press ?
By Robert Parry
September 3 , 2006 I n the movie  Shawshank Redemption ,  the wrongly convicted Andy Dufrense ( Tim Robbins ) gets frustrated when the corrupt prison warden blocks Dufrenses chance to prove his innocence .
 How can you be so obtuse ? 
Dufrense asks .
The same question could be addressed today to Washington journalists who are falling over themselves to absolve George W. Bushs White House of any serious wrongdoing in the three - year - old assault on former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson and the outing of his CIA officer wife , Valerie Plame .
This new backlash against those who challenged the White House on the Plame case follows disclosure that one of the sources for Robert Novaks July 14 , 2003 , column , which blew Plames cover , was Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage , who was not considered a close White House ally .
In a Sept. 2 front - page story , the New York Times reacted to this news by suggesting that special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald had been overzealous in pursuing the Plame investigation for more than two years , since Armitage had testified early on that he apparently was Novaks principal source on Plame .
[ NYT , Sept. 2 , 2006 ]
The Times article came on the heels of a scathing editorial by the Washington Post putting the primary blame for the exposure of Plame on her husband , Joseph Wilson , because in July 2003 , he went public with the findings of his 2002 CIA - organized trip to Niger which helped debunk the false pre-Iraq
War claim that Iraq had sought yellowcake uranium from Africa .
 He [ Wilson ] ought to have expected that both those [ Bush administration ] officials and journalists such as Mr. Novak would ask why a retired ambassador would have been sent on such a mission and that the answer would point to his wife ,  the Post editorial said .
The Post also argued that since Armitage was a reluctant supporter of the Iraq War , it follows that one of the most sensational charges leveled against the Bush White House  that it orchestrated the leak of Ms. Plames identity  is untrue . 
[ Washington Post , Sept. 1 , 2006 ]
How Obtuse ?
But  as with the corrupt prison warden in  Shawshank Redemption   its hard to believe that national journalists could be this obtuse .
As we explain below , the evidence is overwhelming that the White House assault on Wilson was planned weeks before he published an Op - Ed on July 6 , 2003 , accusing Bush of twisting the yellowcake claim  and that Bushs operatives responded by pointing journalists toward Plames identity .
Indeed , the available evidence doesnt even fully support the contention that Novak first learned about Plame from his interview with Armitage on July 8 , 2003 .
According to the Times own reporting , Novak apparently had been primed to ask a question on this topic .
The Times buries this crucial point in its Sept. 2 story that questions whether Fitzgerald properly exercised his prosecutorial discretion .
In the last sentence of the 17th paragraph , the Times reports that Armitage disclosed Plames possible role in arranging Wilsons Niger trip in reply to a question .
In other words , Armitage didnt just toss out Plames CIA connection as gossip ,  as the Post editorial assumes .
He apparently mentioned it in response to Novaks question about how the Niger trip had been arranged , which begs the additional question of who might have suggested that Novak ask that .
The distinction is important because other evidence indicates that Bushs aides were pushing reporters to ask about the circumstances behind the Niger trip , knowing that line of questioning would lead to Plames identity .
For instance , Time magazine correspondent John Dickerson , who accompanied a presidential trip to Africa shortly after Wilsons article was published , said he was twice urged to pursue the seemingly insignificant question of who had been involved in arranging Wilsons trip .
Revenge
As the President toured Africa in July 2003 , questions about Wilsons article dominated the trip , prompting White House spokesman Ari Fleischer to finally concede that the yellowcake allegation was incorrect and should not have been included in the State of the Union speech in January 2003 .
The mistake represented one of the first times the Bush administration had retreated on any national security issue .
Administration officials were embarrassed , livid and determined to punish Wilson .
On July 11 , 2003 , CIA Director George Tenet took the fall for the State of the Union screw - up , apologizing for not better vetting the speech .
 This did not rise to the level of certainty which should be required for presidential speeches ,  Tenet said .
That same day , however , as Bush was finishing a meeting with the president of Uganda , Dickerson said he was chatting with a senior administration official  who was tearing down Wilson and disparaging Wilsons Niger investigation .
The message to Dickerson was that some low - level person at the CIA was responsible for the mission and that Dickerson  should go ask the CIA who sent Wilson . 
Later , Dickerson discussed Wilson with a second senior administration official and got the same advice :  This official also pointed out a few times that Wilson had been sent by a low - level CIA employee and encouraged me to follow that angle ,  Dickerson recalled .
 At the end of the two conversations I wrote down in my notebook : look who sent . 
What struck me was how hard both officials were working to knock down Wilson .
Discrediting your opposition is a standard tactic in Washington , but the Bush team usually played the game differently .
At that stage in the first term , Bush aides usually blew off their critics .
Or , they continued to assert their set of facts in the hope of overcoming criticism by force of repetition .  
[ See Dickersons article ,  Wheres My Subpoena ?  for Slate , Feb. 7 , 2006 ] Back in Washington on July 11 , 2003 , Dickersons Time colleague , Matthew Cooper , was getting a similar earful from Bushs political adviser Karl Rove , who tried to steer Cooper away from Wilsons information and added that the Niger trip was authorized by  Wilsons wife , who apparently works at the agency [ CIA ] on WMD issues ,  according to Coopers notes of the interview .
[ See Newsweek , July 18 , 2005 , issue ]
Cooper later got the information about Wilsons wife confirmed by Cheneys chief of staff Lewis Libby , who had been peddling the information even before Coopers phone call .
Libby had been brought into the get - Wilson cabal in June 2003 when the White House got wind that Wilson might present a problem .
Counterattack
By spring 2003 , Wilson had begun talking privately to journalists about his Niger findings and criticizing the administration for hyping the WMD intelligence .
Behind the scenes , the White House began to hit back , collecting information about Wilson and his fact - finding trip .
In his memoir , The Politics of Truth , Wilson cited sources as saying that a meeting in the Vice Presidents office led to a decision to produce a workup to discredit Wilson .
Libby then asked Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman , a neoconservative ally in the State Department , to prepare a memo on Wilson .
Dated June 10 , 2003 , the memo referred to  Valerie Plame as Wilsons wife .
[ NYT , July 16 , 2005 ] CIA Director George Tenet also divulged to Cheney that Wilsons wife worked for the CIA and had a hand in arranging Wilsons trip to Niger  information that Cheney then passed on to Libby in a conversation on June 12 , 2003 , according to Libbys notes as described by lawyers in the case .
[ NYT , Oct. 25 , 2005 ]
Those two facts 
Plames work for the CIA and her minor role in Wilsons Niger trip ( which was approved and arranged at higher levels of the CIA )  were transformed into key attack points against Wilson .
On June 23 , 2003 , still two weeks before Wilsons Op - Ed , Libby briefed New York Times reporter Judith Miller about Wilson and may then have passed on the tip that Wilsons wife worked at the CIA .
But the anti-Wilson campaign gained new urgency when the ex-ambassador penned his Op - Ed piece in the New York Times on July 6 , 2003 .
As Cheney read Wilsons article ,  What I Didnt Find in Africa ,  the Vice President scribbled down questions he wanted pursued .
 Have they [ CIA officials ] done this sort of thing before ?
Cheney wrote .
 Send an Amb[ assador ] to answer a question ?
Do we ordinarily send people out pro bono to work for us ?
Or did his wife send him on a junket ? 
Though Cheney did not write down Plames name , his questions indicated that he was aware that she worked for the CIA and was in a position ( dealing with WMD issues ) to have a hand in her husbands assignment to check out the Niger reports .
[ Cheney s notations were disclosed in a May 12 , 2006 , court filing by special prosecutor Fitzgerald . ]
On that morning of July 6 , 2003 , Wilson appeared on NBCs  Meet the Press to elaborate on the yellowcake dispute .
Later that day , Deputy Secretary of State Armitage called Carl W. Ford Jr. , the assistant secretary for intelligence and research , at home and asked him to send a copy of Grossmans memo to Secretary of State Colin Powell , according to a former State Department official interviewed by the New York Times .
Since Powell was preparing to leave with Bush on the state visit to Africa , Ford forwarded Grossmans memo to the White House for delivery to Powell , the former official told the Times .
[ NYT , July 16 , 2005 ]
The next day , when Bush left for Africa , Powell was carrying the memo containing the information about Plames work for the CIA and other details about the yellowcake dispute , the Washington Post reported .
Pressing the Press On July 8 , 2003 , two days after Wilsons article , Libby gave Judith Miller more details about the Wilsons .
Cheneys chief of staff said Wilsons wife worked at a CIA unit responsible for weapons intelligence and non-proliferation .
It was in the context of that interview , that Miller wrote down the words  Valerie Flame ,  an apparent misspelling of Mrs. Wilsons maiden name .
[ NYT , Oct. 16 , 2005 ]
On that same day , Novak elicited information from Armitage about the role of Wilsons wife in arranging the Niger trip .
According to the Sept. 2 , 2006 , story in the New York Times ,  Armitage said in reply to a question that Ms. Wilson might have had a role in arranging her husbands trip to Niger . 
On July 12 , 2003 , in a telephone conversation , Miller and Libby returned to the Wilson topic .
Millers notes contain a reference to a  Victoria Wilson ,  another misspelled reference to Wilsons wife .
[ NYT , Oct. 16 , 2005 ]
Two days later , on July 14 , 2003 , Novak  having gotten confirmation about Plames identity from Karl Rove  published a column , citing two administration sources outing Plame as a CIA officer and portraying Wilsons Niger trip as a case of nepotism .
But the White House counterattack had only just begun .
On July 20 , 2003 , NBCs correspondent Andrea Mitchell told Wilson that senior White House sources had called her to stress  the real story here is not the 16 words [ from Bushs State of the Union speech ] but Wilson and his wife .
The next day , Wilson said he was told by MSNBCs Chris Matthews that  I just got off the phone with Karl Rove .
He says and I quote ,  Wilsons wife is fair game .
When Newsday spoke with Novak  before he decided to clam up 
Novak said he had been approached by the sources with the information about Plame .
 I didnt dig it out , it was given to me ,  Novak said .
 They thought it was significant , they gave me the name and I used it .
[ Newsday , July 22 , 2003 ]
That account from Novak clashes with the version cited by the Washington Post editorial of Sept. 1 , 2006 , which describes the Plame disclosure as reportedly passed along in an offhand manner , virtually as gossip . 
Novaks account to Newsday only a week after his infamous column would seem to fit better with a scenario in which Bushs aides had prepped Novak on what to ask Armitage or in which Armitage was part of the anti-Wilson cabal .
Cover -up On July 22 , 2003 , the White House began shifting into cover - up mode .
Bushs spokesman Scott McClellan denied any White House role in the Plame leak .
 Im telling you flatly that that is not the way this White House operates ,  McClellan told reporters .
Privately , however , some administration officials acknowledged that the Plame disclosure was an act of retaliation against Wilson for being one of the first mainstream public figures to challenge Bush on the WMD intelligence .
In September 2003 , a White House official told the Washington Post that at least six reporters had been informed about Plame before Novaks column .
The official said the disclosure was purely and simply out of revenge . 
Novaks article indeed did destroy Plames career as a CIA officer and exposed her network of operatives who had been investigating Irans nuclear program .
A CIA complaint to the Justice Department prompted an inquiry into the illegal exposure of a CIA officer .
Initially , when the investigation was still under the direct control of Attorney General John Ashcroft , Bush and other White House officials continued to deny any knowledge about the leak .
Bush said he wanted to get to the bottom of the matter .
 If there is a leak out of my administration , I want to know who it is ,  Bush said on Sept. 30 , 2003 .
 I want to know the truth .
If anybody has got any information inside our administration or outside our administration , it would be helpful if they came forward with the information so we can find out whether or not these allegations are true . 
Yet , even as Bush was professing his curiosity and calling for anyone with information to step forward , he was withholding the fact that he had authorized the declassification of some secrets about the Niger uranium issue and had ordered Cheney to slip those selected secrets to reporters to undercut Wilson .
In other words , though Bush knew a great deal about how the anti-Wilson scheme got started  since he was involved in starting it  he uttered misleading public statements to conceal the White House role and possibly to signal to others that they should follow suit in denying knowledge .
Partial Exposure
The cover - up might have worked , except in late 2003 , Ashcroft recused himself because of a conflict of interest , and Fitzgerald  the U.S. Attorney in Chicago  was named as the special prosecutor .
Fitzgerald pursued the investigation far more aggressively , even coercing journalists to testify about the White House leaks .
On Oct. 28 , 2005 , Fitzgerald indicted Libby on five counts of perjury , lying to investigators and obstruction of justice .
In a court filing on April 5 , 2006 , Fitzgerald added that his investigation had uncovered government documents that could be characterized as reflecting a plan to discredit , punish , or seek revenge against Mr. Wilson because of his criticism of the administrations handling of the Niger evidence .
Beyond the Plame leak , the White House also oversaw a public - relations strategy to denigrate Wilson .
The Republican National Committee put out talking points ridiculing Wilson , and the Republican - run Senate Intelligence Committee made misleading claims about his honesty in a WMD report .
Rather than thank Wilson for undertaking a difficult fact - finding trip to Niger for no pay  and for reporting accurately about the dubious Iraq - Niger claims  the Bush administration sought to smear the former ambassador .
The Republican National Committee even posted an article entitled  Joe Wilsons Top Ten Worst Inaccuracies and Misstatements ,  which itself used glaring inaccuracies and misstatements to discredit Wilson .
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.coms  Novak Recycles Gannon on  Plame - gate . ]
Meanwhile , with her undercover work destroyed , Plame quit the CIA .
Now , based on a new report about Armitages role in leaking Plames identity , the New York Times , the Washington Post and other leading U.S. news organizations are joining in a new campaign to disparage those who harbored suspicions about the Bush administrations actions  from special prosecutor Fitzgerald to former Ambassador Wilson .
For these national journalists who act as if they are oblivious to all the evidence of a long - running White House smear campaign and cover - up , it might be time to pose the  Shawshank Redemption  question :  How can you be so obtuse ? 
Of course , in the movie , the warden really wasnt obtuse .
He just wanted to keep benefiting from Dufrenses financial skills and , most importantly , to protect his corrupt schemes .
The motives of the Washington news media may be more of a mystery .

An update to the code demonstrating E4X support is here .
Ajaxian is reporting that Sun is releasing Phobos , a Javascript application server .
This is a web server that runs Javascript for implementing the server side code .
The source has not yet been released , according to Ajaxian , but will be .
A while back I worked on doing server side Javascripting using Rhino as the interpreter and Jetty 6 as the server .
I got it to work but never tidied it up for release .
Sun's Phobos has motivated me to make it available so I 've tidied it up and it can be downloaded from javascript - server.tar.gz .
A darcs repository with the code is here :
darcs get http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/repos/javascript-server
The repository contains the Jetty 6 JAR files and the Rhino interpreter JAR , along with an example Javascript file showing how it works and a readme .
Once the ' example.js ' is loaded into the Rhino interpreter you can start a Jetty 6 web server on port 8080 with the following command :
var s = startServer ( 8080 ) ;
A simple ' HelloWorld ' style servlet looks like this in Javascript :
HelloWorldServlet = makeServlet ({ ProcessGet : function ( req , resp ) { var text = " Hello World ! " ; resp.setContentType(" text/plain " ) resp.setContentLength(text.length ) resp.getOutputStream( ).print ( text ) resp.flushBuffer( ) } } ) ;
It has a ' ProcessGet ' function which is called when an HTTP GET is made .
The ' req ' and ' resp ' objects and the standard Java HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse respectively .
The magic of deriving from HttpServlet is done by Rhino .
But it can't actually override HttpServlet methods - it can only override abstract methods .
To fix this I created a JavascriptServlet Java class which forwards doGet ( ... ) to an abstract ' ProcessGet ' , which is the method you see overridden above .
With the Jetty server we started running from the interpreter earlier we can add this servlet dynamically :
addServlet(s , " / " , HelloWorldServlet ) ;
Now requests to http://localhost:8080/ will run HelloWorldServlet .
When can dynamically add other servlets too :
addServlet(s , " / bye " , GoodbyeWorldServlet ) ;
Requests to http://localhost:8080/bye/ will run the GoodbyeWorldServlet .
Using the Jetty API you can work out how to add , remove and otherwise do some very cool stuff .
Like play with Jetty 6's Ajax continuation support .
The server can be stopped with :
s.stop ( ) ;
Running Javascript on the client and server gives some interesting possibilities .
Sharing code for example .
Or writing validation rules in Javascript which run both on the client and server .
The Dojo javascript toolkit can run client side or server side .
This means you could use Dojo 's packaging and other nice features for server side development in Javascript .
Rhino has continuation 's which are serialisable .
A continuation based web server could be implemented which serialises continuations like SISCWeb .
Download javascript - server , play with it , and let me know what you do with it .
I hope to follow up on some of the above ideas too .
In the meantime , we hope you ’re all doing well and staying safe .
Take care of yourselves and help the others in your life when you ’re able .
Get a reasonable amount of sleep , take some deep breaths throughout the day , and let yourself escape into a game , book , or movie when the world gets to be too much .
And we feel lucky to be able to say that !
The world is a hugely different place than it was even a few months ago , as I 'm sure you 've noticed .
We consider ourselves fortunate to still be doing what we ’re doing .
We wish we could show you just what it is we 've been up to , but it 's going to have to wait a little longer .
Patience is a virtue , as they say .
Of course , it would be reasonable of you to think otherwise :
It ’s been nearly two years since our last post on here .
Sorry about that !
The truth is we ’ve just been over here ... doing our thing ... making video games from the moderate comfort of our homes .

Competition is tough for places at Moscow State University
Moscow University security guards first thought the applicant had an oversized bust because " she " was trying to take crib sheets into the exam .
A search unmasked the false bosom , the university told the BBC News website .
The man was barred from the exam and the woman he attempted to cover for was struck off the entrants ' list .
She had been seeking a place in the university 's prestigious psychology faculty .
Heavy make - up
Yasen Zasursky , a head of department in the university 's journalism faculty where the exams were being held , said the man 's " especially protruding female features " gave him away .
" Someone was trying to sit the maths exam dressed as a lady , " he told the BBC .
" The guard was suspicious that they were taking some materials into the exam .
He opened the jacket and saw it was a young gentleman . "
The youth was also apparently wearing heavy make - up .
Correspondents say cheating is a major problem in Russia 's universities and colleges , where bribery is commonplace .
But Mr Zasursky seemed to suggest that the ruse was an appropriate one for the subject involved .
" They try to see ways of using their knowledge of psychology , " he quipped .
If you have n’t heard the news , I ’m afraid your Army is broken , a victim of too many missions for too few soldiers for too long .
Today we have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan all of our fighting brigades , both active and reserve .
Every brigade save one in Korea has spent time in combat .
Twenty have two tours there , nine have three and two have four .
Some of these brigades ’ one - year deployments were extended by several months .
To demonstrate the gravity of the problem , let ’s do the math .
After the surge the nation will need to keep 33 brigades , each consisting of about 3,000 soldiers , in the field .
Past experience tells us that three brigades are needed to keep one continuously in the fight ( one recovering and one training up to support each deployed brigade ) .
The Army could in theory maintain itself in combat indefinitely using such a scheme .
From a human perspective , a three - for - one schedule would allow each soldier two years back for every year in combat .
That is tough but sustainable .
So , that means we need a total of 99 brigades to support 33 in the fight .
Sorry to say , we only have about half that number available to the Army and Marine Corps .
The Army has paid an enormous price for too few brigades chasing too many missions .
What the math tells us in practical terms is that today soldiers are getting a year off for every year in Iraq .
Soon that period at home will shrink to only nine months home for every year deployed .
It ’s important to understand what these back - to - back deployments mean in human terms .
Take a brigade with only nine months between trips to Iraq .
Upon return , it will lose over half its soldiers due to rotations , school dates and soldiers leaving the service .
The first three months back will be devoted to block leave so that soldiers can reunite with their families .
The next two months are needed to assimilate new arrivals .
At least two months are needed on the other end to prepare the brigade ’s equipment for the return trip to Iraq .
That leaves only four months to train at the local level — too little time for a combat unit to bond and coalesce into a first - class fighting outfit .
Past experience tells us that it takes at least a year to build a first - rate small unit .
Like a fine wine , making superb small units can not be rushed .
Commanders stay awake at night worrying that their companies and platoons will go to war as a collection of strangers .
Nine months between deployments will guarantee this condition .
The time - between - deployment problem ( “ dwell time ” ) has become so acute that Army planners , borrowing a phrase from Wal - Mart , are talking about “ just - in - time deployment , ” meaning that units are being rushed through training to arrive in Iraq just in time .
In the past , attendance at the Army ’s superb National Training Centers in California , Germany and Louisiana was supposed to be a finishing exercise where brigades topped off their skills in realistic and demanding maneuvers .
Today , these centers are used to do the most basic skill training in order to get units in the best shape possible so as to arrive in combat “ just in time . ”
Bean counters in the Pentagon tell us that Army recruitment and retention are in good shape .
Problem is , our cumbersome readiness reporting system only informs leaders in Washington of conditions on the ground many months after the force begins to break .
Today , anecdotal evidence of collapse is all around .
Past history makes some of us sensitive to anecdotes and distrustful of Pentagon statistics .
The Army ’s collapse after Vietnam was presaged by a desertion of mid-grade officers ( captains ) and non-commissioned officers .
Many were killed or wounded .
Most left because they and their families were tired and did n’t want to serve in units unprepared for war .
If we lose our sergeants and captains , the Army breaks again .
It ’s just that simple .
That ’s why these soldiers are still the canaries in the readiness coal - mine .
And , again , if you look closely , you will see that these canaries are fleeing their cages in frightening numbers .
The lesson from this sad story is simple :
When you fight a long war with a long - service professional Army , the force you begin with will not get any larger or better over the duration of the conflict .
For that reason , today ’s conditions are pretty much irreversible .
There ’s not much that money , goodwill or professed support for the troops can do .
Another strange consequence is that the current political catfight over withdrawal dates is made moot by the above facts .
We ’re running out of soldiers faster than we ’re running out of warfighting missions .
The troops will be coming home soon .
There simply are too few to sustain the surge for very much longer .

I first heard about this last night , in our own Dailykos ' Diary rescue -- National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive , by phreephallin .
I thought I 'd look into it a little more throughly , since it touches on issues that I 've studied in the past .
Basically the directive states the in the case of a national Catastrophic Emergency " , the President , along with the head of Homeland Security , can take over the government and do whatever they please in order to provide " continuance " .
Here 's the quote right from the White House website :
( b) " Catastrophic Emergency " means any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government functions
Sounds innocent enough , right ?
But look at that phrase " regardless of location " .
What the hell is that supposed to mean ?
Stephen Pizzo at the Smirking Chimp puts it quite beautifully :
Regardless of location ?
Would that include , say , a terrorist attack on Saudi oil fields and refineries ?
That would certainly " disrupt " the U.S. population and economy .
" or government functions . "
Would that include mass public protests such as those during the Civil Rights and Vietnam War eras ?
But it get better .
We may not even have to wait for a real " national emergency " to hit before the President can assume the mantle of near - dictator .
Under the guise of " maintaining government continuity , the President could just sign a " NEF " - a National Emergency Finding : " " As a result of the asymmetric threat environment , adequate warning of potential emergencies that could pose a significant risk to the homeland might not be available , and therefore all continuity planning shall be based on the assumption that no such warning will be received . "
Once the President signs " detects " a real or imagined threat , and signs a NEF , here 's what he gets for his signature :
The President shall lead the activities of the Federal Government for ensuring constitutional government .
In other words , to quote the old Christian hymn , " He has the whole world , in his hands , the whole world , in his hands ... "
You can read the entire press release on this at the White House 's website , listed above .
Ah , but you can't read the whole thing :
( 24 ) Security .
This directive and the information contained herein shall be protected from unauthorized disclosure , provided that , except for Annex A , the Annexes attached to this directive are classified and shall be accorded appropriate handling , consistent with applicable Executive Orders .
And another thing I found disturbing about the order :
( 22 ) Revocation .
Presidential Decision Directive 67 of October 21 , 1998 ( " Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations " ) , including all Annexes thereto , is hereby revoked .
Hm , who was President in 1998 ?
Oh yeah , that other guy .
So whatever Clinton decided would work in this regard has been simply tossed out the window and replaced with the Bush / Cheney / Gonzales plan for " continuance " .
Great .
Now , you might think that this is something that any president has to deal with , and it certainly is .
However , the Criminal Wing of the Republican Party has been working on this for YEARS .
There are many familiar names in the history of nefarious plans to subvert the Constitution and intill Martial Law throughout our country .
Cheney .
Rumsfeld .
Oliver North .
Oliver North ?
Yup .
Here 's a nice article from way back in 2002 entitled " Foundations are in place for martial law in the US " .
This article was alarming enough that the Democrats ' own Jim McDermott got a little freaked out about it :
I recently read an article published in the Sydney , Australia , Morning Herald entitled ``Foundations Are in Place for Martial Law in the United States . ''
The author is a man named Ritt Goldstein , an investigative reporter for the Herald , and he said that recent pronouncements from the Bush administration and national security initiatives put in place in the Reagan era could see internment camps and martial law in the United States .
When President Ronald Reagan was considering invading Nicaragua , he issued a series of executive orders which provided FEMA with broad powers in the event of a crisis , such as the violent and widespread internal dissent or national opposition against a U.S. military invasion abroad .
They were never used .
SNIP ( and here comes the juicy part : ) From 1982 to 1984 , Colonel Oliver North assisted FEMA in drafting its civil defense preparations .
Details of those plans emerged during the 1987 Iran - Contra scandal .
They included executive orders providing for suspension of the Constitution , the imposition of martial law , internment camps , and the turning over of government to the President and FEMA .
A Miami Herald article on the 5th of July , 1987 , reported that the former FEMA director 's , Louis Guiffrida's , deputy , John Brinkerhoff , handled the martial law portion of the planning .
The planning was said to be similar to one Mr. Guiffrida had developed earlier to combat a national uprising by black militants .
It provided for the detention of at least 21 million American Negroes in assembly centers or relocation camps .
Today , Mr. Brinkerhoff is with the highly influential Anser Institute for Homeland Security .
Following a request by the Pentagon in January that the U.S. military be allowed the option of deploying troops on American streets , the institute in February published a paper by Mr. Brinkerhoff arguing the legality of this .
He alleged that the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , which has long been accepted as prohibiting such deployments , had simply been misunderstood and misapplied .
The preface to the article also provided the revelation that the national plan he had worked on under Mr. Guiffrida was approved by Reagan and actions were taken to implement it .
Bush does n't need FEMA anymore for this , because he has his very own Department of Homeland Security .
The Posse Comitatus
Act does n't apply to him , ( according to him ) and all he has to do is decide there 's an emergency coming down the pike to suspend the constitution and start throwing whoever he feels like it into camps .
It would be nice to know more specifics about Reagan 's plan , but :
Disturbingly , the full facts and final contents of Mr Reagan 's national plan remain uncertain .
This is in part because President Bush took the unusual step of sealing the Reagan presidential papers last November .
What we do know is that Cheney and Rummy have were also in on this in the 1980's .
As Peter Dale Scott reported here , the illegal NSA spying program may have started even before 9/11 , due to their planning of such " continuance " operations :
At the time , Cheney was a Wyoming congressman , while Rumsfeld , who had been defense secretary under President Ford , was a businessman and CEO of the drug company G.D. Searle .
Overall responsibility for the program had been assigned to Vice President George H.W. Bush , " with Lt. Col .
Oliver North ... as the National Security Council action officer , " according to James Bamford in his book A Pretext for War .
These men planned for suspension of the Constitution , not just after nuclear attack , but for any " national security emergency , " which they defined in Executive Order 12656 of 1988 as : " Any occurrence , including natural disaster , military attack , technological or other emergency , that seriously degrades or seriously threatens the national security of the United States . "
Clearly 9/11 would meet this definition .
As developed in the mid-1980s by Oliver North in the White House , the plans called for not just the surveillance but the potential detention of large numbers of American citizens .
During the Iran - Contra hearings , North was asked about his work on " a contingency plan in the event of emergency , that would suspend the American constitution . "
The chairman , Democratic Senator Inouye , ruled that this was a " highly sensitive and classified " matter , not to be dealt with in an open hearing .
The supporting agency for the planning and implementation was the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) .
FEMA was headed for much of the 1980s by Louis Giuffrida , whose COG plans for massive detention became so extreme that even President Reagan ’s then Attorney General , William French Smith , raised objections .
Smith eventually left Washington , while COG continued to evolve .
And in May 2001 Cheney and FEMA were reunited : President George W. Bush appointed Cheney to head a terrorism task force and created a new office within FEMA to assist him .
In effect , Bush was authorizing a resumption of the kind of planning that Cheney and FEMA had conducted under the heading of COG .
Keep in mind , that " back when Reagan was considering invading Nicaragua " , our current Defense Secretary , Robert Gates , was the number 2 guy at the CIA and besides wanting to bomb Nicaragua was a key player in the Iran / Contra criminality .
And by sheer coincidence , Cheney 's old company Halliburton is now building detention camps in the United States to house , oh , just a whole lot of people .
A 385 million dollar contract , and they 're damn proud of it :
Halliburton Press Release
Dailykos : Concentration Camps Being Built on US Soil ?
And this one is especially creepy :
Satellite Photographs Emerge of Halliburton 's American Concentration Camp written by , supposedly , someone doing subcontracting work for KBR .
( Kellog Brown Root , Halliburton 's subsiidiary ) .
I 'm gonna quote Stephen Pizzo again to wrap this up :
Last month , two Belgian publications reported that the Brussels police have begun an investigation into a citizen 's allegations of rape – in Second Life .
I am half convinced that the tantalizingly brief story , printed in De Morgen and Het Laatste Nieuws , is a hoax or an April Fool 's joke .
Yet it has prompted several threads of discussion , from a legal analysis to four pages of commentary at the Second Citizen forums .
Unfortunately , rape in virtual spaces is not unheard of .
And I 'm not talking about the " consensual " rape built into some games ( although if you 're interested in that debate , GameGrene has a good conversation about it ) .
There is no question that forced online sexual activity – whether through text , animation , malicious scripts or other means – is real ; and is a traumatic experience that can have a profound and unpleasant aftermath , shaking your faith in yourself , in the community , in the platform , even in sex itself .
Our laws say that an adult subjecting a teenager or child to sexual words , images or suggestions on the internet is preying on their mental and emotional state in a sexual way .
Even if you never try to meet the minor in person , and even if you never touch them or expose your naked self to them , it is a crime to attempt to engage sexually with a minor .
If it is a criminal offense to sexually abuse a child on the internet , how can we say it is not possible to rape an adult online ?
But I have a hard time calling it " rape , " or believing it 's a matter for the police .
No matter how disturbed you are by a brutal sexual attack online , you cannot equate it to shivering in a hospital with an assailant 's sweat or other excretions still damp on your body .
That 's not to say I dismiss the trauma a person suffers after being raped online .
Virtual rape is not just a prank , one the target needs to get over or expect as part of a role - playing world .
( And if you are inclined to pooh - pooh this , first read author Julian Dibble 's chapter about a rape that occurred in a text - only MOO in the early ' 90s . )
A virtual rape is by definition sudden , explicit and often devastating .
If you 've never immersed yourself in online life , you might not realize the emotional availability it takes to be a regular member of an internet community .
The psychological aspects of relating are magnified because the physical aspects are ( mostly ) removed .
Even regular users might not realize how wide open they are until something drastic happens – they fall in love , get dumped , have a huge fight or get attacked in the online parallel of rape .
In that context , a sexual assault can indeed have a deep impact on a person 's life , especially if they are actual rape survivors .
Some suggest that the best way to deal with a virtual rape is to ignore it , or simply log off and come back as another user .
But in a game , you do n't want to lose the long - term investment you 've made in your character .
And these days , your real world income or professional reputation can depend on your online self .
In a 3 - D marketplace , your avatar 's name is your brand .
You can change the appearance of your cartoon without much impact , but changing your name makes it too difficult for customers or clients to find you .
If an online environment becomes too hostile or scary , or causes you such great anxiety you cannot work or interact with friends , more has been taken from you than your playtime .
Your friends will gather around to give you emotional support – but your customers will wander off and shop elsewhere .
Adult communities facilitate our need to go deeper into our sexual selves , even into secret places around gender and taboos that we cannot acknowledge anywhere else .
We feel safe because of the peculiar blend of disclosure and anonymity provided in online communities , and we journey along paths we might not even glance at in the physical world .
We do n't expect to have our control wrenched away or our minds assaulted or even the intensity of our anguish during and after .
The truth is , anywhere people gather , we bring all of our potential with us – for love , for sex , for community and creation , and for violence and destruction , too .
That 's why we still enjoy pondering whether cybersex is real sex and whether an online affair is more or less damaging to a relationship than a physical affair .
It 's a tacit acknowledgement that while the time - space continuum may change , people do n't .
Rape is the ultimate perversion of sexual intimacy .
Like sex , rape has mental and emotional elements that go beyond the body and the damage to the mind and spirit generally takes much longer to heal than the body .
But that does n't make the psychological upheaval of virtual rape anywhere near the trauma of real rape .
And I can't see us making virtual rape a matter for the real - life police .
It 's a shitty thing to do to someone .
But it 's not a crime .
See you next Friday ,

Hillary In '08 !
The Washington Post has run a long profile of Mark Penn , the " chief strategist " for Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign and her campaign manager in all but name .
It 's full of horrifying information .
For instance , Penn is CEO of Burson - Marsteller , and plans to continue being CEO during the campaign .
This is impressive , since usually these people like to wash the blood off their hands before appearing in public .
But this was my favorite part of the story , and the reason why I 've caught Hillarymania :
In their $ 5 million Georgetown mansion , Penn and his wife , Nancy Jacobson , a former staff member for Sen.
Evan Bayh ( D - Ind . ) who is now a fundraiser with the Clinton campaign , run something of a salon for like - minded friends .
They recently threw a book party for Jeffrey Goldberg , the New Yorker writer ...
And what are the foreign policy views of this like - minded friend of Hillary 's campaign manager ?
Here 's Jeffrey Goldberg on October 3 , 2002 :
There is not sufficient space ... for me to refute some of the arguments made in Slate over the past week against intervention , arguments made , I have noticed , by people with limited experience in the Middle East ( Their lack of experience causes them to reach the naive conclusion that an invasion of Iraq will cause America to be loathed in the Middle East , rather than respected ) ...
The administration is planning today to launch what many people would undoubtedly call a short - sighted and inexcusable act of aggression .
In five years , however , I believe that the coming invasion of Iraq will be remembered as an act of profound morality .
Elsewhere in the Post story , we learn that " Penn 's theory of the 2008 race has always been that after two tumultuous terms under Bush , the electorate will want change -- but not too much change . "
Hillary !

概要 : 増えつづける IP v4 の需要に対処するために提案された IPv6 は IP v4 とは互換性がなく、その代用品にはならない。 しかし人々は依然として IP v4 のサービスを必要とする。 したがってたとえ IPv6 が普及しても、その普及率が 100 % になるまでは IPv4 の需要は減少しない。そのためサービスを提供する側はつねに
IP v4 をサポートする必要にせまられ 、IPv6 のメリットはいつまでたっても見えてこない。 結果としてインターネット全体の IPv6 の導入には予想以上の時間とコストがかかり、 普及までには長い忍耐が必要となる 。
おことわり : これは Daniel J. Bernstein さん ( 以下 djb ) による IP v6 mess ( 日本語訳 ) および ngtransメーリングリスト ( IPv6 への移行に関する問題を扱っていた ) での彼の発言を読んで、新山が理解したことをまとめたものです。 ここでは IPv6 がなぜ普及しづらいのかを技術的な観点から説明しています。
比喩と説明文は新山のオリジナルですが、基本的なアイデアはすべて djb の受け売りで、新山自身は何も新しいことは言っていません。
だからといってこのページで書いたことの内容に責任をもたないというわけではないので、
間違っている部分についてはご指摘いただければ幸いです:
注意 : png を沢山使っているためか、このページを 印刷しようとすると異常に時間がかかるようです。すみません。 印刷のとき に
「白黒」を指定できる方はそうするとすこしはましになるかもしれません。
現在のインターネット ( IPv4 ) はただ一つの鉄道会社が運用している鉄道の路線のようなものです。 かりにこの鉄道会社を 「 インターネット公共地上鉄道会社」と呼びましょう。
インターネットに接続されているコンピュータ
( 建物 ) はすべてこ の 「 インターネット公共地上鉄道会社」の鉄道につながれた「駅」を持っており、 インターネット上を流れるデータ ( 人 ) はかならずこれらの駅を経由して運ばれます ( 図1 ) 。
Yahoo !
、Google 、 Hotmail など、インターネット上のすべてのサイトは それ自身がもつ駅の上に構築されています。 とうぜん、いまインターネットに接続しているあなたの家も駅を持っています。
あなたがインターネット上のサイトにアクセスするとき、
データはこれらの駅のいくつかを経由して目的地に到達します
( 図2 ) 。 実際には、それぞれの駅は 「 駅名 ( IPアドレス ) 」 をもっていて 、 インターネット上の駅はその駅名によって区別されています。
ところが、この方法には問題があります。現在のこの鉄道会社のやり方では、
「駅」につけられる駅名はある一定の文字数までに制限されているのです。
そのため、このまま駅を増やしていけばいずれは限界に到達し、
駅につける名前がなくなってしまう → 駅をこれ以上増やせなくなってしまう、 という問題が発生します ( IPアドレスの枯渇 ) 。
インターネットに接続されるコンピュータの数は増えつづけているため、
これは望ましくありません。このままでいくと、いずれは
インターネットに新しいコンピュータが接続できない状態になっていまいます。
なんとかしなければいけません。
増えつづける駅の要求に対処するため、人々は新しい鉄道会社をつくり、
別の鉄道路線を建設することにしました。それが「インターネット公共地下鉄会社 ( IPv6 ) 」です 。
この新しい地下鉄会社では、まったく別の鉄道の規格をつくり、
駅名に使える文字数を大幅に増やしました。
そのため従来の鉄道にくらべて、ケタ違いにたくさんの駅が建設できることになります。
ただし、この地下鉄会社の車両はまったく異なる新しいつくりのため、
地上の鉄道線路に乗り入れることはできません。
そのため地下鉄の駅は、地上の駅とは別に新たに作られることになりました ( 図 3 ) 。
ところが、この方法には問題があります。 地下鉄の駅は地下にあるので、地下鉄 ( IPv6 ) をつかって アクセスしたいサイトには、地下鉄用の通路を作らなければなりません ( それ以外の場所を通ることはできません ) 。 つまりこのようなサイト ( IPv6 対応サイト ) は 地上駅用の通路 ( 従来の通路 ) と、 地下鉄用の通路 を
2種類作る必要があることになります。 こうすれば、新しく地下鉄駅をもった家 ( IPv6 に対応したコンピュータ ) からこの通路をとおって地下鉄対応サイトに到達できます ( 図 4 ) 。
しかし現在の地上路線 ( IPv4 ) はあまりにも巨大化してしまっており、 それと同じ規模の地下鉄 ( IPv6 ) をゼロから建設するのは莫大な費用がかかります。
( 現在までに構築されてい る IPv4 と IPv6 対応サイトの数を比べると、 その差は全国 の JR全線と、都営地下鉄の1路線の差ぐらいあります。 もっと大きいかもしれません。)
そのため、なんとか既存の路線をつかってデータを運べないものか、ということになります。
この問題を解決するために、人々は 「 地上駅と地下鉄駅が同じ位置にあるときは、途中でその駅を通って地上会社の路線を使ってもよい 」 というふうに決めました ( トンネリング ) 。
これは次のようにして実現します。まず、地下鉄駅を利用するすべての人
( データ ) に 「 地下鉄パス 」を持たせます ( カプセル化 ) 。
そしてこの地下鉄パスをもっていれば、途中で地上駅を通ってもよいことにしたのです。
これによって、すべての地域に地下鉄をはりめぐらす必要はなく、
互いにつながっていない地下鉄どうしでも、地上の鉄道会社を経由することで 人々 ( データ ) が移動できるようになりました ( 図 5 ) 。
ところが最大の問題は以下のようなものです。これまでうやむやにしてきましたが、
じつは地下鉄駅しか持っていない家 ( IPv6 のみに対応したコンピュータ ) から直接、地上の駅に到達するすべはありません。
地下鉄パスがあるじゃないか、とお思いでしょうが、じつはなんと 「 いったん地下鉄の改札から乗ったら、 地下鉄の改札からしか出てはいけない 」 というとりきめがなされているのです。 今のところ、Yahoo ! や Google や Hotmail などといったサイトは地上の駅しか持っておらず、 地下鉄用の通路はありません。 そのため、地下鉄駅しか持っていない家 ( IPv6 のみに対応したコンピュータ ) から出発しても これらのサイト ( IPv4 ) で降りることはできず、 したがってアクセスする方法は今のところありません ( 図 6 ) 。 同様に、地上の駅 ( IPv4 ) から出発しても地上の駅でしか降りることはできず、
IP v4 サイトから IPv6 サイトにアクセスすることもやはり不可能です。
で は 「 地上と地下のどちらにも駅をもった ( IPv4 ・IPv6 の両方に対応した ) 家を建てればいいじゃないか 」 と思うかもしれません。それはそのとおりです。でもちょっと待ってください -- もともとこの地下鉄プロジェクトは「地上にはもうこれ以上、駅を建てられないから始めた」んですよ。
最初から地上に駅が建てられるなら、わざわざ地下に駅を建てる必要なんかなかったはずです。
実際には、地下鉄駅からも地上の駅にアクセスする方法はあります。
ある業者は、途中の駅構内で地下鉄会社の定期券を地上会社の定期券と
( 一時的に ) 交換する、 というサービスをやっています ( NAT、注 : 厳密には IPv6 では NAT と呼ばないらしいのですが、 やっていることは同じです ) 。つまり、地下鉄駅しか持っていない人でも、
では、これらの私鉄沿線の住人はどのようにして公共鉄道を利用しているのでしょうか?
じつは、すべての私鉄路線はある特定の場所で公共地上鉄道会社の駅に接続されています。 そこには例の業者 ( NAT ) がいて、定期券の交換サービスをしているのです。したがって、
「公共」鉄道にこだわらず、このような私鉄沿線に住めば ( やや不便を感じつつも ) 地下鉄を使う必要はないのです。逆にいえば、現在の地下鉄会社はいくら
「公共」と名がついているとはいえ、便利さでは私鉄とほとんど変わりありません。
すると地下鉄を建設するメリットはどこにあるのでしょうか?
「 とにかく将来的に駅は不足するんだから、 一時的に多少不便なのは我慢して、無理にでも地下鉄を使っていくようにするしかない 」
と思われるかもしれません。たぶんそれがいちばんいい選択でしょう…
将来ほんとうにそれで利益が約束されるならば -- でも、それはいつでしょうか? いったいいつになったら、すべての駅が地下鉄 ( IPv6 ) に置きかわるようになるのでしょうか?
上でみたように、個人にとっては地下鉄を使うのも私鉄を使うのも
あまり大差はありません。現時点ではどちらも同じように定期券の交換業者
( NAT ) が必要です。 しかし企業にとってはどうでしょうか。 もし Yahoo ! や Google や Hotmail が地下鉄 ( IPv6 ) をサポートするとしたら、 すべての地下鉄利用者のために専用の通路を建設しなければなりません。
Yahoo !
などの大規模なサイトでは、これはとんでもなくコストがかかるでしょう。
それでもそのコストに見合うだけの利益が見込めればいいのですが、 問題は「たとえ彼らがいま地下鉄用通路をつくっても、利用客はほとんどいない 」
ことにあります。地下鉄駅を持っている家
( IPv6 に対応しているコンピュータ ) が まだ少ないうえに、どのみちかれらは業者 ( NAT ) を使って地上駅 ( IPv4 ) にもアクセスできるのですから!
ここに悪循環があることにお気づきでしょうか?
つまり、
比喩はここまでにしますが、いいたいのはこういうことです。
いまの状況だと、どのみち IPv6 のみ対応のコンピュータを使っていも、 人は IPv4 サイトにアクセスする手段を持つ必要があるのです。なぜなら
Yahoo ! や Google や Hotmail が使えなければ、多くの人にとって インターネットはまったく役に立たないからです。 したがって、当面は IP v6 にも IPv4 にもアクセスできるコンピュータが 増えることになるでしょう。しかし、だとすると
Yahoo ! や Google や Hotmail などのサイト側にとってわざわざ IPv6 をサポートするメリットはいったいなんなのでしょうか?
たとえば Google には 、( おそらく ) 何千台ものサーバが存在しています。 これほどの規模のサイトで IPv6 を使えるようにするのは非常にコストがかかるでしょう。 これは、ただ単にソフトウエアをアップデートすればいいというものではありません、 彼らはふたつのアドレス ( 地上駅の通路と地下鉄駅の通路 ) をずっと 維持・管理しつづけなければならないのです!
おまけにこれらの IPv6 対応ソフトウエアはまだ開発途上にあり、
ノウハウの蓄積も十分ではありません。 しかも、それによる利益はいまのところ不明で、たとえ利益があったとしても、
それは何年先にペイするのか誰も予測できないというしろものです。それまで彼らはずっと無駄な
( と思われる ) 管理コストを払いつづける必要があるのです。これを企業に期待するのはかなりむずかしいといえるでしょう。
( 実際、これらのサイトは現時点で は IPv6 に対応していません )
djb は「そこに IPv6 があるから登るのだ 」 と発言した人に対して、 " that 's a dumb answer " ( それは頭の悪い回答ですね ) と一蹴したあと、 以下のように書いています 。
問題 は 「 IPv6 が IP v4 の上位互換ではない 」ことにあります。
さきほどの比喩でいえば、赤字で書いた部分 「 いったん地下鉄の改札から乗ったら、地下鉄の改札からしか出てはいけない 」 というルール、このとりきめによって地下鉄 ( IPv6 ) は現状ではまったく役に立たないものとなってしまいました。
その結果として普及が進まないという状況になっています。コンピュータの用語でいえば、
これ は 「 IPv6 のみ対応のコンピュータと IP v4 のみ対応のコンピュータでは ( たとえ線がつながっていても ) 通信できない」ということになります。
下の図を見てください ( 図 8)。横軸は時間を、縦軸はインターネットに接続されているコンピュータが
IP v4 ホストあるいは IPv6 ホストに到達できる割合をあらわしています ( 注意 : IP v4 対応コンピュータ とIPv6 対応コンピュータの割合ではありません -- IPv6 にしか対応していなくても先程の NAT を使って IPv4 ホストに到達することはできます ) 。 緑の線はしだいに増えていって、いつしか「 100 % 」になる瞬間 ( Magic moment、魔法の瞬間 ) が やってきます。が、いつの時点でも赤か緑のどちらかの線が必ず「100%」であることに注意してください。 これは偶然ではありません。なぜなら、すべてのコンピュータが
IPv6 到達可能にならない限り、 IPv4 到達可能のコンピュータが減ることはないからです
( でも思い出してください 、 そもそも IPv6 は 「 IPv4 アドレスが足りないから 」始めたんですよ) 。しかもその瞬間が訪れる時点までは
必ず IP v4 到達可能率のほうが IPv6 到達可能率よりも高いのです。 このことは、新たにネットワークを利用する新規ユーザや企業にとって何を意味しているでしょうか。 つまり新しくネットワークに接続するコンピュータは、必ず
IP v4 に到達できるように しなければならず、結果としてそれでつねに用は足りてしまい、
IPv6 はいつもいつもあと回しにされてしまうのです!
逆に新たにネットワークを使ってビジネスに参入しようとする企業が
「 IPv6 のみしかサポートしない」などということは考えられません。 なぜなら IPv6 のほうが確実に不利であることがわかっているのですから。 これでは「 Magic Moment」はいったいいつになったらやってくるのか、見当もつきません。 かりにこれが今後 10年で達成できたとしても、そのころには最初に
IPv6 に対応しはじめた コンピュータはとっくにお役御免になっているはずで、そのコンピュータにとって
IPv6 への対応はまったく無駄な投資だったことになります。
そうこうしている間にも IP v4 への需要は増えつづけ、 ネットワークはますます硬直したものになるでしょう。
もし IPv6 が IPv4 の上位互換になっていれば、こうはならなかったはずです。 つまり IPv6 対応によって 、( NAT を使わずとも ) IP v4 サイトと IPv6 サイトの両方に アクセスできるようになっていれば ( 地下鉄から乗っても地上駅で降りられるようになっていれば ) 、
大は小を兼ねるわけですから、新しいコンピュータを
IPv6 のみに対応させることも やぶさかではありません。つまり使う側にとってはつねに「今と同じか、それよりよい」ものが 手に入ります。そうやって IPv6 対応サイトを増やしていけば、いずれは全世界のサイトが
IPv6 対応になると期待することができます。しかし実際にはそうなっていないのです。
IPv4 と IPv6 のあいだに互換性がないということは 「 今までのネットワークを全部捨てて、新しくやり直せ」ということであり、これにはかなり思いきった決断が必要です。
かといって IP v4 へ の“ 乗り入れ ( NAT ) ” に頼っていては、いつまでたっても
IPv6 の意義が生かされません。 このジレンマはいったいどうすれば解決できるのでしょうか。
なぜ IPv6 はこんな設計 ( =地下鉄から乗ったら地下鉄でしか降りられない ) になったのでしょう ?
これは先の地下鉄の比喩からはわかりにくいことですが、
そうしたほうが圧倒的に「簡潔で、効率がよい」からです。
つまり純粋に技術的な観点からみれば、IPv4 と IPv6 は分けて扱ったほうが絶対によいことになります。
しかし上でみたように実際の移行過程を考えると、この技術的な優位性は意味がありません。
たとえどんなに技術的に美しかろうと運用コストが低かろうと、
普及しなければ意味がないのです。 おまけに現状では IPv6 のみしか使わない場合は結局 NAT が必要になります。 山本和彦・加藤朗氏に よ る「 No more NAT ! 」 によれば、 「 いったん IP v6 が広まったあと は
NAT は必要ない」と簡単に書かれていますが、広まるまではやはり必要なわけです。
しかし、そもそも IPv6 の根本にあった目的というのは「 NAT を使わずに公共のアドレス空間 ( 駅名に許される文字数 ) を拡張しよう」ということであり、 効率のアップは付加的な要素にすぎません。
この文章のもとになった Daniel J. Bernstein の主張は 「 NAT なしで IPv4 と IPv6 のコンピュータ間の通信をできるようにせよ ( = 地下鉄から乗っても、地上駅で降りられるようにせよ ) 」
というものでした。実はこれは技術的にかなりむずかしい提案です。
これに対する反論は「たとえそのようなものが可能になったとしても、
それはひどくぶかっこうな、効率の悪いネットワークになる」というものです。 また、どのみち IPv6 に対してはすでに多くの人が研究開発をしており、
いまさらそのメカニズムを ( かなり根本的な部分で ) 変えるのは ほとんど不可能でしょう 。
これはじつに暗い見通しです。 現在考えられている対策は 、IPv6 の機能面における圧倒的な利点を見せつけて
人々を呼びこもう、というものです。つまり IPv6 でしか使えないような「キラー・アプリケーション」をつくって 普及させ、IPv6 を使うことによって得られる「ごほうび」を用意すればいい、
というわけです。しかしこれは IPv6 の普及を促進はしますが、IPv4 の需要を減少させはしません。 IP v4 のアドレスは不足しつづけます。 なぜならいくら IPv6 のキラー・アプリケーションが便利であっても、それがすべて
IPv4 に置きかわるまでは、人は依然として IPv4 のサイトにもアクセスしたいからです。 むしろこれは問題の本質を見失わせかねません。
繰り返しますが、私たちが本当に解決しなければならない問題は「IPv6 が普及しないこと」ではないのです。
「 IPv4 の需要が増えつづけていること」が問題なのです。たとえ
IPv6 が普及しても、 ( その普及率が 100 % にならない限り ) IP v4 の需要を減らせないというのでは、 IP アドレス枯渇問題へのとり組みとしてはひどく効率の悪いやり方と言わざるをえません。
さらに強硬な考え方では、 「 もうすべての IP v4 サイトにアクセスできなくてもいいから、 途中で無理矢理にでも IPv6 のみに移行してしまえばよい 」というのがあります。 2002 年 8 月 14 日 、Randy Bush は 「 ngtrans プロジェクトの勝利を宣言する時がきた ...
IPv4 /IPv6 の混合ネットワークはもはや未来像ではない、それはもう現実にある」として ngtrans ワーキンググループを解散させました ( 日本語訳より ) 。
しかしこれは非常に危険です。この考え方に従うと、インターネット上には
お互いに通信できない 2つのコンピュータ ( IPv6 にしか対応していないコンピュータと IP v4 にしか対応していないコンピュータ ) が存在することになります。 こうなると、これはもはや 「 世界にただひとつのインターネット」ではありません。 インターネットは 2つに分断されてしまいます ( 図 9 ) 。
インターネットはもともとさまざまなネットワークが合体してできたものです。
その成立の過程で、人々はこれらに接続されているすべてのコンピュータが
統一したやり方で通信できるように多大な努力を費やしてきました。
それをまたここで莫大なコストをかけて 2つに分断しようとするのは、 よほど説得力のある理由がない限り受け入れられません。
djb の問いかけに対して 、Keith Moore は ngtrans メーリングリスト上で 以下のように反論しています 。
For the forseeable future , everyone will need some way to get access to the major services that are IP v4 - based : email , web , etc .
Many sites are already doing this with IPv4 NATs and / or application - level proxies so it's not difficult to conclude that this will continue to happen .
I expect that for a very long time most sites will get at least one IP v4 address which can be used for such NATs or proxies to support legacy applications .
However , there will also be large numbers of hosts that can only be directly accessed via IP v6 , precisely because the availability of large numbers of IP v6 addresses will make it possible to network those hosts in a standard way , when due to the address shortage it is not possible to do this with IP v4 .
And there will be applications that require use of IP v6 because they cannot work with NATted IPv4 .
It 's misleading to speak of IP v6 addresses as " second - class " .
IPv6 has a different domain of applicability than IPv4 .
IP v6 makes it possible to network a great many more devices than IPv4 , and it also makes it possible to run new kinds of applications .
I think it likely that we will see large numbers of IPv6 - capable " appliances " - cameras , power meters , game hardware , security systems , cell phones - anything that would benefit by remote control , monitoring , or access .
IPv6 is a failure only if you expect it to replace IP v4 in a short time .
It 's quite clear to all of us that this is n't going to happen .
But due to the address shortage and the presence of NATs , IP v4 is getting less and less flexible and more and more difficult to use for new applications .
IPv6 will be successful because it lets us do things that cannot be done with IPv4 .
" We are taking irregularities very seriously , " he said .
One of the worst cases has been in Paghman , a district west of Kabul , which is the stronghold of Abdul Rab Rassoul Sayyaf , a wartime faction leader and ally of President Hamid Karzai .
Ballot boxes from 95 polling stations in Paghman have been set aside for further inspection and 30 to 40 of those had been cleared for counting by Sunday , officials said .
The rest would be excluded from the count because of clear evidence of fraud , said a foreign observer who lacked permission to speak to reporters and asked not be identified .
Mr. Sayyaf is running for a seat in the Wolesi Jirga , or the lower house of Parliament , and is in fourth place with 2,105 votes .
Only 20 percent of the results for Kabul have been tabulated so far , but he is nevertheless well placed to win one of the 33 seats in the province .
Mr. Erben said that there were no signs of countrywide efforts to defraud the Afghan people but that there had been local efforts .
" I do not believe these irregularities in any way have affected the overall elections , but some of them have surely affected them locally , " he said .
Voters went to the polls Sept. 18 to choose representatives for Parliament from each province , and for members of provincial councils .
" If compared with other , similar , postconflict elections , I think that the level of irregularities that we are currently reviewing is extremely reasonable , " Mr. Erben said at a news conference .
