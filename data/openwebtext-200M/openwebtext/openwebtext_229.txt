Wanted : a XO heartbeat
So , I was a first day donor ( bought online about two hours in ) and finally got my XO this morning ... and it is DOA !
No lights , no power .
Like many of us , I 've been reading the blog posts from folks who'd gotten theirs already , and I 've been dying to get my hands on one .
You can only imagine the horror as it slowly set in that I was n't doing anything wrong , but that my XO was actually completely non-functional ( no charge lights or power up or errors , no activity at all ) .
It turns out , to the best of my knowledge , that mine is the first brick that 's been reported to OLPCNews .
Not a distinction I 'd like to have , but there it is .
After the initial fury / disappointment , I remembered that this is a charity organization , and I started to understand why they were hesitant to sell to consumers in the US .
Understandably , they do n't really have the infrastructure for consumer support since they 're not a commercial organization , and the usual anger I 'd have for tech - support on a bricked product melted away a bit at that thought , I felt a sort of peace .
I was on hold for about 50 minutes with OLPC support ( the hold music is a 4 minute loop , but at least it 's not Christmas music ! ) , and got a volunteer that had me try the standard things ( reseat the battery , power on without the ac adapter , etc ) , before taking my information and telling me that a technician would call me back at some point .
Due to the grass - roots nature of the project , I 'm resigning myself to the fact that a replacement is most likely a long way off , and that it most likely wo n't be here before Christmas .
But , it 's about the kids anyways , right ?
As long as the donated - half of my order gets there fine , I can wait a while .
And considering that I 'm the first report of a brick , they 're still doing a pretty great job .
My XO is dead .
Long live the XO !

Zen Master Ryokan lived in a poor little hut on a mountainside .
One moonlight night he came home and found a burglar looking for something to steal .
But Ryokan was a hermit who owned nothing .
“ Poor fellow , ” he said to the robber .
“ You have come a long way and have found nothing .
But I do n’t want you to leave me empty - handed .
Please take my clothes . ”
And Ryokan stripped , and handed the clothes to the robber .
“ Poor fellow , ” said naked Ryokan , going outdoors again when the inconsiderate robber had left , “ How I wish I could have given him this wonderful moon . ”
Zen Shorts is a tremendous children ’s book , featuring the enigmatic Panda Stillwater and the stories he tells to help children understand their lives .

Relaxing Island Holidays
When it comes to getting away from the stress of everyday life , there is nothing like a vacation on the beach .
There is just something about the ocean breeze and salt spray that makes a holiday on an island something you wo n't soon forget .
Because islands can be found in every ocean and near every continent , island holidays can vary widely .
You can lay on a beach or watch whales , study botany or shop native craft stalls .
It 's all up to you when you plan your island holidays .
North American islands include the Canadian east coast islands of Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland .
Island holidays to these areas will be filled with unspoiled natural beauty , cool , comfortable temperatures , and whale watching expeditions .
South of these regions is the little island of Bermuda off the eastern U.S. coast .
Bermuda is surrounded with hundreds of square miles of reef formations , making snorkeling an interesting activity there .
For the less adventurous , you can ride around in a glass bottom boat and view the beautiful undersea world .
Heading on south , we find the Carribean islands .
These have long been popular spots for tourists .
Here the beaches are white and sandy and the weather is very warm .
Up in the interior of these islands , you can find a wide variety of birds and other wildlife .
Cayman Islands , Jamaica , Barbados , the Virgin Islands , and many other spots make lovely island holidays .
Each island has it's own unique flavor and feel .
Europe has islands of all types nearby which make great spots for island holidays .
Visit the isles of Greece and you will see clear seas , quiet beaches , olive groves , and the simple life .
Corfu is the choice of those who like up - to - date restaurants and shopping , while Lefkas is popular with wind - surfers and sailors .
The Portuguese island of Madeira boasts beautiful weather and one of the lowest crime rates in the world .
The Canary Islands , off the coast of Spain , are a popular tourist spot for Europeans .
A new trend in island holidays is eco-tourism .
This is traveling in such a way that neither the earth nor the local people you are visiting is harmed in any way .
People who are drawn to eco -tourism may enjoy bird - watching , hiking , and other island activities that do not leave an impact on the area .
Everybody dreams of taking island holidays .
There are islands all over the world , each offering it's own cultural experience and natural wonders .
Many spots for island holidays are still unspoiled and secluded , while others are lively and exciting .
Island holidays offer a real diversion from your everyday life .
Twelve provinces in Afghanistan were declared opium poppy free this year .
Afghanistan is known for its large production of opium .
In the 1990s the Taliban regime banned the production of opium .
But after the US invasion and the following chaos the opium production grow to a new level even for Afghan Standards .
The idea of NATO soldiers protecting poppy fields against Islamic fundamentalists , was not very pleasing for western governments .
So they tried to find a way to get rid of the poppies without upsetting the Afghan farmers .
One way they came up with was to promise millions in developing aid to the regions .
Bribing people to do something is usually a bad idea .
The only motivation Money can provide is the motivation to get this Money .
So you end up with people doing smart moves to get the money but without paying respect to your intentions or goals .
And this happened of course in Afghanistan .
When the farmers tried to decide what to grow in the new season they simply switched from opium to cannabis .
You have to understand that most of the Afghan soil is pretty poor and cannabis and opium poppies grow good even on poor soil .
Especially Cannabis ( there really is a reason why this stuff is called weed ) .
Potheads might say that Cannabis is far more harmless than Opium .
But sponsoring Cannabis production is probably not what the UN and western governments intended .

Moments after the Republicans in the Senate heeded a call from the White House to vote against cloture on debate for the bill FUNDING THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES , Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller took the floor , visibly enraged .
Now , Rockefeller has to be one of the coolest heads in the Senate .
He is n't rolled easily .
In his speech , he denounced the BETRAYAL of his committee , including the ranking member , Kit Bond , by the White house , who , according to Rockefeller , put out the word that defeating the cloture vote was a matter of party loyalty .
Watching this exchange , it was difficult to understand WHY the White House would do this .
But a few of the captions given on C - span about the bill lent clues .
Here are some of the features in the bill :
Under the legislation , Bush would have to tell lawmakers about interrogation tactics at the [ secret CIA ] prisons , and the government would be required to publicly reveal total spending on intelligence programs , which is estimated to be about $ 44 billion annually .
Now THAT'S interesting .
Oversight that REQUIRES
Bush to tell lawmakers EXACTLY what happens at these " black sites . "
DEFEATED AS A MATTER OF PARTY LOYALTY .
But wait , there 's more !
Under the legislation , the maximum prison sentence would increase to 15 years from 10 years for those who disclose the identity of a covert agent , a response to administration officials revealing the secret status of CIA agent Valerie Plame .
Think that struck a nerve ?
Perhaps .
I intended to write this diary with rather cursory documentation , but I decided to see if I could find the actual bill .
And I did find it .
Here .
And Here .
Enroute to looking up the language of the bill , I found this article , which led me to the actual bill .
I was struck by the following passage :
The Bush administration has characterized the contested provisions as being " inconsistent with the need for the effective conduct of intelligence activities , " and threatening the security of " intelligence sources , methods , and activities from unauthorized disclosure . "
REALLY ?
REALLY ?
That 's the claim being made ?
Let 's take a look at specific language in the bill :
Title IV : Matters Relating to Elements of the Intelligence Community - Subtitle A : Office of the Director of National Intelligence - ( Sec. 401 ) Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to authorize the DNI , using National Intelligence Program funds , to : ( 1 ) direct the development , deployment , and utilization of systems related to the collection , processing , analysis , and dissemination of intelligence information ; and ( 2 ) transfer funds to address critical gaps in intelligence information sharing or access capabilities .
( Sec. 402 ) Allows the DNI to delegate to any Deputy Director of National Intelligence or the Chief Information Officer of the Intelligence Community the authority to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure .
Interesting eh ?
Read the whole Jurist piece .
Apparently , it 's all those inspector generals that Bush has a problem with .
It 's all the requirements to provide information to the Congress that he has a problem with .
But those are n't meant to have any impact on " intelligence sources , methods , and activities . "
No .
What THOSE parts of the bill address are ILLEGAL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL exercises of power :
Title III : Intelligence and General Intelligence Community Matters ( Sec. 302 ) Specifies that the authorization of appropriations by this Act shall not be deemed to constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States .
I recommend readers read the all the information given here about the bill .
If you read it all , you will see why Bush opposes this bill and has threatened to VETO IT .
It throws the " unitary executive " theory right out the window and REQUIRES active consultation with the Congress on intelligence policy .
Not only that , but it strips the Secretary of Defense of the CURRENT authority he has over an entire spy agency , installs inspector generals in several spy agencies that currently do not have one ( including the CIA ! ) , requires the DNI to consult with the Attorney General on issues that are constitutionally questionable , and prevents the CIA from assuming command over DOD personnel .
And that 's not even everything .
With regard to Bush 's sovereign pretensions , the bill cuts his balls off !
The bill installs checks and balances meant to prevent abuses of power .
Finally , I offer the Congressional Record that preceded the cloture vote and aftermath I saw on C - span .
Tucked in the middle of this , is an amendment offered by Republican Sen Collins .
And what do you think it 's about ?
The Senator from Maine [ Ms. Collins ] , for herself , Mr .
Lieberman , Mr. Carper , Mr. Coleman , and Mr. Akaka , proposes
an amendment numbered 847 to amendment No. 843 .
The amendment is as follows : ( Purpose :
To reaffirm the constitutional and statutory protections
accorded sealed domestic mail , and for other purposes )
A germane amendment , I would say !
But I digress .
The record shows what happened next .
Here is Rockefeller 's rage , after the cloture vote :
Mr. ROCKEFELLER .
Madam President , I have to declare myself absolutely
a series of things : furious , double - crossed , misled , minimized -- in
terms of my role as a Senator and as chairman of the Intelligence
Committee -- shocked by the arrogance of the technique that was used
between the White House and the minority leader to say to Republicans ,
after weeks in which Vice Chairman Bond and I worked out a compromise
on a managers ' amendment on which we worked in good faith -- I dropped
things he did not like , he dropped things I did not like -- but it was a
genuine effort .
Vice Chairman Bond , whom I respect greatly , stood here praising the
managers ' amendment .
Then the word came down from the White House -- not
from Vice Chairman Bond but from the White House - - through the minority
leader , that this vote was to be a test of Republican Party loyalty and
that therefore all Republicans were instructed to vote against it .
In all of my years in the Senate , and certainly all of my years on
the Intelligence Committee , I have never seen something so repugnant ,
putting politics over national security .
That is the bottom line .
Politics was put over national security .
It 's not an exaggeration .
This is n't a bill to fund the 16 spy agencies and implement recommendations from the 9/11 commission for NEXT year , it 's a bill for THIS YEAR , which was n't passed by the last Congress .
I only gave the first two paragraph's of Rockefeller 's furious reaction .
Click on the link and read it all .
The words on the page do n't begin to convey what I saw on C - span .
Rockefeller positively BLASTED the Republicans for this betrayal .
It 's worth giving some play to the Republican 's protests , since the answer to them is so damning .
McConnel claimed that invoking cloture was a ploy to deny the Republicans the opportunity to offer amendments .
Harry Reid spoke to that empty and false lament at the very end of the record given here :
Mr. REID .
Mr. President , I have the greatest respect for the senior
Senator from Missouri , but his facts are all messed up .
We tried to
bring this bill to the floor for a full debate .
In the Senate , as
everyone knows , you have to move to proceed to the bill .
We did that .
They objected .
We had to file cloture on even being able to proceed to
the bill .
They initially said :
We are not going to give you cloture .
Then they gave us cloture .
The purpose of that was to stall for time .
They voted to proceed .
I said immediately : Why waste the 30 hours ?
The
rule in the Senate is you have 30 hours after you complete the cloture .
I said : Offer amendments during this period of time .
Do n't waste the
time .
We could have done that last week .
I told everybody .
All the
staff knew that :
But no , nothing .
I indicated we would be happy to do
relevant amendments on this bill .
That 's not all Reid said .
He did n't dispense with the lame arguments the Republicans gave about amendments til the end of this speech .
Here 's some excerpts from his speech :
Mr. President , let 's call it the way it is .
Vice President Cheney
runs the intelligence operations of this administration .
He has for 6
years .
It apparently is not going to stop .
We could not even improve
the intelligence - gathering operations for the 16 agencies because it
may interfere with the Vice President .
Think he was pissed ?
Read the whole thing .
He brought up Scooter Libby , too .
To conclude , this story about the funding for our spy agencies which the WHITE HOUSE ordered shut down on a " party loyalty " vote , and turning mild mannered Jay Rockefeller into an inferno of fury on the Senate Floor , is something that was missed entirely by the MSM , but well worth reporting .
It will have consequences .
We might have moved another step closer to the realization that impeachment of Bush and Cheney really is the only option .
Make each and every one of these " party loyalists " acquit Bush in the face of a mountain of evidence for staggering crimes .
Let them ride loyalty to Bush all the way to defeat in 2008 .

State of the Platform
While 2007 was the seventh year that the PS2 had been out on store shelves , it proved that you can't keep a great console down .
Although much of the focus within the press has been centered upon the PS3 , Sony 's oldest console has been steadily selling consoles , month after month .
In fact , the slim designed PS2 sold more than 100,000 consoles every month of 2007 , consistently proving that the system has more life in it than most analysts are willing to give it credit for .
The increased longevity of the system could potentially be attributed to the cost of the PS3 .
Even though the newer system received two separate price drops , its cost was still somewhat prohibitive to some gamers that did n't have the funds for the system or a high definition television .
On the other hand , a Slim PS2 was extremely affordable at $ 129 , and its library of more than 1,400 games ( not counting backwards compatibility ) made it a very attractive alternative .
In fact , multiple studies conducted during the year by Nielsen showed that more gamers play the PS2 than any other console , current or last gen .
42 % of all gaming time is conducted on the PS2 , so the elder statesman of consoles is still showing its longevity .
On top of these statistics , the PS2 enjoyed another solid year of games from beginning to end .
Sports franchises such as Winning Eleven : Pro Evo Soccer , MLB '07 : The Show and Rugby 08 shone on the system , while older series made a return to the PS2 .
Lara Croft Tomb Raider : Anniversary , Syphon Filter : Dark Mirror and Burnout Dominator were standouts on the console .
This year was also incredible for RPGs on the PS2 , with Odin Sphere , Persona 3 and Rogue Galaxy anchoring a deep list of enjoyable games .
Furthermore , two Guitar Hero titles were released this year : Rocks The '80s and Legends of Rock , while Rock Band helped bring gamers ' rock and roll dreams to life .
Grand Theft Auto : Vice City Stories wreaked havoc across homes as well , while the largest PS2 game of the year , God of War II , re-established its dominance over the action genre .
Needless to say , Kratos ushered in proof that the PS2 could still provide gripping play .
There were a number of surprises that also landed on the PS2 , such as the quirky , but engaging real time strategy game GrimGrimoire .
Sony released three SingStar games , as well as two installments of its worldwide hit quiz franchise Buzz !
The Hot Shots brand left the golf course and hit the courts as Hot Shots Tennis served onto systems .
But perhaps the largest surprise of them all was the eventual release of Manhunt 2 , which courted controversy throughout its development process and was even banned for a period of time by the ESRB .
With a number of changes , the title was able to hit shelves in time for Halloween .
Although the amount of titles and large releases for the PS2 will probably slow down in 2008 , the reports of its demise may be exaggerated .

Bush 's Clever Cognitive Dissonance So , George W. Bush sees himself as the great defender of the U.S. Constitution .
Bookmark

In a Nov. 15 speech to the right - wing Federalist Society , the President embraced the Constitution ’s checks and balances as a vital protection against tyranny .
And he demanded that federal judges act as fair referees , not political or ideological partisans .
To many Americans who have been aghast at Bush ’s six - plus years of trampling the Constitution , such pronouncements might represent a textbook case of “ cognitive dissonance , ” a psychological term describing the uncomfortable tension when one ’s stated principles are at odds with one ’s actions .
For Bush , however , this divergence of words from behavior may be closer to the fable of the Emperor ’s New Clothes , when the monarch strutted about in invisible garments while his terrified subjects kept quiet about his nakedness .
In this case , the Washington press corps reported on Bush ’s speech as if the President were entirely sincere and left out contradictory facts .
For instance , there was silence about how Bush prevailed in Election 2000 by getting five partisan Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to stop a recount of votes in Florida that – if it had been allowed to tally all legally cast ballots – might well have put Al Gore in the White House .
Instead , the five Republican justices cast aside any sense of neutrality – and their own principles about avoiding federal interference in state decisions – to hammer together a twisted ruling that halted the recount and gave the election to George W. Bush .
[ For details , see our new book , Neck Deep . ]
Yet , in his Nov. 15 speech , Bush declared how important it was for judges to act as honest umpires .
“ When people see the umpire rooting for one team , public confidence in our courts is eroded , the sense of unfairness is heightened and our political debates are poisoned , ” Bush said .
“ So we will insist … on judges who call the game fairly . ”
Bush also declared that he was committed to the original intent of the Founders as expressed in the Constitution .
“ Tonight I will discuss a judicial philosophy that is based on what our Founders intended , ” Bush said .
“ The President 's oath of office commits him to do his best to ‘ preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . ’
I take these words seriously .
I believe these words mean what they say . ”
‘ Plenary ’ Powers
Yet , even many conservative legal scholars , such as former assistant attorney general Jack Goldsmith , believe that Bush and his inner circle have stretched the wartime powers of the President far beyond what the Founders intended or the Constitution allows .
Bush has asserted “ plenary ” – or unlimited – powers as Commander in Chief for the duration of the indefinite “ war on terror . ”
In Bush ’s view , that means he can ignore the rights that the Constitution grants to both citizens and other branches of the federal government .
While the Founders envisioned “ unalienable rights ” for all mankind , Bush claims that he can even waive habeas corpus , a principle dating back to the Middle Ages requiring the government to present evidence of a person ’s guilt .
Habeas was a right that the Founders considered so fundamental that they embedded it in the body of the Constitution .
But Bush ’s former White House counsel and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales once told the Senate Judiciary Committee , “ There is no expressed grant of habeas in the Constitution . ”
Gonzales ’s unorthodox view – which left Republican Sen. Arlen Specter sputtering in disbelief – also was n’t just theoretical .
Bush and his administration have locked up people , including American citizens , while denying them their day in court .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Gonzales Questions Habeas Corpus . ” ]
Bush also has formulated military commissions – first unilaterally and then through legislative action – that represent a parallel legal system operating outside the rules of the U.S. Constitution .
In effect , the Military Commissions Act of 2006 casts aside not only habeas corpus but the Sixth Amendment , which grants the accused “ the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury ” and the right to confront one ’s accusers .
By contrast , in Bush ’s system , there is no guarantee of either a speedy or a public trial .
Secrecy dominates in a process run by U.S. military officers whose careers depend on the favor of the Commander in Chief .
The military commissions also would apply not only to foreign “ unlawful enemy combatants ” but to “ any person ” who aids the enemy “ in breach of an allegiance or duty to the United States , ” presumably a reference to U.S. citizens .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Who Is ‘ Any Person ’ in Tribunal Law ? ” ]
In his warrantless wiretapping program , Bush also has brushed aside the Fourth Amendment , which requires that the government establish “ probable cause ” before it can conduct searches of Americans .
In his wiretapping operation , Bush ignored , too , the specific legal requirements of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Bush ’s approval of harsh interrogation tactics , including simulated drowning by “ water - boarding , ” also has made a mockery of the Eighth Amendment and its ban on “ cruel and unusual punishments , ” not to mention federal statutes prohibiting torture .
Unitary Executive Still , Bush ’s Nov. 15 speech talked glowingly of the constitutional “ checks and balances ” as a guard against tyranny .
“ When the Founders drafted the Constitution , they had a clear understanding of tyranny , ” Bush said .
“ They also had a clear idea about how to prevent it from ever taking root in America .
Their solution was to separate the government 's powers into three co-equal branches : the executive , the legislature , and the judiciary . …
“ Each serves as a check on the others .
And to preserve our liberty , each must meet its responsibilities – and resist the temptation to encroach on the powers the Constitution accords to others . ”
But for the past six years , Bush has asserted his right as “ unitary executive ” to ignore any law that he chooses by asserting his " plenary " powers and attaching “ signing statements . ”
In effect , if one examines Bush ’s claims of unlimited executive power – and overlays that with a “ war on terror ” of indefinite duration – a fair conclusion is that the President has , in effect , eliminated both the " checks and balances " and the “ unalienable rights ” that the Founders enshrined in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
Under Bush ’s theories , constitutional rights can be selectively denied by one person , him .
Yet , in his Federalist Society speech , Bush was the rock - ribbed protector of the Founders ’ dream of a constitutional Republic .
He chided his political opponents for their more flexible interpretation of the Constitution .
“ Advocates of a more active role for judges sometimes talk of a ‘ living Constitution , ’ ” Bush said .
“ In practice , a living Constitution means whatever these activists want it to mean .
They forgot that our Constitution lives because we respect it enough to adhere to its words . ”
But what Bush has sought in key federal judicial appointments , including his Supreme Court selections of John Roberts and Samuel Alito , are judges who will predictably assent to Bush ’s extraordinary assertion of presidential powers , regardless of the words in the Constitution or the intent of the Founders .
Cognitive Dissonance
In a broader sense , Bush ’s Nov. 15 speech reflected what has been a core rhetorical device of the modern American Right , the clever use of cognitive dissonance – the confident assertion of positions that fly in the face of reality .
I first encountered this tactic in 1981 when President Ronald Reagan sought to frustrate the intent of government policies from the 1970s by appointing individuals who were hostile to those goals but who claimed to embrace the same principles .
For instance , Reagan disdained President Jimmy Carter ’s emphasis on “ human rights ” but instead of making a complete break , Reagan appointed Ernest Lefever as the State Department ’s human rights pointman .
Though Reagan and the Right hailed Lefever as a champion of human rights , the nomination foundered after critics , including his own family members , presented evidence of his racial prejudices and fondness for South Africa ’s apartheid government .
( After Lefever ’s nomination was pulled , Reagan turned to a more astute practitioner of this technique , a bright and aspiring neoconservative named Elliott Abrams . )
In dealing with environmental issues , Reagan took a similar tack .
Instead of directly challenging environmental policies enacted during the previous decade , he appointed right - wing “ environmentalists ” who talked about their love of nature while quietly dismantling regulatory protections .
What the Right – and especially the neocons – drew from these experiences was that the Washington press corps could be tough when contesting some narrow falsehood or a slight hypocrisy , but would ignore audacious misrepresentations , at least when they came from Republicans backed by aggressive right - wing media attack groups .
Bush has proved to be a master of this technique because he shows even fewer scrupples than the average politician in making claims that are at clear variance with the truth .
For instance , in his last two addresses to the United Nations General Assembly , Bush has hailed the U.N. ’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights although its tenets are in contradiction of his claims that he can kill , kidnap , detain , torture and spy on anyone of his choosing anywhere in the world .
Nevertheless , Bush displayed a well - founded confidence that the U.S. press corps would n’t challenge him on these obvious hypocrisies – and he was right .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Bush to World : Up Is Down . ” ]
Indeed , one of the most successful features of Bush ’s presidency may be his ability to exploit cognitive dissonance to avoid accountability for his actions .
While Bush does n’t blush when his actions belie his words , the American political system ca n’t seem to cope , incapable of either reconciling Bush ’s dishonesty or enforcing any accountability upon him .
The national press corps and other Washington institutions – like the emperor ’s subjects in the old fable – try as best they can to ignore the obvious .

The mainstream media is dominated by a handful of mega corporations who control what many of us hear , read , and believe .
The propaganda masters are censoring and suppressing the truth from the American people .
There are many reporters who know the truth but dare not talk or write about it , and what some report they do n’t even believe themselves .
Those who are courageous enough to stand up to the establishment are often ridiculed , intimidated , and blocked by editors and producers who are acting as gatekeepers to the truth .
There have been calls for the arrests and even death of those who criticize the government .
You know you have slipped into a fascist dictatorship when those who dissent are treated like traitors , terrorists , and enemies of the state .
We are being brainwashed with all the propaganda that we are subjected to in our everyday lives in an effort to control our minds and shift us into massive groupthink .
We are being told that we are spreading democracy around the world while our own freedoms are being systematically taken away .
There is a war on the truth , and we are partly to blame as we have lost our respect for genuine news .
Dissent is an important ingredient in any free society , yet there is an effort to silence those who criticize the government .
Through propaganda , the global elite wish to control our thoughts and perceptions .
Just as there is an assault on our personnel freedoms , there is war on the freedom of the press .
When journalists are threatened for doing their jobs , the big loser is the free flow of information and ultimately the truth .
The Founding Fathers envisioned the press as being independent , reporting the facts and uncovering the truth .
Instead , it has become a circus of entertainment and theater mixed in with spin , lies , and disinformation .
The Bush administration has been caught paying actors and journalists to appear in and write propaganda pieces .
Television stations are using prepackaged news releases produced by corporate and governmental groups without such facts being disclosed .
It is clear that we can no longer trust the mainstream media to hold the government accountable .
The Bush administration is spending millions , paying off journalists and producing fake news spots to promote their agenda .
Some $ 10 million was spent in a propaganda - like advertising campaign to push President Bush ’s Social Security plan .
Fake news reports were also put out to promote his Medicare prescription drug program , with production company employees masquerading as reporters .
These mock prepackaged reports are distributed to broadcast outlets across the country and inserted into local news casts .
They look so authentic that most would mistake it for a real piece of independent journalism , not partisan propaganda politics .
They are paying journalists and reporters to further advance the government ’s agenda .
One of the best examples is commentator Armstrong Williams who was paid $ 240,000 by the Department of Education to help promote Bush ’s No Child Left Behind .
Maggie Gallagher also received tens of thousands of dollars from the Department of Health and Human Services to promote Bush ’s marriage initiative .
The list goes on with the likes of Jeff Gannon , Michael McManus , and Karen Ryan , and these are only a few who were caught .
A very recent example of fake news occurred during a FEMA - orchestrated news conference which took place during the recent fires that ravaged Southern California .
By all accounts , it had the makings of a real news conference , but the only thing missing was real reporters .
Some of FEMA ’s employees posed as reporters , asking softball questions that were carried live by some news stations .

But they confirmed in a recent interview that the correct amount for that year ’s pension contribution was zero , which appeared in an actuarial report .
They explained that the conflicting figures elsewhere had been inflated by other items , like health care contributions .
If New Jersey violated federal securities , tax or other rules , it could be forced to make up some of the contributions .
The Internal Revenue Service has very specific rules against mixing pension money with money for other uses , like health care .
Federal securities law also requires bond issuers to provide complete and accurate financial information .
The New Jersey Education Association has sued the state for failing to put enough money into the teachers ’ pension fund .
The lawsuit does not describe all the accounting maneuvers , but a State Superior Court judge has held that the case , now scheduled for trial in May , can proceed .
State law requires New Jersey ’s seven pension plans , large and small , for various types of public employees , to be funded according to actuarial standards .
Over the last decade , though , the Legislature has passed , and various governors have signed , a series of amendments to statutes that allow smaller contributions or none .
These were justified by various maneuvers and approved with little scrutiny .
In interviews , officials of the Treasury said the changes were made at the behest of the Legislature , while legislators faulted the Treasury .
Donald T. DiFrancesco , the acting governor in 2001 , when the Legislature approved an expensive pension increase for teachers and other state employees , said he recalled that “ people thought it was good public policy , ” devised to attract the best people .
He said he did not think the measure was considered financially unsound and did not recall anyone challenging it or calling it improper .
The state ’s practices have nevertheless left its retirement system in a much more perilous condition than is widely understood .
“ If people ran their households like this , they ’d be in bankruptcy , ” said Lynn E. Turner , a former chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission .
“ If businesses did , the best example is the old steel mills when they got so far behind and did n’t fund their pensions as they should have .
It tipped them into bankruptcy . ”
Suspicious timing
So , was Gonzales ’ resignation yesterday specifically timed to happen just as the _Daily Show_ started a two week hiatus ?
Inquiring ( and very disappointed ) minds would like to know .
Not even to mention the revelations about Larry Craig ’s bathroom misdemeanours .
It ’s _very suspicious_ that the court judgment should have been handed down on August 8 – but that _Roll Call_ should only have published the details yesterday .
I seem to recall that the last time the _Daily Show_ went on holiday , there was a similar outbreak of political scandals ( the Libby case judgement etc ) .
As they say , developing …

Finally the time has come for Beer Brewing Bender to fulfill his destiny .
Beer making time !
The beer we are making is made from a kit bought from the local brewing supply place ( Brewcraft in Mt Eden http://www.ebrewcraft.co.nz across the road from Galbraiths pub http://www.alehouse.co.nz).
The different things you need are shown above .
First Bender and I had to go do some research at my favourite local pub , Galbraiths .
He is looking pissed off because 1 , I did n't get him a drink before taking the picture and 2 , he needed phone books to stand on to reach the bar .
His extending legs were broken that day .
In the middle picture above you can see most of the things you need to make beer .
Sugar .
Usually you 'd use dextrose but in this case I am using something called an enhancer .
This is a mixture of sugar , malt and hops .
This is supposed to give the beer a fuller flavour than just sugar alone .
Tin of beer concentrate and yeast .
These come together as a package .
Sterilising power sachets .
You mix these with water and use them to clean the fermenter , bottles and all the equipment you use .
Hydrometer and measuring cylinder .
This is used to measure the specific gravity of the beer .
Mixing spoon .
Sugar tablets .
Used when bottling to add the last bit of sugar to the beer before conditioning .
Fermenter .
With airlock and temperature strip .
One of the most important things is everything has to be very clean .
Wash everything then carefully sterilise everything that will come in contact with the brewing beer .
When everything is sterilised we can start mixing the ingredients .
First you need to sit the can of concentrate in hot water for 10 minutes or so to make it more runny .
Even then it is the consistency of honey .
It also has the taste of beer flavored honey .
In fact for a second I was seriously considering buying some just to spread on my toast in the mornings .
Woo !
Beer for breakfast !
Once the can has heated up you transfer it into the fermenter .
Next you mix up the sugar / enhancer with 2L of hot water .
Sugar will dissolve easily but the enhancer you need to mix in carefully to avoid it forming lumps .
I mix it a bit at a time in the tin the concentrate came in then transfer that to the fermenter .
Once the sugar / enhancer is thoroughly mixed in with the concentrate you fill up the fermenter to just under 23L with water .
You must make sure the temperature is between 18 - 28 C to avoid killing the yeast which is added next .
The yeast is simply sprinkled into the top of the barrel then mixed in .
I mixed the concentrate and sugar with the fermenter on my kitchen bench .
Then I placed the fermenter inside Bender 's body before adding the rest of the water .
Once all the water and yeast is added you put the lid onto the fermenter .
This has a rubber seal to give a good airtight fit .
In the top of the fermenter is a hole to which is added an airlock .
The airlock is a bent plastic tube you half fill with water .
As the beer ferments it gives off bubbles of CO2 gas .
This gas bubbles out of the airlock but no air can get in .
In the second picture I am taking a sample of the mixture before any fermentation has begun .
If you take a specific gravity ( SG ) reading at the start and another at the end of fermentation you can calculate the alcohol content of your beer .
I did feel a little dodgy taking that sample given where the tap is .
Bender did n't seem to mind .
With a sample in the measuring cylinder you float the hydrometer in it .
This floats at different levels depending on how much sugar there is in the mixture .
As the yeast converts the sugars into alcohol the SG changes .
You can tell when the fermentation is over when the SG value remains constant .
As the beer is fermenting you take periodic readings to follow it 's progress .
The initial reading I got was a SG of 1.034 .
I will add further updates as the brewing continues .
December 22nd 2007
Bender is n't happy .
For some reason the beer is n't bubbling .
This could be due to several things .
1 , the mixture was too hot before adding the yeast and it died in the hot conditions .
Or 2 , the airtight fermenter is n't actually airtight .
I took a SG reading though and it has dropped .
From 1.034 to 1.014 so it seems something is happening .
The instructions say you bottle when the reading has been stable at around 1.006 for a few days .
I shall keep going and see if it does indeed continue to drop .
I also checked the seal around the lid of the fermenter and found that where the two sides of the moulded plastic container join there was a ridge of plastic .
This might be preventing the 0 - ring in the lid from sealing properly so I carefully cut this away with a sharp knife .
Hopefully now the container will pressurise correctly .
More updates to follow .
December 30th 2007
Bender 's bubbly personality finally came through !
After making sure the fermentor was sealing correctly the beer did start bubbling through the airlock .
This continued for quite a few days but has now slowed considerably .
A SG reading shows the beer is not quite ready for bottling by giving a reading of 1.008 .
Bottling has to be done once the beer goes below 1.006 according to the instructions otherwise there is a chance the bottles will over pressurise when the final amount of sugar is added and they could explode !
I will give it another day or two then take another reading .
If it has stopped changing I will bottle it despite the reading being a touch high .
January 2nd 2008
The day finally arrived .
Bottling day !
The SG readings finally settled on 1.006 ( just ) and stabilised so today I bottled the beer .
The procedure is something as follows :
1. Clean and sterilise the bottles .
I use 750 mL plastic PET bottles .
A batch of beer will fill 30 of them .
2 . To each bottle add sugar .
I use sugar drops and add two per bottle ( see below ) .
The additional sugar is to allow for extra fermentation in the bottle .
This is what causes the beer to have bubbles .
3 . Remove the airlock from the top of the fermenter to allow the beer to flow freely .
4 . Warm your hands ( Not normally necessary but Bender insisted on this step before letting me near his tap ) .
5 . Slowly , with each bottle tilted to avoid frothing , fill each bottle from the tap .
6 . Tightly cap each bottle .
Once all the bottles are full and the caps tightened we are almost done .
Now we must wait .
The bottles must be stored somewhere warm for 5 days .
This is to allow the secondary fermentation to take place .
This pressurises each bottle with CO2 gas .
After the 5 days you move the beer somewhere cooler to allow it to mature .
You can supposedly start drinking the beer after a week but generally the longer you leave it the better .
The plastic bottles however probably limit it to a year or so before they start leaking .
By the way I did have a little taste of the beer before I bottled it .
It was n't totally unpleasant .
It tastes very green but it had a fair amount of body .
Yeasty with maybe just a hint of Mom's Old - Fashioned Robot Oil !
January 7th 2008
The bottles have now all pressurised in the warm and are ready to be put away in the cool until ready to be tasted !
As one final finishing touch each bottle was given it 's own Bendërbrau label .
Many thanks to my friend Jen who did the graphics for the labels for me .
I did have a little problem printing them out however as my crappy HP printed decided to die .
I ' fixed ' it however .
With my oxy - acetylene welding / cutting torch ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5V8sKjMUF0)!
And I tell you , that felt great !
Now all there is left to do is drink it once it has matured !

As governor of Arkansas five years ago , Mike Huckabee joined a bipartisan chorus of politicians who concluded that the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba was bad for businesses .
Now that he ’s a top - tier candidate for president , Huckabee has decided he favors the embargo -- so much so that he vowed Monday to outdo even President Bush in strangling the regime of Cuban President Fidel Castro and punishing those who do business there .
It was a change of heart sure to please hard - liners among the Cuban exiles who could make up 10 % or more of the electorate in Florida ’s crucial Jan. 29 Republican primary .
But it also reflected the latest move by a once - obscure candidate now grappling with how to transform a burst of momentum into a sustainable bid for the White House .
Huckabee ’s Cuba flip - flop comes just days after he released a new , hard - line plan on illegal immigration described as “ radical ” by some of the same immigrant - rights advocates who once lauded him for more liberal views .
As governor , Huckabee supported in - state college tuition for children of illegal immigrants and stood up for illegal workers caught in a raid of a meatpacking plant .
Now he wants all illegal immigrants to return to their native countries within 120 days .
Huckabee all but acknowledged the political expediency of his shifting views as he stood Monday in a Cuban restaurant in Miami and explained why he wrote a letter to Bush in 2002 describing how the Cuba trade embargo was hurting Arkansas rice growers .
Advertisement
“ Rather than seeing it as some huge change , I would call it , rather , the simple reality that I ’m running for president of the United States , not for reelection as governor of Arkansas , ” he said .
“ I ’ve got to look at this as an issue that touches the whole country . ”
Huckabee has rocketed to the front of the GOP pack by emphasizing his roots as a plain - spoken Southern Baptist preacher with staunchly conservative views .
A CNN survey released Monday puts him in a statistical tie nationally with GOP front - runner Rudolph W. Giuliani .
But Huckabee ’s evolving views on certain issues are giving his rivals for the Republican nomination ammunition as they try to halt his rise .
On Monday in Miami , former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee criticized Huckabee for changing his stance on Cuba “ on a dime to appeal to a particular group of people right before an election , ” according to the Associated Press .
Advertisement
The night before -- when the GOP candidates jockeyed to appear toughest on Castro during a debate on the Spanish - language network Univision -- Thompson ’s campaign gave reporters quotes from Huckabee ’s 2002 letter .
Thompson had hoped to win support from the social conservatives flocking to Huckabee .
Huckabee on Monday won an endorsement from Marco Rubio , Florida ’s Cuban American state House speaker , handing the upstart candidate instant cachet in a community that some of his rivals have been courting for years .
He said his decision was based largely on Huckabee ’s new views on Cuba .
Rubio , who has been wooed by all the major GOP candidates , said he decided to back Huckabee after searching for “ someone that will fight for what they truly believe in the depths of their heart . ”
The letter Huckabee wrote in 2002 reportedly argued that the embargo “ continues to harm our own agricultural and business interests here at home and has certainly not helped the people of Cuba . ”
Advertisement
His views on Monday were equally firm in the opposite direction , as he vowed , if elected president , to veto any effort to end the sanctions .
Huckabee pledged to adhere to provisions of a 1996 law that would permit U.S. citizens to sue in American courts for property taken from them during the 1959 Cuban revolution .
Those lawsuits could threaten European businesses with holdings on the island .
Bush and President Clinton have routinely avoided conflict on the issue by suspending those provisions of the 1996 law .
“ I really was n’t that aware of a lot of the issues that exist between Cuba and the United States , ” Huckabee said Monday , adding that his flexibility on policy should be viewed as a good thing .
Advertisement
“ I ’ll be the first to tell you I ’m always subject -- and I hope we all are -- to learning , to growing , and never being so stubborn and maybe bull - headed , ” he said .
Huckabee appears to be applying that same approach to his views on immigration , another issue that is important to conservative voters in early GOP contests and an area where he is being attacked by his opponents .
Like former New York Mayor Giuliani , Huckabee has long been viewed with admiration among advocates for immigrants .
He supported legislation two years ago in Arkansas that would have given in - state tuition to certain children of illegal immigrants .
And two years ago he reacted with outrage after federal agents raided an Arkadelphia , Ark. , poultry plant and arrested and deported many Mexican workers .
Huckabee was incensed that federal authorities had separated many parents from their children , and he called for a White House investigation .
Advertisement
“ Our first priority should be to secure our borders .
I ’m less threatened by people who cross the line to make beds , pick tomatoes , or pluck chickens as I am by people like those in Canada making 3 - ton bombs , ” he said in an e-mail to The Times last year .
“ While we should certainly enforce the law , we need to prioritize . ”
He called in the e-mail for a “ process that avoids amnesty , but does provide a path for workers to become legal by paying a fine , getting in the back of the line to register . ”
But Frank Sharry , executive director of the National Immigration Forum , an immigrant rights group , said he was stunned last week when Huckabee released a new plan calling for all illegal workers to register with federal authorities and return to their native countries within 120 days .
Those who did would face no penalty under Huckabee ’s plan if they later applied to immigrate to or visit the United States .
Those who did not return home would be barred , when caught , from future reentry to the United States for 10 years .
“ To me , it ’s like night and day , ” Sharry said .
“ One day he ’s saying children of [ illegal ] immigrants should go to college , and the next day he ’s saying there should be mass expulsion . ”
Advertisement
Huckabee on Monday said his anger over the Arkadelphia raid stemmed from the fact that local authorities were not told in advance so they could make preparations for the children who were left alone when their parents were arrested and deported .
Often , illegal workers have children who were born on U.S. soil and are therefore citizens .
He said raiding a business employing “ vast amounts ” of illegal workers was a “ legitimate thing to do ” as long as local officials knew in advance .

A growing number of oil - industry chieftains are endorsing an idea long deemed fringe :
The world is approaching a practical limit to the number of barrels of crude oil that can be pumped every day .
Some predict that , despite the world 's fast - growing thirst for oil , producers could hit that ceiling as soon as 2012 .
This rough limit -- which two senior industry officials recently pegged at about 100 million barrels a day -- is well short of global demand projections over the next few decades .
Current production is about 85 million ...

The rally was called to mark the first anniversary of his landslide election victory .
' Institutionalise freedom '
This was a task , he said , which required " patience and forbearance " .
" Desired and legitimate freedom may come under attack from those who disagree with the essence of freedom and who are by nature attached to prejudices and what they are used to ...
They think that the only way they can survive is through the elimination of their rival , " said the Iranian President .
Religion not to contradict freedom
Mr Khatami said that the continuing prestige of religion in Iranian society would rely on its not coming into contradiction with the principles of freedom .
" Let me declare my belief clearly .
The destiny of the religion 's social prestige today and tomorrow will depend on our interpretation of the religion in a manner which would not contradict freedom , " he said .
" Whenever in history a religion has faced freedom , it has been the religion which has sustained damage .
Even if justice has contradicted freedom , justice has suffered .
When progress and construction have curtailed freedom , they have been undermined . "
Mr Khatami told the rally that " freedom does not mean anarchy ; and limiting freedom does not mean dictatorship . "
" The civil society , which we keep talking about , and which human wisdom over the years has come to believe will serve the people 's interest in the best possible manner , is the sort of civil society which will guarantee freedom within the framework of the law .
But the law itself must officially recognise the principle of freedom . "
" The foundation of our law and our system is the Constitution , which has recognised the people 's right to be in charge of their own destiny , and has also recognised our society 's right to fundamental freedom .
Only by securing freedom under the umbrella of law , one can establish the legitimate and desirable freedom in society , " he said .
' Freedom of the opposition '
President Khatami defended the right of the opposition to be heard , saying that " when we speak of freedom we mean the freedom of the opposition .
" It is no freedom if only the people who agree with those in power and with their ways and means are free .
Freedom means the freedom of the opposition .
" The art of government is not to eliminate the opposition from the arena .
The art of government is to compel even its own opposition to behave within the framework of the law .
" There is a mutual right between the state and the people here .
The state has the right to expect the citizens , its supporters and the opposition , to behave and express their views in the framework of the law .
" And the people have the right , within the framework of the law , to expect their freedoms from the government , " said Mr Khatami .

Craig leaves accidental voice mail reconsidering resignation RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday September 5 , 2007
Print This Email
This A half - hour before his Saturday news conference announcing his plans to resign , Sen. Larry Craig left a voice mail -- at a number he apparently did n't intend to dial -- stating his intent to possibly rethink the decision .
Roll Call obtained the following voicemail ( mp3 ) from a Washington D.C. resident .
" Yes , Billy , this is Larry Craig calling .
You can reach me on my cell .
Arlen Specter is now willing to come out in my defense , arguing that it appears , by all that he knows , that Ive been railroaded and all of that .
Having all of that , weve reshaped my statement a little bit to say it is my intent to resign on Sept. 30 .
 I think it is very important for you to make as bold a statement as you are comfortable with this afternoon and I would hope you could make it in front of the cameras .
I think it would help drive the story that I am willing to fight , that Ive got quality people out there fighting in my defense , and that this thing could take a new turn or a new shape ; it has that potential . 
David M. Drucker and Emily Pierce write for Roll Call , " Although it could not be determined who the Senator was trying to reach when he incorrectly dialed the phone number , Craig recently hired Washington , D.C. , lawyer Billy Martin , who put out a statement Saturday in support of his new client . "
Excerpts from Roll Call article : # Craig spokesman Dan Whiting confirmed Tuesday that the incoming phone number identified by the cell phone where the voice mail was left is in fact the Senators cell number .
The cell phones owner , who requested anonymity , said Craigs number has shown up on his phone as a missed call a handful of times over the past several weeks , but said that this was the first time the Senator left a message .
But Whiting dismissed any notion that Craigs statements on the message suggest that he may be strategizing to clear his name for the purpose of jettisoning his planned resignation and remaining in the Senate .
Whiting said Craig delayed his resignation by one month primarily to give his staff time to find other jobs and allow his as - yet - to - be appointed successor to benefit from an orderly transition .
 Larry said what he said on Saturday .
He told his staff he intends to resign , and the staff is certainly preparing the office for the next Senator from Idaho ,  Whiting said .

Often when I discuss victim disarmament gun control with its supporters , I am confronted with the question .
“ Do you think we should allow people to own machine guns , F - 16’s or even nuclear weapons ? ”
I always answer “ Yes , of course ” .
To me , the question is not how deadly the weapon , but how its owner wishes to use it .
If someone wants to waste their time and money building a superweapon that they will then use peaceably , or just admire in a glass case , it is no skin off my nose .
After all , so long as they do n’t attack other people with them or damage other people ’s property , they have a perfect right to enjoy themselves however they wish .
Are there people who wish to own F - 16’s and nuclear weapons so that they can kill people ?
Definitely – members of the Armed Services Committees in Congress , for example .
But , without tax - payer funds how many of them could really afford to commission such weapons ?
Even with economies of scale , an F - 16 costs something like $ 10,000,000 to build and about $ 5,000 per hour in fuel and maintenance to fly .
Additionally , firing the weapons systems can cost up to $ 1,000,000 per sortie .
If forced to work productively to earn their keep , how many of people would have the free time to design , build and practice with such weapons ?
How many of them would settle for the reduced mayhem of a cruise missile when they can kill a larger number of people with a cheaper and more reliable low - tech truck - bomb made out of fertilizer ?
Let us be realistic : without government demand for them , I do n’t think nuclear weapons or even F - 16 ’s would exist .
They are expensive to build , and of limited use .
They require a significant amount of industrial infrastructure , including hundreds of factories , hundreds of engineers , and thousands of workers to build , maintain and support them .
In the absence of significant consumer demand for these superweapons , all those resources would be invested in other more profitable ventures , like the flying cars we were supposed to get by the year 2000 .
I honestly think the legality of the ownership of squad weapons or fighter jets or ICBMs is irrelevant .
A dedicated , would - be mass murderer will have an easier time killing a bunch of people with rifles , hand - guns or homemade bombs than with an F - 16 .
It is far better that we allow these weapons to fail on the market place than to outlaw their ownership .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Stable gasoline prices over the last two months have shielded U.S. consumers from the impact of galloping crude oil prices , but drivers will face more pain at the pump if the cost of crude remains high into next spring .
Retail gasoline prices have held in a tight range around $ 2.80 a gallon nationwide over the past two months amid a normal seasonal slowdown in road travel , even as the cost of crude oil has surged about 14 percent over the same period to a record over $ 85 a barrel .
The stability in gasoline prices prompted U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman last week to describe the U.S. economy as “ remarkably resilient ” in the face of surging oil prices .
But analysts expect gasoline prices could rise to a never - before - seen $ 3.50 or $ 4 a gallon if oil prices hold near current levels into next spring when drivers hit the roads in greater numbers .
That could further strain consumers already facing a housing slowdown .
“ Thus far we ’ve been relatively insulated from the effect of higher crude prices by the narrowing of spreads ( between crude oil and ) refined products , ” said Richard DeKaser , chief economist at National City Corp in Cleveland , Ohio .
“ If those spreads revert to normal and crude oil prices remain high there is going to be a definite retail impact . ”
As of Friday , crude oil futures CLc1 were up by over 14 percent since August 15 , driven higher by expectations of tighter supplies in the winter amid ongoing production restraint by OPEC .
However gasoline futures RBc1 have lagged crude oil , rising only 3.8 percent over the same period .
As a result , the spread between gasoline and crude oil has shrunk to $ 3.88 per barrel as of Friday , compared with over $ 20 for much of last summer and a peak $ 37.76 per barrel in mid-May -- when extensive refinery outages cut deeply into U.S. fuel inventories .
The potential surge in gasoline prices at the end of winter would come at a time when U.S. consumers are already facing a declining housing market in many parts of the country .
Higher energy prices probably will cut further into discretionary spending , even if energy prices have yet to gobble up as big a proportion of household budgets as they did in the 1970s energy crisis .
“ We cannot escape the reality that $ 80 oil induces consumers to practice energy conservation ( and ) modestly curtails ex-energy consumer spending , ” wrote energy analysts at Raymond James in a research note on Monday .
LOW STOCKPILES
U.S. gasoline stocks are more than 22 million barrels , or about 10 percent , lower than they were at the same time last year , according to U.S. government data .
The current weakness in gasoline prices relative to crude has prompted leading U.S. refiners including Valero , Marathon Oil and Chevron to warn investors that their profits will fall in the third quarter .
But analysts expect gasoline prices will rebound .
Average retail gasoline prices could surpass $ 3.50 per gallon next summer if crude oil prices hold at their current levels .
“ If we go though another spring and summer where U.S. refineries have trouble operating above 90 percent of capacity , I think we will finally see $ 4 gasoline in some places , ” said Stephen Schork , publisher of the Schork report , an energy futures newsletter .
SAVED BY A CORRECTION ?
The one hope for drivers could be a correction in the oil market , which some analysts believe is becoming overvalued .
Speculative investors have been buying crude oil and other commodities as a hedge against inflation and the declining value of the U.S. dollar .
“ A lot of this market is dependent on what happens this winter and where supplies are when we come out of it , ” said Eric Wittenauer of A.G. Edwards in St Louis .
“ If the winter is warm as it has been forecast , we could see a correction . ”
However any correction is likely to be limited by the rising cost of producing oil in non-OPEC countries and continued strong demand for crude oil .
OPEC itself raised its forecast for demand for its oil this winter on Monday , citing the resilience of the world economy despite the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States .

In the 1988 sci - fi novel Wetware by Rudy Rucker , a character wears a " heartshirt " - - a t- shirt that detects the wearer 's heart rate and displays it on the front .
It may have been futuristic 20 years ago , but today you could replace a good portion of your wardrobe with " smart " electronic clothing , thanks to innovations in MEMS ( Microelectromechanical Systems ) , carbon nanotubes , polymers , Kevlar , and more .
While much of the clothing is designed as health diagnostics tools or for the elderly , researchers and investors are also beginning to invest in " cool " smart fabrics , as long as consumer demand is there and the cost is right .
There are several techniques for creating smart fabrics .
For example , MEMS textiles usually contain tiny metal wires woven into the fabric , or wires as the actual fibers , that give the clothes electrical properties .
Despite the different approaches , most smart fabrics have a few things in common : they 're washable , comfortable , and make use of flexible electronic circuitry .
Here are a few examples of the best in Sci -Fi Fashion of 2007 :
Audio- Controlling Ski Jackets
Ski jackets made by Eleksen , Ltd. , uses touch - sensitive fabric controls to allow wearers to control iPods simply by touching parts of the " iJacket . "
By pushing two layers of the clothing together with their fingers , the wearer creates a closed circuit to issue a command .
The company is also investigating human - computer interface applications .
Falling Shirt
A shirt designed by Francis Tay and colleagues from the National University of Singapore can detect when a person falls , and wirelessly transmit the information to relatives via Bluetooth .
The shirt can measure the speed and tilt of the wearer , and will soon be able to predict falls as well as report them .
Cancer - detecting Bra
A smart bra developed by Elias Siores and colleagues from the University of Bolton is a low - risk , non-invasive , and simple method to detect breast cancer at a curable stage .
The bra uses a built - in microwave antenna and embedded microchips to collect data to generate computer images , which is easily interpreted , and cost - effective .
Temperature - Controlling Jackets
These jackets , designed by the Center for Biomimetic and Natural Technologies in the UK , adapt to changing temperatures by opening up thin spikes of wool when warm and shutting the wool spikes tight when cold .
The researchers actually got the idea from pinecones , which close when they become moist ( or sweaty ) at high temperatures , and open when the spikes dry at lower temperatures .
Heart - monitoring Underwear
Scientists from Philips Research in Germany have designed underwear that uses sensors woven into the fabric to detect the wearer 's heart rate .
Plus , if an abnormal heart rate is detected , the underwear calls 911 .
Keyboard Jackets
A denim jacket , designed by Emily Cooper and colleagues at MIT , doubles as a flexible music keyboard with keys that control miniature MIDI synthesizers .
When a finger touches an electrode on the fabric , the contact increases the electrode 's capacitance , creating the signal .
Cooper has also designed a musical potholder .
Multi-Purpose Health Harness
A bio-harness developed by Zephyr can detect a wearer 's heart beat , skin temperature , posture , activity and breathing rate .
The harness is a flexible fabric that is worn like a sash against the skin , which the company is marketing to amateur athletes , soldiers , patients undergoing drug tests , and the elderly .
Runner 's Shoe Insole
Zephyr has used the same technology to design a shoe sole that measure the size of a person 's step , which part of the foot a runner pushes off from and how fast their foot hits the ground .
The device is aimed at runners and patients recovering from knee or hip replacements .
Message - Displaying Jackets
A jacket developed by Nyx has built - in flexible display screens that can connect to a smartphone or PDA and display whatever message the wearer chooses .
Features include scrolling words , rotating messages , and a sound detector that allows the message to pulse to the beat of the music .
In the future , it may not be so far - fetched to think about people wearing entire computers ... we 'll see .

BANGKOK ( Reuters ) - Secret networks of dissident citizen reporters operating beneath the noses of government spies in army - ruled Myanmar are giving the world unprecedented glimpses of the biggest anti-junta protests in two decades .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
With foreign journalists barred from what is one of the world ’s most closed states , much of the worldwide media coverage is coming from exiled newshounds in countries such as Thailand and India -- and their clandestine contacts on the inside .
Technology ranging from the latest Internet gizmo to satellite uplinks to camera phones are ensuring pictures of the massed marches of monks and civilians and the response by security forces is on TV screens around the world in hours .
The contrast to Myanmar ’s last major uprising , in 1988 , could not be more stark .
Then , as many as 3,000 people were killed when soldiers opened fire on the crowds but it took days for the news -- let alone pictures or video footage -- to emerge .
“ The difference is night and day , ” said Dominic Faulder , a Bangkok - based British reporter during the 1988 uprising .
“ Now , the whole population are journalists on the move equipped with all sorts of information - capturing devices from telephones and video machinery that you just could n’t use in 1988 . ”
Then , Faulder said , all information went via the telex at Yangon ’s posh Strand Hotel , a single line that on one day accounted for 90 percent of all international calls , according to the government spies who came round the next day to find out why .
“ OUR MAN ON THE STREET ”
As troops fired warning shots at crowds in Yangon on Wednesday , “ citizen journalists ” in the masses seething through the city centre were sending their thoughts , pictures and video to international broadcasters such as CNN and the BBC .
More important , the news is beamed back in by satellite television and radio by exile news groups such as the Democratic Voice of Burma ( DVB ) , now one of the main ways Myanmar ’s 56 million people learn about events inside their own country .
DVB has its headquarters in Oslo and receives funding from several European Union countries .
The United States helps fund other dissident news - gathering organizations through its National Endowment for Democracy , one source of the generals ’ assertions that the protests are the result of outside agitation .
Apart from dissident news outlets , the only sources of news inside Myanmar are the junta ’s rigidly controlled state media , which , according to one man in Shan state , broadcast “ only pop singers and lies ” .
After curfews were announced in Yangon and Mandalay via loudspeakers mounted on trucks , the official New Light of Myanmar ran a front page article accusing the opposition of being “ rude ” and taunting monks who did not join protests .
“ It is not bed time , ” the protesters were quoted as shouting when abbots at one monastery shut their gates to indicate they were staying put .
“ Do you wish to be called nuns ? ” they continued .
“ You are hiding because you are afraid .
Want to wear bra ? ”
With the overwhelming response to my earlier Python Is Not Java post , I thought I ’d take a little time to be fair and point out that Java Is Not Python , either .
While Python is more powerful as a language , Java beats the crap out of it in the area of standards and specifications like JDBC , JNDI , and OSGi , to name just a few .
Of course , Python folks typically react with disdain towards such things , preferring in most cases to “ roll their own ” .
For Python , the only standards are PEPs and the standard library .
While a Java spec can run to hundreds of printed pages , a PEP is pretty much limited to what you can humanly read in a single web page , and the standard library is defined by its documentation and implementation , and only gets updated once a year or so .
In a way , the current flap in the Python community over standard library improvements versus language changes is a symptom of the cultural difference between Python and Java .
In the Java world , it ’s generally understood that there may be reasons to have multiple implementations of a specification , so the specification is the community focus rather than a single implementation .
It also is n’t necessarily assumed that once a specification is implemented , it becomes part of the Java platform .
( For one thing , nobody wants to wait around for a new platform version . )
Specifications themselves are an inherent part of Java , too .
Java has interfaces , Python does n’t .
Of course , larger frameworks like Zope , Twisted , and PEAK all have interfaces , but since they ’re not part of the language or standard library , for most Python developers it ’s as if they do n’t exist .
The existence of interfaces in Java means that the body of a specification can talk about named and rigorously defined kinds of objects , for whatever the specification is about .
Python specifications , by contrast , are often characterized by handwavy notions of the “ protocols ” that objects implement , or are merely documentation for an implementation .
As long as one is dealing with libraries , this can perhaps suffice .
But to create frameworks and platforms , it is n’t enough to specify what one implementation does .
You have to be able to talk about what implementations in general are supposed to do , because some of the users of a framework or platform will be creating their own implementations of needed functionality .
Consider OSGi , for example .
OSGi is the Open Services Gateway Initiative , and they ’ve defined a standard service platform for component - oriented , networked services .
Basically , an OSGi platform implementation lets you install software “ bundles ” .
Bundles can import classes from other bundles , or export them , with managed version dependencies .
They can be started or stopped , offer services to other bundles , and dynamically access services provided by other bundles .
This allows you to create customized applications , such as a web server bundle that is dynamically notified when any bundles offer servlets that it should serve .
OSGi is used in a variety of products and systems , including “ smart home ” applications , vehicle electronics , and service provisioning systems .
It ’s also used as the basis of the Eclipse IDE platform ’s “ plug - in ” system .
Currently , the Python world has nothing like it .
By comparison , Zope 2 ’s Products and Chandler ’s Parcels are crude toys .
By the very nature of what something like OSGi does , it has to be specified in terms of interfaces .
There are multiple platform implementations that load bundles , and of course there are many , many bundles , and services offered by those bundles .
Without interfaces , there would be “ no there there ” – nothing to exist or document .
And many Python developers would say , “ So what ?
We don ’ need no stinkin’ standards . ”
Maybe especially not 600 - page Java standards like OSGi .
Arguably , only a handful of application platforms in the Python world are complex enough to truly need something like OSGi anyway : mainly IDEs , application servers , and extensible application platforms ( like Chandler ) .
But , in the Java world , you do n’t have to “ truly need ” something in order to be able to benefit from it .
If you use functionality of that kind , the sensible thing to do is to follow the standard , either by dropping in an existing implementation , or using your own mocked - up subset of the standard until you need a more sophisticated implementation .
Either way , you have an established model to follow .
In this way , a savvy Java developer can avoid much of the head - scratching and prototyping that a Python developer would be doing in order to flesh out their needs in a given application area .
Instead of reinventing the concept of the wheel , the Java developer just writes an IWheel implementation .
Of course , individual Python developers can and do pilfer from Java specs .
I myself make it a particular point to examine the state - of - the - art in Java before undertaking the design of any complex facility for Python .
I then have to go through a fairly lengthy process of “ Pythonification ” , often involving multiple rewrites , to get the API truly Pythonic .
But when I ’m done , my implementation and interfaces are still not a standard in the Python world .
Nobody is going to know about what I did , and the next guy over is going to either do the same thing I did , or throw together their own little thing .
Individually , perhaps , we are all productive , but our collective productivity is lower in the Python community , because we are all forced to reinvent ‘ IWheel ’ , up until there ’s a ‘ Wheel ’ implementation in the standard library .
And of course that implementation will have to be all things to all people , or odds are good that it wo n’t actually get into the standard library .
And , by a curious coincidence , a surprising number of modules adopted by the standard library are in fact derived from equivalent Java interfaces or implementations !
For example the ‘ logging ’ module comes from log4j , the ‘ threading ’ module mimics Java thread classes , and ‘ unitttest ’ is a JUnit clone .
So , does something about the Java language inherently inspire better specifications ?
Could it be that this is a byproduct of having , and consistently using , interfaces ?
Maybe the fact that Java forces you to think about interfaces ( at least a little ) , encourages Java architects to design better frameworks ?
More to the point , is there any way we can leverage this characteristic in Python , such that we ’re not always begging scraps from Java ’s table ?
Maybe that will never happen , perhaps because the Python community simply does n’t have the critical mass needed to have enough of the right people to design such specs .
Or maybe kneejerk reactions against interfaces as “ creeping static - ism ” will keep the community from adopting the current de-facto standards for interfaces that exist in Zope , Twisted and PEAK .
Who can say ?
As for me , I ’ll just keep on picking my scraps of Java where I can find them , and working towards the day when Python wo n’t have to rely on interfaces defined by ad - hoc description , and specifications defined by their implementation .

The far - right British National Party is being investigated over alleged spying , money laundering and theft , it was revealed last night .
A Labour MP used Parliamentary privilege to publish a dossier lifting the lid on " apparent illegal activity and financial irregularities " in the BNP .
Jon Cruddas , who came second in Labour 's deputy leadership contest , said he had passed on the claims of " systematic illegality " to the police and the Electoral Commission for investigation .
The dossier claims the BNP 's leader Nick Griffin orchestrated the " illegal spying " and sanctioned a covert raid on the home of a BNP councillor , who later resigned from the party .
Sadie Graham , a councillor in Broxtowe , Notts , quit the party along with seven others following the campaign of bugging , the House of Commons was told .
Mr Cruddas , whose own constituency of Dagenham in east London is under threat from rising support for the far - right party , said that during two meetings over the last week , Mr Griffin is " believed to have admitted to some device being used and insisted he would not hesitate to use such devices and methods in the future .
" The BNP has boasted this information was gleaned by its intelligence department .
This department consists of former police officers from the apartheid South Africa . "
Mr Cruddas accused members of the BNP 's security division , under " instructions from leader Nick Griffin , " of entering Miss Graham 's home " by deception , " removing property including her computer and of " trawling through " it , in breach of data protection laws .
The MP 's claims are protected from libel because they were made in the Commons .
It is rare for MPs to use parliamentary privilege to make accusations of this nature .
Scroll down for more
The alleged financial irregularities are contained in a 20 page dossier by the anti-fascist Searchlight Information Services .
Mr Cruddas said : " What 's been uncovered in the internal workings of the BNP appears to be systematic illegality in terms of data protection , bugging , money laundering , theft and the operation of the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000 .
" This demands a most thorough investigation .
This is not the behaviour of a legitimate political party and I hope to see the police and the Electoral Commission investigate these charges .
" The fact this is being orchestrated by the leader of a political party is the most shocking aspect .
" The BNP leadership and Nick Griffin in particular are showing us their true colours . "
He said the BNP was " engulfed in a political crisis that threatens to tear the party apart " .
Mr Cruddas said on December 9 the party leadership " sacked " two of its senior officers amid claims of " gross misconduct , after they were found to be behind a blog that criticised other BNP officials " .
As a consequence over 58 BNP organisers and regional officials had resigned their positions and eight councillors resigned the party whip and become independent nationalist councillors .
" While I welcome these divisions , I would like to highlight some particularly unsavoury aspects to this feud that is unbefitting to any legitimate party .
I believe much of the behaviour of the BNP leadership is actually illegal . "
Mr Cruddas said he was particularly concerned over allegations that the BNP had posted on their website a recording and transcript of a private conversation between the two people subsequently sacked .
" It is the belief of the people concerned that their house , phone and computer have been bugged . "
BNP accounts for 2006 have not been submitted to the Electoral Commission , more than five months after they were due , the MP added .
He said the BNP had failed to report a specific donation of £ 5,315 in the period of July 1 2007 to September 30 2007 in contravention of the Political Parties Election and Referendum Act 200 .
" There are allegations the BNP has paid workers in cash to avoid tax and NI contributions .
" Finally the BNP claims to have spent at least £ 70,000 on printing equipment in 2005 alone but no such expenditure is shown in the accounts . "
Deputy Commons leader Helen Goodman said Mr Cruddas had described a number of " extremely unpleasant criminal activities , which have been admitted to by Mr Griffin .
" It was in keeping with the horrible racist politics ( of the party ) , which I 'm sure the whole House would wish to condemn . "
Organisations across the country are struggling against rising bills in all manner of ways , yet nowadays driver - based companies are truly bearing the brunt of escalating costs .
With this in mind , many of them are taking action to avoid this problem undermining their profits and even pushing them out of business .
Insurance is a big thing that many businesses are restructuring .
Many organisations are turning to Staveley Head fleet insurance and other specialised products to get the cover they need for much less .
If you pay for this cover in a lump sum instead of monthly , you will also pay less .
Opting for a higher excess – the amount you pay in the event of an accident before an insurer gets involved – will also give you a cheaper policy .
Other major driving forces behind fleet bills are vehicle choices , driving skills , journey decisions , taxation and the basic price of fuel .
By using the correct tools and training to measure these metrics , you can make a significant difference .
However , you need to remember that you can only control fuel costs by measuring them .
For example , use fuel cards to buy as much of your fuel as possible .
Many freight bill factoring providers have a fuel card incentive to take advantage of .
The adoption of pay - and - reclaim expenses will see a company buying fuel from drivers without knowing what they paid or how much was used .
This also means that you can send drivers to low - cost supermarkets , which could save thousands of pounds in just a month or two .
Bad drivers could be burning as much as 20 per cent more fuel with poor acceleration , braking and journey planning , while the associated wear and tear could cost more in terms of replacement parts and servicing .
Training safe and efficient driving techniques could truly improve efficiency , essentially giving you return on investment for the initial cost of training .
Finally , in terms of vehicle choices , low - CO2 vehicle policies will lower expenditure with both fuel and tax .
While many companies feel the need to go one step further with alternative fuels or electric vehicles , a lower - cost vehicle supplier can offer petrol models that will deliver real tangible savings , again resulting in one or two vans even paying for themselves in the long - term .
Whatever your choices are when lowering your fleet spending , be sure to consult other experts in the field as well as insurers , vehicle specialists and mechanics .
You may never realise just how much money you could save !
Merrill Lynch is expected to report today that it will add about $ 2.5 billion more to the $ 5 billion worth of write - downs it has already announced , according to a person briefed on the situation .
Merrill reports its third - quarter earnings this morning .
The bank announced earlier this month that it expected to write down $ 5 billion because of losses in its fixed - income unit .
Most of the losses , the bank said , were tied to the decline in value of complex debt instruments called collateralized debt obligations , whose value has diminished in recent months as credit markets have been hit by a collapse in the subprime mortgage market .
A Merrill spokesman declined to comment .
The additional write - down , coming so soon after the company ’s $ 5 billion charge , may raise more questions about the leadership of E. Stanley O’Neal , Merrill ’s chief executive , and the ability of his top executives to assess the firm ’s risk exposure .
Since he took over in December 2002 , Mr. O’Neal has pushed Merrill into riskier businesses — which , if managed well , tend to produce higher returns .
That strategy has taken Merrill Lynch deeper into fixed - income markets like commodities and mortgages , areas outside of its traditional strengths of wealth management and equities .
The Absolute Poker Cheating Scandal Blown Wide Open
[ Addendum appended . ]
A few weeks back I blogged about allegations of cheating at an online poker site called Absolute Poker .
While things looked awfully suspicious , there was n’t quite a smoking gun , and it was unclear exactly how the cheater might have cheated .
A combination of some incredible detective work by some poker players and an accidental (? ) data leak by Absolute Poker have blown the scandal wide open .
You can read the first - hand account in the following thread at 2+2 Poker Forum , but here ’s the short version :
Some opponents became suspicious of how a certain player was playing .
He seemed to know what the opponents ’ hole cards were .
The suspicious players provided examples of these hands , which were so outrageous that virtually all serious poker players were convinced that cheating had occurred .
One of the players who ’d been cheated requested that Absolute Poker provide hand histories from the tournament ( which is standard practice for online sites ) .
In this case , Absolute Poker “ accidentally ” did not send the usual hand histories , but instead sent a file that contained all sorts of private information that the poker site would never release .
The file contained every player ’s hole cards , observations of the tables , and even the IP addresses of every person playing .
( I put “ accidentally ” in quotes because the mistake seems like too great a coincidence when you learn what followed . )
I suspect that someone at Absolute knew about the cheating and how it happened , and was acting as a whistleblower by sending these data .
If that is the case , I hope whomever “ accidentally ” sent the file gets their proper hero ’s welcome in the end .
Then the poker players went to work analyzing the data — not the hand histories themselves , but other , more subtle information contained in the file .
What these players - turned - detectives noticed was that , starting with the third hand of the tournament , there was an observer who watched every subsequent hand played by the cheater .
( For those of you who do n’t know much about online poker , anyone who wants can observe a particular table , although , of course , the observers ca n’t see any of the players ’ hole cards . )
Interestingly , the cheater folded the first two hands before this observer showed up , then did not fold a single hand before the flop for the next 20 minutes , and then folded his hand pre-flop when another player had a pair of kings as hole cards !
This sort of cheating went on throughout the tournament .
So the poker detectives turned their attention to this observer .
They traced the observer ’s IP address and account name to the same set of servers that host Absolute Poker , and also , apparently , to a particular individual named Scott Tom , who seems to be a part - owner of Absolute Poker !
If all of this is correct , it shows exactly how the cheating would have transpired : an insider at the Web site had real - time access to all of the hole cards ( it is not hard to believe that this capability would exist ) and was relaying this information to an outside accomplice .
If this is all true , I presume that the two cheaters are looking at potential prison time .
I would also guess that if Absolute Poker continues to argue that nothing out of the ordinary happened , they will take an enormous hit to their profits .
Online poker is a game of trust — players send their money to a site believing that they will be playing a fair game , and trusting that the site will send them their winnings .
If there is even a little bit of uncertainty about either one of those factors , there is no good reason for a player to choose that site over the many close substitutes that exist .
If I ran Absolute Poker , I would take a lesson from past corporate attempts at cover ups , sacrifice the cheaters , and institute safeguards to prevent this ever happening again .
The real lesson of this all , however , is probably the following : guys who are n’t that smart will figure out ways to cheat .
And , with a little luck and the right data , folks who are a lot smarter will catch them doing it .
( Hat tip : Dan Hirschberg and Dean Strachan , who have kept me up to date on this story . )
Addendum :
After the publication of this blog post , Absolute Poker conducted an investigation which did not find any evidence suggesting that Scott Tom was himself directly involved in the cheating .

Like a lot of other folks , I ’d switched over to Gmail my primary email account .
Their Web interface is great , and Gmail ’s spam filtering is possibly the best I ’d ever seen .
However , there was one rather small problem , where by “ rather small problem ” I mean “ kinda huge problem ” : I was losing emails .
As in , I know the person had sent me emails , and I never received them .
Yep , I checked the spam folder .
The emails never showed up .
I was willing to forgive this once or twice , seeing as how complicated and fragile all these SMTP shenanigans is .
( Seriously , SMTP has to contend with FTP for the Most Stupid Protocol Ever Award . )
However , after Gmail lost emails three or four times and I received the emails successfully at my other , non-Gmail accounts , I could n’t ignore the problem any longer .
The last straw was when one of my friends forwarded me an email three times from another Gmail account and none of the mails came through .
I ’ve since switched to Pobox.com and have been a happy chappy since .
Pobox ’s spam filtering is n’t quite as good as Gmail ’s , but it ’s good enough , and their once - per - day spam report where you can simply click on a false positive spam to whitelist and retrieve it is just brilliant .
That feature alone is worth the $ 20 / year .
If they had an email forwarding address where I could send them the rest of my spams to improve their overall spam training , Pobox would be perfect .
If you ’re looking for a powerful , reliable email forwarding service , I can recommend Pobox without hesitation .
So , here ’s a question : has anybody else out there lost emails with Gmail ?
Surely it must ’ve happened to somebody besides me .
( Oh , and if you read this , work for Google and would like to figure out what ’s going on , drop me a mail : I have the Message - IDs of at least a couple of the emails that were lost .
Maybe we can all work this out . )

US now allowing feds to track Americans by cell phone RAW STORY

We need you : 488 donors needed to close budget gap for investigative news .
Federal prosecutors are being granted the right to reach out and find someone by ' pinging ' cellphones " upon request " , according to a front page article in Friday 's Washington Post .
" Federal officials are routinely asking courts to order cellphone companies to furnish real - time tracking data so they can pinpoint the whereabouts of drug traffickers , fugitives and other criminal suspects , according to judges and industry lawyers , " Ellen Nakashima reports for the paper .
" In some cases , judges have granted the requests without requiring the government to demonstrate that there is probable cause to believe that a crime is taking place or that the inquiry will yield evidence of a crime . "
The article continues , " Privacy advocates fear such a practice may expose average Americans to a new level of government scrutiny of their daily lives . "
Excerpts from article : # Such requests run counter to the Justice Department 's internal recommendation that federal prosecutors seek warrants based on probable cause to obtain precise location data in private areas .
The requests and orders are sealed at the government 's request , so it is difficult to know how often the orders are issued or denied .
The issue is taking on greater relevance as wireless carriers are racing to offer sleek services that allow cellphone users to know with the touch of a button where their friends or families are .
The companies are hoping to recoup investments they have made to meet a federal mandate to provide enhanced 911 ( E911 ) location tracking .
Sprint Nextel , for instance , boasts that its " loopt " service even sends an alert when a friend is near , " putting an end to missed connections in the mall , at the movies or around town . " .... " Most people do n't realize it , but they 're carrying a tracking device in their pocket , " said Kevin Bankston of the privacy advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" Cellphones can reveal very precise information about your location , and yet legal protections are very much up in the air . "

The old records turned up when the individuals applied for jobs
The Information Commissioner told West Midlands , Humberside , Northumbria and Staffordshire forces their records on four people breached data protection .
The individuals complained to the commissioner after their history showed up in checks when they went for jobs .
Each force is appealing against the ruling .
The Association for Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) said it was " regrettable " the commissioner had decided to make the cases public while they were being appealed against .
The record held by Humberside Police related to the theft of a packet of meat , worth 99 p , back in 1984 when the complainant was aged 16 .
' Juvenile prank '
Staffordshire Police also held a record in which a 13 - year - old girl was cautioned for a minor assault .
The woman said she was told the information would be kept until her 100th birthday .
The individuals contacted the commissioner Richard Thomas , saying they were concerned after the old records appeared on Criminal Records Bureau ( CRB ) checks .
John Webb , 45 , from Hull , was one of those who complained after a conviction surfaced from West Midlands Police dating back to 1978 .
Richard Thomas ruled the records were " no longer relevant "
Mr Webb was 16 when he was caught using metal discs cut to the size of 1 p and 10 p pieces in a fairground slot machine .
He said : " I had no idea that this incident would have come to light after such a long period of time .
" I accept what happened in the incident was wrong , I consider that by today 's standards what I did would be considered more of a juvenile prank . "
A spokesman for the commissioner said the records were " no longer relevant " and " excessive for policing purposes " .
' Disappointed and surprised '
Assistant commissioner Mick Gorrill said : " Each case relates to individuals who have been convicted or cautioned on one occasion and have not been convicted of any other offences . "
He added : " The retention of the previous conviction information is causing harm and distress to the individuals concerned .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Keeping petty offences on file for decades seems pretty pointless

" We are not satisfied that in these particular cases this information will be of any use for policing purposes . "
The forces are appealing each at the Information Tribunal , which means the files will not be deleted until a final decision is reached .
Humberside Police deputy chief constable David Griffin said : " I am disappointed and surprised that the Information Commissioner 's office have chosen to publicly comment on matters that are still undergoing an appeal process . "
Ian Readhead , of ACPO , said : " It is regrettable that the Information Commissioner has decided to go public on a matter that he knows will be subject of an Information Tribunal hearing early in the new year . "

Jabba the Puppet
Behind the cut you 'll see how a few of us made a full sized Jabba out of supplies from discount and hardware stores .
The supplies were pretty basic :
3/4 " inside diameter semi-rigid irrigation tubing .
This is the stuff you would bury in your lawn for sprinklers .
This was around $ 30 for 50 ' , and we ended up using a LOT more than we thought ... almost the whole role !
1 " thick foam padding used for mattresses .
This came from a discount store ( Building 19 ) .
We ended up using 5 or 6 queen sized mattress sheets .
It was around $ 20 a sheet
A smaller amount of 2 " and 1/2 " foam .
2 " for the lower body and 1/2 " for the features
LOTS of hot glue .
TONS of it ... probably 6 big bags of the 12 " sticks from a hardware store
The skin is " Jet Set " from Joann fabrics .
Basically non shiny spandex .
I think we used 20 yards of it .
Yay for 1 /2 off coupons !
3 M 77 spray adhesive .
This is how the skin sticks to the foam .
We used 4 cans .
Clear plastic bowls for the eyes .
We painted the insides of the bowls , so the outside shiny .
This is a little tricky , but I 'll get into that later .
Paint .
All sorts of stuff !
The base coat was 1 gallon of ugly yellow house paint .
We thinned it out a LOT ( 2 parts water to 1 part paint ) and sprayed it onto him with a pump sprayer used for lawn chemicals .
Not so good for the sprayer ( or my driveway ! ) , but it did the trick .
Assorted lengths of PVC pipe .
These are used for the arms , the tail , and whatever else seems good at the time .
OK , enough words , let 's get some pictures !
This is Jabba 's skeleton .
We took the irrigation tubing and bent it into a ship 's hull type shape .
It is cross braced and screwed together to hold that shape , since this type of tubing will eventually revert back to a straighter position .
The 2 " foam was screwed to the pipe all around .
This makes up Jabba 's lower body .
We left one side open , where the tail will join .
We made a tent like support for the head .
2 lengths of tube bent to arches and screwed together .
We used a few 8 " lenghts of PVC to act as couplers between the lower frame and the upper , so that the tent supports can drop in .
You can see that here :
Next is his head .
We took a sheet of foam and just threw it over the head supports , then drew lines on it with a sharpie where it looked like it should be cut .
We then hot glued the edges of the foam together to form the basic shape .
The tail was made the same way ... just take the sheet , twist and turn it til it looked good , then cut and glue .
Then a piece of foam was added in to one side to fill out the rest of the armpit area :
A quick slash with a knife , and Jabba was ready for a snack !
Mark , the main creative force behind the construction techniques and detailing , spent the evening working on feature buildup .
He took the thinner foam and cut it to shape , then hot glued it where it was needed .
At this point we wanted to make sure that the skinning process was going to work so we jumped ahead to that part of things and skinned the tail :
The skin was done by coating the foam in spray adhesive then placing the fabric down on it , folding the fabric the way that Jabba 's skin is folded .
After the first round of skinning , we made the right arm .
Same deal , cutting foam and hot gluing it together .
We then skinned the upper body , same way as the tail .
The arms are held to the body via long strips of fabric glued to the body and the arm .
The stretchy fabric lets the arms move freely .
Next came the painting .
This part was fun .
We went to Home Depot to get some paint .
We picked up a gallon of house paint that looked like a good Jabba color .
I used a chemical sprayer from my garage to layer it down .
We thinned it out 2:1 water : paint , and it went on evenly and fast !
Now to the eyes .
We used plastic bowls for the eyes , painting the insides .
This is a confusing way to paint .
Normally , if you want a red surface with a yellow line on it , you would paint the thing red , then put the yellow on top .
When you are painting inside a clear surface , you put the yellow first , then the red .
So it took a bit of mapping out colors to get it right .
And there they are .
We made sure to get the lopsided eyes that Jabba often has .
The detail painting was done via airbrush , and really brought out his features :
The last detail was the mouth .
It is really simple ... a pink cloth bag sewn up and glued to the inside of his mouth , then airbrushed to tone down the colors a bit .
A slit was cut in the bottom of the bag , and the tongue was glued in .
The tongue is a piece of 1/2 " foam with the fabric spray glued to it The fabric wraps around and is glued together underneath .
This lets you reach into the tongue from the inside to move it .
Which brings us to his big debut :
2 people inside .
One working the arms and mouth , and another in the tail , working the Salacious Crumb puppet ( through a slit in the tail )

Here ’s how some companies do team building :
Employees [ of Californian home security company ] Alarm One Inc. were paddled with rival companies ’ yard signs as part of a contest that pitted sales teams against each other , according to court documents .
The winners poked fun at the losers , throwing pies at them , feeding them baby food , making them wear diapers and swatting their buttocks .
The good news :
The company got paddled in court when an employee sued them and had to cough up 1.7 million USD .
The bad news :
A lot of team building events borrow elements from this approach , setting up artificial ( and often meaningless ) contests pitting coworkers against each other .
This is especially ironic because companies today want their employees to cooperate more , to work well in teams , to share knowledge and to work to achieve success together .
That is why it makes absolutely no sense to send them on trainings that are mainly competitive in nature .
Even when these events let people work together in smaller teams , competing against other teams , the focus still ends up being on competition , not cooperation .
There ’s a simple reason why these events are almost always competitive : Competition = instant passion .
Setting up a competition activates a primal urge in many people to win at all costs , making them very focused and active – which looks great to the organizers .
But there ’s a huge downside to this – which means that not only are many team building events a huge waste of time , they can be actively harmful to teams .
Here are the top 5 problems with competitive team building events .
1 : Competition does not create an experience of success
Yes , someone will win – most people wo n’t .
If the entire focus is on competing and winning , most participants will leave with a sense that “ we were n’t good enough . ”
That ’s not really a good feeling to have created in your employees .
2 : Competition brings out the worst in people
CEO Hal Rosenbluth was just about to hire an executive with all the right skills , the right personality and the perfect CV .
His interviews went swimmingly and he ’d said all the right things , but something about him still made Rosenbluth nervous , though he could n’t put his finger on just what it was .
Rosenbluth ’s solution was genius :
He invited the applicant to a company softball game , and here the man showed his true colors .
He was competitive to the point of being manic .
He abused and yelled at both the opponents and his own team .
He cursed the referees and kicked up dirt like a major league player .
And he did not get the job .
( From Hal Rosenbluth ’s excellent book The Customer Comes Second ) .
Competing brings out the inner jerk in some people , making them manic and abusive .
Some even try cheating in order to win .
This is not exactly a great basis for future cooperation – it might be better if people left the event liking each other more than before because they ’d seen each other at their best and most likable .
3 : People learn less when they ’re competing
Studies show that we learn less when we compete and more when we cooperate .
Here ’s an example from education :
In a comprehensive review of 245 classroom studies that found a significant achievement difference between cooperative and competitive environments , David Johnson and Roger Johnson of the University of Minnesota reported that 87 percent of the time the advantage went to the cooperative approach .
In visiting classrooms where cooperative learning is used , I like to ask students to describe the experience in their own words .
One ten - year - old boy thought a moment and replied ,  It ’s like you have four brains . 
By contrast , a competitors single brain often shuts off when given no reason to learn except to triumph over his or her classmates .
– Alfie Kohn ( Source )
4 : Competition lowers performance
And contrary to what most people think , most of us perform worse when we ’re competing .
This is especially true for complex tasks that require us to work with and learn from other people .
5 : Waste of time
These events focus more on finding and rewarding winners than on making sure that people learn something that might actually be useful at work .
This creates a sense that the events are a waste of time , and employees come to resent them because they keep them from doing real , actual , useful work .
How to do team building that actually builds teams
Here ’s what the result of a good team building event should be :
A deeper understanding between co-workers
Co-workers like each other better than before
An experience of having performed well together
A feeling that “ we ’re good at what we do ”
An increased desire to cooperate and help each other out
Specific learnings that can be applied at work
And maybe most of all : A sense that the event was “ time well spent . ”
This would actually be easy to achieve .
We ’d just have to change the event so that :
The event has common goals for all participants , making people cooperate , not compete
The event rewards those who get good results but also those who help others get good results and those who help make it a nice experience for everyone
You take plenty of time to let participants reflect on how the learnings from the event can be applied in their work
You may not get the same hectic moody you get from those intensely competitive events – but that ’s actually a good thing .
What you would get instead is an event that is more fun for more people – and much more useful .
That has to be a good thing !
Your take
What ’s the best team building event you ’ve ever tried ?
Or the worst ?
How did it help or hinder your team ?
What would your ideal team building event look like ?
Please write a comment , I ’d like to know what you think .

Books I Recommend Without Reservation : 2006
I read over a hundred and twenty books in 2006 .
Some of them were OK .
Some were good .
Some were very good .
Here are the handful that I can recommend you read without any reservations .
This is n’t a top ten list ; the books are n’t in any particularly meaningful order .
These are just the books that I can honestly say that , as a human being , I think you will enjoy reading ( and you ’ll be a better person for having done so ) .
You should follow me on twitter here .
June 28 , 2007
Two months ago , you might remember , the gods of humor and blogging saw fit to bestow on me an unexpected gift :
Model 1 : But if quantum mechanics is n’t physics in the usual sense — if it ’s not about matter , or energy , or waves — then what is it about ?
Model 2 : Well , from my perspective , it ’s about information , probabilities , and observables , and how they relate to each other .
Model 1 : That ’s interesting !
“ For almost the first time in my life , ” I wrote then , “ I ’m at a loss for words … Help me , readers .
Should I be flattered ?
Should I be calling a lawyer ? ”
Almost three hundred comments later , your answer was clear .
Half of you thought I ’d be a stereotypical American jerk , epitomizing everything wrong with modern society , if I sought any redress for the blatant plagiarism of my quantum mechanics lecture .
The other half thought I ’d be a naïve moron if I did n’t seek redress .
However , there did seem to be a rough consensus on two topics : first , that as part of any settlement I should “ date the models ” ( at least a hundred people made some joke to that effect , each one undoubtedly thinking it highly creative ) ; and second , that it was probably okay to try to get something from either Ricoh ( the printer company ) or Love Communications ( the ad agency ) , as long as the proceeds went to charity and I did n’t directly benefit .
Since , like any public figure , I now make all decisions by polling my base , I finally had a warrant for action .
After talking things over informally with Warren Smith — the guy who discovered the Ricoh ad in the first place , who just happens ( in one of the many ironies of this case ) to be studying Australian intellectual property law , and to whom I ’m deeply indebted — I next contacted a lawyer from a well - known Australian law firm .
Talking to her confirmed my suspicion that many of the armchair legal theories offered in my comments section were simply mistaken .
In Australian copyright law , as in American law , you ca n’t just take someone ’s words and use them for commercial purposes without permission or attribution , regardless of any subjective judgments about the “ uniqueness ” or “ specialness ” of those words .
I was on strong legal ground .
But there was also a key difference between the Australian and American legal systems : Australian lawyers are prohibited from taking cases on a contingency basis .
If I wanted the law firm to pursue the case , then I would have to pay them up - front .
Disregarding the pleas of my relatives — who at this point were begging me to sue — I instead wrote to Love Communications directly , proposing a settlement to be donated ( for example ) to a mutually - agreed - upon Australian science outreach organization .
We eventually agreed to a settlement of AUS $ 5,000 .
Considering the value of Love Communications ’ Ricoh account — which the Sydney Morning Herald reported as more than AUS $ 1,000,000 — I thought the ad agency was getting off incredibly easily , but at least I would n’t have to write any more letters or deal with lawyers .
The one remaining problem was to find a suitable Australian science outreach organization to which to donate the $ 5,000 , and that would also be amusing to blog about .
As I chewed on this problem , my mind wandered back to my visit to Brisbane in December 2005 , and to a conversation I ’d had there with Jennifer Dodd — then of the University of Queensland and now of the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo .
In that conversation , Jen had told me about a popular - science lecture series in Brisbane she ’d founded , called BrisScience .
I ’d immediately asked her to repeat the name .
“ BrisScience , ” she said .
“ Spell it ? ” I asked .
“ B - r - i-s - Science .
Why , is there something funny about the name ? ”
“ No , no , it should n’t be a big deal in Australia . ”
Aha !
I now emailed Jen to ask whether BrisScience had continued its “ cutting - edge ” outreach programs in her absence .
Jen replied that yes , it had , and she put me in touch with Joel Gilmore , BrisScience ’s current director .
Joel told me that not only was BrisScience still going strong ( with the next lecture , by Bill Phillips , being about quantum mechanics ) , but that he ( Joel ) also directed another science outreach program called the Physics Demo Troupe , which does hands - on science shows for schoolkids in Brisbane and rural areas .
Joel proposed that we donate $ 2,000 of the settlement to BrisScience and $ 3,000 to the Physics Demo Troupe , the latter supporting a visit to the Torres Strait Islands in North Queensland .
I agreed , and Love Communications agreed as well .
I am , of course , gratified that this sordid southern - hemisphere tale of sex , plagiarism , quantum mechanics , and printers could be resolved to everyone ’s satisfaction , without the need for a courtroom battle , and that schoolkids in Torres Strait Island might even learn some physics as a result .
But is there one sentence with which to conclude this saga , one sublimely fatuous thought that sums up my feelings toward the entire affair ?
Wait for it … wait for it …
That ’s interesting .
Greed stampede : Wall Street bulls should have known better than to charge into sub prime fiasco
By Eric Margolis
Created Dec 23 2007 - 8:29am
Western nations have been rightly scourging China for flooding world markets with toxic food , toys , nutritional products , clothing and other tainted goods .
China 's government closed its eyes to this apparent malefaction .
Meanwhile , Wall Street was exporting toxic financial instruments called sub prime mortgages around the globe .
Washington 's regulatory monkeys saw no more evil than those in Beijing .
Here 's how the sub prime mess developed .
A single mother , say in East St Louis , was peddled an initially low interest adjustable mortgage by a flim - flam broker .
When rates rose sharply , she could n't pay and was forced to abandon the home she should never have bought to begin with .
Multiply this little human tragedy by hundreds of thousands , and , voila , the spreading sub prime mortgage crisis .
Meanwhile , the world 's leading financial institutions built a $ 500 billion to $ 1 trillion house of cards based on these sleazy mortgages .
They were bundled , chopped up like stolen cars , and peddled everywhere as secure , high - yielding American securities .
Once the sub prime crisis broke , banks holding such paper panicked .
Not only could n't they find any more stupid buyers , the wildly inflated values given to these securities turned out to be totally bogus .
This , in turn , gravely undermined the asset base of lending institutions holding this worthless paper .
Britain's Northern Rock ( aka " Northern Wreck " ) suffered a run on the bank and is now clinically dead .
CIBC lost up to $ 2 billion .
Two of the world 's biggest banks , Citigroup and UBS , lost $ 9 billion and $ 10 billion respectively .
They nearly capsized , and had to be rescued by Gulf Arabs and Singapore .
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley each face $ 9 - 10 billion of write - downs .
More banks will soon reveal billions of losses , all thanks to " innovate finance . "
BLEW IT
How could so many of the brightest Wall Street financiers , who claim unrivaled expertise in managing clients ' assets , be so stupid and incompetent ?
After the flu and bad taste , few diseases are more contagious than greed .
So began the greed stampede as Wall Street bulls charged into the sub prime Valley of Death .
Blame begins with the Bush administration .
Faced with hugely expensive foreign wars and the dot com bubble , the White House got the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to nearly nothing .
This produced the monster property bubble that is now bursting .
Cheap credit became a dangerous drug , financial " speed " arousing false economic euphoria that helped keep Republicans in power and fueled swarms of unregulated , parasitic hedge funds .
Rock - bottom U.S. interest rates made bankers and investors search out higher paying investments .
sub prime mortgages were Wall Street 's answer .
In a giant Ponzi scheme , new investor money was used to pay off old investors , building a giant pyramid that collapsed this past fall .
The U.S. Federal Reserve , which is supposed to regulate mortgages , failed in its duty .
So did other U.S. financial regulators , such as Treasury and the SEC .
They , and auditing firms , allowed banks to egregiously misvalue their mortgage holdings and create " conduits " and " off balance sheet " vehicles that were new forms of accounting fraud .
COMPLEXITY
Many bankers and managers simply failed to understand the mind - numbing complexity of financial derivatives .
President George Bush lauded " the new finance " as the model of Republican economic policy .
It turned out to be the financial equivalent of Iraq .
Worryingly , no one knows how much the world 's rickety financial structure now depends on these arcane financial alchemies .
We enter 2008 threatened by the prospect of new financial earthquakes and recession .
Instead of facing fraud indictment , CEOs of the big peddlers of this worthless junk got millions worth of golden handshakes , or raises .
While government was busy prosecuting Conrad Black over a few million dollars , the public was defrauded of tens of billions .
No one has yet been prosecuted for these outrageous crimes .
If there was a time for government to justify its existence , it 's now .
Prosecute the sub prime fraudsters .
Forget golden handshakes .
They deserve steel handcuffs .

Dell press release .
Miscellaneous trivia
According to HardlyFamous.com , Michael Dell once washed dishes at a Chinese restaurant for $ 2.30 per hour .
He also dropped out of the University of Texas at Austin at the age of 19 when his computer business , PCs Limited , began to take off .
Benjamin Bowmar Curtis , " The Dell Dude " was the young actor who played Steven in the " Dude , you ’re getting a Dell " TV commercials in the early 2000s .
On February 9 , 2003 , he was arrested in New York for possession of marijuana , prompting many to coin the phrase , " Dude , you ’re getting a cell " .
Since then he has gone on to what appears to be a very successful career in film and acting .
He now goes by the name Ben Curtis , and has appeared in three movies , one episode of Law & Order and his voice has been used for the character Damon in a video game entitled Bully .
He is also the Associate Producer of an upcoming movie called Spy , due out in 2008 .
" The conflict between maternal and fetus genes is one of the weirdest ideas in the modern theory of evolution . " *
According to evolutionary logic , the fetus " wants " to milk the mother for all it can get ; the mother " wants " to restrict the fetus to what it needs to survive and save something for future offspring .
The reason is that the fetus benefits from every bit of help the mother gives , while the mother 's return on her investment diminishes with increasing investment , ( i.e. ever greater investment wo n't necessarily increase her fitness ) .
One example of this struggle is the regulation of the mother 's blood sugar , which is much than normal higher during pregnancy .
Well this makes sense , you might think , because the mother is now feeding a growing fetus .
But look at the mother 's insulin level , it also is much higher than normal , and insulin is used to down - regulate blood sugar levels .
Huh , that 's weird , she is secreting more insulin , yet her blood sugar level is ever higher .
She must be responding less to insulin .
Why should that be ?
David Haig suggested that the fetus is trying to increase blood sugar levels by releasing human placental lactogen ( hPL , a hormone that reduces the effects of insulin ) into the mother 's bloodstream and the mother is trying to reduce blood sugar levels by increasing more insulin .
The amount of hPL in the mother 's blood is astonishing , on the order of 1000 - 2000 x the level of comparable hormones , and the amazing thing is that hPL is entirely unnecessary because babies with nonfunctional hPL genes are completely normal at birth .
So the mother and fetus are battling over the allocation of resources by pumping out more and more hormones .
But wait that 's not the weird part !
The weird part is , strictly speaking , the conflict is not between mother and fetus , but rather between genes within the same individual .
The fetus that contains a gene causing it to release more hPL will someday , provided it is a female , grow up to be a mother whose offspring may contain that very same gene and will be trying to suck every bit of nourishment out of her .
The gene is then , within the very same individual , advantageous during fetus - hood and disadvantageous during mother - hood .
The net result is that the fetus loses out by possessing the hPL gene , its lifetime reproductive output is reduced , but it does n't matter .
The gene spreads anyway because the gene increases its representation in the gene pool .
There is then an inherent inefficiency in life .
The intragenomic conflict leads to reduced reproductive output , through less efficient use of resources and , more importantly , in the hPL case , through increases in the onset of diabetes .
10 % of pregnancies result in gestational diabetes ; and 50 % of the cases of gestational diabetes results in full diabetes later on in life .
Would that be object of an intelligent designer ?

One of the best kept secrets at this year 's RubyConf was the working whereabouts of two of Ruby 's hottest superstar developers : Ryan Davis and Eric Hodel of Seattle.rb .
Ryan revealed the secret last week : they 've officially joined Engine Yard to work full - time on next - generation Ruby runtime Rubinius .
( Learn more about Rubinius on InfoQ )
Engine Yard , a premium Ruby on Rails hosting company headquartered in San Francisco , has grown to 21 people around the world this year .
In the last week , they also announced that Brian Ford and Wilson Bilkovich , two of the most active committers of the Rubinius project will also join the company in January .
Engine Yard 's corporate support of Rubinius is not new .
They hired on its project lead , Evan Phoenix , back in May of this year .
One of Engine Yard 's founders , Ezra Zygmuntovich , cited community goodwill as a driving factor in that decision .
Goodwill certainly translates into revenues , perhaps dramatically so for a small company such as Engine Yard , compared to the other company generating heaps of goodwill in the Ruby community : Sun Microsystems , with its generous backing of the JRuby project and the world - class Ruby support being built into NetBeans .
It 's becoming apparent that more than community goodwill is at play for EngineYard .
Better Ruby performance impacts the company 's bottom line directly .
Ezra told InfoQ , " Everybody knows the current Ruby interpreter needs help ... we run into plenty of problems with the current interpreter and I think Rubinius is going to help a lot . "
In case you have n't been following the red - hot developments in the world of Ruby runtimes , Rubinius is an open - source implementation of Ruby implemented in the manner of Squeak ( Smalltalk ) .
It has a small core virtual machine written in C , but is otherwise completely written in Ruby itself , including the compiler .
Incidentally , the Rubinius project is moving along at a fast clip and enjoys massive developer support , with 67 committers in its 1.5 year history .
Evan estimates that about 25 of the committers are active contributors .
While Rubinius performance is nothing to brag about right now , that is certain to change .
The massive IQ behind the project is yielding results , fast .
Ruby performance expert Antonio Cangiano regularly publishes " shootout " results on his blog , and praised Rubinius last week :
Looking at the old table and then at the new one , it ’s hard to believe that the same implementation could improve so much in such a short period of time .
In 16 tests it actually managed to be faster than Ruby 1.8.6 .
How fast will Rubinius be in a year ?
I personally consider Rubinius to be one of the most promising Ruby implementations out there .
The next major milestones for Rubinius revolve around release of a 1.0 version that satisfactorily runs Rails .
A big part of that effort is to get RubyGems working , which is reportedly Eric Hodel 's primary focus right now ( which makes sense given his connection to the RubyGems project ) .
Evan estimated that Rubinius on Rails should fall into place rather quickly after RubyGems support is finished , perhaps as early as February 2008 .
Ezra is currently involved marginally in Rubinius , but planning to transition to full - time software development duties in January .
Already , Ezra is known to be working on getting the Mongrel web server to work on Rubinius .
Ezra 's own Merb framework , considerably simpler than Rails , will be supported sooner than that .
As for IP issues , according to Evan , Rubinius will be following the Asterisk open - source model , where the copyright holder and steward of the project will be Engine Yard .
Incidentally , the Engine Yard hires are not the only corporate - sponsored developers on the Rubinius project .
Powerset 's Kevin Clark is reportedly spending 20 % of his time on the project as well .
Skynet 5 is already supporting operations in Afghanistan
They are now sending voice , images and other data over the Skynet 5A platform .
The spacecraft , which was launched in March , is part of a £ 3.6 bn project to upgrade the super - fast connections between command centres .
" It 's making a clear difference already , " Brigadier Simon Shadbolt at the Ministry of Defence told BBC News .
" In Afghanistan , where we 've been using the system probably more than in Iraq , our troops have seen a noticeable increase in capability . "
Data demand
Skynet 5A was launched from Kourou in French Guiana on 11 March .
It is the first in what will eventually be a three - spacecraft constellation providing satcoms support to the Army , Royal Navy and RAF , wherever they might be operating across the globe .
There was a huge sigh of relief when Skynet 5A went into orbit
Malcolm Peto , Paradigm Secure Communications
They incorporate novel antenna technology that will resist attempts to hijack or " jam " the platforms .
Skynet 5A together with its sister platforms , 5B and 5C ( an in - orbit spare ) , provide two - and - a - half times the bandwidth capacity of the previous system .
Over the course of the next few years , they will gradually take over the traffic currently passed through four Skynet 4 spacecraft .
And it is expected Skynet 5 will experience heavy demand .
Skynet 5A has been tested and pressed into service
More details
Good examples are the growth in the use of intelligence imagery and the rise of remote - controlled weapons .
Unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) produce large volumes of still and moving pictures that need to be sent over networks for analysis and attack planning .
Skynet will be particularly useful when the UK takes delivery of Predator B drones for use in Afghanistan .
" Skynet gives us capacity - a two - and - a - half times capability enhancement ; it 's assured - commanders want to know they will get through each time they press the send button ; and it's also resilient against computer - based threats , " said Brigadier Shadbolt .
Business plan
The Ministry of Defence does not own the Skynet system ; the military merely buys the services run over it from a company called Paradigm Secure Communications .
This arrangement - the most expensive Private Finance Initiative ( PFI ) signed by the MoD - allows for spare bandwidth on the new satellites to be sold to " friendly " forces , earning money not just for Paradigm but for the defence department as well .
Information is now key to successful modern military operations
" There was a huge sigh of relief when Skynet 5A went into orbit because a huge lump of risk was retired .
It was a job well done , " said Malcolm Peto , managing director of Paradigm Secure Communications .
" We 're now looking forward to the launch of 5B towards the end of this year , and 5C around the middle of next year ; full operational service will come in 2008 . "
Ground control segments for the new system have been upgraded ; and ships , planes and land vehicles are being equipped to make the best use of the upgraded Skynet .
After missing the horror writers picket last week , I made sure to head over to the Paramount lot this afternoon to snap some shots of this week 's awesome ( ly nerdy ) strike gimmick — STAR TREK DAY !
Sadly , I saw nary a Klingon , but I did manage to spot a few pairs of Spock ears , a phaser or two , and of course , one Mr. George Takei ( oh my ) .

Many cultures find that English might possibly be one of the most difficult languages to learn .
Not , in fact , for its words , but for the fact that it has so many unusual and contradictory rules .
Just looking over an English study book will tell you that so many odd ifs and buts apply to so many words that it is enough to drive one crazy .
Here are 25 examples of the oddities in the English language .
Oddities 21 – 25
25 . “ Rhythms ” is the longest English word without the normal vowels , a , e , i , o , or u .
24 . Excluding derivatives , there are only two words in English that end - shion and ( though many words end in this sound ) .
These are cushion and fashion .
23 . “ THEREIN ” is a seven - letter word that contains thirteen words spelled using consecutive letters : the , he , her , er , here , I , there , ere , rein , re , in , therein , and herein .
22 . There is only one common word in English that has five vowels in a row : queueing .
21 . Soupspoons is the longest word that consists entirely of letters from the second half of alphabet .
Oddities 16 – 20
20 . “ Almost ” is the longest commonly used word in the English language with all the letters in alphabetical order .
19 .
The longest uncommon word whose letters are in alphabetical order is the eight - letter Aegilops ( a grass genus ) .
18 . The longest common single - word palindromes are deified , racecar , repaper , reviver , and rotator .
17 . “ One thousand ” contains the letter A , but none of the words from one to nine hundred ninety - nine has an A .
16 . “ The sixth sick sheik ’s sixth sheep ’s sick ” is said to be the toughest tongue twister in English .
Oddities 11 – 15
15 . Cwm ( pronounced “ koom ” , defined as a steep - walled hollow on a hillside ) is a rare case of a word used in English in which w is the nucleus vowel , as is crwth ( pronounced “ krooth ” , a type of stringed instrument ) .
Despite their origins in Welsh , they are accepted English words .
14 . “ Asthma ” and “ isthmi ” are the only six - letter words that begin and end with a vowel and have no other vowels between .
13 .
The nine - word sequence I , in , sin , sing , sting , string , staring , starting ( or starling ) , startling can be formed by successively adding one letter to the previous word .
12 . “ Underground ” and “ underfund ” are the only words in the English language that begin and end with the letters “ und . ”
11 . “ Stewardesses ” is the longest word that can be typed with only the left hand .
Oddities 6 – 10
10 . Antidisestablishmentarianism listed in the Oxford English Dictionary , was considered the longest English word for quite a long time , but today the medical term pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is usually considered to have the title , despite the fact that it was coined to provide an answer to the question ‘ What is the longest English word ? ’.
9. “ Dreamt ” is the only English word that ends in the letters “ mt ” .
8 . There are many words that feature all five regular vowels in alphabetical order , the commonest being abstemious , adventitious , facetious .
7 . The superlatively long word honorificabilitudinitatibus ( 27 letters ) alternates consonants and vowels .
6. “ Fickleheaded ” and “ fiddledeedee ” are the longest words consisting only of letters in the first half of the alphabet .
Oddities 1 – 5
5 . The two longest words with only one of the six vowels including y are the 15 - letter defenselessness and respectlessness .
4. “ Forty ” is the only number which has its letters in alphabetical order .
“ One ” is the only number with its letters in reverse alphabetical order .
3 . Bookkeeper is the only word that has three consecutive doubled letters .
2. Despite the assertions of a well - known puzzle , modern English does not have three common words ending in - gry .
Angry and hungry are the only ones .
1. “ Ough ” can be pronounced in eight different ways .
The following sentence contains them all : “ A rough - coated , dough - faced ploughman strode through the streets of Scarborough , coughing and hiccoughing thoughtfully .

Eye - tracking studies are a popular way to test the effectiveness of a website , but it can be hard to figure out how to translate the results of these studies into real design implementations .
How can you design a page that your readers find engaging ?
These are a few tips from eye - tracking studies that you can use to improve the design of making your own blog or website .
1. People like text more than images
Contrary to what you might think , the first thing users look at on a web page is n’t the images .
Most casual visitors will be coming to your site looking for information , so they ’ll scan the words before they look at photos .
Make sure your website is designed so that the most important parts of your text are most prominent .
2. Initial eye movement focuses on the upper left corner of the page
Most computer applications are designed with the top left hand side as the main focus .
That ’s usually where you ’ll find the logo for the site you ’ve currently reading .
You can do your website a favor by keeping this format in mind when creating a wireframe layout .
While you want to have a design that ’s all your own , you have to keep the habits of your readers in mind if you want your site to be user - friendly .
3 . Users look at the top left and upper portion of the page , before moving down and to the right
Users were found to generally scan webpages in the shape of an ‘ F ’ .
Make sure the important elements of your content are located in the left hand side , across the top and across the middle section keep your readers engaged .
Key items , like headlines , subheadlines , bullet points , and highlighted text , should be placed along these lines .
4. Readers ignore banners
Ads may be the bread and butter of your site , but studies have shown that readers largely ignore banner ads , often focusing for only a fraction of a second .
If you ’re trying to make money from ads , you need to be creative in your ad placement or in the types of ads you have on your site .
5 . Fancy formatting and fonts are ignored
Websites are becoming more saturated with adverts , and reader behavior is changing as a result .
Anything that looks too fancy could be glossed over , since readers assume these areas ads and do n’t have the information they need .
In fact , studies showed that users had difficulty finding information in large colored letters formatted in this way , because visual clues told them to ignore those parts of the page .
Keep your website streamlined and not so shiny that important elements will be glossed over .
6 . Show numbers as numerals
Readers will find it much easier to find factual information on your site if you use numerals instead of writing out numbers .
Remember the points made above ; you ’re writing for readers that are going to be primarily scanning your site , so make it easier for them to find what they need .
7 . Type size influences viewing behavior
Want to change how people look at your page ?
Change the size of your font .
Smaller fonts increase focused viewing behavior , while larger fonts encourage scanning .
Depending on your needs , you may want more of one than the other .
8 . Users only look at a sub headline if it interests them
Do n’t put in sub headlines just to stick to a particular format .
Make sure that they are relevant and interesting .
You can assist your SEO by making sure all headlines include keywords that will help search engines to index your site .
9 . People generally scan lower portions of the page
You can use this habit to your advantage if you give readers something to latch onto when they ’re scanning your page .
Highlight certain sections or create bulleted lists so information is easy to find and read in the footer .
10 . Shorter paragraphs perform better than long ones
Information on your page should be designed for the short attention span of most Internet users .
Keep paragraphs and sentences short unless context mandates otherwise , such as descriptions of products on an e-commerce sites .
Short content may also render more effectively on smaller screens , such as smartphones .
11 . One - column formats perform better in eye - fixation than multi-column formats
Do n’t overwhelm visitors to your site with too much information .
Simpler really is better in many cases .
Multiple columns will more than likely by ignored by users , so eliminate clutter from the get - go .
12 . Ads in the top and left portions of a page will receive the most eye fixation
If you ’re going to place ads on your website , try integrating them into the top left portion of your page , as those will get the most visual attention .
Of course , just because readers see them there does n’t mean they ’ll click on them , so do n’t sacrifice design just to gain some extra visibility .
13 .
Ads placed next to the best content are seen more often
If you want to get your ads seen – and , hopefully , clicked on – incorporate them into your design in a way that places them near the most interesting elements of your content .
Users will still be able to find what they need , but you ’ll gain an advantage in advertising if you draw more eyes to the ads .
14 .
Text ads were viewed mostly intently of all types tested
Like we said earlier , the average internet user generally does n’t waste much time looking at things that immediately appear to be ads .
That ’s why text ads perform so much better .
They are n’t distracting , and they blend in with the rest of the content on the page , making them less visually irritating to the reader – and , ultimately , more successful .
15 . Bigger images get more attention
If you are going to use images on your page , bigger is better .
People are more interested in an image where they can see details and information clearly .
Just make sure that any image you are using is particularly relevant to your text , otherwise it will most likely be ignored .
Most readers have high - speed connections these days , so do n’t be afraid to use photos where they ’re warranted .
16 . Faces in images attract more eye fixation
While they might look good with your design , abstract and artsy photos are n’t going to garner much reader attention .
If you ’re using photos with people in them , make sure they are clear , easy to read shots .
It should also be noted that photos with real people in will perform better than photos featuring models .
17 . Headings draw the eye
One of the first things readers have been found to look at on a webpage are headlines .
Make sure yours are unobstructed by other items on the page and that they are engaging enough to draw the reader into looking further through your site .
18 . Users spend a lot of time looking at buttons and menus
Because of this , you ’ll want to put in some extra time making sure that yours are well - designed .
After all , they not only draw a lot of eye fixation , they are one of the most important elements of your site .
Make sure your call to actions are well defined .
19 . Lists hold reader attention longer
One way you can break up the paragraphs in your content , and keep users looking through your site , is to make frequent use of a list format for your articles .
Use numbers or bullet points to highlight important information within your content .
It will make your site more scannable , so it ’s easier for users to find the information that they ’re looking for .
20 .
Large blocks of text are avoided
Studies have shown that that your average web visitor is n’t going to take the time to study large blocks of text , no matter how informative or well - written they might be .
Because of this , you need to break up these larger blocks of text into smaller paragraphs .
Highlighting specific areas and pulling out bullet points can also help to keep user attention .
21 . Formatting can draw the eye
To keep users from skipping over the main and most important points in your content use bold , capitalized , italicized , colored , and underlined text .
Use these things judiciously however , as too much will make your page hard to read and send readers away .
22 . White space is good
While it might be tempting to put something in every corner of your page , it ’s actually better to leave some of your site free of any text .
Sites with too much going on tend to overwhelm users and they ignored a large part of the content .
So keep things simple and allow some visual open space for readers to rest their eyes .
23 . Navigation tools work better when placed at the top of the page
Ideally , you do n’t want readers to just look at the initial page they came to on your site , you want them to stick around and look at other interesting things as well .
You can help send them in the right direction by making your navigation easy to find and use by placing it at the top of the page .
Beijing 2008 has its bird 's nest stadium and Wembley its soaring arc of light , but the organisers of London 2012 revealed a rather more cautious design today , when they unveiled plans for their Olympic stadium .
" This is not a stadium that 's going to be screaming from the rooftops that it 's bigger and more spectacular , " admitted its chief architect , Rod Sheard .
" This is just a cleverer building .
This is a cleverer solution . "
Organisers hope to ensure the coliseum - style stadium , which will be built in Stratford , east London , can continue to be used on a smaller scale after the Olympics , by scaling down its 80,000 capacity to 25,000 in the months following the Games .
It will then become a multi- purpose venue with athletics as a major use , but no anchor tenant , such as a football or rugby club , has been found .
" This is a very important Olympic milestone and this stadium is focused very much on legacy and sustainability , " said the Olympics minister , Tessa Jowell .
" Once the Games are over this will then be translated into a stadium that will not only host grand prix athletics events and other national sport events but will also serve the communities of the boroughs . "
Lord Coe , chairman of the London Organising Committee , agreed that the stadium 's long - term use was an important factor in the design .
" It 's a stadium that delivers on everything we said we would deliver on , " he said .
" A stadium with track and field as its primary legacy ; a stadium that will be reduced from 80,000 seats in Olympic mode to a 25,000 - seater community base . "
The permanent seating in the stadium will be built on a concrete bowl sunk into the ground .
The architects hope this design will bring spectators closer to the action and create an electric atmosphere .
" We 've ended up with a very tight , very compelling bowl , " said Sheard .
" The atmosphere inside this bowl , we think , will be pretty special . "
The stadium will also boast a cable - supported roof , providing cover for two - thirds of spectators , and a fabric curtain that will wrap around the structure , acting as additional protection and shelter for spectators .
The £ 496 m structure has nearly doubled in budget from the £ 280 m estimated in 2004 when London was bidding for the Games .
David Higgins , the chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority , has blamed the spiralling costs on VAT and inflation .
With half an eye on the fiasco surrounding the delayed construction of the new Wembley , building work on the stadium is set to begin three months ahead of schedule in April 2008 , with completion in 2011 to allow for test events .
So far , 20 out of 33 buildings on the site have been demolished and 600,000 tonnes of soil taken away in preparation for the construction process .

Race and conservatism ?
Yes , that was the title of the panel discussion I ’d signed up for , at the Robert A. Taft Club in Arlington , Va .
I ’d signed up without much thought , being of an insecure and self - deprecating nature ( ask anyone ) , and always flattered to be invited to events at clubs and institutions with impressive - sounding names .
Once I did start to think about it , mild panic set in .
Race and conservatism ?
What on earth can one say ?
In order to say anything , it helps to start with a simplistic view of race , a view that regards Americans as belonging to two races only : black , and nonblack .
This is an over - simplification , of course — a first approximation — and I reserve the right to add more detail as I go along , should I find it helpful .
That established , I suppose the first thing one can say is that conservatives — I mean , mainstream , respectable conservatives , the type who edit magazines , or run for office , or get hired to write speeches for Congresscritters and Cabinet officers — are race - shy .
That is , in fact , to put it very mildly indeed .
While a certain amount of lampooning of the more egregious kinds of black race hustlers — the Sharptons and Farrakhans — is permissible in mainstream conservative circles , and the crazier manifestations of racial guilt , like affirmative action or bans on “ racial profiling , ” can be gently criticized , race as an abstract topic is out of court .
You could break wind in a mainstream - conservative gathering and be forgiven , Elizabeth the First style * , but if you were to try to get a conversation about race going , the well - known kitchen - light - switch - and - roaches metaphor would kick in , and your invitations to such gatherings would fall off dramatically thereafter .
The reasons for this race panic on the Respectable Right are , I think , pretty well understood .
When , in the late 1950s , race became a national issue , and great numbers of white Americans became aware of the injustice of racial segregation , the activist movement for reform was led by Leftists .
When not ( as was rather often the case ) members of far - Left fringe groups , these people belonged to the northern , urban , egalitarian wing of the Democratic Party .
Thus — with assistance from a sympathetic , and largely Leftist , media establishment — the equation “ racial justice = Democrat ” became lodged in the public mind , and generated an obvious converse : “ racial injustice = Republican . ”
This was all horribly unfair .
As Pat Buchanan notes in his latest best - seller : “ Democrats had bedded down with segregationists for a century without censure . ”
When Congress voted on the 1964 Civil Rights Act , Republicans in both House and Senate said yea by about 80 percent to 20 ; among Democrats , the votes went more like 60 - 40 .
Alas , there is no justice in politics .
Republicans got stuck as the party of racial discrimination .
Since racial discrimination soon came to be seen as the most unspeakable of all evils , and since , from the 1970s on , most conservatives were Republicans , it is not very surprising that conservatives do n’t want to talk about race .
I think we should , though .
Our current silence keeps us out of present trouble , I ’ll grant ; but I believe it stores up future trouble .
Let me try to explain .
* * * * *
I am 61 years old .
That ’s old enough to have a clear memory of the Civil Rights movement .
To be sure , I watched it from a distance , growing up in England .
I followed it with keen interest , though , wishing it well .
Racial segregation was an obvious injustice , and we had all heard lurid tales of life in the American South .
Like most intelligent teenagers , I was sensitive to injustice , and wanted to see it corrected .
I can tell you a thing that has been considerably forgotten now , flushed away down the memory hole .
Here ’s the thing .
At that time , everyone who supported the Civil Rights Movement — everyone , absolutely everyone — assumed that the Movement would , if it succeeded , lead to a more harmonious society , a society in which the races mingled freely as equal citizens , a society in which race matt ered to nobody but the manufacturers of cosmetics .
They , we , all assumed that if the shackles of legal discrimination were removed , black Americans would swiftly distribute themselves across America ’s class , income , and status structure in the same proportions as their white fellow - citizens .
Why should they not ?
Human beings form a single biological species .
Given a level playing field , any group should perform as well as any other , in any kind of endeavor , should n’t it ?
What a terrible disillusioning there has been !
Things did not happen in the least as we expected .
True , there has been much improvement .
Our nation now has a flourishing black middle class .
There is now no obstacle to a capable black American , from any part of the country , rising to any level , in any sphere or profession .
The casual mocking and insulting of black Americans by nonblack Americans has been shamed out of our social life .
Yet the numbers did not come out right , not at all .
With black people at thirteen percent of our population , we should , if the dreams of the Civil Rights Movement had come true , find that thirteen percent of our engineers and airline pilots , thirteen percent of our storekeepers , contractors , and entrepreneurs , thirteen percent of our prisoners and unwed mothers , are black .
This is not , of course , what we find ; and the numerical discrepancies are not of the kind called “ statistically insignificant . ”
Not at all .
Not at all .
Worse yet , and even setting aside issues of class and status , black and nonblack Americans have drifted apart , and in many respects are further from common citizenship now than they were fifty years ago .
We do not , for example , watch the same TV programs and movies .
The producers of a middle - class domestic comedy movie — one with someone like Meg Ryan or Tom Hanks in it — can leave black people out of the movie altogether if they feel like it , confident in the knowledge that black Americans do n’t watch that kind of movie anyway .
Similarly , sitcoms like Cheers and Friends could field all - white casts with a clear conscience , knowing that the black audience was off somewhere else , watching some different sitcom with an all - black cast .
We do n’t even name our kids the same way any more .
Black Americans were always somewhat more adventurous than nonblacks in choosing names for their children — H.L. Mencken has an interesting section on this in The American Language .
It is none the less the case that black and nonblack Americans of 100 years ago for the most part chose their children ’s names from the same stock .
This is no longer the case .
More than forty percent of black girls born in the state of California in 2004 got a name that was not given to a single one of the 100,000 nonblack girls born that year .
( In this context , I note something a doctor in New York City once told me .
Among Ob - Gyn practitioners in America ’s inner cities , he said , one chore that has to be performed at pretty regular intervals is dissuading illiterate teenage black mothers from naming their infants “ LaTreen . ” )
Meanwhile , among nonblack Americans , a rigorous and intolerant ideology of “ anti-racism ” has grown up .
The opinions a nonblack American has , or more precisely voices , about race are now a major in - group ( I mean , among fellow nonblacks ) status marker .
Let me just elaborate on that a little .
Modern neuroscience perceives the human brain as a modular structure , different modules performing different functions .
Since humans are quintessentially social animals , much of the brain is given over to processing social information .
A big part of this information concerns in - group status .
We need to be constantly evaluating , and re-evaluating , the status of ourselves and others in the various groups we belong to .
A mistake in this respect can be fatal — as , for example , in the case of an undersized low - status male foolishly challenging one of the group ’s alpha males .
Evolution has a way of weeding these things out .
Some neuroscientists have postulated an entire module of the brain given over to these highly important issues of in - group status evaluation .
Among American nonblacks in the present age , being known to have “ incorrect ” opinions about race results in catastrophic loss of status .
A literary example will illustrate the point very well .
Here is America ’s foremost observer of our social mores , Tom Wolfe , writing in the mid-1980s in his novel The Bonfire of the Vanities .
In the extract below we have a lower - middle - class but upwardly striving white couple , the Kramers .
The Kramers have a baby , and have hired a nurse to help look after it .
Their yuppie instincts led them to an agency recommended by the New York Times , and the agency provided them with a crisply - turned - out , briskly efficient , English baby nurse , also white .
The presence of this Englishwoman in their apartment causes considerable psychic stress to the young couple .
On the one hand , she is an employee , so of course they , who are paying her wages , ought to outrank her in status .
One the other hand she is English .
It is a peculiar thing — a very peculiar thing , when you consider this nation ’s origins — that being English gives you extra status points in the U.S.A. all by itself .
It ’s odd , and I do not know why it is so ; but I can assure you , being English - born myself , that it is so .
So this baby nurse , socially inferior to the Kramers on an employer - employee scale , actually outranks them on status , just by virtue of being English .
The psychic stress is , as I said , acute .
Then one day the husband , wife , and baby nurse are watching news footage of a race riot on TV .
The English nurse passes some mildly anti-black remarks : “ The colored do n’t know how good they ’ve got it in this country … ” etc .
I will let Tom Wolfe tell the rest .
Kramer and his wife looked at each other .
He could tell she was thinking the same thing he was .
Thank God in heaven !
What a relief !
They could let their breaths out now .
Miss Efficiency was a bigot .
These days the thing about bigotry was , it was undignified .
It was a sign of Low Rent origins , of inferior social status , of poor taste .
So they were the superiors of their English baby nurse , after all .
What a fucking relief .
As always with Tom Wolfe , this is absolutely spot - on social observation .
Reveal yourself to be racially “ incorrect , ” and watch your in - group status points go swirling down the toilet .
And look at the emotions on display there .
In - group status evaluation is not just a matt er of cold arithmetic .
Powerful emotions are engaged : pride , humiliation , envy , fear .
The co-opting of this key portion of the nonblack psyche by “ anti-racist ” reformers was a tremendous triumph .
So instead of the harmonious race - unconscious society every thoughtful person hoped for fifty years ago , we have this separation , or at least disjunction ; and we have this major warping of the nonblack in - group status - evaluation system .
( In - group status evaluation among black Americans operates quite differently — another disjunction .
Broadly speaking , a black American may express any opinion at all about nonblacks without loss of in - group status . )
We also , of course , have all the hideous , rickety , noisome , rancorous apparatus of Affirmative Action , corporate shakedowns , sensitivity training , Black History Month , “ discrimination ” lawsuits , “ profiling ” protests , speech codes , dumbed - down public service exams , and the rest of it .
And then there are the atrocious double standards : Karl Rove making a friendly speech at a conference of La Raza ( “ The Race ” ) , when we all know that Rove would rather be torn to pieces by wild dogs than be seen in company with even a single individual known to promote , on behalf of Rove ’s race , what the activists of La Raza promote on behalf of theirs .
It ’s not a pretty sight .
To those dwindling few of us who can remember the hopes of the Civil Rights Movement , it is a great , a terrible , a bitter and painful disillusioning .
* * * * *
How have conservatives responded to this disillusioning ?
So far as mainstream conservatives are concerned , I do n’t think it is unfair to reply : with silence and cowardice .
First , the silence .
This is quite adequately explained by the remarks I offered above , concerning the origins of the Civil Rights movement , and the rise of “ anti-racism ” as a major in - group status marker among nonblacks .
( And by way of noting that this is indeed a rise , quite a recent one , let me record a remark I heard in the mid-1980s from an elderly , but perfectly clear - headed , gentleman who was at that time a senior professor in one of the humanities departments of an Ivy League university not a million miles from Cambridge , Massachusetts .
I was sitting with Professor X at a table with half a dozen other professional or academic white men , all middle - aged or elderly — a generation or more above the Kramers .
I had married my wife a few months before , and brought her out of China to live with me in New York City .
I told the professor this .
“ And what , ” asked this distinguished gentleman , “ what does she think of our noble savages ? ”
Call me naïve , but it took me a moment or two to grasp his meaning .
No - one present visibly minded the remark .
There was no status loss . )
“ Conservative ” is a general political designation , of course ; but most people who make a point of being known as conservative are in the business of trying to sell ideas to people .
They are , or aspire to be , politicians , or commentators , or writers or producers of some kind .
These are hard , ill - paid , competitive lines of work , and it is not easy to rise in them .
The catastrophic loss of status involved in revealing oneself to have “ incorrect ” opinions about race is a career - killer in these spheres , and it is not very surprising that mainstream conservatives keep their mouths shut .
The cowardice is a bit harder to excuse .
Silence is merely a sin of omission .
When a mainstream conservative breaks his silence on race , and opens his mouth , and extrudes words , those words conform in fairly precise particulars to what a Leftist would have said on the same occasion .
If , for example , you can persuade a conservative to say anything at all about the extraordinarily high levels of crime among black Americans , he will fall back on standard boilerplate Leftist cant about “ root causes ” … “ oppression ” … “ discrimination ” … “ racism ” … “ poverty ” … “ legacy of slavery ” … “ opportunity ” … , and so on .
His conservatism has evaporated before your eyes .
He has become a social engineer , a victimologist .
On race , all goodthinkful people are liberals .
Perhaps that is not altogether fair .
Some borderline - respectable conservatives — I am thinking here of people like Heather Mac Donald and Ward Connerly — have deviated from orthodoxy enough to give us brilliant , critical essays on topics like racial profiling or affirmative action .
This is all activity at the fringes , though .
No major American conservative politician — most certainly not our current “ compassionately conservative ” President — would touch Connerly or Mac Donald with a ten - foot pole .
I tag this mealy - mouthed approach to race among conservatives as cowardice because any given conservative could , at any time , just have kept his mouth shut .
That conservatives do not always keep their mouths shut on race might just signify a lack of self - control ; that , when they do open their mouths , what comes out is Leftist sociobabble , I call cowardice .
Conservatives should challenge liberal orthodoxy at every turn , with a prudent respect for what Willam F. Buckley calls “ the prevailing structure of taboos . ”
If that prevailing structure dictates silence , then keep silence .
Do n’t feed , do n’t nourish , liberal orthodoxy .
That is cowardice .
In a narrow party - political sense , it is treason .
* * * * *
What , actually , is that orthodoxy ?
What defines the meaning of those words I have been putting in scare quotes — “ correct , ” “ anti-racism , ” and the rest ?
I think a single dogma encompasses it all .
For my purposes here , I shall call it the Dogma of Zero Group Differences , or DZGD .
To get to grips with the DZGD , consider the following thought experiment :
Experiment X : Take a largish group — say five thousand — of people at random from any fairly compact , but not too compact , populated region — fifty to a hundred miles across , say — anywhere in the world .
Now take a second group of the same size from some other similar region elsewhere .
Run both groups through batteries of physical , mental , and personality tests .
What can we say about the results of these tests , of this experiment ?
The first , and unhappiest , thing to say is that the results are , by definition , statistical .
This is a terrible drawback to sensible discussion in the public , the political , sphere .
Statistical truth is extraordinarily difficult for untrained minds to grasp .
I know what I am talking about , for I was once a teacher of statistics .
I use a different thought experiment to illustrate this sad truth .
Imagine you are addressing a room full of people .
We can let them be quite well - educated people , so long as they are not trained statisticians .
A room full of students from some university Humanities department will do nicely .
Now say the following thing to the room : “ Men are , on average , taller than women . ”
I can almost guarantee — it is nearly a dead certainty — that someone in the room will stand up and say something like : “ What about Sally ?
She ’s taller than any of us .
Taller than you , for sure — Ha ha ha ha ! ”
The room will then consider your thesis to have been decisively exploded .
Men taller than women ?
Nonsense !
Look at Sally !
That , I am afraid , is how the untrained human mind works .
For the past few years I have been writing pop-math books for a living , and let me tell you , it ’s damn hard work .
Mathematical and scientific thinking is deeply unnatural .
Statistical thinking about our fellow human beings is doubly or trebly so .
It goes against all the grain of human nature , against all the social habits programmed into our brains .
Anyone can see Sally , but without special training , no - one can see a group average , let alone a standard deviation .
We are all interested in other people , but very few of us are interested in multivariate distributions or correlation coefficients .
People magazine has a far , far larger circulation figure than the Notices of the American Mathematical Society , and I am willing to hazard a speculation that this will always be so .
All right , all right ; the results of our group tests are statistical .
Let ’s suppose we accept that , and train ourselves to read them .
What will they tell us ?
Well , it will of course depend on our groups .
If one comes from Oslo , Norway , and one from Bismarck , North Dakota , we may find that the statistical profiles of our two groups are wellnigh identical , in spite of the great distance between the two sources .
Rather often , however , this will not be the case .
Some of the physical statistics will exhibit strikingly different profiles .
On height , for example , a group of Netherlanders will show markedly different statistics from a group of Japanese .
Even on physical abilities , we will get different histograms .
It is possible that your “ racial sensitivity ” training has been so thorough you did not notice , but according to John Entine ’s book Taboo , published in 2000 , it was a fact that : “ All of the thirty - two finalists in the last four Olympic men ’s 100 - meter races [ were ] of West African descent . ”
There is likewise a preponderance of East Africans in long - distance running , of Polynesians in American football and Australian rugby , of Northeast Asians in diving , of North Europeans in swimming , and so on .
These things are so obvious , and so well - known , that I think even the most doctrinaire racial egalitarian will defer to them , if you press them on him .
He will insist on reframing our Experiment X as follows :
Experiment Y : Take a largish group — say five thousand — of people at random from any fairly compact , but not too compact , populated region — fifty to a hundred miles across , say — anywhere in the world .
Now take a second group of the same size from some other similar region elsewhere .
Run both groups through batteries of mental and personality tests .
… dropping the “ physical ” altogether .
He will then assert the DZGD , or Dogma of Zero Group Differences , as follows :
The Dogma of Zero Group Differences ( DZGD )
Experiment Y will , under all circumstances , with all possible combinations of groups , deliver identical statistical profiles on all metrics , with only statistically insignificant variations .
The DZGD is the ruling dogma of our society in the matt er of race .
To be regarded as a respectable member of society , you must affirm it , or at very least not openly deny it .
If you deny it , or even question it , you must be prepared to see your in - group status points hemorrhage away .
Depending on your circumstances , you might even lose your job , or find yourself being sued .
And all these things , for the reasons I sketched out above , are especially true for conservatives .
* * * * *
There are three things to be said about the DZGD .
First , it is empirically false .
Second , it contradicts everything we know about the natural development of populations of living creatures .
Third , it causes discord , disorder , and hatred when let loose in a multiracial society .
I would go so far as to say that it is a dangerous , poisonous , and evil doctrine .
· Empirically false .
The empirical falsehood of the DZGD has been so often demonstrated that only a willful stubbornness , joined with an ingrained terror of being thought insufficiently “ anti-racist , ” could lead anyone to deny the evidence , once it has been fairly presented to him .
There is a widespread public impression that this evidence is of a scattered and dubious sort , assembled by people with axes to grind , probably for nefarious purposes .
The late Stephen Jay Gould , who , as well as being a committed “ anti-racist , ” was a Marxist ( and not a psychometrician , but a paleontologist ) , wrote a book to this effect , still widely read and quoted .
This impression is , however , a false one .
Good - quality empirical evidence on the quantification of the human personality and human mental abilities now goes back nearly a century .
All conceivable objections to this evidence on grounds of methodology have been pondered , debated , and corrected for .
Researchers from all over the political spectrum , from Charles Murray , who is a libertarian conservative , to James Flynn , a liberal activist so far to the Left he fled the 1960s U.S.A. on principle to live in New Zealand , are in basic agreement on the core facts of group differences .
Statistical differences in scores on various tests of personality and mental ability are as well established as the orbit of the Moon .
( An academic sociologist of my acquaintance refers to the famous one - standard - deviation black / white gap on IQ scores as “ the fundamental constant of American sociology . ”
The statistically - challenged should note that among the mathematical consequences of this gap is the fact that at least six million black Americans score higher on IQ tests than the average nonblack American . )
Because the DZGD holds such sway in the public and political spheres , the academics who know all this stuff perfectly well are mostly silent about it when confronting the general public ; but get the man in his lab or study , and you will hear it all .
And the evidence is not , in fact , all locked away in technical literature .
If you read a newspaper , even a liberal broadsheet like the New York Times , you cannot fail to have noticed the recurrent stories about how some city fire department , or county police department , or some other public agency with strict entrance requirements , is being sued because black applicants fail the written admission exam at far higher rates than nonblacks .
These stories have been appearing at regular intervals for thirty years , to my certain recollection , and you would have thought that the collective ingenuity of a mighty and populous nation would by now have figured out the cause of them , and the proper means of correction .
No , nobody can ; it is a perfect bafflement !
An unfathomable mystery !
The only response anyone can come up with is to keep dumbing down the tests .
In my local police department ( Suffolk County , Long Island ) , after a number of lawsuits , this has now gone so far that the test questions are of the type :
“ What was your favorite athletic activity in high school ? ”
Everyone passes , and applicants are then selected on a straightforward numerical quota by race .
Problem solved !
( Similar remarks apply to that other hardy perennial of the broadsheet press , the story about school districts , despite heroic efforts , mysteriously failing to bring black test scores into line with nonblack ones .
Under the No Child Left Behind
Act , states are required by law to redouble their efforts in this regard — to advance from the merely heroic to the superhuman .
States are responding in the only way they can , by cooking the books . )
· Contrary to biology .
In almost any population of a living , interbreeding species , you will observe some variations between individuals .
The individuals are not all identical .
Some of these variations ( red hair , in a human population ) are heritable ; some ( appendec tom y scars ) are not .
Some ( fleetness of foot in prey animals , camouflage in moths ) increase one ’s chances of surviving and reproducing ; some ( poor eyesight , a defective immune system ) decrease those chances .
Darwin ’s great insight was that those variations that are both heritable and advantageous will increase in frequency in the population over time , because of differential breeding success .
That , said Darwin , is how populations change .
And if a population divides , with one part going here and breeding mainly among itself , and another part going there and doing the same , then because the two sub-populations will have different starting “ menus ” of variation in them ( “ founder effect ” ) , and perhaps also because they are now in different environments , under different survival stresses , the environment favoring some variations and disfavoring others ( “ natural selection ” ) , they will diverge from each other over time .
And that , said Darwin , explains the origin of species .
The group of modern humans who emerged from Africa 50,000 or so years ago split up in just this way , and settled in various parts of the world as populations interbreeding mainly among themselves .
These human groups , and subgroups , and sub- subgroups , developed their own peculiarities as a result of founder effect , natural selection , and some other minor effects I need not go into .
There was nothing like enough time for speciation to occur — we are indeed all one species — but there was plenty of time for group differences to develop .
If human groups , long mostly isolated from each other , in severely different environments , and interbreeding mostly among themselves , had not developed distinctive group characteristics , that would be biologically astounding .
And of course , we all know that such group characteristics exist .
We can see them — skin color , hair texture , stature , muscle - to - fat ratio , epicanthic fold , and so on .
Fortunately these visible group characteristics were excluded from the DZGD when we dropped the word “ physical . ”
Phew !
Thus , the obvious , visible group differences we are all familiar with are the only ones .
There are no others .
There are no group differences other than physical ones .
That is the DZGD .
It is , as I have said , biologically preposterous .
Physical differences are not biologically “ privileged ” in any way .
Since great swathes of our personalities and mental abilities are known , in good functional detail , to be products of brain activity , the physical / mental dicho tom y is to a large degree , and perhaps entirely , an artificial one .
The brain is an organ .
It has an ontogeny and a phylogeny , like any other organ .
We know a lot about that ontogeny and that phylogeny , and are learning more at a galloping rate .
· An evil doctrine .
Why do I say that the DZGD is a dangerous and evil doctrine ?
It is false , to be sure ; but a false doctrine need not be dangerous .
If the generality of Americans came to believe that Jupiter is further away from the Sun than Neptune , they would have come to believe a falsehood ; but in all probability , society would go on much as before , and only pedants would feel any distress .
Suppose you are a black American .
( You might , of course , actually be a black America — no offense .
If you are not , suppose you are . )
Looking around , you notice all the familiar statistics of black America : the high rates of incarceration , single parenthood , and other dysfunctions .
You also note that black Americans do not do very well in school ( statistically speaking ) , do not have a fair proportion of good jobs , and so on .
What is your logical deduction from all this ?
If you cleave to the DZGD , as everyone from the President on down insists that you must in order to be accepted into polite society , there is only one possible conclusion you can come to :
Some force is keeping black people down .
Since , on the DZGD , the statistical profile of your group on all measurable abilities is just like the statistical profile of any other group , there must be some force keeping black people away from society ’s goods .
What other force can that be , but the malice of nonblack people ?
Oppression !
Racism !
The DZGD thus generates discord and hatred .
It is touted as a sine qua non of the modern civilized outlook .
In fact it is a poisonous , anti-social doctrine , as well as a false one .
How on earth did it come to have such a grip on our culture , against all the evidence of our own eyes , all the accumulated experience of the ages , and all the researches of our best minds ?
The DZGD also lies behind our county ’s current insouciance towards mass Third World immigration .
If any ten thousand Somalians ( say ) are statistically indistinguishable from any ten thousand Americans , what difference does it make ?
It ’s just a matt er of numbers — and we all know that swelling numbers guarantee national wealth and success ( look at China , India , Brazil , … ) .
If the DZGD is false , then of course it may not be just a matt er of numbers … but that is unthinkable , unsayable .
And so the deluge continues .
This is a topic all by itself , but it is well aired elsewhere , and I only want to note that the DZGD is a driving force in mass Third World immigration , as well as in inter-racial domestic discord .
But what would happen if we abandoned the DZGD ?
We shall soon find out .
New understandings in population genetics , in paleoanthropology , in neuroscience , are rendering the DZGD more and more untenable .
Faith in it will drain away , first among specialists ( this has already largely happened ) , then among the general educated public , and at last among our politicians , educators , and the public at large .
* * * * *
Conservatism , to me , is the politics of the Cold Eye .
It strives to see human beings as they are , not through a smeared lens of wishful thinking or abstract ideology .
Conservatives have , or used to have , no patience with grand schemes of human improvement via government action .
Improvements may happen , but they do so organically , through advances in understanding , or the softening of manners brought on by an easier , less arduous , less dangerous life .
These things all rest , to a large degree , on scientific progress .
So it will be with the great social improvement brought about by the imminent discrediting of the DZGD .
What will the United States look like when the DZGD has been abandoned ?
I think we shall be a happier and healthier society .
Why should group differences cause anyone discomfort , if frankly accepted ?
Individual differences do not .
All well - adjusted adults accept that on the broad range of human capabilities , any individual will score mediocre , below mediocre , or simply hopeless on most .
I tried for years to learn to play tennis , at which my father excelled ( I still have his 70 - year - old racquet ) .
It was all a waste of time .
I was no good , and never could be .
I simply do n’t have hand - eye co-ordination .
I stink at a great many other things , too .
Even at the things I do n’t stink at , the things I make my living doing , I know , just in my personal acquaintance , half a dozen people who do them better .
Very few of us indeed are the best in the world at anything , or even strikingly good at anything .
Most of us are mediocre at most things , and dismayingly inferior at many .
Somehow we live with the knowledge of our own mediocrity — quite cheerfully , in most cases .
If we can cope with this knowledge at the level of an individual person , comparing himself with other individual persons , why should we not be able to cope with it at the level of a group — a rather arbitrary group , since none of us picked his ancestors ?
I think we shall be surprised to find that we can , once we have got rid of the wretched , poisonous , fallacious DZGD .
Some other measures will then be seen to be necessary for social harmony : the abolition of affirmative action and of laws against petty discrimination , a radical overhaul of our dependency - creating social support systems ( for which , many good ideas are available for consideration — this one , for instance ) , different philosophies on education and immigration .
We are not in a very happy place today with race .
One large group of citizens avoids , and is avoided by , the other — just look at patterns of residential segregation .
The traditional American approach to dire social problems is to move away from them : hence “ white flight , ” the growth of gated communities , new townships in the desert , and so on .
That ca n’t go on .
The USA is big , but not so big that we can keep running away from each other indefinitely .
To a patriot , in any case , all this separation is obnoxious .
Ca n’t we all just get along ?
We are Americans , for heaven ’s sake — citizens of the same country .
Our country has enemies who hate us , and do not distinguish among us by ancestry group .
Why should we distinguish ?
And this is not just any country ; it is the Can Do country , the problem - solving country , the nation that fixes things .
Race slavery was a great wrong : we fixed it .
Legal segregation was a lesser wrong , but still intolerable to us at last : we fixed it .
Hung up on mid-20th - century social - engineering fantasies , we replaced it with something that , while a still lesser wrong , must none the less be odious to anyone who takes pride in our nation and its ideals , or even just to anyone who wants to be able to walk freely abroad in his own city without doing quick mental statistical analyses on the colors of the faces he sees .
Perhaps we can fix this too , if we start dismantling the edifice of lies and guilt we have built around race this past forty years .
And who is going to do the fixing , if not conservatives ?
Surely not liberals — the party of wishful thinking and social engineering and clientage , the people who once hailed New Soviet Man , who wrecked black family life , who insist that racial guilt be taught to little children in our schools , who encourage whole classes of citizens to think of themselves as victims — victims of the imagined malignity of their fellow Americans .
I have had enough of the sowers of discord , and of that great engine of discord I have called the DZGD .
I think it is time we turned aside from the path of error , lies , and folly .
Lies beget lies , and nothing good was ever built on lies .
We should begin by speaking the truth to each other , citizen to citizen , and by striving to learn actual facts about our human natures , and to adapt our understanding to those facts .
Only conservatives can take the lead here — we conservatives , we who unflinchingly embrace cold fact , we who are unafraid to stare the universe in the face , we who know the difference between ideals and fantasies .
It ’s time we started .

Photo : William Colburn * Editor 's note : Jorn Barger of Robot Wisdom coined the term " weblog " Dec. 17 , 1997 – 10 years ago Monday – to describe the daily list of links that " logged " his travels across the web .
Barger 's blog and essays on James Joyce and AI have earned high praise , but his opinions about Israeli policy have led to accusations of anti-semitism ( see Wikipedia ) .
In the decade hence , Barger feels that he 's gained some wisdom of his own about blogging .
Here are Barger 's top 10 tips for novice bloggers .
My intent for weblogs in 1997 was to make the web as a whole more transparent , via a sort of " mesh network , " where each weblog amplifies just those signals ( or links ) its author likes best .
1998 -1999 was for me the Golden Age of Weblogs , when the following principles were widely understood :
1 . A true weblog is a log of all the URLs you want to save or share .
( So del.icio.us is actually better for blogging than blogger .com . )
2 . You can certainly include links to your original thoughts , posted elsewhere … but if you have more original posts than links , you probably need to learn some humility .
3 . If you spend a little time searching before you post , you can probably find your idea well articulated elsewhere already .
4 . Being truly yourself is always hipper than suppressing a link just because it 's not trendy enough .
Your readers need to get to know you .
5 . You can always improve on the author 's own page title , when describing a link .
( At least make sure your description is full enough that readers will recognize any pages they 've already visited , without having to visit them again . )
6 . Always include some adjective describing your own reaction to the linked page ( great , useful , imaginative , clever , etc . )
7. Credit the source that led you to it , so your readers have the option of " moving upstream . "
8 . Warn about " gotchas " – weird formatting , multipage stories , extra-long files , etc .
Do n't camouflage the main link among unneeded ( or poorly labeled ) auxiliary links .
9 . Pick some favorite authors or celebrities and create a Google News feed that tracks new mentions of them , so other fans can follow them via your weblog .
10 . Re-post your favorite links from time to time , for people who missed them the first time .

Let ’s chat about money .
Cash , moolah , the big bucks , treasure .
Greenbacks .
Funds .
Scratch .
Coin of the realm .
You know — the stuff we kill ourselves ( and sometimes each other ) to get ahold of .
People who pretend to know will tell you that money cannot buy you happiness .
In fact , they say , too much of it can even cause you grief , and ruin your life .
There is ample evidence that there ’s something to this , too — lottery winners are often right back where they started , financially , a short time after taking possession of their loot … wealthy business owners often lead lives of desperate loneliness , estranged from their own family and without any real friends … and many folks who strike it rich go into life - long funks worrying about losing it all , and the paranoia makes them suspicious , nervous , unlikeable pricks .
Still … most of us want to experience the horror of having lots of dough for ourselves , thank you very much .
We ’ll take the risk of being ruined forever by a too - fat bank account .
Well … as with most of the good info in life , this topic bears a little airing out .
It ’s not black - and - white , and it ’s definitely worth exploring a bit .
In fact …
I just returned from a weekend brainstorm at my pal Joe Polish ’s joint in Phoenix ( attended by a bevy of bucks - heavy business mavens ) where this very subject was a hot discussion point .
( I was there as a guest lecturer .
The regulars were all part of Joe ’s schockingly - successful “ $ 25 K Mastermind Group ” — who literally write twenty - five thou checks just for the privilege of attending four of these carefully - presented events each year . )
( If you ’ve ever demanded real - world proof that mastermind groups are worthwhile , this should shut you up quickly :
The event I spoke at was the last of the year , and everyone in attendance considered the cost a genuine bargain … and most were eager to pay again for another year . )
( Think about that . )
Anyway …
Joe asked me to clarify an operating statement I ’ve been tossing around for years .
It goes like this : Money will solve problems that not having money creates .
I came up with that slogan over a decade ago , in an attempt to explain to MYSELF the role money should play in my life .
Other folks liked it so much , I ’ve been bouncing it off of audiences every since .
The concept of money not making you happy is not unique , of course .
I just googled the phrase , and there are deep references to brilliant minds ( both ancient and modern ) stressing that very point .
But for my mind ( always antsy about details ) , the “ money problem ” was n’t that simple .
Yeah , money wo n’t make you happy .
It wo n’t dissolve your psychological problems .
It wo n’t magically grease the skids of life … at least not much .
But there ’s a subtle reality to having money that is n’t so easily put into a motto .
What my phrase does — money solves problems that not having money creates — is to focus on the issue as I saw it back when I first started earning some Big Bucks .
See , I ’ve been poor .
In fact , it was a major catalyst for me — one day , as my bank account once again floated below solvency and I was again eyeing my precious ‘ 64 Stratocaster as fodder for the pawn shop , I just snapped .
I did n’t want to be that poor anymore .
Here I was , living in a free country oozing with opportunity and flush with the means to take advantage of that opportunity … and I was just floating along like driftwood on a stormy ocean , buffeted about without direction , plan or goal .
For me , it suddenly seemed criminal that I was languishing on the bottom rungs of the financial ladder .
Rent was a problem every single month .
If my rattle - trap Toyota broke down somewhere , I would have to just take the license plates off and leave it for thieves , cuz the price of a tow job would bankrupt me ( let alone the price of having to fix any part of it ) .
I was wearing clothes from thrift shops , not that there ’s anything wrong with that … but one fine early autumn , everhthing just hit rock bottom : I lost my pitifully - low - paying job , my place to live and my girlfriend all within a couple of weeks .
And I discovered I could fit everything I owned into the back of my Celica ( yes , including that precious Strat and the Princeton Reverb amp ) , with room to spare .
Now , the stories I have to tell you about the six - month period that followed are pretty wild … but that ’s for some other time .
I lived out of the car , slept on friend ’s and near - friend ’s couches , and spent many , many moments ( sometimes in the drizzling rain ) in foreign fields and driveways and streets keeping that car alive ( barely ) with used parts and desperate ingenuity .
( Including chewing gum , bent paper clips and rubber bands keeping critical elements of the engine functional . )
In fact , I now consider it damned lucky that I went through that period of near - disaster .
It was my personal “ trek through the desert ” , looking for America and relying on my wits and living in the gritty reality of never knowing where I ’d be tomorrow .
You know — the classic American Road Novel .
So I do n’t regret doing any of that .
I ’m glad I survived , because there were times of extreme danger ( and occasional violence ) … all very normal when you ’re forced to sometimes rely on strangers for help , in unfamiliar towns where the nearest friend might be several day ’s journey or longer away .
And no one knew where you were .
I was a ghost , popping up every so often to let family and friends know I was still kicking , and then disappearing again .
But living literally on fumes like that helped me finally make up my mind that I was n’t going to do it again .
If there was a point to be proved , fine — I ’d proved it .
I could manage .
I survived .
I had wandered over the edge , without a safety net , and come back with only minor damage .
And , just to further make the point , I gotta tell you that I was happy , much of the time .
Usually when I was deep into some adventure or other .
However , the reality of encountering trouble I could n’t solve with my wits was always hovering , and the free - floating anxiety was intense .
I ’m sure many of you have had similar experiences .
So I learned , first - hand , some things about living life without money ( or at least with the very minimum needed to scrape by ) .
There was some real brotherhood among other broke people , even .
A sense of shared plight .
But the problems that cascaded onto my life seemed mostly to be caused by not having enough money to deal with them in a dignified way .
Not having money created problems .
I started to believe that having money would solve all my troubles .
A pocketfull of cash was all I needed to attain bliss .
We all need motivations that ring true to us .
These motivations are all over the map — people have charged machine gun nests because “ duty ” demanded they do so , and others have walked away from fame and wealth because some internal gauge of happiness directed them elsewhere .
For me , the motivation to finally stop being a slug and to put my nose to the grindstone of “ success ” ( a concept I had only a vague notion of at the time ) , was as simple as the sudden realization that businesses sucked at writing things , and I could charge money for some very fundamental copy skills .
I had no idea at the time just HOW much those basic skills were valued in the biz world , however .
I just wanted to rise above “ scraping by ” , and maybe get ahead one or two months in the rent .
That was it — my idea of heaven was not having to worry about July ’s rent in June .
The money started to arrive , as a direct reward for the hardest and most brain - twisting work I ’ve ever attempted … and in a relatively short time , I realized I had n’t worried about the rent for a while .
I could go buy a new car , for cash , if I liked .
That very night , in fact .
The fridge was stocked , and the price of an airline ticket to anywhere in the world actually seemed a true bargain , cuz I could pay it in full and not even notice the dough gone from my ever - burgeoning account .
However … I was n’t anywhere near as HAPPY as I ’d figured I ’d be at that point .
Money had solved all the pressing problems in my life that not having any money had created .
But I merely moved up another step on Maslow ’s Hierarchy Of Needs — from mere survival , to the new problems of “ what ’s it all mean ? ”
This was the part about having money that tends to confuse people who are n’t prepared for it .
For my entire adult life , to that point , I knew how to navigate being broke .
I was comfortable about it , even if the anxiety ate away at my stomach .
I was n’t severely unhappy being broke , because I was lucky ( or unlucky ) enough to have oodles friends in the same boat , so I never felt too alone in my sense of not “ making it ” .
Still , I had a few friends break away from the pack and get serious about biz and life , and there was a noticeable cooling of our friendships .
When everybody ’s broke , there are no screaming social problems .
When only one of you ca n’t afford to pick up a round of drinks , the disconnects start popping up .
I was paying attention during this entire journey , and I took notes because I sensed there was something important going on .
Being suddenly free of the worry about the rent did n’t open up any grand new opportunities — it simply took that time - consuming problem off the table .
In my Zen moments of gratitude , I try to remember to be thankful each time I write a big check for our big house ( with its big mortgage ) … but the main thing is that I simply do n’t spend much time thinking about it .
So money solved the problems that not having money created .
I ’m neither throwing money away now , nor hoarding it .
I was able to settle the issue in my brain and heart , by not falling into the trap of believing the slogans .
Money and happiness are two entirely different things .
One has almost nothing to do with the other .
I know many wealthy people who are miserable on every level , and I know people of very modest means who feast on life to a degree that shames their richer friends .
For me , separating the issue helped me come to terms with how money fit into my life .
I have n’t lost a single friend because of it .
I neither flaunt , nor hide my success .
I have , however , taken full advantage of the things that money offers :
More time to do the things that fuel my passions , for example .
Being chronically broke will drag you down .
You can still be a jolly fellow , but you ’ll have to devote energy and attention to things that — with money — become minor details , easily solved .
It ’s an issue worth exploring for yourself .
Many newly successful entrepreneurs are deciding NOT to grow too quickly — they , instead , groove along with a very fat income of a few hundred K and indulge in the non-biz pleasures of life .
Later on , they can ( if they so choose ) pursue the million - buck ventures that will require more attention and energy .
Depending on your age , your goals , and your situation … sooner or later , you ’re going to wake up one day and wonder what it all means .
Broke or rich , you will face this crucible in life .
It ’s inevitable .
As you work through this Zen - like question , you may decide that neither happiness ( however you define it ) nor money is worth the struggle .
You may crave something deeper , more profound , or more relevant to your heart ’s desires .
For many people , both happiness and wealth are overrated .
For most of us — and I ’m speaking from the benefit of having lived a while here — this crucible comes after the turmoil of early adulthood .
During that time of growth , you will be doing yourself a huge favor by exploring how YOU react to making too much money .
Thus , getting hip to the wonders of entrepreneurial and small biz success makes sense on a personal level .
That ’s my two cents , anyway .
It resonates tremendously with successful entrepreneurs and small biz owners .
Think about it .
And stay frosty …

AUSTRALIA plans to spy on the Japanese whaling fleet using an armed P&O cruise ship , with a lesser role for the Australian Defence Force .
High - level talks have focused on leasing the commercial vessel , Oceanic Viking , which has a re-enforced hull to cut through ice , a crew trained for polar conditions and " super- telephoto " lenses to record the whale slaughter .
Sources said the ship would also carry video equipment , and the images would be used in Australian international court action planned against the Japanese whale hunt , the largest for 20 years .
The images would complement a series of aerial surveys on whale populations , to begin soon .
Under plans being developed , the Oceanic Viking would have two .50 - calibre machine - guns manned by a customs boarding party to supply the " muscle " , while working with a civilian P&O crew .
It is highly unlikely the guns would be fired or Japanese ships boarded .
The 105 - metre vessel has already been used to chase foreign poachers of the Patagonian toothfish in the Southern Ocean .
" The bottom line is you have got to get close to really see what is going on , " one source said .
Satellite technology would be of limited use against whalers and unmanned aerial vehicles would be unlikely to have sufficient range .
The imminent Japanese Government - backed hunt aims to slaughter 935 minke whales and 50 fin whales .
For the first time since 1963 , humpbacks - 50 of them - are being targeted .

Comcast ’s apparent policy of blocking some BitTorrent traffic , which has been discussed on tech sites [ example ] for months , has now broken out into the mainstream press .
Comcast is making things worse by refusing to talk plainly about what they are doing and why .
( This is an improvement over Comcast ’s previously reported denials , which now appear to be inconsistent with the facts . )
To the extent that Comcast has explained itself , its story seems to be that it is slowing traffic from heavy users in order to keep the network moving smoothly .
This would be a reasonable thing for Comcast to do ( if they were open about it ) – but it ’s not quite what they ’re actually doing .
For starters , Comcast ’s measures are not aimed at heavy users but rather at users of certain protocols such as BitTorrent .
And not even all users of BitTorrent are targeted , but only those who use BitTorrent in a particular way : uploading a file to non-Comcast users while not simultaneously downloading parts of the same file .
( In BitTorrent jargon , this is called “ seeding ” . )
To get an idea of how odd this is , consider that an uploader who is experiencing blocking can apparently avoid the blocking by adding some download traffic .
It would likely be easier for Comcast to simply measure how much traffic each user is generating and drop the heaviest users ’ packets , or just to discard packets at random ( a tactic that falls most heavily on those who send and receive the most packets ) .
Beyond its choice of what to block , Comcast is using an unusual and nonstandard form of blocking .
There are well - established mechanisms for dealing with traffic congestion on the Internet .
Networks are supposed to respond to congestion by dropping packets ; endpoint computers notice that their packets are being dropped and respond by slowing their transmissions , thus relieving the congestion .
The idea sounds simple , but getting the details right , so that the endpoints slow down just enough but not too much , and the network responds quickly to changes in traffic level but does n’t overreact , required some very clever , subtle engineering .
What Comcast is doing instead is to cut off connections by sending forged TCP Reset packets to the endpoints .
Reset packets are supposed to be used by one endpoint to tell the other endpoint that an unexplained , unrecoverable error has occurred and therefore communication cannot continue .
Comcast ’s equipment ( apparently made by a company called Sandvine ) seems to send both endpoints a Reset packet , purporting to come from the other endpoint , which causes both endpoints to break the connection .
Doing this is a violation of the TCP protocol , which has at least two ill effects : it bypasses TCP ’s well - engineered mechanisms for handling congestion , and it erodes the usefulness of Reset packets as true indicators of error .
People have apparently figured out already how to defeat this blocking , and presumably it wo n’t be long before BitTorrent clients incorporate anti-blocking measures .
It looks like Comcast is paying the price for trying to outsmart their customers .

GUATEMALA CITY ( Reuters ) -
Three people were missing on Friday after a 200 - foot - deep hole opened up in the middle of a Guatemalan neighborhood , likely due to a burst sewer pipe .
“ It sounded like a bomb was dropping .
Boom ! ” said Carlos Gutierrez , 58 , of the crater , which measured 130 feet in diameter .
The crater appeared in the capital ’s San Antonio neighborhood on Thursday night .
Authorities evacuated hundreds of people on Friday fearing more land could collapse into a fast - flowing river of sewage below .
The missing people had lived in a house that fell into the hole .
Two bodies showed up about a mile downstream .
Neighbors said the ground had been shaking for weeks after a huge sewer pipe burst , making the ground underneath the houses unstable .

Guinness is to launch the most expensive TV ad in its 80 - year marketing history , with a domino rally that features cars , flaming hay bales and grandfather clocks
Scott Erik Kauffman on Acephalous , Chad Orzel on Uncertain Principles , GrrlScientist on Living the Scientific Life all bemoan the fact that out of the NY Times ’ list of the Notable 100 Books of 2007 there were no science books .
Here are two books I think should have made the list :
The World Without Us is Alan Weisman ’s book about what would become of the earth if suddenly all humans disappeared .
How quickly would the earth revert to wild form ?
What effects of humans would disappear , and which would remain ?
The book reminds one that the detrimental effects that humans have had on the world extend well beyond the global warming currently in the news .
Where the book is most effective is reminding us of the everyday things that we take for granted but that are in reality alien to our world ; aluminum cookware and domesticated pets come to mind right away .
Stumbling On Happiness is Daniel Gilbert ’s book about how little we know about what actually makes us happy .
To quote from the forward :
What would you do right now if you learned that you were going to die in ten minutes ?
Would you race upstairs and light that Marlboro you ’ve been hiding in your sock drawer since the Ford administration ?
Would you waltz into your boss ’s office and present him with a detailed description of his personal defects ?
Would you drive out to that steakhouse near the new mall and order a T - bone , medium rare , with an extra side of the really bad cholesterol ?
Hard to say , of course , but of all the things you might do in your final ten minutes , it ’s a pretty safe bet that few of them are things you actually did today .
Now , some people will bemoan this fact , wag their fingers in your direction , and tell you sternly that you should live every minute of your life as though it were your last , which only goes to show that some people would spend their final ten minutes giving other people dumb advice .
The quote shows that not only does Gilbert write about a topic that is central to everyone ’s life , but he does so with great insight and humor .
This is a delightful book , Freakonomics for Psychology , if you will .
To be honest , when science books have made the NY Times ’
Notable 100 books in the past , they ’ve been fairly dull , so maybe it is n’t a big deal that no science books made the list .
Heck , my idea of a spectacular science book is Mattuck ’s A Guide To Feynman Diagrams In The Many - Body Problem , which would never make a list like the Times ’ .
But these two books were quite good , written for quite a general audience , and should have been on the list .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House of Representatives voted 223-201 Thursday to require most U.S. troops to leave Iraq by April 1 , 2008 .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , shown with President Bush in March , says the American people are demanding " a new direction . "
President Bush vetoed a war - spending bill with a similar withdrawal date in May and has threatened to spike any new effort to set a timetable for a U.S. pullout .
His Republican allies in the House said the new measure has no chance of passage .
But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat , said Thursday 's mixed report on the progress of the war shows it 's time for American troops to come home .
" President Bush continues to urge patience , but what is needed -- and what the American people are demanding -- is a new direction , " she said .
Earlier Thursday , Bush said a report on U.S. - set benchmarks for Iraq shows " satisfactory progress " in eight areas .
He admitted that there is " more work to be done . "
Watch benchmark report , House vote factor into Iraq debate »
During his news conference , the president commented on the nation 's psyche , declaring , " There 's war fatigue in America .
It 's affecting our psychology .
I understand that .
" This is an ugly war .
It 's a war in which an enemy will kill innocent men , women and children in order to achieve a political objective .
It does n't surprise me that there is deep concern amongst our people . "
The president said it is not Congress ' job to make decisions regarding the war .
Before the House vote , Rep. John Murtha , a Pennsylvania Democrat , told CNN's Wolf Blitzer :
We 're the people who decide when to go to war , whether the war should be funded .
" Now , when [ the Bush administration ] keeps making mistakes as they have made , we have to intercede .
The public spoke in the last election and said clearly we want the troops redeployed . "
" We are wasting the time and trying the patience of the American people for no useful purpose , " said Oklahoma Rep .
Tom Cole , one of four Republicans who voted for the measure .
Rep. Jay Inslee , a Washington Democrat , said the United States has given Iraqi leaders " a reasonable chance " to work out their differences , and it was time for American troops to come home .
" The moral obligation to Iraq has been completed , " he said .
" The moral obligation to our families now needs to be honored . "
Four Republicans joined 219 Democrats to pass the bill , two more than backed a similar measure in March .
But 10 Democrats broke ranks to oppose it .
Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said most Republicans are unwilling to challenge Bush before a September report from Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker , the top U.S. officials in Iraq .
In a closed - door meeting Wednesday , he called Republicans who break with the president " wimps . "
" It was a way of illustrating the point that we ought to give the generals on the ground and our troops a chance to succeed , " Boehner said .
But Rep. Jim Clyburn , the House Democratic whip , said the vote shows Republicans need to resort to " intimidation " to keep their caucus in line .
" The name - calling that other side has resorted to , I think , is beneath the dignity of the men and women who find themselves in harm 's way , " said Clyburn , of South Carolina .
The vote came the same day that the White House delivered a mixed report on the progress of the 4 - year - old war , concluding that the political progress of the Iraqi government is lagging behind military gains .
Across the Capitol , the report added new fuel to a similar debate in the Senate , where a leading Republican senator pronounced himself " disappointed " in the results .
" That government is simply not providing leadership worthy of the considerable sacrifice of our forces , and this has to change immediately , " said Sen .
John Warner , the influential former chairman of the Armed Services Committee .
A broader report by the top U.S. officials in Iraq -- Petraeus , the top American commander , and Crocker -- is scheduled for September , and Bush told reporters he would consult with Congress about " the way forward " at that point .
Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl , a Republican , told CNN , " I think any judgments at this time , one way or the other , are quite premature . "
But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said , " The time to do this is now , not September . "
" We 're told , ' Good progress is being made .
Wait till September .
Good progress is being made . '
How many times over the last 4 ½ years have we heard this ? "
Reid asked .
The Senate 's Democratic leaders are using a Defense Department authorization bill as a vehicle to consider several amendments designed to force Bush to change course in the war .
Republicans have so far managed to use procedural roadblocks to head off those measures -- but faced with a U.S. death toll of more than 3,600 and deep public opposition , several GOP senators have wavered in recent weeks .
Three Republicans -- Chuck Hagel of Nebraska , Olympia Snowe of Maine and Gordon Smith of Oregon -- have co-sponsored a Democratic amendment that parallels the House bill .
But Democrats are likely to need at least eight more Republican votes before their proposal comes to a vote .
Warner and six other Republicans voted Tuesday for an amendment that would have required U.S. troops to spend a month at home for every month deployed .
Two more -- Sens. Richard Lugar and Pete Domenici -- have called on Bush to change course , but have opposed Democratic calls for an American withdrawal .

Child workers , some as young as 10 , have been found working in a textile factory in conditions close to slavery to produce clothes that appear destined for Gap Kids , one of the most successful arms of the high street giant .
Speaking to The Observer , the children described long hours of unwaged work , as well as threats and beatings .
Gap said it was unaware that clothing intended for the Christmas market had been improperly subcontracted to a sweatshop using child labour .
It announced it had withdrawn the garments involved while it investigated breaches of the ethical code imposed by it three years ago .
The discovery of the children working in filthy conditions in the Shahpur Jat area of Delhi has renewed concerns about the outsourcing by large retail chains of their garment production to India , recognised by the United Nations as the world 's capital for child labour .
According to one estimate , more than 20 per cent of India 's economy is dependent on children , the equivalent of 55 million youngsters under 14 .
The Observer discovered the children in a filthy sweatshop working on piles of beaded children 's blouses marked with serial numbers that Gap admitted corresponded with its own inventory .
The company has pledged to convene a meeting of its Indian suppliers as well as withdrawing tens of thousands of the embroidered girl 's blouses from the market , before they reach the stores .
The hand - stitched tops , which would have been sold for about £ 20 , were destined for shelves in America and Europe in the next seven days in time to be sold to Christmas shoppers .
With endorsements from celebrities including Madonna , Lenny Kravitz and Sex and the City star Sarah Jessica Parker , Gap has become one of the most successful and iconic brands in fashion .
Last year the firm embarked on a huge poster and TV campaign surrounding Product Red , a charitable trust for Africa founded by the U2 lead singer Bono .
Despite its charitable activities , Gap has been criticised for outsourcing large contracts to the developing world .
In 2004 , when it launched its social audit , it admitted that forced labour , child labour , wages below the minimum wage , physical punishment and coercion were among abuses it had found at some factories producing garments for it .
It added that it had terminated contracts with 136 suppliers as a consequence .
In the past year Gap has severed contracts with a further 23 suppliers for workplace abuses .
Gap said in a statement from its headquarters in San Francisco :
' We firmly believe that under no circumstances is it acceptable for children to produce or work on garments .
These allegations are deeply upsetting and we take this situation very seriously .
All of our suppliers and their subcontractors are required to guarantee that they will not use child labour to produce garments .
In this situation , it 's clear one of our vendors violated this agreement and a full investigation is under way . '
Professor Sheotaj Singh , co-founder of the DSV , or Dayanand Shilpa Vidyalaya , a Delhi - based rehabilitation centre and school for rescued child workers , said he believed that as long as cut - price embroidered goods were sold in stores across Britain , America , continental Europe and elsewhere in the West , there would be a problem with unscrupulous subcontractors using children .
' It is obvious what the attraction is here for Western conglomerates , ' he told The Observer .
' The key thing India has to offer the global economy is some of the world 's cheapest labour , and this is the saddest thing of all the horrors that arise from Delhi 's 15,000 inadequately regulated garment factories , some of which are among the worst sweatshops ever to taint the human conscience .
' Consumers in the West should not only be demanding answers from retailers as to how goods are produced but looking deep within themselves at how they spend their money . '
One theory is that the dark native vegetation absorbs and releases more heat into the atmosphere than the light - colored crops .
These native plants release heat that combines with water vapor from the lower atmosphere , resulting in cloud formation .
Image BOUNDARY

Another hypothesis is that the warmer air on the native scrubland rises , creating a vacuum in the lower atmosphere that is then filled by cooler air from cropland across the fence .
As a result , clouds form on the scrubland side .
A third idea is that a high concentration of aerosols — particles suspended in the atmosphere — on the agricultural side results in small water droplets and a decrease in the probability of rainfall .
On the native landscape , the concentration of aerosols is lower , translating into larger droplets and more rainfall .
Within the last few decades , about 32 million acres of native vegetation have been converted to croplands west of the bunny fence .
On the agricultural side of the fence , rainfall has been reduced by 20 percent since the 1970s .
Dr. Nair speculates that increases in the world ’s population will prompt the clearing of more land to increase food production .
But he wonders whether , in the long run , “ we will reach a point of land clearing that will diminish food production , ” because rainfall has decreased .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The Iraqi government said it will file criminal charges against employees of security firm Blackwater USA who were involved a gun battle in Baghdad in which civilians were killed , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said Sunday .
Members of a private security company pose on the rooftop of a house in Baghdad earlier this month .
The official said the charges will come within a week .
It is not clear how Iraqi courts will attempt to bring the contractors to trial .
The Iraqi government has no authority over private security firms contracted by the U.S. government , according to a July report from the Congressional Research Service .
Order 17 from the Coalition Provisional Authority appears to shield security contractors from Iraqi laws .
It states , " Contractors shall be immune from Iraqi legal process with respect to acts performed by them pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Contract or any sub-contract thereto . "
The Iraqi government claims the private contractors , who were guarding a U.S. diplomatic convoy , killed as many as 20 civilians .
Iraqi officials , who claim the shootings were unprovoked , dispute Blackwater 's claim that the guards were responding to an attack and said on Saturday they had a videotape showing the Blackwater guards opened fire without provocation .
The incident prompted the Iraqi government to call for Blackwater 's expulsion from the country and sparked anger among Iraqis .
Watch a report on Blackwater 's response to the allegations »
U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said earlier this week the Blackwater employees involved in the incident were still in Iraq .
Word of Iraq 's intent to file charges came as no surprise .
One day after the shooting , Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki said his government would punish those responsible .
On Sunday , Rear Adm. Mark Fox , Communications Division chief for Multi-National Force - Iraq , and Dr. Tahseen Sheikhly , civilian spokesman for the Baghdad Security Operation , refused to comment on Iraq 's plan to file charges .
But they gave some details on a joint U.S. - Iraqi commission that would examine issues of security and safety in the aftermath of the shooting .
The commission -- to be co-chaired by Iraqi Minister of Defense Abd al Qadir and Patricia A. Butenis , the charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy -- will receive the results of both a State Department investigation and the separate Iraqi investigation in the next few days , Fox and Sheikhly said .
Blackwater contractors are part of the estimated 25,000 - plus employees of private security firms who are working in Iraq , guarding diplomats , reconstruction workers and government officials .
As many as 200 security contractors have been killed in Iraq , according to U.S. congressional reports .
Blackwater resumed its normal operations of providing security to U.S. civilian authorities in Iraq on Friday after a hiatus sparked by concerns among Iraqi and U.S. government officials over last weekend 's shootings .
Sheikhly said the Iraqi government has allowed Blackwater to again operate in the streets of Iraq because , otherwise , U.S. troops would have to be pulled from the field to provide security .
Meanwhile , 19 bodies were found by Iraqi police in Baghdad over the weekend , an Interior Ministry official told CNN on Sunday .
The total number of bodies reported to be found in the capital this month is 251 .

Right - wing furor demanding pardon for convicted Cheney aide
By Patrick Martin
13 March 2007
Former Bush administration officials , congressional Republicans , and the whole panoply of the American ultra- right are raising the demand for an immediate Bush pardon of I .
Lewis Libby , the former Cheney chief - of - staff who was convicted last Tuesday of four felony counts involving lies to a federal grand jury .
Some of these same individuals and institutions — pundit William Kristol , Fox News anchor Brit Hume , the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal — raised a hue and cry for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton for lying about a private sexual relationship .
But now they are declaring , in tones of outrage , that to try Libby for the same charges ( perjury and obstruction of justice ) , for which Clinton was impeached , amounts to “ criminalizing political differences . ”
The two cases , however , are radically different .
The Clinton impeachment was indeed a case of “ criminalizing political differences , ” in the sense that a criminal charge against Clinton was manufactured for political reasons .
Ultra -right groups brought forward and financed the Paula Jones lawsuit as a means of harassing and destabilizing the Clinton administration .
After the Supreme Court agreed , in an unprecedented decision , that Clinton could be compelled to testify in a civil suit while still in office , Jones ’s lawyers took Clinton ’s deposition , set a trap with questions about the unrelated Monica Lewinsky affair , and then handed off the case to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr .
The criminal case against Libby likewise had its source in political conflicts in Washington , but the charges arise directly from Libby ’s own actions as a public official .
Libby lied to the grand jury , not about a purely private matter like the Lewinsky affair , but about the White House effort to smear and punish a critic of its war policies in Iraq , former ambassador Joseph Wilson .
While no one was charged with the underlying offense of leaking the identity of Wilson ’s wife , CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson , to the media , there is no question that Libby ’s conduct was directly related to his work as Cheney ’s chief political hatchet man , and one of the most fervent advocates of the Iraq war .
In that context , his conviction is a serious blow to the Bush administration .
The Journal is , of course , well aware of the political implications of the verdict .
Its March 7 editorial declares that Libby should be pardoned immediately , warning that the conviction of one White House aide for lies related to the Iraq war will only inflame those who believe ( quite correctly ) that “ President Bush ‘ lied us into war ’ ” and lead to demands “ that Dick Cheney be strung up next . ”
The editors reproach Bush for failing to respond aggressively , thus allowing “ a trivial matter to become a threat to the Administration itself . ”
Bush was noncommittal in his reaction to the verdict , given in an interview with CNN En Español just before departing for his Latin American tour .
“ This was a lengthy trial on a serious matter , and a jury of his peers convicted him , ” he said , “ and we ’ve got to respect that conviction . ”
He said he was “ pretty much going to stay out of ” the Libby case until the legal process had run its course , suggesting that an immediate pardon was unlikely .
This comment only fueled the furor on the right , however .
Even more significant than the predictable howls from the Journal , National Review and the Weekly Standard was the editorial in the Washington Post March 7 .
This nominally liberal newspaper has moved sharply to the right over the past decade , and was perhaps the most important US editorial voice in support of the invasion and conquest of Iraq .
The editorial acknowledges that Libby ’s conviction on four counts of perjury , making false statements and obstruction of justice “ was grounded in strong evidence and what appeared to be careful deliberation by a jury . ”
It then goes to say , in effect , “ So what ? ”
The Libby case is “ a pointless Washington scandal , ” one “ remarkable for its lack of substance .
It was propelled not by actual wrongdoing but by inflated and frequently false claims and by the aggressive and occasionally reckless response of senior Bush administration officials — culminating in Mr. Libby ’s perjury . ”
In point of fact , the Libby case does have substance , not merely because the offenses of perjury and obstruction of justice are significant , but because they were only the tip of the iceberg .
Libby ’s perjury was only a small portion of the monumental lying which has been the basis of the Bush administration ’s case for war , from “ weapons of mass destruction ” to the suggestions of connections between Saddam Hussein and the September 11 terrorist attacks .
As for “ actual wrongdoing , ” the entire political program of the Bush administration consists of a series of criminal assaults on international law , the US Constitution , and the democratic rights and social interests of the vast majority of the American people .
Libby ’s perjury and obstruction of justice were carried out as a necessary part of the waging of an illegal war in which more than 3,200 American soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been killed .
The immediate purpose of Libby ’s actions — to discredit and punish a critic of the war — dovetails with the most important domestic policy of the Bush administration , its creation of the legal framework for a police state , in which anyone targeted by the White House can be spied on , wiretapped , or designated an “ illegal enemy combatant ” and arrested and locked away for life in a US government camp , with no legal recourse .
It is , of course , true that Libby ’s selection as the sole member of the Bush administration to face a prison term — at least up to now — may seem unfair , in the sense that there are many other officials even more deserving of criminal prosecution .
But that is an argument , not for dismissing the significance of the Libby case , but for establishing an international tribunal to try all the perpetrators of the US war of aggression in Iraq , including not only those directly responsible for ordering the criminal war , but those who played prominent roles in justifying and providing political cover for the monstrous slaughter unleashed against the people of Iraq — including the editors of the Journal and the Post , among others .
There is another aspect of the Libby case that deserves attention : whether the White House , despite its proclaimed “ hands - off ” policy , secretly colluded with Libby ’s own defense attorneys and with Libby himself .
An astonishing passage buried in a Washington Post news article of March 8 notes : “ Despite the defense ’s trial argument that Libby was made a scapegoat by the White House , aides and advisers said there is no anger toward him in the West Wing .
Libby ’s defense team reached out to an intermediary after its opening statement to reassure the White House about its strategy , according to a source close to the situation . ”
The American media has generally passed over this report in silence , but the Post ’s online White House columnist , Dan Froomkin , took note of it in a posting headlined , “ Did Libby Make a Deal ? ” Froomkin asks some apt questions about the sudden shift in tactics by the Libby defense , which initially suggested it would put both Cheney and Libby on the stand , and that it would charge that Libby was being made a scapegoat for higher - level administration officials ( given Libby ’s prominence , that could only be Karl Rove , Cheney and Bush himself ) .
Froomkin writes : “ Wow !
In what form did this reaching out take place ?
Was it two - way ?
Was Team Libby ’s threat to attack Rove , call Cheney to the stand and potentially spill plenty of White House secrets just a bargaining chip in some sort of negotiation ?
Was their decision to rest their case in any way related to any promises from the White House ?
Could Libby have made some sort of a deal with the White House to ensure a presidential pardon ? ”
If such a deal did take place — as seems likely — the White House has added to its crimes with a further effort to obstruct justice by ensuring that the Libby trial did not provide an exposure of the responsibility of top administration officials for the smear campaign against Joseph Wilson and his wife .
Any secret assurances to Libby of a pardon would continue and escalate the underlying crime which he committed through his initial perjury — obstructing the investigation into the leaking of Plame ’s name by providing Libby with an incentive to continue his cover-up .
The impact of the Libby case is reflected in a second remarkable commentary which appeared in the Post on the same day as Froomkin ’s blog , written by the newspaper ’s foreign - policy columnist , Jim Hoagland , a longtime proponent of a US war to overthrow Saddam Hussein .
“ What has happened to Dick Cheney ? ” the column ’s headline queries , and Hoagland then asks , “ Is the vice president losing his influence , or perhaps his mind ? ”
He notes that the question of whether Cheney has become delusional is now widespread in government circles around the world , and increasingly in top US political and media circles as well .
Referring to Cheney ’s angry and agitated demeanor in several recent television appearances , he writes , “ his irascibility in television interviews triggers diplomatic cables analyzing his equilibrium . ”
Hoagland observes , “ The Libby trial revealed serious splits between Cheney and Bush ’s political team , led by Karl Rove , who suffered no legal consequences for his role in the scandal . ”
But he suggests that Cheney is unlikely to resign unless doubts continue to grow about whether the United States has “ a vice president in stable physical , emotional and political health . ”
In other words , according to this Washington insider , “ reasons of health ” will be the pretext if Cheney has to be removed because he has become too much of a political liability .

Missouri Man Tells
The Perfect Tale of Disgust With Politicians Posted by Pile ( 10534 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Beating Dead Horses ]
An editorial submitted to a small Missouri newspaper is making the rounds online , crystallizing the disgust people have for political parties .
By Steve Thomas
A little background here might help ...
I grew up in a fairly political family .
My father was a solid Democrat .
In what can only be seen as an odd way of rebelling , I became a Republican .
I put up yard signs for Kit Bond in 1972 and was happy when Richard Nixon was re-elected .
People were n’t getting drafted anymore and in my kid- world , things were pretty good .
As time went on , I found myself more in line with moderate Republicans who effectively managed the Cold War and tried to keep government out of my life .
I thought Ford , Reagan , Bush # 1 were all good presidents .
I thought Jimmy Carter was a well - meaning screw up , though he ’s become a first - rate ex-president .
I thought Clinton was okay because for the most part , he was a moderate .
It ’s worth noting that Clinton started getting things done when Republicans took over Congress and he had someone to fight with and bargain with instead of trying to manage Congressional Democrats , a task that compares unfavorably with roping cats .
I thought George W. Bush started off well enough .
He responded to 9/11 with the right amount of diplomacy and force .
I never thought much of his tax cuts - I ’m not rich - and I found his constant harping on family values and morals to be distasteful .
( It made me think of the Sermon on the Mount : " Take heed that ye do not your alms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven . ”
But who I am to quote the Bible without sounding like W ? ) .
I supported the Iraq War in the beginning , but as its mismanagement grew , so did my disillusionment .
Yet I remained a Republican .
Then the rains came .
When the New Orleans levees gave way , so did my belief in the Republican Party .
This was an American city , pulverized by nature - though with plenty of notice , unlike an earthquake - and although the local and state authorities ( which were Democrats ) reacted with monumental ineptitude , I had confidence that a Republican administration would get the situation under control and lead a swift rebuilding .
That has n’t happened .
Instead , a great American city has been left to pull itself out of the mess while thousands of American citizens have n’t been able get decent housing or assistance from the federal government , which is firmly in the hands of the Republicans .
Maybe the Republicans were grossly incompetent or simply indifferent because most of the hardest - hit victims were poor or non-white or both .
No matter what , a Republican administration showed itself to be either monumentally inept or cruelly , methodically callous .
Either way , I did n’t want anything more to do with the Republicans .
So I declared myself an Independent and have been so since .
It was hard for me to walk away from a party that had been my political home since my youth .
Now Bush has commuted the jail sentence of former aide Scooter Libby .
After being convicted by a jury and sentenced by a judge to 30 months for obstruction of justice , Bush pulled the plug on incarceration after a higher court ruled that Scooter had to start doing time while his appeals progressed through the system .
Bush exercised his Constitutional authority and kept Scooter out of jail , saying the sentence was excessive .
This made me think about what Hunter S. Thompson wrote after Ford pardoned Nixon in 1974 :
“ Well ... this is going to be difficult .
That sold - out knucklehead refugee from a 1969 ‘ Mister Clean ’ TV commercial has just done what only the most cynical and paranoid kind of malcontent ever connected with national politics would have dared to predict ...
“ If I followed my better instincts right now , I would put this typewriter in the Volvo and drive to the home of the nearest politician -- any politician -- and hurl the g****** machine through his front window ... flush the bugger out with an act of lunatic violence then soak him down with mace and run him naked down Main Street in Aspen with a bell around his neck and black lumps all over his body from the jolts of a high powered “ Ball Buster ” cattle prod .
“ But old age has either mellowed me or broken my spirit to the point where I will probably not do that -- at least not today , because that blundering dupe in the White House has just plunged me into a deep and vicious hole . ”
After Bush scrubbed a stay in the gray bar hotel for Scooter Libby , I sat in my study for a long time , drink in hand , and eyed my 1970s IBM Selectric typewriter with dark intentions .
Would I have to do jail time for chucking an old machine through a politician ’s window in an act of angry protest while Libby roamed free ?
Once charged , I would be obliged to find an attorney who would defend me on the grounds of justifiable outrage and a strike for common sense .
In the end , though , I would just have a lamentable conviction on my record and have to pay for the living room window of someone who might be just as fed up as I .
Libby should have gone to jail , period .
He was found guilty , sentenced by a judge and his bid to put off his jail time during appeals was rejected by a panel of judges .
I think the man who prosecuted the Libby case , Patrick Fitzgerald , put it well in his statement after the commutation :
“ We fully recognize that the Constitution provides that commutation decisions are a matter of presidential prerogative and we do not comment on the exercise of that prerogative .
“ We comment only on the statement in which the President termed the sentence imposed by the judge as ‘ excessive . ’
The sentence in this case was imposed pursuant to the laws governing sentencings which occur every day throughout this country .
In this case , an experienced federal judge considered extensive argument from the parties and then imposed a sentence consistent with the applicable laws .
It is fundamental to the rule of law that all citizens stand before the bar of justice as equals .
That principle guided the judge during both the trial and the sentencing .
“ Although the President ’s decision eliminates Mr. Libby ’s sentence of imprisonment , Mr. Libby remains convicted by a jury of serious felonies , and we will continue to seek to preserve those convictions through the appeals process . ”
At least one sentence of that statement is worth repeating : “ It is fundamental to the rule of law that all citizens stand before the bar of justice as equals . ”
It reminds me of another quote , but this one from a fictional character , attorney Atticus Finch in Harper Lee ’s classic , “ To Kill A Mockingbird : ”
" Now gentlemen , in this country our courts are the great levelers , and in our courts all men are created equal .
I 'm no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts and of our jury system .
That 's no ideal to me .
That is a living , working reality . ”
The president ’s action in the Libby case has made this living , working reality into a debased , sad fantasy .
Unless all men are equal before the bar of justice , no man is equal before the bar of justice .
The commutation of Libby ’s sentence undermines the faith of the American people in the system of justice , underscoring a growing perception that this nation is increasingly unequal , that there is not one American dream but instead many American nightmares , that we are no longer a nation where competition and compassion can coexist in a unique if sometimes uncomfortable fashion .
Instead we are faced with some ugly questions and answers :
- Among the American military , who is dying in Iraq and Afghanistan ?
For the most part , people who found their best economic opportunities in the armed services , though love of country has always outweighed dollar signs among soldiers I have known .
- Who has been left to sink into despair in the wake of Hurricane Katrina ?
The poor , who had little to lose , but lost it all anyway .
- Whose jobs are disappearing overseas as the result of trade policies ?
The working poor and the lower middle class who are finding fewer and fewer opportunities for work .
- Who is having the hardest time finding health care coverage ?
The people who can least afford it .
- Who is most likely to go to jail ?
Anyone who is n’t Scooter Libby , a guy with a lot of dirty secrets about the man who had the power to commute his sentence and who , with a stroke of a pen , did just that .
America has never been a perfect , fair , country motivated only by unconditional love .
It has never been a paradise or without its great flaws .
However , no matter how big the flaws , there have always been even greater strengths to light the way into the future .
Now , George Bush and his cronies are showing America in the worst possible light .
They are illuminating the chasm between the weak and the powerful , the rich and the poor , the connected and the disconnected .
They are doing all they can to find a death row cell for the American Dream and when crunch time comes , giving none of us hope for a commutation of that sentence .
I guess it ’s no surprise .
This administration has found comfort in secret courts , domestic spying , defying Congressional subpoenas , smudging the protective line between church and state , developing policies behind closed doors , ignoring corruption and treating compromise with contempt .
When it comes to the big things , they have learned all the wrong lessons from the past .
When it comes to getting away with things , they have learned how to succeed on a grand scale .
It ’s unlikely this Congress will ever impeach George Bush because his people - some of who were close at hand during Watergate - did n’t make any Watergate - like tactical errors : no tapes , no smoking gun , no hard evidence of deliberate wrongdoing .
That does n’t make them any less guilty of what Theodore H. White described as the underlying deed that undid Nixon :
“ The true crime of Richard Nixon was simple : he destroyed the myth that binds America together , and for this he was driven from power .
“ The myth he broke was critical - that somewhere in American life there is at least one man who stands for the law , the President . . .
That faith holds that all men are equal before the law and protected by it ; and that no matter how the faith may be betrayed elsewhere , at one particular point - the Presidency - justice will done beyond prejudice , beyond rancor , beyond the possibility of a fix . ”
Cops will continue to do their duty , prosecutors will continue to do theirs and judges will do likewise , but guilty men everywhere will find comfort in knowing that the justice system can be treated like a whore , if you have enough money or clout or both .
Mob bosses will admire Bush ’s loyalty to a closed - mouth soldier and petty criminals may well want to do better than small crime because they ’ll realize that big crime pays big dividends .
Pass a bad check and go to jail .
Attempt to subvert the justice system and never see the inside of a cell .
Thanks a lot , George Bush .
Yet a small part of me wo n’t give up on our country .
I think it can be brought into a better future with a healthy application of more democracy via the ballot box .
I do n’t know who will get my vote in the future , but I wo n’t surrender to the anger and cynicism that grip me right now .
Having said that , I will confess that I plan on cleaning my old Selectric .
I want to rid it of the dust and grime acquired by sitting unused on a shelf .
That way I can be prepared for whatever else may come because I cannot , in good conscience , hurl a dirty typewriter .
But wait , there 's more .. now an op - ed from a current DOJ employee :
Bush justice is a national disgrace
By John S. Koppel
As a longtime attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice , I can honestly say that I have never been as ashamed of the department and government that I serve as I am at this time .
The public record now plainly demonstrates that both the DOJ and the government as a whole have been thoroughly politicized in a manner that is inappropriate , unethical and indeed unlawful .
The unconscionable commutation of I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby 's sentence , the misuse of warrantless investigative powers under the Patriot Act and the deplorable treatment of U.S. attorneys all point to an unmistakable pattern of abuse .
In the course of its tenure since the Sept. 11 attacks , the Bush administration has turned the entire government ( and the DOJ in particular ) into a veritable Augean stable on issues such as civil rights , civil liberties , international law and basic human rights , as well as criminal prosecution and federal employment and contracting practices .
It has systematically undermined the rule of law in the name of fighting terrorism , and it has sought to insulate its actions from legislative or judicial scrutiny and accountability by invoking national security at every turn , engaging in persistent fearmongering , routinely impugning the integrity and / or patriotism of its critics , and protecting its own lawbreakers .
This is neither normal government conduct nor " politics as usual , " but a national disgrace of a magnitude unseen since the days of Watergate - which , in fact , I believe it eclipses .
In more than a quarter of a century at the DOJ , I have never before seen such consistent and marked disrespect on the part of the highest ranking government policymakers for both law and ethics .
It is especially unheard of for U.S. attorneys to be targeted and removed on the basis of pressure and complaints from political figures dissatisfied with their handling of politically sensitive investigations and their unwillingness to " play ball . "
Enough information has already been disclosed to support the conclusion that this is exactly what happened here , at least in the case of former U.S. Attorney David C. Iglesias of New Mexico ( and quite possibly in several others as well ) .
Law enforcement is not supposed to be a political team sport , and prosecutorial independence and integrity are not " performance problems . "
In his long - awaited but uninformative testimony concerning the extraordinary firings of U.S. attorneys , Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales did not allay these concerns .
Indeed , he faced a no - win situation .
If he testified falsely regarding his alleged lack of recollection and lack of involvement , he perjured himself and lied to both Congress and the American people .
On the other hand , if he told the truth , he clearly has been derelict in the performance of his duties and is not up to the job .
Either way , his fitness to serve is now in doubt .
Tellingly , in his congressional testimony , D. Kyle Sampson ( the junior aide to whom the attorney general delegated vast authority ) expressed the view that the distinction between " performance " considerations and " political " considerations was " largely artificial . "
This attitude , however , is precisely the problem .
The administration that Sampson served has elided the distinction between government performance and politics to an unparalleled extent ( just as it has blurred the boundaries between the White House counsel 's office and the attorney general 's office ) .
And it is no answer to say that U.S. attorneys are political appointees who serve at the pleasure of the president .
The point that is lost on those who make this argument is that U.S. attorneys must not serve partisan purposes or advance a partisan agenda - which has nothing to do with requiring them to promote an administration 's legitimate policy priorities .
As usual , the administration has attempted to minimize the significance of its malfeasance and misfeasance , reciting its now - customary " mistakes were made " mantra , accepting purely abstract responsibility without consequences for its actions , and making hollow vows to do better .
However , the DOJ Inspector General 's Patriot Act report ( which would not even have existed if the administration had not been forced to grudgingly accept a very modest legislative reporting requirement , instead of being allowed to operate in its preferred secrecy ) , the White House - DOJ e-mails , and now the Libby commutation merely highlight yet again the lawlessness , incompetence and dishonesty of the present executive branch leadership .
They also underscore Congress ' lack of wisdom in blindly trusting the administration , largely rubber - stamping its legislative proposals , and essentially abandoning the congressional oversight function for most of the last six years .
These are , after all , the same leaders who brought us the WMD fiasco , the unnecessary and disastrous Iraq war , Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib , warrantless domestic NSA surveillance , the Valerie Wilson leak , the arrest of Brandon Mayfield , and the Katrina response failure .
The last thing they deserve is trust .
The sweeping , judicially unchecked powers granted under the Patriot Act should neither have been created in the first place nor permanently renewed thereafter , and the Act - which also contributed to the ongoing contretemps regarding the replacement of U.S. attorneys , by changing the appointment process to invite political abuse - should be substantially modified , if not scrapped outright .
And real , rather than symbolic , responsibility should be assigned for the manifold abuses .
The public trust has been flagrantly violated , and meaningful accountability is long overdue .
Officials who have brought into disrepute both the Department of Justice and the administration of justice as a whole should finally have to answer for it - and the misdeeds at issue involve not merely garden - variety misconduct , but multiple " high crimes and misdemeanors , " including war crimes and crimes against humanity .
I realize that this constitutionally protected statement subjects me to a substantial risk of unlawful reprisal from extremely ruthless people who have repeatedly taken such action in the past .
But I am confident that I am speaking on behalf of countless thousands of honorable public servants , at Justice and elsewhere , who take their responsibilities seriously and share these views .
And some things must be said , whatever the risk .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
After the United States has spent more than $ 5 billion in a largely failed effort to bolster the Pakistani military effort against Al Qaeda and the Taliban , some American officials now acknowledge that there were too few controls over the money .
The strategy to improve the Pakistani military , they said , needs to be completely revamped .
In interviews in Islamabad and Washington , Bush administration and military officials said they believed that much of the American money was not making its way to frontline Pakistani units .
Money has been diverted to help finance weapons systems designed to counter India , not Al Qaeda or the Taliban , the officials said , adding that the United States has paid tens of millions of dollars in inflated Pakistani reimbursement claims for fuel , ammunition and other costs .
“ I personally believe there is exaggeration and inflation , ” said a senior American military official who has reviewed the program , referring to Pakistani requests for reimbursement .
“ Then , I point back to the United States and say we did n’t have to give them money this way . ”
Pakistani officials say they are incensed at what they see as American ingratitude for Pakistani counterterrorism efforts that have left about 1,000 Pakistani soldiers and police officers dead .
They deny that any overcharging has occurred .
Earlier this week I wrote about a particularly outrageous decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia which essentially held that terminally ill patients do not have the right to use drugs for purposes not approved by the Federal Drug Administration .
Today , the Cato Institute ’s Roger Pilon , writing in the Wall Street Journal , demonstrates just how tragically and unjustifiabily wrong the Court of Appeals was :
The wheels of justice turn slowly , especially for the dying .
On Tuesday the D.C. Circuit , sitting en banc , reversed a 15 - month - old decision by a panel of the court that had recognized a constitutional right of terminally ill patients to access potentially life - saving drugs not yet finally approved by the Food and Drug Administration .
Given the poor quality of Tuesday ’s opinion in Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v. Eschenbach — “ startling , ” said the dissent — one wonders why it took so long .
The opinion ’s one virtue is that it brings out clearly how far modern “ constitutional law ” has strayed from the Constitution , a document written to protect liberty , not federal regulatory schemes .
Represented by the Washington Legal Foundation , Abigail Alliance is named for Abigail Burroughs , a 21 - year - old college student who died of cancer in 2001 .
Their argument could not be more simple or straightforward , nor could Tuesday ’s dissent , written by Judge Judith Rogers and joined by Chief Judge Douglas Ginsburg , the majority in the earlier opinion .
Citing the Fifth Amendment ’s right to life , the Ninth Amendment ’s assurance to the Constitution ’s ratifiers that the rights retained by the people far exceed those named in the document , and the Supreme Court ’s “ fundamental rights ” jurisprudence , Judge Rogers argued that the right to life , the right to self - preservation , and the right against interference with those rights — which the FDA is guilty of — are of one piece .
They are deeply rooted in common law and the nation ’s history and traditions , implicit in the concept of ordered liberty , and thus “ fundamental . ”
Indeed , it is startling , she noted , that the rights “ to marry , to fornicate , to have children , to control the education and upbringing of children , to perform varied sexual acts in private , and to control one ’s own body have all been deemed fundamental , but the right to try to save one ’s life is left out in the cold despite its textual anchor in the right to life . ”
Because the rights at issue here are “ fundamental , ” she concluded , the court must apply , in judicial parlance , “ strict scrutiny . ”
The burden is on the FDA to show why its interference is justified — to show that its regulatory interests are compelling and its means narrowly tailored to serve those interests .
This would seem to be especially true in cases such as this , where we ’re dealing with people who , left only with the skills of contemporary medicine , are likely to die anyway .
In such a situation , what justification is there for telling someone who is about to die that they ca n’t try an experimental therapy just because it has n’t been approved by some bureaucrat in Washington ?
This is the frustration of many families who feel that they could have had so much more done to save loved ones .
Places like Hospice Cleveland can only do so much in making the final months of a patients life as comfortable as possible .
Washington needs to act in order to do more to help terminally ill patients .
As Pilon notes , though , this case is about much more than whether the rights of the terminally ill .
It has do to with just how screwed up Constitutional jurisprudence has become :
[ T ]he issues here go well beyond this case , which is doubtless why the court decided to rehear it en banc .
And they go beyond liberal and conservative as well , as the mixed seven who joined Judge Griffith ’s opinion should indicate .
What we have here , arguably , is a revolt of sorts by Judge Rogers and Chief Judge Ginsburg against what passes today for “ constitutional law . ”
Reducing that revolt to a simple question : Under a Constitution that expressly protects the right to life , how did we get to where government can effectively restrict the right , and the courts will do nothing ?
As Pilon notes , for liberals , the answer to that question is rather simple .
Rather than worrying about fundamental rights and the intent of the Framers , they worry about sociology and economics ; issues that ought to concern legislators rather than Justices
For conservatives , though , it involved a rejection of the Founders themselves :
[ I ] n Robert Bork ’s The Tempting of America , where conservatives often turn , we find an answer .
Describing what he calls the “ Madisonian dilemma , ” Judge Bork writes that America ’s “ first principle is self - government , which means that in wide areas of life majorities are entitled to rule , if they wish , simply because they are majorities .
The second principle is that there are nonetheless some things majorities must not do to minorities , some areas of life in which the individual must be free of majority rule . ” ( emphasis added )
That turns Madison on his head .
James Madison stood for limited government , not wide - ranging democracy .
His first principle was that in wide areas individuals are entitled to be free simply because they are born free .
His second principle was that in some areas majorities are entitled to rule because we have authorized them to .
That gets the order right : individual liberty first , self - government second , as a means for securing liberty .
Yet we repeatedly see conservative jurists , as here , ignoring the true Madison — deferring to the legislature when their duty , as Madison put it , is to stand as “ an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the legislative or executive . ”
A perfect example is Justice Antonin Scalia ’s dissent in a 2000 case , Troxel v. Granville , which found that Washington State ’s grandparent visitation act violated the right of fit parents to control access to their children .
Dissenting , Justice Scalia argued that although the parental right is among the unalienable rights proclaimed by the Declaration of Independence and the unenumerated rights retained pursuant to the Ninth Amendment , that amendment does not authorize “ judges to identify what [ those rights ] might be , and to enforce the judges ’ list against laws duly enacted by the people . ”
Thus , just as the Abigail Alliance majority did , he would defer to the legislature to tell us what those rights are — the very legislature that had extinguished the parental right that he had just located in the Ninth Amendment .
And that , in a nutshell , is what Robert Bork meant when he infamously referred to the Ninth Amendment as a “ ink blot . ”
And it ’s also why libertarians who think they can trust conservative judges are kidding themselves .
I could easily see something like this being the next big thing , instead of satellites ( or maybe in conjunction with satellites ) we would have this .
Built by Qinetiq ( a UK defense firm ) , the Zephyr is an unmanned aerial vehicle .
During a recent test it flew non -stop for 54 hours .
Meaning that it flew straight through the ( sunless duh ) night , twice .
This is rather cool .
It is efficient enough to charge up all the energy it needs during the day to not only power the plane , but store up enough energy for the flight all night long as well .
The 54 hour flight unofficially smashes the previous record of 30 hours held by a jet - powered air force Global Hawk surveillance aircraft .
The Qinetig team did n’t notify the record keepers so they will have to do this again if they want an official place in the record books .
The plane was originally developed in order to take pictures of another record breaking attempt , this time a giant helium balloon trying to go higher than any other manned flying device in 2003 .
The Zephyr can go pretty high itself .
With a wing span of 59 ft , it reached a height of more than 58,000 feet .
The plane is so light , that it is launched by hand , and this lightness allows it to be so efficient , but also means that the current model has problems with any kind of inclement weather .
As material science , and solar panel efficiency improve , we could easily see larger versions of this kind of aircraft .
Perhaps one day you could visit a large permanently flying solar hotel in the sky .
I am sure the military would love to use these to spy on whoever .
But I think a much cooler use of things like this would be for communications devices bringing internet to places that do n’t have it already .
I am sure you could come up with a lot of other fun uses for a plane that only has to land every could of days / weeks .
If you had enough of them you would never be without service .
City techie spent 50 days in jailKetan Tanna | TNNMumbai : Early on Aug 31 , Lakshmana Kailash K was asleep in his home in Bangalore .
He was woken up by eight policemen from Pune who came knocking on his door and waved the Information Technology Act , 2000 , in his face .
Get dressed , he was told , we are taking you to Pune for having defamed Shivaji .
Lakshmana protested he did n’t know anyone called Shivaji .
The policemen said they were talking about Chhatrapati Shivaji , and that an insulting picture of him had been uploaded on the networking site Orkut .
The cyber trail had led them to his computer in Bangalore .
Turning a deaf ear to his protests , the police took him to Pune and put him behind bars .
Finally , on October 20 , after spending 50 days with 200 undertrials at Yerawada Jail , Lakshmana was released .
Sorry , said the police , the IP address given to us was wrong .
In the jail , Lakshmana tried initially to be brave .
But he cracked when he was made to pose for a photograph with a black slate carrying his father ’s name and his alleged crime .
“ It hurt me a lot that my father , who is a retired banker in Tirunelveli , was being associated with a crime .
I just broke down , ’’ he says .
“ We were given a vaati ( bowl ) from which we had to eat and drink and even take to the toilet .
The long queues for filling water in the vati was our survival routine , ’’ says Lakshmana .
The three - in - one bowl system hit him hard : his health deteriorated rapidly .
“ Because of depression and the bad food , I lost 12 kilos , ’’ he says .
He ’s back home now trying to put it all behind him .
HCL has been supportive but Lakshmana is not sure whether his job still exists .
“ I have forgotten coding .
I need to start all over again , ’’ he says .
Times ViewThis is a shocking case .
The police ca n’t get away with an apology after wrongly putting Lakshmana Kailash in jail for 50 days on the basis of a “ mistake ’ ’ .
The cops may argue they acted in good faith and error was made by telecom firm .
But was n’t the mistake compounded because of poor policework ?
It is because of police sloppiness — or is it arrogance ? — that the youngster has suffered this nightmare .
The law does n’t allow for suing the police for such mistakes .
The law must be changed so that people like Lakshmana can get compensation for being wronged .
Cops :
We made a mistake , so what ?
Mumbai : Lakshmana Kailash K , the HCL employee who was wrongly imprisoned for 50 days on charges of posting hate literature on Chhatrapati Shivaji , is very philosophical about all that happened to him .
Asked if he planned to sue for compensation , he said , “ My family is considering it .
Right now , I ’m just beginning to appreciate the small things in life .
It ’s good to have a toilet to oneself .
It ’s good to have clean drinking water .
It ’s good to have family to quarrel with .
’’ Along the way , the 26 - year - old Lakshmana learnt that what he was being arrested for a case that had triggered riots in Pune in November 2006 .
Political parties had forcibly closed cafes and gone on the rampage over the posting of the illustration which had poked fun at Shivaji .
New to the ways of cyber crime , the police took over ten months to trace the alleged source .
Google , which owns Orkut , had cooperated with them but the vital IP address was provided by the service provider Bharti ( Airtel ) .
Bharti said the IP address belonged to a Lakshmana K who lived in a Bangalore apartment with friends .
His first bail plea was rejected .
To add insult to injury , the police released Laskshmana nearly three weeks after they claimed to have picked up the “ real culprits ’ ’ on October 3 — three Bangalore boys from Koramangala , all in judicial custody .
Asked about the earlier arrest , assistant commissioner Netaji Shinde says , “ Yes , we made a mistake .
So what ?
’’ Bharti was a little more contrite but made no mention of compensation .
“ We are in touch with the customer .
We have robust internal processes which we review frequently to make them more stringent , ’’ said Airtel in a written response to TOI .
Lakshmana ’s ordeal has uncanny resonances of Kafka ’s The Trial , more so because his name has the same initial ‘ K ’ as Kafka ’s hapless protagonist .
K is arrested one morning before breakfast on a non-charge and is left to battle the state ’s mindless might .
Lakshmana was charged under Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code for a deliberate and malicious act intended to outrage religious feelings , and Section 67 of the Information Technology Act for publishing ‘ lascivious ’ material or material that ‘ appeals to the prurient interest ’ .
The latter charge carries a punishment of five years ’ jail and gives the police the right to search cyber cafes and residences without a warrant .
Like Kafka ’s K , two days after he returned to Bangalore , Airtel got in touch .
But it was n’t about the arrest .
They sent him a text message reminding him to pay his bill .
The text message was followed up by a visit from a collection agent .
“ I told them it ’s all because of you that I have n’t paid , ’’ says Lakshmana .
“ We ca n’t pay bills from jail .
” TECHIE ’S ARRESTThe arrest of Bangalore ’s IT pro for an alleged hate crime is truly Kafkaesque : a trial which he knew not , a ‘ crime ’ he was n’t even aware of
次の関数は再帰的な関数だ。
( define fact ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 ( * n ( fact ( - n 1 ) ) ) ) ) )
この関数は内部で自分自身を呼び出しているので、普通の方法では無名関数として定義できない。
こういう場合、不動点オペレータというものを使うと以下のようにしてfactを定義することができる。（fact関数の中で直接factという名前を使っていない所がポイント）
( define fact ( let (( Y ( lambda ( F ) ( ( lambda ( s ) ( F ( lambda ( x ) ( ( s s ) x ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( s ) ( F ( lambda ( x ) ( ( s s ) x ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( Y ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 ( * n ( f ( - n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
ここで天下り的に出てきたYをなんとか導出してみたいと思って数日間考えていたのだが、ようやく方法が分かった。ほとんどは最後に挙げた参考URLに書いてあることの焼き直し。
まず、こういう関数を考えてみる。
( define fact - maker ( lambda ( s ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 ( * n ( ( s s ) ( - n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
すると以下のような変形ができるので、
( fact - maker fact - maker ) ( ( lambda ( s ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 ( * n ( ( s s ) ( - n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) fact - maker ) ( let ( ( s fact - maker ) ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 ( * n ( ( s s ) ( - n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 ( * n ( ( fact - maker fact - maker ) ( - n 1 ) ) ) ) )
( fact - maker fact - maker ) はfactに等しい 。
次に、fact-makerを変形していく。
( define fact - maker ( lambda ( s ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 ( * n ( ( s s ) ( - n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define fact - maker ( lambda ( s ) ( let ( ( f ( lambda ( x ) ( ( s s ) x ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 ( * n ( f ( - n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define fact - maker ( lambda ( s ) ( ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 ( * n ( f ( - n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( x ) ( ( s s ) x ) ) ) ) ) ( define fact - maker ( lambda ( s ) ( F ( lambda ( x ) ( ( s s ) x ) ) ) ) ) ( define F ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 ( * n ( f ( - n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
これを使うと 、( fact - maker fact - maker ) は以下のような式に展開される 。
(( lambda ( s ) ( F ( lambda ( x ) ( ( s s ) x ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( s ) ( F ( lambda ( x ) ( ( s s ) x ) ) ) ) )
ここか らFを抽象してYが得られる。
( define Y ( lambda ( F ) ( ( lambda ( s ) ( F ( lambda ( x ) ( ( s s ) x ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( s ) ( F ( lambda ( x ) ( ( s s ) x ) ) ) ) ) ) )
以上のことをまとめると、
( Y F ) == ( fact - maker fact - maker ) == fact
となる。
Inflation adjuster
How much would : $
in : be worth today ?
Today 's dollars : $
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Wholesale prices saw their biggest jump in 34 years in November , according to a government inflation reading Thursday that came in much higher than forecast due to a record spike in energy prices .
The Producer Price Index rose 3.2 percent , up from only a 0.1 percent rise in October .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a 1.5 percent increase .
It was the biggest jump in that price measure since August 1973 .
The key driver in November -- a record 14.1 percent rise in energy prices .
The previous record one - month jump in energy prices was in January 1990 , on the eve of the first Gulf War .
Gasoline prices were up 15.1 percent in November , but that is a very volatile number .
Gas prices were up 17.4 percent in February and down 14.8 percent in August , for example .
Food prices , which had been another source of inflationary pressures recently , were unchanged in the latest month .
But the even more closely watched core PPI , which strips out volatile food and energy prices , also rose much more than expected , jumping 0.4 percent after being unchanged in October .
Economists had forecast only a 0.2 percent rise in that reading .
Still the 12 - month change in the core PPI actually came down to a 2.0 percent rise , from a 2.5 percent rise in the October reading .
The Federal Reserve is generally believed to want to see core inflation readings in the range of 1 to 2 percent .
The Fed uses interest rates in an effort to keep prices stable , and the threat of inflation is one of the factors that stopped the central bank from cutting rates more than the quarter percentage point cut announced Tuesday afternoon .
Stocks plunged on that action as investors who had been hoping for a half - point cut were disappointed .
And the hotter than expected PPI number led to further declines on Wall Street Thursday .
" The core is worse than expected , but on a year over year basis , its in the comfort zone , even if it's at the top of the comfort zone , " said Wachovia economist Sam Bullard .
He said he believes that the PPI is likely to show a decline in the December reading due to a retreat in gasoline prices so far this month .
The inflation reading comes the day before the government 's key inflation reading on the retail level , the Consumer Price Index , or CPI .
That report , which is less volatile than the PPI , is forecast to show a 0.6 percent in the overall CPI , and a 0.2 percent rise in core CPI .
I will be on WDAY radio in Fargo at 8:35 AM Wednesday morning .

This being an early interview , I will probably sound like a thick - tongued stumbledork .

His expression says it all : put this on the Internet so people can judge your purchases !
Weak cow leakings !
Soy milk !
The beer that sponsored that sex - in - public contest !
Hahahaha !
How I hate Jinglepixie .
I am planning my revenge .
I am not , repeat NOT in the writing mood today .
The fortnight of slackening seems to be asserting itself .
Thankfully , I had the day off from work , sort of ; there was work to be done , but not the usual post - and - do - a - video schedule .
( I had to take my “ floating holiday ” or lose it .
I will also be taking time off Christmas week , for which I feel a horrid sense of guilt in advance . )
( It will pass . )
( G ) Nat finally wanted to watch Star Wars , and it was on the HD channel , so I sat down to watch the last half .
The show gets dumber every time I watch it , but I love it no less .
Still , the details do tend to nag after 21953 viewings ; I still think they might have reassessed the tactics for the Death Star assault .
All right , men , here ’s the port you have to hit .
A small bomb has to go down this pipe .
We will assemble about three miles from the port , run down a heavily defended trench that gives us no room to maneuver and no way to defend ourselves from the obvious rear assault , then fire the bomb perpendicularly .
Any questions ?
You there , Boggs .
That ’s Biggs , sir .
Why not just fly directly in the direction of the port and shoot straight into it ?
I do n’t understand your question .
Well , it ’s space .
We can approach from any angle .
Why do we have to fly down a trench for a minute when we could just fire into the hole from above then pull away ?
I wo n’t dignify that with an answer .
You there , eating the fried chicken .
Porkins , sir .
How much time do we have ?
The Death Star will be in position in 30 minutes .
What takes them so long ?
They got here via hyperspace , crossing vast distances in the blink of an eye , but they materialized on the other side of Yavin so it would take them 30 minutes to get into position ?
Stay on subject .
It just seems like they could have blown us up the first minute – Stay on subject .
Okay .
If I die , how will I die ?
If struck from the rear , you will grimace and lean forward in your seat as though you had a sudden pang of gas .
Good luck , and may the force be with you .
( G ) Nat enjoyed it very much , partly because she was watching Star Wars with Dad .
For my part , it was hard not to tear up , because I was watching Star Wars with my Child .
She had many questions and observations .
About Han Solo : “ I ’m not sure I like him .
He ’s sorta bad but sorta good . ”
Bingo .
About Luke : “ I like him . ” About Dark Vader : “ He ’s evil , right ? ” Right .
About my ability to recite all the dialogue as it happened : “ Dad , be quiet ” About the Death of Porkins : “ He ’s dead , right ? ” About the voice of Obi-Wan telling Luke to use the Force :
She thought it was the ghost of the fat guy who just blew up .
She thought it was the voice of Porkins .
That really would change the entire story , would n't it .
About the Princess “ with the buns on her head ” – she asked if she as the only girl in Star Wars , and I said no , of course not .
But in the first movie , she is .
Aside from a few extras and Aunt Baru , it ’s a man ’s game .
About the death of Obi-Wan : “ where did he go ? ” Darth Vader had the same question , kid .
About Luke ’s decision to shout out BEN !
Upon seeing his mentor killed , thereby alerting the otherwise diverted storm - troopers : “ well that was stupid . ”
She liked Chewbacca and R2D2 .
I pointed out how Chewie did n’t get a medal at the end , and she said it was totally unfair .
She also noted Leia ’s rather suggestive leaning - and - lips - parting bestowal of the medal , and said “ Mushy . ”
Someday we ’ll watch some more .
Together .
I do n’t want her to find about Jar - Jar on the street , or hear about him from her peers .
I want to be there to guide her .
Today was the Fun Run at ( G ) Nat ’s school .
That ’s why there ’s no buzz .
mn video on Wednesday .
I am ashamed to note that I initially said I could n’t make the Fun Run , because I did n’t know how I ’d get in everything that ’s required .
My wife assisted me to find the proper priorities .
( Hence the day off . )
The Fun Run is simple enough : you run around the gym for 30 minutes .
Straight .
I hated nothing more in school than gym , and nothing more in gym than running – except perhaps gymnastics , which even sounded like painful gym .
I do not run now and I do not like to run .
I can walk forever , but running seems rather needless unless a giant Martian tripod has just burst through the pavement and is using a death ray to level your neighborhood .
Even then I would prefer to saunter , because they ’re going to go after the guys who are running away , just to prove a point .
Anyway : we ran for 30 minutes .
Well , we moved in a forward motion for 30 minutes .
I ran as much as I could , as did she ; two quick 30 second breaks on a mat were required , but then we were back to it .
Great fun .
What made the event perfect was her absolute delight that I was there .
Even when I jogged backwards and made her shout out cadence .
I DON ’T KNOW BUT I’VE BEEN TOLD / SCHOOL IS COVERING UP HIDDEN MOLD and so on .
The music selections were enthusiastic , but I had to laugh when they played “ YMCA . ”
Once of these days kids will figure out the rest of the story , as Paul Harvey says .

Guilt has an incredible way of popping up even when we ’re barely doing anything at all .
Most of us learn guilt throughout normal childhood development .
Guilt clues us in when we ’ve stepped outside the boundaries of our core values .
It makes us take responsibility when we ’ve done something wrong and helps us to develop a greater sense of self - awareness .
The feeling of guilt forces us to examine how our behavior affects others and make changes so that we do n’t make the same mistake again .
How can we learn to deal with guilt — accepting it when it is appropriate and letting it go when it ’s unnecessary ?
1 . Is this guilt appropriate and , if so , what is its purpose ?
Guilt works best to help us grow and mature when our behavior has been offensive or hurtful to others or ourselves .
If we feel guilty for saying something offensive to another person , or for focusing on our careers with an 80 - hour work - week over our family , that ’s a warning sign with a purpose : change your behavior or you will push away your friends or family .
We can still choose to ignore our guilt then , but then we do so at our own risk .
This is known as “ healthy ” or “ appropriate ” guilt because it serves a purpose in trying to help redirect our moral or behavioral compass .
The problem arises when we do n’t need to reexamine our behavior or makes changes .
For example , a lot of first - time mothers feel badly about going back to work part - time , fearful it may cause unknown damage to their child ’s normal development .
However , that ’s simply not the case in most situations and most children have a normal , healthy development even when both parents work .
There ’s nothing to feel guilty about , yet we still do .
This is known as “ unhealthy ” or “ inappropriate ” guilt because it serves no rational purpose .
If you ’re feeling guilty for eating five chocolate bars in a row , that ’s your brain ’s way of trying to get the message to you about a behavior you probably already recognize is a little extreme .
Such behavior may be self - destructive and ultimately harmful to your health and well - being .
So the rational purpose of this guilt is simply to try and convince you to change this behavior .
2. Makes changes , instead of wallowing in guilt .
If your guilt is for a specific and rational purpose — e.g. , it ’s healthy guilt — take action to fix the problem behavior .
While many of us are gluttons for self - punishment , ongoing guilt weighs us down as we try and move forward in life .
It ’s easy enough to apologize to someone whom we ’ve offended by a careless remark .
It ’s a little more challenging to not only recognize how your 80 - hour - a - week career may be harming your family , but to also change your work schedule ( assuming that there were legitimate reasons for working 80 - hours a week in the first place ) .
Healthy guilt is telling us we need to do something different in order to repair relationships important to us ( or our own self - esteem ) .
Unhealthy guilt ’s purpose , on the other hand , is only to make us feel badly .
While sometimes we already know the lesson guilt is trying to teach us , it will return time and time again until we ’ve actually learned the lesson fully .
It can be frustrating , but it seems to be the way guilt works for most people .
The sooner we “ learn the lesson ” — e.g. , make amends , work to not engage in the same hurtful behavior in the future , etc. — the sooner the guilt will disappear .
If successful , it will never return for that issue again .
3 . Accept that you did something wrong , but then move on .
If you did something wrong or hurtful , you will have to accept that you cannot change the past .
But you can make amends for your behavior , if and when it ’s appropriate .
Do so , apologize , or make - up for the inappropriate behavior in a timely manner , but then let it go .
The more we focus on believing we need to do something more , the more it will continue to bother us and interfere with our relationships with others .
Guilt is usually very situational .
That means we get into a situation , we do something inappropriate or hurtful , and then we feel badly for a time .
Either the behavior was n’t so bad or time passes , and we feel less guilty .
If we recognize the problem behavior and take action sooner rather than later , we ’ll feel better about things ( and so will the other person ) and the guilt will be alleviated .
Obsessing about it , however , and not taking any type of compensatory behavior ( such as apologizing , or changing one ’s negative behavior ) keeps the bad feelings going .
Accept and acknowledge the inappropriate behavior , make your amends , and then move on .
4. Learn from mistakes .
Guilt ’s purpose is n’t to make us feel bad just for the sake of it .
Legitimate guilt is trying to get our attention so that we can learn something from the experience .
If we learn from our behavior , we ’ll be less likely to do it again in the future .
If I ’ve accidentally said something insulting to another person , my guilt is telling me I should ( a ) apologize to the person and ( b ) think a little more before I open my mouth .
If your guilt is n’t trying to correct an actual mistake you made in your behavior , it ’s unhealthy guilt and there ’s not a whole lot you need to learn .
Instead of learning how to change that behavior , a person can instead try to understand why a simple behavior most people would n’t feel guilty about is causing them to feel guilt .
For instance , I felt guilty for spending some time playing a game during regular work hours .
But , since I work for myself , I do n’t really keep “ regular work hours . ”
It ’s just hard for me to change that mindset after years of working for others .
5. Recognize that no one is perfect .
Not even our friends or family members who appear to lead perfect , guilt - free lives .
Striving for perfection in any part of our lives is a recipe for failure , since it can never be attained .
We all make mistakes and many of us go down a path in our lives that can make us feel guilty later on , when we finally realize our mistake .
The key , however , is to realize the mistake and accept that you ’re only human .
Do n’t engage in days , weeks or months of self - blame — battering your self - esteem because you should ’ve known , should ’ve acted differently , or should ’ve been an ideal person .
You ’re not , and neither am I .
That ’s just life .
Guilt is one of those emotions that we feel is telling us something important .
Be aware that not every emotion , and certainly not every guilty feeling , is a rational one that has a purpose .
Focus on the guilt that causes loved ones or friends harm .
And remember to be skeptical the next time you feel guilty – is it trying to teach you something rational and helpful about your behavior , or is it just an emotional , irrational response to a situation ?
The answer to that question will be your first step to helping you better cope with guilt in the future .

5 Tips for Dealing with Guilt
Click to viewHere 's a video of the iPhone Firmware 1.1.3 , with confirmation that the leak is real from Natetrue , famed iPhone hacker .
Like before , the update breaks unlocks and third - party apps , patching previous vulnerabilities at the same time .
The video shows how to move icons around in the Springboard , wobbling to indicate they can be dragged and dropped around , which is kind of an Apple - meets - Nintendo touch :

We had some doubts , but now we can tell you we are sure : the new firmware 1.1.3 is real .
Or as Nate puts it : " if it is a hoax , they did a buttload of work . "
The fact is that it installs normally and it works perfectly .
For those not familiar , Natetrue is one of the most respected and veteran iPhone hackers and the author of the popular app iBrickr .
Advertisement
Nate goes on to say that " it installs on the phone no-questions - asked and for that you need to have Apple 's private key , which i can confirm that the iphone hacker community does not have — as much as we would love to have it . "
Indeed , Apple 's private encrypted key , used to authenticate all accesses to the iPhone most - private guts , has n't been uncovered yet by anyone in the world .
In other words , no firmware upgrades can be installed without the knowledge of this key .
Furthermore , the idea that someone would have access to this key and spend months to create a fully functional firmware update , with key new features and without any documentation whatsoever seems just absolutely silly .
Effects on unlocks and Third - party applications
The update breaks AnySim 's unlocks .
Logically , you can't unlock this update using AnySim and there 's no alternative to iTunes for activation .
If you want to activate , it will only work using iTunes and a standard AT&T account .
Nate says , " that is the only way we have been able to activate so far . "
Nate tried to upgrade an AnySim 1.2u iPhone and it failed .
Even while he was able to force it to boot , the phone refused to activate even with a normal AT&T SIM card .
" I suspect it 's due to the fact that the baseband could not be upgraded to the 1.1.3 ' required ' version " , he says .

Other updates remain untested , like iPhone Sim Free or any of the hardware - based ones , like TurboSIM .
In theory , these should work just fine , but jailbreak and activation would be absolutely impossible for the time being .
We would have to wait until the update gets released in the open to try new alternative activation methods .

Your favorite third - party apps will be gone too , with no possibility of return for now .
The update fixes the bugs which allowed " the jailbreak method we were using for 1.1.2 , locking us out again , as expected . "

Other effects
Like previous firmware upgrades , whatever is in the user partition remains unchanged .
Only the Apple - owned part is affected by 1.1.3 .
So for those of you who claim that this is a fake because it says " Nate " in the network instead of " AT&T , " that 's the reason .
He changed the network name in 1.1.2 using a program by Erica Sadun , of TUAW , called Make It Mine .

New features and future releases
The list of new features are confirmed too : all are correct , but he could n't confirm if they are the only ones or not .
Many of you would be wondering how this could have happened , knowing the extremely tight security around the iPhone firmware updates .
We do n't know , but apparently the leak has occurred because " someone wanted to help the unlock effort . "
The source of the leak is completely anonymous , even to the people who have had access to the upgrade .

Why the update has n't hit Torrent yet ?
The code could be watermarked to catch any leaks " so for now it 's screenshots and videos . "
Also , distributing it wo n't make much sense at this point : according to Nate the iPhone 1.1.3

The XO laptop is being field tested in Nigeria
Criticism of plans to get technology into the developing world is misplaced , says Bill Thompson .
One of the best things about being on the World Service radio programme Digital Planet each week is that I get to hear about interesting technologies from many different countries and explore the impact that computers and the internet are having in people 's daily lives .
We often follow stories as they develop , coming back to them from time to time to see if early promises have been kept or bold predictions have been borne out .
It 's been nearly three years since Nicholas Negroponte came onto the show to talk about his plan for a low - cost laptop for the developing world .
He wanted to build it for under $ 100 and sell millions to governments who would then give them away to schoolchildren .
Later he set up the One Laptop Per Child project to do this , and we 've come back to the $ 100 laptop many times , and in December 2005 we saw the prototype launched at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunisia .
' Radical rethinking '
We have watched as the prototype turned into the XO - 1 , a radical rethinking of what a laptop should be , with a brand - new user interface , a low - power chip from AMD , the Linux operating system and a low - energy high contrast screen .
And earlier this year we heard schoolchildren in Nigeria tell BBC reporter Jonathan Fildes how excited they were to have their own computers , what they planned to use them for and how good they were .
Perhaps Dvorak 's just afraid that a Nigerian schoolchild , empowered by the technology entrusted to them , will take him to task for his patronising attitude , or perhaps even turn out to be a better journalist .

Politics ' stifling $ 100 laptop ' Audio slideshow : Laptops in Nigeria
Not every promise was fulfilled , of course .
The computers cost around $ 180 to make , and instead of millions there are only a few hundred thousand being built in the first year , largely because governments have gone back on the promises they made to buy them in large numbers .
Even the Nigerian government has yet to decide whether to commit funds to the project , and is watching the trial at Abuja 's Galadima primary school with interest .
To make things worse Intel and Microsoft seem to have done everything they could to undermine the project , offering cut - price hardware and discount operating systems in an attempt to keep this remarkable machine , with its Linux operating system and AMD processor , at bay .
Now US journalist John Dvorak has weighed into the debate , dismissing the laptop as a ' little green computer ' that changes nothing , and arguing that sending food aid to Africa is a better way to solve the continent 's problems .
Dvorak is so wrong that it pains me .
He misrepresents both the laptop 's capabilities and the plans for how it will be used .
' Demeans people '
He ignores the educational uses and its sophisticated mesh network and acts as if the sole purpose is to get online , asking what benefit the " spam - ridden Information Super Ad - way laced with Nigerian scams , hoaxes , porn , blogs , wikis , spam , urban folklore , misinformation " has to offer .
And he demeans the people who will receive the computers , asking his readers if they will feel " better about the world 's problems , knowing that some poor tribesman 's child has a laptop " , apparently contrasting a " tribesman " with a real person like himself , safe in his Western affluence .
Dvorak is a controversial , opinionated and immensely influential technology writer , based in the US but read around the world thanks to the same internet that he dismisses as unsuitable for those living in poverty .
His comments matter because he may influence those with the power to change people 's lives , especially in governments considering investing in the XO - 1 , yet he chooses to use his platform to criticise a self - penned parody of the computer and its planned uses .
There are sensible criticisms to be made of OLPC and its work , but Dvorak simply misrepresents their position when he dismisses the whole project as arguing : " let 's give these kids these little green computers .
That will do it !
That will solve the poverty problem and everything else , for that matter . "
At WSIS in 2005 I talked to OLPC 's chief technology officer , Mary Lou Jepsen .
She led innovations in the screen design , energy consumption and user interface that have resulted in a computer to transform the relationship of the world 's poorest children to the networked economy .
' Hold back '
She also understands the need for the laptop to fit into the larger development agenda .
The point is not that computers or internet access are as important as clean water , good healthcare , effective education and safe housing .
It is that access to computers and the network can make it simpler and easier to deliver those other things , just as access to electric light can vastly improve the quality of people 's lives .
No one starting a business in the rich world would do so without relying on computers and the internet , so why should we hold back those in the poorer countries ?
Dvorak seems to have fallen for the Intel and Microsoft line that something they are n't involved with could not possibly be all that good .
The XO - 1 is powerful , effective and designed to be used by those with little experience of new technology , and even those who are less than fully literate .
Yes , there will be problems .
The computers need to be properly integrated into the educational curriculum ; power supplies and stable network connections have to be provided ; some will be stolen , some will break , some will not get to the people who need them .
But that is not a reason to stop .
A century ago campaigners for a working wage were adamant that just having enough to live on was not enough , that there should be space for culture and enjoyment in life , and in 1912 strikers at a textile factory in Lawrence , Massachusetts are said to have rallied around the slogan " We want bread , but we want roses , too ! " .
Well , we need to give the poor of today 's world rice , and housing , and water , and healthcare , but they need the laptops and all that they symbolise too .
Those who argue otherwise , like John Dvorak , would condemn the poor countries to another century of want and dependency by depriving them of access to the technology that has already transformed life for the rich and privileged .
Perhaps he 's just afraid that a Nigerian schoolchild , empowered by the technology entrusted to them , will take him to task for his patronising attitude , or perhaps even turn out to be a better journalist .
It would n't be hard .
DIGG THIS
Dr. Paul Hein makes some excellent observations with regard to the outrageousness of the city of Atlanta attempting to impose a ban on saggy pants .
But , I believe that the problem goes even beyond the attempt by a government to become fashion police .
It is in fact the government that is responsible for the saggy fashion in the first place .
I came across this discovery on a recent trip to New York City .
I have a good friend that owns a pawn - shop there .
I visited him at his shop .
It is on the edge of what would certainly be deemed a tough neighborhood .
Although my friend has the place stocked with hidden guns and baseball bats , I would still wince every time someone came in that I would deem a character .
What was interesting about these characters , is that they all had shirts hanging out of their pants and they all had saggy , baggy pants .
It was impossible to tell , by their wearing that kind of clothing , whether they had a gun or any other type of weapon on them .
Then it dawned on me .
This is Ayn Rand ’s form fitting function .
This is about street drug dealer types adopting a fashion style that makes it very difficult for police to observe if they are carrying drugs or weapons .
If drug dealers wore tighter clothing , the silhouette of a gun could much more easily be identified by passing police .
With saggy , baggy pants and shirts hanging out , it is impossible .
This is also why you see so many coats with hoods , in drug - infested areas .
It ’s another case of form fitting function .
Big Brother puts up cameras , so the drug dealers put up their hoods when they are doing a deal .
Of course , there are others who follow the lead of gun-carrying drug dealers and wear this fashion , even though they are n’t dealing drugs or carrying drugs , but in the neighborhoods they live in , they sure better look like they are carrying .
Otherwise , who is going to protect them , when they come across a true gangster , the police ?
Not likely .
When in Rome , do as the Romans do .
In the hood , do as the government - created gangsters do .
I personally find the saggy , baggy pants and hooded sweat shirt style about as ridiculous and ugly a fashion statement as you can have , but the dealers are doing what they have to under oppressive government laws .
Fortunately , there is a solution to this problem : legalize gun carrying and drugs .
Upon the legalization of gun carrying and drugs , I predict the saggy , baggy pants - wearing fashion will be gone in six months , maybe less .
Now aside from having the pleasure of walking down a city street without the eyesore of this government - caused fashion style , we will once again have the freedoms associated with the right to carry guns and the right of drug dealers to provide a demanded public service .
Note :
It is not my intention to go beyond the saggy , baggy pants problem here , but if anyone has a problem with drug dealers , I recommend they read Walter Block ’s brilliant book , Defending the Undefendable , which not only defends drug dealers but male chauvinist pigs and a multitude of others scorned by society .
Block ’s book received high praise from F.A. Hayek , Murray Rothbard , Henry Hazlitt , Dr. Thomas S. Szasz and Robert Nozick .

The Best of Robert Wallach
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Private U.S. security contractor Blackwater USA denied on Saturday it was involved in illegally shipping automatic weapons and military goods to Iraq .
The statement by the company , whose contractors were accused by the Iraqi government of killing 11 people in Baghdad this week , came after a newspaper report that federal officials were investigating whether Blackwater exported unlicensed military hardware into Iraq .
“ Allegations that Blackwater was in any way associated or complicit in unlawful arms activities are baseless .
The company has no knowledge of any employee improperly exporting weapons , ” the company said in a statement .
“ This issue is completely unrelated ” to Blackwater ’s U.S. government programs in Iraq , said the company , based in Moyock , North Carolina .
It employs about 1,000 contractors to protect the U.S. mission in Iraq and its diplomats from attack .
The News & Observer of Raleigh , North Carolina , reported that two former Blackwater employees had pleaded guilty in Greenville , North Carolina , to weapons charges and were cooperating with the federal investigation .
Court records showed Kenneth Wayne Cashwell and William Ellsworth Grumiaux pleaded guilty earlier in the year to possessing , receiving and concealing between May 2003 and August 2005 stolen firearms that had been “ shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce . ”
The records , which showed both men agreed to cooperate with authorities and testify about any crimes they knew of in plea deals filed last November , did not name Blackwater or Iraq .
The newspaper also quoted two unidentified sources as saying federal officials were probing whether Blackwater was shipping weapons , night - vision scopes , armor , gun kits and other military goods to Iraq without the required permits .
A U.S. Justice Department spokesman declined comment on the investigation .
SMUGGLING ALLEGATIONS
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki has suggested the U.S. Embassy stop using Blackwater after what Iraq called a flagrant assault by the firm ’s contractors in which 11 people were killed last Sunday while the firm was escorting an embassy convoy through Baghdad .
The Washington Post reported in Saturday ’s edition the Iraqi government ’s investigation into the shootings had expanded to include allegations about Blackwater ’s involvement in six other violent incidents this year that left at least 10 Iraqis dead .
Asked at a news conference at the United Nations on Saturday about whether Iraqi investigators had videotape of Blackwater security men firing unprovoked on Iraqi civilians , Maliki said , “ We ’ve asked the Americans to deal with the investigation through an investigation committee to see whether there is a video about this ( Baghdad ) incident . ”
The issue of suspected weapons smuggling by a U.S. contractor in Iraq surfaced earlier in the week in a letter from a congressional committee chairman , Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California , to Howard Krongard , the State Department ’s inspector general .
“ You impeded efforts by your investigators to cooperate with a Justice Department probe into allegations that a large private security contractor was smuggling weapons into Iraq , ” Waxman told Krongard in a letter dated September 18 .
Waxman ’s letter did not name Blackwater .
Waxman has asked the head of Blackwater USA , Erik Prince , to testify before his committee on October 2 on its work in Iraq .
The State Department said on Friday it would thoroughly examine the use of private security contractors to protect American diplomats in Iraq .
In its statement , Blackwater said that when it was uncovered internally that two employees were stealing from the company , it immediately fired them and invited the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives to conduct a thorough investigation .
“ The employees , who were former Marines and law enforcement , have been convicted and are currently negotiating sentencing in Raleigh with federal prosecutors , ” the company said .
Fractals derived from Newton - Raphson iteration
Introduction
This page describes a type of fractal derived from the Newton - Raphson method , which is more normally used as an approximate method of solving equations .
This is not a new idea to me ; I was given the idea by a colleague at work , and several other people have web pages about it too .
I 'm putting up yet another one because it contains some additions to the concept which I have n't seen anywhere else .
Explanation
Newton - Raphson iteration should be familiar to anyone who has studied calculus ; it 's a method for finding roots of a function by using the derivative of the function to improve an approximation to the root .
To perform a Newton - Raphson approximation , suppose you have a function $ f ( x ) $ , with derivative $ f '( x ) $ , and you have an approximation $ a$ to a root of the function .
The Newton - Raphson procedure is to calculate $ a' =a - f ( a ) / f'( a ) $ , which is a closer approximation to the root .
Typically you would then iterate this again , and again , until the successive values were extremely close together , at which point you would conclude that you had a very good approximation to the actual value $ r$ for which $ f( r ) =0 $ .
The Newton - Raphson method is useful in practice because of its extremely fast convergence .
The distance from the root to each approximation is roughly squared at each iteration ; so assuming the distance is already small enough that this makes it smaller rather than larger , you expect to double the number of correct decimal digits in each approximation .
So if you can find a reasonably good approximation to begin with , Newton - Raphson can very quickly give you an excellent one .
What the Newton - Raphson formula is essentially doing is drawing a tangent to the curve at the point of the original approximation , then following that tangent to where it crosses the x-axis .
Since any differentiable function looks close to a straight line when viewed at sufficient magnification , this explains why it works so well : the curve itself does not diverge from the tangent line by very much , and the points where they cross the x-axis are very close to each other .
Hence , this technique massively improves an already good approximation .
However , if you start with a really bad approximation , much more interesting things happen .
Suppose the function curves up from one intersection with the x-axis and back down to another , like a parabola ; and suppose your initial approximation is somewhere near the top of this arc .
Now drawing a tangent to the curve and following it to the x -axis will land you a huge distance away from the roots of the function – and as your initial approximation $ a$ crosses the maximum point of the curve , the Newton - Raphson second approximation $ a '$ will flip from one side of the roots to the other .
In fact , as $ a$ moves the relatively short distance across the maximum of the curve , $ a '$ will cover most of the real line .
This sort of behaviour , expanding a small area into a large one , is exactly the sort of behaviour we expect to give rise to self - similar fractals .
So if we were to start a Newton - Raphson iteration at each point on the real line , run each iteration until it converged to within a given tolerance level of a root , and then colour the starting point according to which root it ended up at , we might well expect to see fractal shapes .
Fractals on one line are not very interesting , however ; so let 's work in the complex plane .
The Newton - Raphson iteration still works perfectly well there , so that 's where I 'll be generating my fractals .
Illustration
Here 's an example fractal , generated from the polynomial $ z ^ 4 - 1 $ , so that the four roots of the function are at $ - 1 $ , $ +1 $ , $ - i$ and $ +i$ .
In this image , we see a large boring area surrounding each root of the function – as we would expect , since any point near a root will converge rapidly to that root and do nothing interesting .
But between the areas of boring well - behaved convergence , we see some beautiful fractal shapes .
Let 's zoom in on one of those boundary areas :
Just as we predicted – each of the heart - shaped blobs making up the boundary line is itself composed of boundary lines made up of further heart - shaped blobs .
This pattern is a true fractal .
Here 's a rather different example .
This time the function being used is $ ( z - 3 ) ( z - 2 ) ( z - 1 ) z( z+1 ) ( z+2 ) ( z+3 ) $ , so it has seven roots strung out in a long line :
In this case , the fractal shapes are much smaller compared to the overall structure of the image .
But they 're not completely absent .
If we zoom in on a couple of the little blobs on the boundary lines , we see this :
Each blob is divided up into coloured areas similar to those covering the whole plane , and on each dividing line we see more blobs looking much the same as the larger blobs .
Decoration
These images are reasonably pretty , but they 're a bit garish to be turned into desktop wallpaper in their current form .
Is there anything we can do to make them less stark ?
Yes , there is .
One obvious thing we can do , as well as noticing which root of the function the iteration ended up at , is to count how many iterations it took to get there .
We can then colour each pixel a different shade of the colour assigned to that root depending on the number of iterations .
So , using the obvious approach of setting the pixel shade to the number of iterations modulo the number of available shades ( so that each colour cycles through those shades ) , we see something like this :
This is not only prettier , but it also shows us exactly where each root of the function is – instead of just knowing the roots are somewhere in the large coloured areas , we can now positively identify each root as the centre of the bright spot in each area .
The cyclic behaviour is not quite optimal , though ; it works well enough if the number of available colours is limited , but it means there are sudden edges ( like the ones at the very centre of each region ) where a dark colour suddenly becomes a bright colour again .
Perhaps if we have true colour available , it would be better to have the pixel shading be monotonic – always getting darker the more iterations are needed , but fading out by less and less and never actually reaching blackness :
Now that 's starting to look much nicer , I think .
But it would be even better if the visible boundaries between different shades of the same colour could be removed .
I suspect that doing this rigorously requires some really horrible maths and a lot of special cases , but I 've found that a good ad - hoc approximation is obtained simply by looking at the last iteration , in which the point first comes within the specified distance of a root .
We look at the distance $ D_0 $ from the previous point to the root and the distance $ D_1 $ from the new point to the root , and we know that the threshold distance $ T$ is somewhere in between the two .
I 've found that simply looking at $ $ \frac{\log T - \log D_0}{\log D_1 - \log D_0 } $ $ or , in other words , whether the log of the threshold radius was near to the start or the end of the inward distance travelled by the point ( on a logarithmic scale ) , produces a perfectly acceptable result which we can use to smooth out those boundaries :
Animation
In order to write a program to generate these images , it 's necessary to know both the function being used ( typically a polynomial ) and the exact locations of all its roots .
Finding the exact roots of a general polynomial is not easy ( cubics and quartics are just about solvable , but quintics and beyond fall foul of Galois theory ) , so it makes much more sense to start by deciding where we want the roots to be , and using that to compute the polynomial by multiplying together a series of $ ( x - a ) $ terms .
This does not restrict the range of polynomials we can end up with , since in the complex plane any polynomial can be fully factorised .
So the actual parameters you would pass to the fractal program consist of the coordinates of a set of points , together with a colour for each point .
This led to an interesting idea : suppose we imagine a small number of coloured points drifting gently around the plane , and at each instant of time we compute a Newton - Raphson fractal for the current positions of the points .
This should lead to a sequence of fractals which flow naturally on from each other , and as the bright central point in each coloured region moves , the regions move with them and the fractal phenomena on the region boundaries swirl continuously .
Here is such an animation .
To create this , I 've set up three points , each moving along the Lissajous curve $ ( \sin t , \sin 2t ) $ , and each one third of the way further around the curve than the last .
[ download cascade.mpeg , 320x256 MPEG animation , 633KB ]
The image quality is n't amazing ( due to the MPEG compression ) , but one feature that 's just about visible is the lines of additional bright spots moving within each coloured region , which appear to become the blobs on the connecting line when the other two regions come together to squash the line of spots .
Evolution
Looking at the above rainbow - coloured plot with seven roots in a line , I found myself thinking that it's not very pretty , because the fractal blobs are so small .
Why are they so small ?
Could anything be done to make them bigger ?
I speculated that perhaps the reason the blobs are so small ( implying that Newton - Raphson converges particularly well for this function ) might be because polynomials of a high degree are generally very steep , and curve over very sharply at the top of peaks , so there is n't a large region of the plane in which the fractal self - similarity can be observed .
This suggested than an obvious way to soften the process might be to reduce the overall degree of the function : to make it more like $ x ^4 $ than $ x ^7 $ .
How to do that while preserving the locations of the roots ?
Why , take the square root , of course !
Thinking about this a bit further , that does sound like a good idea .
In the real numbers , the square root transformation squashes things towards the x-axis , and it squashes them more the further away they are ; so I would indeed expect it to turn a very sharp switchback into a more gentle curve .
Moreover , it 's trivially easy to do in the Newton - Raphson iteration .
Suppose we have a function $ f$ , and we define a function $ g$ to be $ f^k$ for some ( constant ) power $ k$ .
Then $ g ' = k f^{k - 1} f'$ ; so when we compute $ g / g ' $ , the $ f^{k - 1} $ term cancels out , and we are left with simply $ ( 1 / k ) ( f/ f' ) $ .
In other words , the sole effect of raising the entire function to the power $ k$ is to multiply a constant factor of $ 1/ k $ into the distance moved per iteration .
So this had to be worth a try .
Here are the results from taking the rainbow plot above , and raising the entire function to a variety of overall powers :
As I had hoped , the small fractal blobs have expanded into larger fractal blobs , which is good ; and they 've become more complex and spiky in shape as well , because the smaller fractal blobs on them have also expanded .
What I was n't expecting , however , was that the dividing lines between the main convergence regions have entirely changed shape , becoming more wiggly .
It turns out that actually taking the square root of the function ( raising it to the power 0.5 ) is not feasible , since the algorithm converges more and more slowly the closer to 0.5 you get .
This is because raising the function to the power 0.5 causes us to double the distance moved per iteration ; so once we 're near to a root , $ f / f ' $ gives you an accurate estimate of the distance to the root , and we go twice as far , causing us to end up just as far away from the root on the far side , so no wonder the iteration fails to converge .
0.52 was the smallest value I could use without having to increase my iteration limit .
This tendency to overshoot the root we 're aiming at when using $ k < 1 $ also offers an alternative intuitive explanation for the fractal shapes becoming bigger .
The fractal shapes arise because near to a boundary between convergence regions there is a tendency for a single iteration step to travel a long distance into remote regions of the complex plane ; so if we 're moving even further in a single iteration , then we would indeed expect not to have to be so close to the boundary before experiencing this phenomenon .
Raising the value of $ k$ to something greater than 1 has the opposite effect : we now converge toward our root in smaller steps , more slowly but more surely , and so we 're less likely to overshoot and the fractal effects on the boundary lines become less pronounced .
I 'm not going to exhibit any pictures of that , because they 're boring .
However , I 'll come back to this later .
As well as raising the entire polynomial to a power , it 's also interesting to see what happens if we try raising only one of the $ ( z - a ) $ factors to a power .
To do this we must first think about whether this can be efficiently implemented in software .
It can , it turns out .
Observe that if you have a function made up of the product of a lot of smaller factors $f = abcd $ , then the product rule gives its derivative as the sum of a list of terms $ $f ' = a'bcd + ab'cd + abc'd + abcd '$ $ in which each term looks very similar to $ f$ itself .
In fact we can divide both sides by $ f$ to give us $ $ \frac{f '}{f} = \ frac{a ' }{a} + \ frac{b '}{b} + \ frac{c ' }{c} + \ frac{d ' }{d} $ $ which is precisely the thing whose reciprocal we subtract from $ z$ in the N - R formula .
Now when each factor $ a$ is of the form $ ( z - k ) $ , then the resulting term $ a ' / a$ looks like $ 1 / ( z - k ) $ ; and as we observed in the previous section , if the factor is raised to a power so that it's of the form $ ( z - k ) ^e $ then the resulting term $ a ' / a $ is only altered by a constant , so it becomes $ e / ( z - k ) $ .
So if we have a function which is the product of a number of terms of the form $ ( z - a_1 ) ^{b_1} $ , then we can efficiently perform its Newton - Raphson iteration without ever computing the entire function itself .
We simply compute $ b_1 / ( z- a_1 ) $ for each term , sum them , take the reciprocal , and subtract that from $z$ .
A useful point about this procedure is that it means we can conveniently raise each factor of our " polynomial " ( which is n't very polynomial any more , really ) to not only an arbitrary real power , but to a complex power if we so wish .
And it turns out that we do so wish , because some very impressive fractals turn up if we do .
Here 's a map of 121 small fractal images , all generated from functions with the same three roots , namely the complex roots of 1 .
But the red root ( 1 itself ) has been raised to a different power in each picture : across the map the real part of the power runs from 0 to 1 , and downwards the imaginary part runs from 0 to 1 .
As mentioned above , raising a root to a power of 0.5 or less inhibits convergence of the iteration to that root at all .
But in the presence of other roots to which we can still converge , the region of non-convergence – shown in black on the above map - forms complex and interesting fractal shapes .
Meanwhile , applying an imaginary part to the power of the red root causes a twisting effect : the higher the power , the more the shape is less straight and more spirally ; and it appears that it 's the real part of the power which must be greater than 0.5 to manage to converge .
Some of the images in that map are well worth expanding to a larger size to admire in more detail .
Here are four particularly good ones :
Imitation
If you look again at the images in the above section , you may notice that some of the shapes – particularly the ones that occur when things are raised to real powers near 0.5 – are beginning to look interestingly like the shape of the Mandelbrot set .
This suggested to me that there might be some sort of close relationship between these fractals and Mandelbrot / Julia sets .
So an obvious question to ask along these lines is , is there a function to which we could apply the Newton - Raphson formula $ z \mapsto z - \ frac{f ( z ) }{f ' ( z ) } $ and end up with the Julia set iteration $ z \mapsto z ^2+ c $ ?
Well , if you write down the equation $ z - \ frac{f ( z ) }{f ' ( z ) } = z ^2+c$ , or equivalently $ z - \ frac{f}{df / dz} = z ^ 2+ c$ , then it looks a lot like a differential equation .
If only we were working in the positive reals instead of the complex numbers , we could solve it quite easily by separating variables into $ df / f = - dz / ( z ^ 2 - z+c ) $ , factorising the denominator of the RHS and turning it into partial fractions , and integrating to get $f = ( z - a ) ^ { 1 / ( b - a ) }( z - b ) ^ { 1 /( a - b ) }$ , where $ a$ and $ b$ are the roots of the quadratic $ z ^ 2 - z+ c $ .
( Unless $ c=\frac14 $ , which is a special case arising from $ z ^ 2 - z+ c $ being a perfect square and looks rather different ; but I 'll ignore that , because it 's not a very interesting Julia set anyway . )
And it turns out that even in the complex numbers this answer works plausibly .
The function $ ( z - a ) ^ { 1 / ( b - a ) }( z - b ) ^ { 1 /( a - b ) } $ is of precisely the form discussed in the previous section : it 's the product of linear terms raised to arbitrary powers .
Hence we can conveniently do the Newton - Raphson iteration for this function by the method described above : compute $ \frac1 { ( b - a ) ( z - a ) } + \ frac1 { ( a - b ) ( z - b ) } $ and subtract its reciprocal from $ z$ .
If you do that , remembering that by construction $ a+b=1 $ and $ ab=c$ , you will indeed find that a lot of algebraic mess cancels out and you end up with the iteration $ z \mapsto z ^2+c $ .
So there is a family of functions to which the application of the Newton - Raphson formula yields a Julia set iteration , and moreover those functions are n't very far away from the ones we 've already been considering here .
To prove it works , here are a couple of plots of Julia sets , with their corresponding Newton - Raphson plot :
Julia set for $ 0.28+0.528i $ Julia set for $ - 0.656+0.272i$ Newton - Raphson fractal for
$ (z -( 0.9994-0.5286i ) ) ^{-0.4722-0.4998i} \times $ $ ( z-( 0.0006+0.5286i ) ) ^{ 0.4722+0.4998i}$ Newton - Raphson fractal for
$ (z -( 1.4623-0.1413i ) ) ^{-0.5086-0.0747i} \times $ $ (z-( -0.4623+0.1413i ) ) ^{ 0.5086+0.0747i}$
You will have noticed , of course , that the colouring is very different .
The two types of fractal are using matching iteration formulae , but a Julia set plotter concentrates on how long it takes the iteration value to land outside a critical circle , whereas the Newton - Raphson plotter is actually waiting for the iterates to converge to a point , and is only incidentally observing what happens when they do n't .
So you would n't actually want to throw away your dedicated Julia - set plotting programs ; but it 's interesting , nonetheless , that something very like Julia sets are a special case of Newton - Raphson fractals .
Dissection
Another noticeable thing about some of the above fractals is that some have much more fractal content than others .
The original fractal at the top of this page with roots at $ - 1 $ , $ +1 $ , $ - i$ , $ +i$ has four big regions of flat colour meeting at the origin , and the self - similar nature of the fractal causes that quadruple contact point to be replicated in other parts of the plane .
This gives rise to qualitatively more interesting fractal phenomena than the plot with seven roots in a line , in which all the large convergence regions are separated by boring curves which never meet , and the fractal blobs reflect this structure .
So I wondered , is there a way that we can predict how the convergence regions are going to be shaped , and thereby construct polynomials which have triple or quadruple meeting points exactly where we want them ?
Yes , as it turns out , there is .
I observed above that raising a polynomial to a real power greater than 1 has the effect of causing the iteration to take smaller steps towards the root , which in turn causes convergence to be slower but surer and reduces the incidence of overshoot leading to fractal phenomena .
As a result of this , the boundary lines between regions become clearer and smoother and simpler .
This seemed like a good thing if we wanted to know the overall structure of the fractal ; but merely clearer is n't good enough .
I wanted clearest .
So I wondered what would happen " in the limit " , as the iteration speed slowed down more and more .
In other words , I was interested in what I 'm going to describe as continuous Newton - Raphson , in which you start your " iteration " at an arbitrary point $ z_0 $ on the plane and then let $ z$ evolve continuously according to the differential equation $ \frac{dz}{dt} = - \ frac{f ( z ) }{f ' ( z ) } $ .
As in the previous section , we can " solve " this equation by separating variables and naïvely integrating , trying hard to ignore the question of whether this is rigorous or even meaningful in the complex numbers .
This time we end up with $ \frac1f \frac{df} {dz}dz = - dt$ , and then we can apply the integration - by - substitution formula to the LHS to give us $ \frac{df}{f} = - dt $ , which integrates to give us $ f ( z ) =
Ae ^{ - t} $ for some constant $ A$ .
We can check by differentiating with respect to $ t $ that this does indeed turn out to be a plausible answer to the equation even in the complex numbers : the chain rule tells us $ \frac{d}{dt} f( z ) = f'( z ) \ frac{dz}{dt} $ , so we end up with $ f ' ( z ) \ frac{dz}{dt} =
- Ae^{ - t} = - f ( z ) $ as required .
And the constant $ A$ is clearly equal to $ f( z_0 ) $ , the value of $ f $ at the point where we started our integration .
" Very nice " , I hear you protest , " but what does that mean ? "
Well , since $ t$ is a positive real , it means that whatever path $ z$ follows from our starting point $ z_0 $ must have the property that at all times $ f ( z ) $ is equal to $k f( z_0 ) $ , where $k = Ae^{ - t} $ is a real value which continuously and monotonically decreases from 1 toward 0 .
So we normally expect the limit of such an " iteration " to be a point at which $ f ( z ) $ is actually equal to zero , i.e. a root of $ f $ .
But that 's not the only thing that can happen .
It 's also possible to imagine that we might encounter a point along this path at which there is n't a clear direction we should head in : either there is no direction in which we can head from $ z$ which will cause $ f( z ) $ to continue decreasing as a real multiple of its initial value , or perhaps there is more than one such direction .
How do we find such points ?
Well , for most points in the complex plane the differential equation we started with will usually give us a unique direction in which we can head to linearly decrease $ f ( z ) $ : we compute $ f ( z ) / f'( z ) $ , and head in the direction pointed to by that complex number .
This fails if $ f( z ) =0 $ , in which case there is no clear direction to head in ; we expect that , of course , because if $ f( z ) =0 $ then we 've already reached a root .
But it can also fail if $ f '( z ) =0 $ .
So this suggests that the roots of the derivative of $ f$ might be worth investigating .
So consider some root $ r$ of $ f '$ , at which $ f$ itself is non-zero .
If we can find any continuous paths in the complex plane which start at $r$ and have $ f$ increasing as a real multiple of $ f ( r ) $ , then any point on one of those paths will be a point at which starting a continuous Newton - Raphson process will cause it to head backwards along the same path and terminate at $ r$ rather than at a root .
In other words , we expect those paths to be precisely the boundaries between the convergence regions for the various roots ( since that 's the obvious set of points which we expect not to converge sensibly to a root ) ; and moreover , on every such boundary we expect to find a root of $ f '$ ( because a continuous Newton - Raphson process started on any boundary has to end up somewhere ) .
That 's a lot of maths to endure without a break for a pretty picture , and it's also a long and rather handwavey chain of reasoning to endure without some sort of reassurance that what I 'm saying still makes sense .
So , here I present a sample polynomial Newton - Raphson fractal , with the roots of the polynomial 's derivative marked as black blobs .
Observe that each dividing line between convergence regions has a blob somewhere on it , and that in particular the point where three regions ( and three such lines ) meet has a blob .
So now we know , at least in theory , how to find the lines dividing the different convergence regions .
Now , what distinguishes a simple dividing line , separating only two regions , from a point at which three or more regions meet ?
Let 's consider our root $ r$ of $ f '$ again .
We 're now interested in how many directions we can head away from $r$ in , such that $ f$ increases as a real multiple of $ f ( r ) $ .
Equivalently , we 're interested in directions we can head in such that $ f ( z ) = ( 1+k ) f( r ) $ for some real positive $ k$ ; in other words , we want small values $ \epsilon $ such that $ f( r+\epsilon ) / f( r ) - 1 $ is real and positive .
So now let 's consider the Taylor series expansion for the function $ f( r+\epsilon ) / f(r ) - 1 $ .
We have $ $ f ( r+\epsilon ) = f( r ) + \epsilon f'( r ) + \epsilon ^2 \ frac{f ''( r ) }{2!} + \epsilon ^3 \ frac{f ''' ( r ) }{3!} + \ cdots $ $ and we know that $ f ' ( r ) = 0 $ by construction , so this gives us $ $ \ frac{f ( r+ \epsilon ) } {f ( r ) } - 1 = \epsilon ^2 \ frac{f '' ( r ) } { 2 ! f( r ) } + \epsilon ^3 \ frac{f ''' ( r ) }{ 3 ! f( r ) } + \ cdots $ $
In the usual case , $ f ' ' ( r ) $ will be non -zero , so for small values of $ \epsilon$ , $ f( r+\epsilon ) / f( r ) - 1 $ will be approximately equal to $ K\epsilon ^ 2 $ for some ( complex ) constant $ K$ .
This means that we expect to have two directions in which we can head in order to make $ f( r+\epsilon ) / f( r ) - 1 $ real and positive : one direction corresponding to each square root of $ 1 / K $ .
This fits with what we expect , because in the usual case a root of $ f '$ gives rise to a region boundary extending away from it in two opposite directions .
But if $ f '' ( r ) $ is zero as well , then the $ \epsilon ^3 $ term will now be the dominating one in the Taylor expansion ; so for small values of $ \epsilon$ , $ f( r+\epsilon ) / f( r ) - 1 $ will be approximately equal to $ K\epsilon ^3 $ for some $ K$ .
And now we expect to have three region boundaries coming out of our root $ r$ , one for each cube root of $ 1 / K $ .
If the third derivative of $ f$ is zero at $r$ too , then we can have four region boundaries , and so on .
And there it is : that 's the result I 've been working towards for this entire section .
A multiple - region meeting point occurs when a root $r$ of $ f '$ is also a root of $ f ' '$ , and the more higher derivatives are zero at $r$ the more regions meet there .
For polynomials in particular , this translates into $r$ being a repeated root of $ f '$ , and the more repeated the merrier .
To demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that this actually works , I will now construct from first principles a Newton - Raphson fractal containing two points at each of which five regions meet .
For a five - way meeting point we need $ f '$ to have a four - times - repeated root ; so let 's set $ f ' ( z ) = ( z - 1 ) ^4( z+1 ) ^4 $ , which has two repeated roots as desired .
We " integrate " this in the naïve way ( actually what we 're doing is finding an anti-derivative of it , integration in the complex plane being a generally messy concept ) to obtain the nasty - looking polynomial $ ( 35z^9 - 180z^7 + 378z^5 - 420z^3 + 315z ) /315 $ .
We can discard the constant factor of $ 1/315 $ since it makes no difference to the convergence , and this gives us $ 35z^9 - 180z^7 + 378z^5 - 420z^3 + 315z$ .
We find the roots of this ( using Newton - Raphson for its more conventional purpose ) and feed them into our fractal plotter , and get this picture :
And , exactly as we asked for , this has two five - way meeting points at locations $ +1 $ and $ - 1 $ .
Bingo !
Of course , integration lets us add an arbitrary constant term without affecting the derivative of our result .
Here 's what we get if we add a constant term of $ 50+200i $ to the above polynomial :
The roots of the polynomial have moved around , and the picture is distorted , but the region meeting points are still exactly where we asked for them .
Oscillation
Here 's another curiosity .
The following fractal is plotted using a pure polynomial $ f$ , placing the roots at $ +i$ , $ - i$ , $ - 2.3 $ and $ +2.3 $ :
The interesting feature of this picture is the black areas , which are regions in which Newton - Raphson failed to converge to a root within the program 's limit of 256 iterations .
At first sight one might assume that this is an artifact of having a finite iteration limit at all , but one would ( it turns out ) be wrong .
Even if you crank up the iteration limit to a much larger number , those black areas stay black , because they represent genuine non-convergence .
What 's actually happening here is that for this particular polynomial the Newton - Raphson method gives rise to period - 2 cyclic behaviour .
There 's a pair of points $ a$ and $ b$ , one in the middle of each of the two main black areas , which have the property that a single iteration of Newton - Raphson starting from $ a$ takes you to $ b$ , and vice versa .
But this is more than just a cycle between those two points : it 's an attracting cycle .
If you start from a point somewhere near $ a$ , an iteration of Newton - Raphson will take you to somewhere even nearer to $ b$ , from which another iteration will land you nearer still to $ a$ again .
Hence , there 's a sizeable region around each point of the cycle which all converges to the cycle itself , and hence never settles down to a root of the polynomial .
This is interesting to me because it happens so rarely ; I 've plotted quite a lot of these fractals , including a lot of animated ones in which the points wander continuously around the plane , and this particular arrangement of roots is the only case I 've found in which a polynomial gives rise to a non-converging area .
( It 's not the only actual polynomial : you can obviously rotate or translate the root positions to obtain other polynomials with the same behaviour , and you can also move the roots around by a small amount relative to each other before the black areas go away .
But this general pattern – four roots in a diamond layout of roughly this shape – is the only pattern I know of that does this . )
On one level , it 's reasonably easy to see " why " it happens .
If you define $ g ( x ) = x - f( x ) / f'( x ) $ to be the Newton - Raphson iteration for this polynomial , then find roots of the equation $ g ( g( x ) ) =x $ ( probably using a computer algebra package , since it's a pretty ugly mess ) you will observe that it has roots which are not also roots of the similar first - order equation $ g ( x ) =x $ ( and hence of $ f $ ) .
That proves that there are cycles at all ; then , to prove there are attracting cycles , compute the derivative of $ G ( x ) =g ( g( x ) ) $ at those roots and find the ones where it has modulus less than 1 ( since for small $ h$ , $ G ( r+h ) $ will be approximately $ G ( r ) + G' ( r ) h $ , and if $ G ( r ) = r$ and $ | G ' ( r ) | < 1 $ then this will be closer to $ r$ than we started out ) .
But that does n't really explain the phenomenon , or predict what other sorts of polynomial will give rise to cyclic behaviour of this type .
Do there exist polynomials which exhibit period - $n$ cycles for all $ n > 1 $ , for example ?
How often does this happen ?
How would one go about constructing polynomials with non-converging regions to order ?
I do n't currently know the answers to these questions , but I 'd be interested to hear them if anyone else does .

By default the program will use the cyclic shading behaviour with 16 shades of each colour .
You can specify - C no to turn off cyclic shading ( so the colours get uniformly darker as more iterations are needed ) , - B yes to turn on blurring of the iteration boundaries , and -f 32 or -f 64 if you want to increase the number of shades used .

To raise the function to an overall power , use the -p option , for example -p 0.52 .
This will slow down convergence , so you will probably also need to increase the number of shades of colour ( the - f option , as discussed above ) in order to make the result look nice .

Newton - Raphson fractals are not a new idea of mine , although most other pages I 've seen do n't go so far into the maths .
Here are a few such pages ; you can probably find more by googling for " Newton - Raphson fractal " .
Like any other close relative at the family table , chimpanzees may throw vengeful fits , but they also lend a helping hand .
A recent spate of experiments out of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , has revealed that chimpanzees exhibit some of the same traits — altruism and vengeance — displayed in human society .
Spiteful motivations and sophisticated social learning skills , however , appear uniquely human .
The new studies give insight into how and when such traits evolved .
Most importantly they help answer the age - old question :
What makes us lucky bipeds human ?
" The most important way to ask these really hard questions — is human altruism unique , is human spite unique , is human fairness unique — is to ask non-human animals , " says Laurie Santos , director of the Comparative Cognition Laboratory at Yale University .
This behavioral process of elimination defines humans as it progresses .
Since chimpanzees can't speak our language , researchers design experimental scenarios to detect the presence or absence of such traits .
Recently , Felix Warneken , a developmental and comparative psychologist at Max Planck , and his colleagues conducted a series of tests to see whether chimpanzees were helpful — or , as they put it , " spontaneously altruistic . "
To do this they compared the behavior of children with that of chimpanzees , one of the two closest relatives to humans ( the other being bonobos ) .
If chimpanzees engaged in helpful behavior , it would suggest that the trait went as far back as a common ancestor to chimpanzees and humans , some five to seven million years ago .
" If any animal or human passes this task , we have to assume that this organism possesses certain skills , " Warneken says .
" We 're not just trying to attribute something to them . "
In the first test , an adult human stretched for a baton that was out of its grasp but within the reach of the chimpanzee , or an 18 - month - old infant .
If the test subject passed the baton to the adult , the researchers considered it an act of " spontaneous altruism . "
In the end , chimpanzees and human infants were equally helpful , the researchers report in the July PLoS Biology .
When the scientists made it a bit harder for the subjects to help , by erecting some obstacles , the results remained the same .
In the final experiment , chimpanzees were given the opportunity to help out one another — and sure enough , they obliged .
More often than not , the chimpanzees opened a door that allowed a fellow chimp access to some food .
The results represented a breakthrough , as previous lab experiments had found the opposite .
" It looks like , in certain situations , chimps are very helpful and as helpful as young children , " says Brian Hare , a Max Planck psychologist involved in the study .
" So probably whatever makes us human in terms of our helping and cooperative behavior … it did n't spring out of nowhere during human evolution . "
On the opposite end of the behavioral spectrum , Keith Jensen , also at Max Planck , recently found that chimps are likely to exact revenge as well .
Given the chance , chimpanzees retaliated against thieves by collapsing the bandit 's table , thereby ruining the stolen meal , Jensen reports in the Aug. 7 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The idea is vengeance acting as a deterrent .
In other words , you steal from me , I punish you enough to make you think twice before taking my banana the next time .
This type of vengeance , even if it takes the ugly form of punishment , is healthy in that it discourages freeloaders .
So even if vengeance is considered bad , it can often serve the greater good .
Spite , however , does n't appear to have any such obvious perks , which might explain why chimpanzees did n't exhibit it in Jensen 's experiments .
When an adult person took food away from one chimpanzee and gave it to another , the first chimpanzee did n't collapse the second chimpanzee 's table , the researchers found .
" I 'm not very surprised that we do n't see a lot of spiteful behavior in the chimps , " says Joan Silk , an anthropologist at the University of California , Los Angeles who was not affiliated with the study .
" In some sense it 's a little bit irrational , because you hurt yourself to hurt someone else more . "
Still if the chimpanzees do n't display spite , then why do humans ?
Spite , which Jensen describes as " altruism 's evil twin , " might help motivate behaviors related to a sense of fairness , he says .
" In the absence of punishment , at least in studies that have been done on human adults , cooperation falls apart , because it only takes a few selfish individuals … to ruin everything for everybody , " Jensen says .
" But if you give people the opportunity to punish free riders , they stop cheating . "
What makes human and orangutan brains different ?
Researchers at the National Zoo hope to find out by playing customized computer games with the savvy primates
Other differences between human and chimpanzee behavior have been teased apart by testing infants , chimpanzees and orangutans in identical conditions .
Esther Herrmann of Max Planck recently found that apes and two - and - a - half - year - old children performed similarly on tasks that tested their understanding of the physical world , such as space and quantities .
For example , chimpanzees were better than infants at detecting added quantities of food or toys , a rudimentary math skill .
Their spatial relationships were similarly developed ; both extracted food and toys from difficult places .
However , the similarities in their cognitive skills broke down when it came to Herrmann 's social learning tests , she reports in the Sept. 7 issue of Science .
Herrmann says these social cognition skills , which people display more often than chimpanzees , are the same skills that give us the leg up to perpetuate our culture and society .
" Human children have much more sophisticated skills dealing with the social world like dealing with imitating another 's solution to a problem , communicating non-verbally and reading the intentions [ of ] others , " Herrmann says .
" These skills enable them to participate in the cultural world , and by doing so children become members of this cultural world . "
Still , such studies cannot replicate one major linchpin of our evolutionary story , even if they can guess at it .
For traits to evolve , they must be inheritable , and for them to persist , they must bestow reproductive success or increased survival to the individual .
This is why finding altruism displayed by chimps is a bit puzzling .
After all , how could sacrificing your own life for that of an unrelated individual ( the most extreme form of altruism ) be a trait that would survive through the ages ?
In Santos ' opinion , figuring out whether the chimpanzee or human is getting any reproductive benefit from its actions is the harder question .
" It really involves measuring and comparing reproductive fitness , " she says .
" That 's going to be one of the harder questions from an evolutionary point of view , about why these animals might have these abilities and why they might not . "

KENNEDY SPACE CENTER , Fla. Nov. 7 — The shuttle Discovery glided to a safe landing here Wednesday , bringing to a close an eventful mission that combined challenging space station construction and emergency repairs .
Commander Pamela A. Melroy fired the shuttle ’s braking rockets just before noon , Eastern time , beginning the return from orbit .
The shuttle flew over North America from the northwest to the southeast and landed on the 15,000 - foot landing strip shortly after 1 p.m .
The shuttle , which glides to its landing without power , could be seen passing high above the landing site as a speedy white dot .
Its distinctive double sonic ba-BOOM could be heard moments after it passed overhead , bringing applause from the spectators at the runway .
Commander Melroy then brought the craft around for its final approach , heading into a stiff headwind and touching down .
The mission started out as a pivotal moment in station construction , tightly packed with goals that included bringing up a new room — the Harmony module — and relocating an enormous solar array and truss from its temporary position atop the station to its permanent location on the left side .
Moving the 35,000 - pound array required two spacewalks and a nimble handoff between the robotic arms of the shuttle and station .
DARDENNE PRAIRIE , Mo.  Waterford Crystal Drive is one of those suburban streets that seem so new as to have no history at all .
But the suicide of a teenage girl — and allegations she had been tormented by a neighbor over the Internet — have brought a reaction that is old , almost tribal , in its nature .
Residents of the middle - class subdivision have turned against the neighbor , Lori Drew , and her family , demanding the Drews move out .
In interviews , they have warned that someone might be tempted to " take matters into their own hands . "
" It 's like they used to do in the 1700s and 1800s .
If you wronged a community , you were basically shunned .
That 's basically what happened to her , " said Trever Buckles , 40 , who lives next door to the Drews .
Drew became an outcast after she participated in a hoax in which a fictional teenager who went by the name of Josh Evans exchanged online messages with 13 - year - old Megan Meier .
Megan received cruel messages from " Josh " that apparently drove her to hang herself in her closet in 2006 .
Through her lawyer , Drew — a mother of two in her 40s — has denied saying hurtful things to the girl over the Internet , and prosecutors have said they found no grounds for charges against the woman .
Nevertheless , the community reaction has been vengeful and the pressure on the Drews intense .
More than 100 residents gathered in front of their home on a recent evening , holding candles and reciting stories about Megan .
Last December , after neighbors learned of the Internet hoax , someone threw a brick through a window in the Drew home .
A few weeks ago , someone made a prank call to police reporting that there had been a shooting inside the Drews ' house , prompting squad cars to arrive with sirens flashing .
Someone recently obtained the password to change the Drews ' outgoing cellphone recording , and replaced it with a disturbing message .
Police would not detail the content .
Clients have fled from Drew 's home - based advertising business , so she had to close it .
Neighbors have not seen Drew outside her home in weeks .
Death threats and ugly insults have been hurled at Drew over the Internet , where she has been portrayed as a monster who should go to prison , lose custody of her children , or worse .
Her name and address have been posted online , and a website with satellite images of the home said the Drews should " rot in hell . "
Some of the threats " really freak me out , " Buckles said while standing on his front porch after dark Tuesday .
As he spoke , a car slowed and stopped in front of Drew 's home .
It sat there idling for a few minutes , then sped away .
Buckles said it is a common occurrence .
" I just really hope that no one comes out here and does something insane , " Buckles said .
" If they do , I hope they get the right house . "
Sheriff's Lt. David Tiefenbrunn said patrols have been stepped up around Drew 's house .
" There could be individuals out there with a vigilante - type attitude that might want to take revenge , " he said .
The Drews — Lori , husband Curt and two children — live in a one - story ranch - style house .
An older man at the house , who described himself only as a relative , said Lori Drew would not comment .
He would not say whether the family planned to move .
Ron and Tina Meier 's home is four houses away from the Drews .
The sidewalk is curved , so the neighbors can't see each other from their front doors .
The breach between the once - friendly families seems beyond repair .
" I think that what they have done is so despicable , that I think it absolutely disgusts people , " Tina Meier said .
" I can't take one ounce of energy worrying about who does not like Lori Drew or who hates Lori Drew .
I could not care less . "
Just a year ago , Waterford Crystal Drive was the kind of quiet suburban street where joggers waved hello while kids played in the yard .
Lately the road has been choked with news trucks , and neighbors hustle inside to avoid questions .
The Drews used to fit in just fine , said neighbor John McIntyre , who described Lori Drew as an intensely social woman .
McIntyre fondly remembered Megan , too .
She came across the street to babysit McIntyre 's 4 - year - old daughter , Genna , and arrived with a clipboard and notes , determined to do the job right .
" She was a good kid , " he said .
Megan became friends with the Drews ' young daughter , according to a report provided by prosecutors .
The girls had a falling - out in 2006 .
A teenage employee of Drew 's named Ashley said she created the " Josh " account on MySpace after a brainstorming session with Drew and her daughter , according to a prosecutor 's report .
Drew said the girls approached her with the idea , and she told them only to send polite messages to Megan .
Ashley sent Megan many of the messages from " Josh , " and Lori Drew was aware of them , prosecutors said .
On Oct. 16 , 2006 , there was a heated online exchange between Megan and Ashley , posing as Josh .
A few other MySpace users joined in , calling Megan names .
It ended when " Josh " said the world would be better off without Megan .
Tina Meier said Megan went to her room , crying .
About 20 minutes later , she was found hanging from a belt around her neck .
Drew 's attorney Jim Briscoe told NBC that Drew " absolutely , 100 % " had nothing to do with the negative comments posted about Megan and was n't aware of them until after the girl took her life .

I share your belief that Vice President Cheney must answer for his deceptive actions in office , particularly with regard to the preparations for the Iraq war and the revelation of the identity of covert agent Valerie Plame Wilson as part of political retribution against her husband .
Again the same old regurgitation of the Rovian spin .
When will folks realize the true target of Cheney 's treason was the intentional destruction of Brewster - Jennings Plames covert front company to pave the way for the Iran lies .
The wilson smear story originated from the WH .
The Bush / Cheny cabal needed Plame gone so they could lie at will ( now ) when the time came .
wexler Cheney is guilty of Treason not just High Crimes and Misdemeanors .
Perhaps now we can cut through the spin of the Wilson Smear and get to the heart of the matter TREASON .
Intentional destruction of a vital intelligence asset .
Wexler needs to wake up and get with the program and do his homework .

All I ask is that our elected officials do their job to uphold our Constitution , and that includes impeachment when it is called for .
It is definitely called for in the case of Dick Cheney ( and George Bush ) !
We must take our country back from these proven liars and thieves who are most certainly guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors .

There is nothing I would like better than number 1 : Cheney impeached and number 2 : Bush , too .
They empower corporations at the expense of humankind , the environment , our treasury and national security .
Their actions are criminal .
However I am not confident this will amount to anything with Reid and Pelosi doing their best to block it .
Pelosi and Reid do n't realize how angry Americans are about handing Bush a blank cheque to continue reeking havoc on the world .
Polls show over 70 % of Americans are very unhappy and want a drastic change .
Mainly Pelosi and Reid are not willing to go forward on impeachment so the elections will be a referendum on Bush , but in the long run that strategy may backfire .
Playing politics instead of doing the right thing does not go unnoticed .
Do note impeachment is a remedy , not a political ploy ( or should n't be despite the politically - driven impeachment hearings against President Clinton for an erroneous and inconsequential act that was none of the nation 's business IMHO ) .
In contrast charges brought against Bush & Cheney are grave and serious .
Their unprecedented abuse of power goes far beyond that of previous presidents .
They 've acted well - outside and well - beyond the rule of law .
When it becomes necessary to remove a president and / or a vice - president , the Founders understood the value of " impeachment , " which is mentioned 6 times in the Constitution .
Neither have upheld the Constitution ; that is impeachable .
" ... George Mason , a primary author of the Constitution , said that impeachment was the single most important part of the entire document .
" Shall any man be above Justice ?
Above all shall that man be above it who can commit the most extensive injustice ? "
Legislators in Washington abdicated their responsibility .
They have forgotten they represent the people and their sworn duty is to protect the Constitution .
Instead they protect , allow and even encourage Bush & Cheney whose actions clearly demonstrate they believe they are invincible , free to act above the law .
Well unless something is done , even if the next president does n't , you can rest assured future presidents will do likewise .
An assault on our Constitution is an assault on all of us .
Nancy Pelosi made a big mistake when she took impeachment off the table .
She basically suspended the Constitution while giving Bush and Cheney the heads - up to literally do anything they want without restraint or accountability .
Notwithstanding if impeachment is allowed to go forward democrats will have solid support .
Cheney must go first because he is the mastermind behind most of the villainous policies .
With Cheney gone Bush is basically toast ... ineffective , isolated and impotent .
Whereas Cheney has his loyal accolades planted in every department at every level which gives him leverage and clout and Bush 's ear .
Ultimately as long as Cheney is gone I do not care if Bush is impeached even though by all measures he should be .
However Cheney 's impeachment is imperative for the nation 's sanity and security .
Best case scenario : they are both impeached !

Kucinich 's motion for impeachment is actually the second one .
I read that an earlier one was filed and sat ignored in the same committee .
I also read that his ability to make these motions is unlimited -- meaning he can do it again and again and force the Congress to deal with them if only to kill them or , as in this case , " table " them .
Conyers sits on the committee which reviews this stuff and the question now is whether he will actually act ( as Wexler supports ) or continue to pay homage to Pelosi and hope Dennis goes away .
I think Kucinich has nerve and I would like to see him submit one of these motions a week -- just grind down the opposition by inviting their criticism and , when they turn to him for comment , blast away .

My basic legal and constitutional strategy that I proposed on Constitution Day was to have 87 members vote for the question of impeachment so it could at least end up on the Congressional Record .
" Each house shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy ; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall , at the Desire of one fifth of those Present , be entered on the Journal . "
Dennis succeeded brilliantly in this regard .
There are now at least 86 votes on the Houses historical record in calling for impeachment .
Why am I not surprised that my socalled representative David Dreier was not on this record given he is from Nixon 's old congressional district .
Your rule and BLUFF is over David .
You had no excuse given the history of your district .
Let the record show that you were not there to protect neither my Liberty nor Republic .
You could have been the 87th vote to cinch it but you chose otherwise .
Well done Congressman Kucinich !

Thank God , a Dem with a spine , so it appears ?
Do n't mean to be pessimistic but I do intend to expect the same behavior from the same people , who have shown us nothing and constantly Told Us About Change before a hundred times over and over again .
Their words have been very cheap for a long time now .
I will believe it when I see results , for 8 months I have not seen any from the Party that stands for nothing .
WOW I had just sent out letters and phone calls ( yesterday when they handed the Golden Free Impeachment Ball back to the Republicans on the Republicans 1 yard line with 4 downs to go and then I get to read about Gonzales ’s [ spelling not important for criminals names , sorry ] replacement , and those upstanding Dems Schumer and Feinstein ) to the Dems letting them know I am now voting Republican because no difference=no difference .
Lets hope this is a real deal and not more smoke and mirrors and career advancement effort from a member of the " I 'm different I swear I am club " !
Even though we have already started voting for Republicans out of disgust .
We will see if this is a PR move , or a genuine effort of conscious on Mr. Wexler 's part and if he can get his peers who I am not voting for into 2008 to smell the coffee .
Maybe just maybe the Party will decide they Stand for Something and really Go Into Action like dare I say the Republicans , at least they believe and do Something about what they believe !!!!
Just maybe if the Dems take us to lunch we might if it's a sunny day vote for them again , they are loosing voters by the thousands and still do n't get it ?
Bush and Cheney are really , really bad and Congress might even be worse .
Repeat after me fire them all they are all responsible because without the Congress Cheney and Bush could not have pulled off the greatest crime and nightmare we have seen in 100 + years and continue their insane behavior .
Where oh where is Osama now ?
Enough already .
" Well we are paying Pakistan to find him ? "
Do what , wow they got allot of incentive considering they Need $ $ .
" Gee I can not find him please send more $ $ . "
" No problem as soon as China gets that check over to U.S. we will forward it right to you . "
This nightmare needs too end real soon but I fear America must sink way lower before we really wake up , its heart breaking !
It has been Congress 's job to get some control over this insane behavior a long , long , time ago as soon as it became obvious to them .
Say 2004 to give them some really , really Undeserved Slack .
By the time the JC has finished doing the current Cheney work or what ever is more Important ?
than Impeaching , he will be retired and enjoying his endless $ $ drinking in the islands on checks from well so many we can't count the corporations .
Lets just start with lets say KBR ( Halliburton ) who serves our military daily in Irag and has billed our government ( us ) for meals soldiers have not even eaten yet though they were prepared what 2 - 3 yrs ago ?
A lot of good a slow moving process is doing us .
Wake up people tell DC you got their number .
Impeachment Front Row and Center in the House JC , Right Here Right Now !
Does anybody in DC care ?
Mostly not but we can pray , do n't hold your breath Sports Fans we all got excited last November election for nothing .
Show us do n't tell us and show us really soon or go look for a job !
Start firing them again in 2008 and I mean the spineless Dems that did nothing .
Pelosi's olive branch was a nice idea at first but it was rejected completely as we see , so please someone slap that woman into some integrity .
I really think the Dems blew it already - maybe 2012 I will vote for them again we will see .
Remember it does not hurt bad enough for the USA yet vote Republican teach those Spineless Dems we mean business we expect change NOW .
So maybe they wo n't slap us in the face the next time we give them our trust , honor and votes .
1 voter gone Republican for 2008 see ya in 2012 .

OK , this is a little convoluted but please bear with me .
And remember that Republicans think and plan long - term --- as in , Rove had planned and was implementing his permanent Republican takeover for decades .
So .
Any attemps by Dems toward impeachment of Cheney ( or Bush ) are automatically accused of being political or retaliatory by the right - wing .
We all know why , of course : the Clenis .
And , hoo - boy , did they struggle and strive and strain for two terms to find something , anything , to impeach Clinton for .
And they finally did , and turned it into a circus about lying about a blowjob , and pretty much tainted the process for who knows how long .
What 's the significance ?
Tinfoil hat time .
The setup for 2000 is already in the works .
When they get their guy elected , he can get away with murder , literally , because any talk of impeachment will be met with " Political ! " and " Retaliation ! " and Dems are too wimply to handle that .
And , if a Dem * is * elected , well they can go the same route with impeachment if they want , because Repubs are Sooooo upstanding .

Why Cheney first ?
Because he 's the low hanging bad apple .

Because he 's the Vice President ( self explanatory ) .
Cheney is also more guilty than Bush .
At least , his public statements about Iraq back in 2002 & 2003 were more over - the - top .
Cheney is also less popular than Bush .
So we go after Cheney first , becuase it 's more feasable .
Most of the same evidence will apply to Bush , so it is basically a 2 - fer - 1 Impeachment .

Hi all , What wonderfully written , insightful comments here !
I could n't agree more -- HR 333 may just , through happy accident of Republican stunting ( though I have a different theory on that ) be our ONE , REAL CHANCE to change the course of our country 's miserable history over 7 years of stolen elections , illegal wars of aggression , treason , etc .... HOWEVER , because this may be our only chance , I feel it is PARAMOUNT that we write to EVERY MEMBER OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE .
I will gently challenge you all , who wrote such poignant , correct , heartfelt comments here , to follow this link , to a list of EVERY MEMBER OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE and , at a minimum : 1 . Merely copy and paste your personal comment , here , to EVERY ONE OF THEM !
2 . If you felt like doing more , you could write them a more formal , email letter .
But really , # 1. , above , is enough , perhaps with the additional explanation that YOUR COMMENTS ARE MERELY TYPICAL OF THE MAJORITY OF AMERICAN OPINION , and included a link back to The Bradblog , www.mikemalloy.com, or direct them to the comments section of www.rawstory.com or WHEREVER IS BEST , in your judgment .
Here ’s the thing :
Not to piss anyone off , but IF YOU ONLY BITCH HERE , you ’re NOT PART OF THE SOLUTION !
No offense , but which member(s ) of the House Judiciary Committee do you honestly think are reading The Bradblog ?
Even one HJC member ?
Sadly , I highly doubt it ….
I , myself , am working on a " form letter " embodying my most heartfelt arguments , with my full name , the fact that I am an attorney ( though I no longer practice - - could n't stand ' em - - no offense ) and that I will oppose reelecting ANYONE who did n't at least ATTEMPT to oppose the B*sh Juggernaut .
Please , talented writer / patriots of The Bradblog , do as I suggest ( challenge ? ) you to , and share your easily - cut - and - pasted , already - written thoughts , with THE ONE COMMITTEE CURRENTLY HOLDING OUR FUTURE IN THEIR HANDS .
If more incentive is needed , a less - subtle challenge to the parents reading this : General Betrayus testified , before Congress , in Sept. , that he envisions an 11 - 50 YEAR commitment of US troops in Iraq .
Several Congressmen have bills pending to REINSTITUTE a draft .
So ... take your kids ' ages , add 11 - 50 years , and see if you feel they will be at risk of a DRAFT ....
To the non-parents : best estimates place our current tax bill , for the Iraq war , at 2.4 TRILLION or , $ 8,000 .
PER PERSON , FOR EVERY U.S. CITIZEN !
This is from the NON - PARTISAN Congressional Budget Office .
Here is the article documenting these estimates : http://rawstory.com/news...r_US_wars_8000_1024.html
Of course , that estimate did n't include the " long term / 24/7 medical care " required for many of the vets , a bill itself estimated , two years ago , at TWO TRILLION .
So ... I believe the REAL bill is 4.4 TRILLION DOLLARS or , $ 16,000 .
PER PERSON !
If you 're the only breadwinner in a family of four , YOU OWE $ 64,000 .!
( Funny , huh ? )
Per the Congressional Budget Office , estimates of these costs ( the $ 8,000 .
figure , not the real amount , IMO , of $ 16,000 . ) will skyrocket to $ 40,000 .
if we invade Iran and " encounter serious resistance . "
Well , if I 'm right the official figures need to be doubled , ( to account for the long - term medical costs ) then $ 40 k = $ 80 k , per person .
Again , multiply THAT by the number of non-wage - earners in your home , and cut the check .
Four family members = $ 320,000 .
HOUSEHOLD war tax bill ( if we invade Iran ) .
So , please , please PLEASE post your already - written comments TO EVERY MEMBER OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE , here : http://judiciary.house.g...CommitteeMembership.aspx
And let your Neocon numbnuts friends who believe “ GWB is gunna lower our TAXES ! ” get a load of these numbers !
Ask them if they ’re ready to pay $ 8,000 . - 16,000 .
PER PERSON , to “ liberate ” Iraq .
And then ask them if they want to watch the news every night , to see if their daughter , son , niece , nephew , mom or dad is coming home in a dark cargo plane ’s hold , with their eyes closed … .
And ( please ! ) do it TODAY , ( right now ! ) before the evil Pelosi , Reid , Hoyer , and the rest of these TRAITORS can stick a broomstick in the spokes of Dennis Kucinich 's wobbly , first - time - on - two - wheels IMPEACHMENT BICYCLE !
PLEASE POST YOUR COMMENTS TO EVERY HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER — NOW — BEFORE IT ’S TOO LATE !!!!

Ooops !
I forogt to include my theory on why the Rethuglicans switched their votes .
I put it here as a possible cause for Hope : >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
There IS Cause for Hope :
My personal belief is , the Rethuglicans did not switch their votes in an attempt to embarrass the Dems , as we are being asked to believe by EVERY MSM source .
Rather , I believe the Rethuglicans saw a chance to have this BLOATED TIC ON THE BACK OF THEIR NECK , Richard B. Ch*ney , PLUCKED FROM THEM PRIOR TO THE ’08 ELECTIONS , by a True American Patriot , one Dennis Kucinich .
I honestly believe that — I believe they said “ Let ’s dump this war - mongering , spending - us - into - bankruptcy albatross , Ch*ney , and blame the Dems !
Tell your uber - Neocons we ’re doing it to embarrass the Dems , and they ’ll go along with it .
Ultimately , we ’ll either embarrass the Dems or lose Darth Vader — either way , WE WIN ! "
Obviously , some of them did n’t get the memo that B*sh is planning to cancel the ’08 elections , after he declares “ martial law ” under HSPD 51 , after invading Iran or after some other manufactured “ catastrophic emergency . ”
Oh , you had n’t heard ?
" Homeland Security Presidential Directive 51 " ( HSPD 51 ) REMOVES OUR THREE - BRANCH SYSTEM OF GOV'T .
It became “ law ” on May 9 , 2007 , when B*sh issued it , and it says , basically , in the event of a vague , “ catastrophic emergency of B*sh ’s own definition ( could be environmental , economic , military , animal / vegetable / mineral ) BOTH THE LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES BECOME UNDER THE CONTROL OF HOMELAND SECURITY , which itself is under the control of …the Executive Branch .
Oh yeah !
Too bad Pelosi does n’t know about it — if her whole “ impeachment is off the table ” bullsh*t is simply because she ’s planning on installing Billary in ’ 08 , well , both those b*tches got a BIG SURPRISE comin’ , when Georgie cancels the ’08 elections .
Read all about HSPD 51 here , but be warned : when you get to the article the following link takes you to , and you click on the link in the article itself you will be looking at the White House 's Official Website , and you see GWB 's signature on the bottom of HSPD 51 .
It 's scary because it 's unConstitutional and the epitomy of the slow - motion coup d'tat that B*sh 's Corporatist - Fascists have already effected ....
But at least go here to read an article about HSPD 51 , if nothing else : http://www.wnd.com/news/...cle.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55824
But I digress ….
However , perhaps HSPD 51 will motivate you to post your excellent Bradblog comments TO EVERY MEMBER OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE , HERE , in support of Impeachment via HR 333 : http://judiciary.house.g...CommitteeMembership.aspx >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I believe the Republicans want Cheney removed from office so they can install their next presidential candidate in the V.P. office before 2008 .
I believe that George Bush would select McCain .
This way McCain would almost be guaranteed to be the Republican choice for next president .
Short of Cheney having a heart attack before 2008 , impeachment would be the only way of getting McCain in as the Republican candidate .

JEEZ , I hate head twisting , but if any one thinks for a moment that the tide is not going out on the tortured truth , and the elected officials who find themselves in this naked position are going to play into the GOP CRAP , have lost all hope .
That my friends is despair ... a position that easily lends itself to manipulation !
I for one am still hopeful .
A chance now exists for a reading of the crimes to ALL KNUCLEHEADS .
Just make sure you do n't fall into the trap that hopeful is ignorant ( uniformed . )

Wow , the majority of you liberal fucks sound like a bunch of communist .
You know , I support the war and the fight for terrorism .
I believe we 're in for a good cause , killing whoever was connected to 9/11 .
But all you liberals want to do is complain about how the war is bad for us .
I 'll tell you what , when the Radical Islams end up coming to America terrorizing everything , I will be the one fighting back .
As for the rest of ya'll , do what you do best and talk about peace ... you guys will be the first to die .
And I hope that happens , because I hate communist .

Note to Peter : HSPD51 did not " become law " when the President signed it .
It became law 30 days later when the Congress did n't vote to STOP it .
The Democrats KNEW this had been signed , and COULD have made an issue of it , but they really ARE too stupid for words .
The bottom line is that the Dems STILL believe that politics is being played as it always has been --- we get a little , you get a little , and the little guys get squat --- but it IS NOT BEING PLAYED THAT WAY ANY MORE .
Rove , Cheney , and the neo-con Rethuglican cabal that stole power in 2000 are playing TO WIN FOREVER .
They are not playing the game the way the Democrats think and they are being OUTPLAYED at every corner because of it .
The Democrats really believe they can actually get a President elected IF there even is an election .
Screw them all !
Let 's get this damn corporate fascist state up and running .
I 'd rather be a guerilla fighter for freedom than a sniveling consumer hoping the Dems will come to my rescue .
Bring it on !

L.P.E. { Ed Note : Rick , please read the commenting policy ....
-- 99 } Buy some newspapers and history books - learn how to read , do some homework , no one on this blog wants to be killed by terrorists - did any one here say they did ?
No one here said they wanted to open our country to terrorists or any such insanity !
As to killing the people responsible for 9 - 11 no one on here said they were against that !
Go to Pakistan kill Osama and bring his head to us , we will send you a donation for being a Real Patriot !
After that go to Saudi Arabia and untwist why 9 of the high jackers came from there and why the US is still great friends with that country .
For the record Iraq and Hussein had nothing to do with 9 - 11 that is now commonly accepted by even the most un or misinformed people in this country to include loads and loads of people in our Military .
People that disagree with their Government are not traitors or communist , usually if you study HISTORY you will find disagreement within countries that flies against what may appear to be the status qoe often effects a more stable , sane , fair and long lived country with certain freedoms .
You sound like a parrot doing a sound bite ( great thing to do to get elected in this country to run for office - but unless your extremely RICH you can not do that no matter how bad you want to - you can not ) do your own homework Bush and Cheney will gladly sacrifice you and any others who refuse to do their homework - yes doing our personal homework and our own research , not blankly accepting rhetoric that falls from people of power can be a very good thing .
Do you think the fact you cannot get elected in this country cause you do not have the biggest stack of money is fair or represents a democracy .
Do you think just maybe these people who are elected who get incredible sums of money from corporations might not have you best interest at heart ?
Going to war when its necessary can also be a good thing , Osama was a necessary target , Iraq was a tangent .
Tell me why you think we cannot kill Osama in 6.5 yrs .
when we have the most powerful military in the world ?
Is it funny business or are we just incompetent .
If you tell us Osama was not the person behind 9 - 11 go fight any war you choose plenty of them everywhere ( just pick which ever one you believe in ) just do n't come crying to us maimed and crippled 10 years from now telling us you got screwed and they used you .
Cheney and Bush use people like you for cannon fodder , votes and power - stay tuned into what you research not what people tell you , live long and learn .
Disagree all you want its the basis of this great country , do n't believe what Bush says or what I say - go find out for yourself .
Then you will be informed from you own hard work .
Coming on here and calling us communists is BS !
In most of our opinions you are the blind Communist - Nazi - Terrorist ( quite unknown to you ) by helping the world to be less safe by accepting information passed to you by people in positions of power as FACT rather than finding the facts for yourself !
It seems blind faith in your leaders could possibly be your reason , its never good to trust completely any authority .
Not : Clinton , Bush , Hitler , Blair , any Caesars , Mussolini , Popes , Cardinals , Priests , Christian Fundamentalist , Thomas Jefferson , George Washington or any body PERIOD EVER !
People like Thomas Jefferson would expect nothing less from you before he called you a Patriot !
All people in power must be watched with a careful eye because they carry so much power and can do so much damage while people are asleep and working to make ends meet .
Disagree all you want with people but state some information you have discovered on your own that leads you to such beliefs .
I really think you ’re quite mistaken to think people on this blog would not take up arms to protect our country from threats like Radicals attacking the homeland .
You hope we get killed cause you hate Communists ?
Since you ’re an expert on identifying Communists please enlighten us to Communism ’s history and rise in the world , in what countries , at what points in time and what situations the countries that succumbed to it were in who and what was over thrown and how , how it was implemented and so forth in detail .

While I agree in principle , with only 15 months left on his term , this is probably not a good use of the Congressional brain trust .
This should have been done 4 years ago .
Of course , Cheney is a symptom of the problem not the problem itself .
I believe that Wexler and his constituents would be better served if he were to spend more time researching & sponsoring oversight measures to see that this does not happen again .
However , lawmakers are wary of ' permanent ' solutions that would impede a Party presidency .
Blaming the other party is more politically effective ( disruptive , newsworthy , etc. ) that fixing the problem .
Cheney simply took advantage of the lack of checks and balances that Congress is entrusted with .
Congress must accept as much of the blame here as the Administration .
There is more than enough to go around .

This has a chance of going somewhere in the probability range between a snowball in hell and a black man getting accepted in the John Birch Society .
A lone Dem urging this or that does not a genuine opposition party make .
They 're a bunch of spineless twats and phonies , sometimes talking a good game but when push comes to shove they roll over on command without fail , every time .
Same with the " opposition " parties in Putin 's Russia , only he 's less adept at the game .
Hope is a good thing but let 's remember what we are dealing with .

While I have a different view of who was responsible for the 9/11 attacks I agree wholeheartedly with the remainder of your statement above .
Questioning authority is the mainstay of a free and democratic country .
When we fail to keep informed of the issues and accept everything our leaders feed us - that is when we cease to have liberty .
This can be seen here in the loss of Habeas Corpus , preemptive wars based on falsehoods and lies , " Free Speech Zones " , the Patriot Act as well as the acceptance of actions which are illegal under the Geneva Conventions and other laws pertaining to a countries actions during war .
Those who come here to attack the commenters with derision and canned talking points are followers - Lemmings if you will - ditto heads unable to think for themselves - parroting all they have been spoon fed .
They are NOT patriots !

The Balloon Lamp is a new modern day version of the paper lantern .
I know , I know , paper lanterns are still very cool , but designer Kouichi Okamoto has replaced the candle with a high intensity LED bulb and the paper lantern with a rubber balloon .
Not only does the bright LED generate no heat which makes it much safer than paper surrounding fire , it can also last around a hundred hours on the two provided batteries .
The Balloon Lamps are wireless and portable so they can be hung up all around your home or yard and if you purchased thousands of them , you could have one incredibly illuminated balloon drop on New Year 's Eve !
Over 50 % of people polled admitted they had stolen Wi-Fi internet access from others .
Over 50 % of people polled admitted they had stolen Wi-Fi internet access from others .
IT security and control firm Sophos has revealed new research into the use of other people 's Wi-Fi networks to piggyback onto the internet without payment .
The research , carried out by Sophos on behalf of The Times , shows that 54 percent of computer users have admitted breaking the law , by using someone else 's wireless internet access without permission .
According to Sophos , many internet - enabled homes fail to properly secure their wireless connection with passwords and encryption , allowing freeloading passers - by and neighbours to steal internet access rather than paying an Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) for their own .
In addition , while businesses often have security measures in place to protect the Wi-Fi networks within their offices from attack , Sophos experts note that remote users working from home could prove to be a weak link in corporate defenses .
" Stealing Wi-Fi internet access may feel like a victimless crime , but it deprives ISPs of revenue .
Furthermore , if you 've hopped onto your next door neighbors ' wireless broadband connection to illegally download movies and music from the net , chances are that you are also slowing down their internet access and impacting on their download limit , " explained Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant for Sophos .
" For this reason , most ISPs put a clause in their contracts ordering users not to share access with neighbours - but it 's very hard for them to enforce this . "
Survey results
Have you ever used someone else 's Wi-Fi connection without their permission ?
Yes 54 % No 46 %
Sophos online survey , 560 respondents , 31 October - 6 November 2007 .
Sophos recommends that home owners and businesses alike set up their networks with security in mind , ensuring that strong encryption is in place to prevent hackers from eavesdropping on communications and potentially stealing usernames , passwords and other confidential information .
" If you 're not encrypting your wireless communications then it's not hard for cybercriminals in your neighborhood to snoop on what you 're doing , whether it 's surfing or remotely accessing work documents .
They may even be able to infect your computer with malware designed to commit identity theft , " continued Cluley .
" It 's essential that your Wi-Fi connection is encrypted and that you have not chosen a password for your router which is easy to guess or crack .
The problem is that a lot of Wi-Fi equipment is not properly configured when it comes out of the box , or is a headache to setup . "

Will Smith Blasts Daily Mail
is fighting mad over a story that appeared in theover the weekend .
The article claims that Smith praised Adolf Hitler .
The media storm that followed has put the Hollywood actor in fighting mode .
Smith was quoted in the Scottish newspaper as having said that Hitler was essentially a good person .
His response is that the article was a ludicrous misinterpretation of his remarks .
They attributed the following quote to Smith : " Even Hitler did n't wake up in the morning sayings ' let me do the most evil thing I can do today ' .
I think he woke up using a twisted , backward logic and he set out to do what he thought was good . "
Smith wanted to set the record straight by saying that " Hitler was a vile , heinously vicious killer responsible for one of the greatest acts of evil ever committed on the planet . "
Daily Mail printed the followup today .
The original story was in their Saturday edition .

Hazy red sunset on extrasolar planet
The NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope has given astronomers a fascinating new insight into the atmosphere of a planet in orbit around another star .
The observations provide evidence of the presence of hazes in the atmosphere of the planet HD 189733b .
A team of astronomers have used the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope to detect , for the first time , strong evidence of hazes in the atmosphere of a planet orbiting a distant star .
The discovery comes after extensive observations made recently with Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) .
The team , led by Frédéric Pont from the Geneva University Observatory in Switzerland , used Hubble 's ACS to make the first detection of hazes in the atmosphere of the giant planet .
" One of the long - term goals of studying extrasolar planets is to measure the atmosphere of an Earth - like planet , this present result is a step in this direction " says Pont .
" HD 189733 b is the first extrasolar planet for which we are piecing together a complete idea of what it really looks like . "
The new observations were made as the extrasolar planet , dubbed HD 189733 b , passed in front of its parent star in a transit .
As the light from the star passes through the atmosphere around the limb of the giant extrasolar planet , the gases in the atmosphere stamp their unique signature on the starlight from HD 189733 .
The planet itself , orbiting close to its parent star , is a " hot - Jupiter " type of gas giant slightly larger than Jupiter .
The proximity to its star results in an atmospheric temperature of roughly seven hundred degrees Celsius .
Measurements of the way light varies as the planet passes in front of its parent star indicates that HD 189733 b has neither Earth - sized moons nor any discernable Saturn - like ring system .
Hubble 's ACS camera , coupled with a grism ( a kind of cross between a prism and a diffraction grating ) allowed the astronomers to make extremely accurate measurements of the spectrum of HD 189733 b , allowing conclusions to be drawn about the composition of the planet 's atmosphere .
The exquisite level of precision needed to make this observation can only , at the moment , be achieved from space .
The combination of a large planet and relatively small parent star - only 76 % of the diameter of our Sun - contributes to the success of this delicate experiment .
Where the scientists had expected to see the fingerprints of sodium , potassium and water there were none .
This finding , combined with the distinct shape of the planet 's spectrum , infers that high level hazes ( with an altitude range of roughly 1000 km ) are present .
So the atmosphere on HD 189733 b would look very similar to a gorgeous red sunset over Athens !
Venus and Saturn 's moon Titan , in our own Solar System , are also covered with haze .
According to the scientists the haze probably consists of tiny particles ( less than 1/1000 mm in size ) of condensates of iron , silicates and aluminium oxide dust ( the compound on Earth which the mineral sapphire is made of ) .
As part of the observations of HD 189733 , the teams of astronomers also needed to accurately account for the variations in the star 's brightness during the set of observations .
" Starspots " like those seen on our own Sun may cover several percent of the star and are thought to be about 1000 degrees Celsius cooler than the rest of HD 189733 's surface .
It was found that there is a starspot on the star 's surface which is over 80,000 km across .

Groups of political activists or “ hacktivists ” that support Al Queda had been calling for a “ cyber jihad ” to occur yesterday , November 11th .
There was never any mention of a specific target for their holy cyber war , and no one noticed any effects of their efforts .
If there was a concerted effort to attack internet sites , you could label this jihad as a failure .
The Washington Times has some background on the attacks here .
A planned cyber - attack by al Qaeda supporters against Internet sites today has its intended targets in the U.S. on guard .
The plans were uncovered by several Web sites in October , one of which launched a counterattack earlier last week .
A Homeland Security Department spokeswoman dismissed the threat as rumor and said the agency did not issue any warnings in advance .
One message board called al - Jinan acted as the main page for attackers to download software called “ Cyber Jihad 3.0 ” for the attacks , but another , unidentified blogger initiated a counterattack and shut down the page last week .
So it seems there is indeed anti-terror cyber warfare taking place on the net , and much of it is led by private groups .
These efforts have , to my knowledge , gone on without interference or prosecution by the U.S. government , which could be considered as tacit approval of the government .
Or , since it is against the law to operate websites or publish propaganda to support Al Queda or other terrorist groups , any victims of this cyber - vigilanteism has remained quiet , knowing they would face prosecution themselves for exposing their identities .
The article also mentions a piece of software called “ Cyber Jihad 3.0 . ” McAfee ’s
Avert blog analyzed the software and provides screencaps of the program here .
As one commenter correctly notes in the blog , its like volunteering for a botnet .
Marc Sachs , the director of SANS , notes his gleeful disappointment at the failures of the cyber jihadis here , saying :
Folks , let ’s get serious about this for a few minutes .
I know that this is politically incorrect , but the odds of a terrorist group “ terrorizing ” the Internet with cyber bullets and e-bombs are about as small as the odds of the Morse Code coming back as a primary means of communication .
It ’s not zero , but it ’s also not much more than zero .
With the Internet providing near - perfect communications and a seemingly endless supply of money ( from fundraising , phishing and other criminal activity ) why would a terrorist group want to blow it up ?
But the cyber jihad may have failed for more technical reasons rather than lack of effort .
McAfee examined the binaries of the Cyber Jihad 3.0 program here and concluded the software wo n’t pose much of a threat .
They list 7 reasons why it did n’t work .
They concluded :
The little bits of analysis make the code look to be written by high school or early college kids .
If their network gets large enough , maybe they could have caused harm .
Right now the websever is n’t working and the app seems like a no - go .
I ’d suggest everyone block traffic to the server http://al-jinan.net and stop worrying .
So is this enough to not have to worry about cyber terrorism ?
Perhaps only as far as its direct impact on internet operations .
Remember , causing infrastructure to explode is always more terrifying than a DDoS against a messageboard .
The real threat , however continues to be terrorist organizations using the internet for fundraising , phishing scams , and identity theft .
The next major terrorist attack could be financed by stealing the identities of internet users who tried to buy low cost Viagra .
Now thats a terrifying idea .
" Redneck Neighbor "
Page last edited on April 11 , 2002
In case you 're wondering , this Web page is about my next - door neighbors .
Since my neighbors have been driving me crazy and no amount of civilized reasoning and / or negotiations have worked - I have decided to dedicate a small corner of cyber - space to them .
My family and friends are constantly asking me to tell them the " latest " thing my neighbor has done so this page will save me from repeating myself .
Besides , I thought it would be fun .
Everything you read here is entirely true , that 's what makes it so funny .
Enjoy !
Background :
My neighbors moved into the house next to ours in October 1997 .
It ’s a brand new neighborhood with new houses .
Everyone ’s house looks beautiful but that ’s about to change .
The new neighbors seem like normal people until shortly after they move in ( more later ) .
First , let me say that my redneck neighbor is not destitute or under - privileged .
The guy owns a business , drives VERY nice new cars , he just does n’t care about his house .
In order to protect the ignorant , we ’ll call him John Doe # 8 or JD8 for short .
October 1997 - They are here !
Well , it should have been a sign of things to come but my neighbors move into their brand new house .
Inventory : 1 artificial Christmas tree , clothes , stereo system , TV , no furniture ) .
The Christmas tree is nicely decorated ( remember , it 's October ) .
We can tell what the tree looks like because the windows have no miniblinds so at night , you can see right into the house as you drive up .
They have also decided to wrap some strands of Christmas lights around their front porch railing .
I guess there 's no electric outlet nearby because they never turn these lights on .
October 1997 - 1st
Home beautification project
It 's dark outside , I 'm standing in front of my house and my neighbor does the following :
He gets in his car , drives it up to the house on the other side of my house ( this house is still being built ) .
He backs his car up to the construction site and opens the trunk .
He calmly proceeds to load up the trunk with bricks and 2x4s .
Pretty clever , huh ?
The following night , at around 9:00 pm he decides it 's time to build a mailbox post .
It 's very nice .
He used the stolen 2x4s from the previous night .
It looks like it 's made out of 2x4s except he did n't steal any that were long enough so he nails a couple of them together to get the correct height - I mean , it has to look just right !
The mailbox post is not very sturdy so he braces it with an additional 2x4 ( at an angle ) .
Click here to see the mailbox ( no bracing 2x4 though ) .
He uses the bricks as edging for his flower beds .
They look nice .
Especially with the newly planted bamboo trees and the ten gallon fish tank ( no fish , just water ) .
November 1997 - The fence !
I wake up to my wife telling me , " Hey , it looks like JD8 is working on a fence " .
Well I do n't think much of it until she tells me that he 's trying to build a fence around the entire house ( front and back ) and that the fence is going to be chain - link .
We have some " covenant rules " that prohibit you from putting up a silver chain - link fence .
Also , you cannot have any fence go past the back of your house .
By now , I am freaking out .
I can see the property value falling faster than his mailbox post .
Anyway , I get to work and at 9:01 AM I call our builder .
I explain the situation to him and he agrees to pay JD8 a visit before the concrete around the metal posts dries .
Sure enough , I get home after work and the posts around the front of the house are laying on the street .
Not exactly what I expected but at least they 're out of the ground .
Tragedy is averted for now .
A few days later I realize he's not putting up chain - link but " chicken wire " .
Call # 2 to the builder .
While talking on the phone , the builder starts referring to the neighbor in a less - than - amicable fashion – someone else on my side !
By that afternoon , the fence is chain - link again .
The top of the fence looks like a wave ( he did n't want to spend the 6 bucks on a level ) , and the sides look like an S .
Very crafty guy .
Total estimated fence cost : $ 250.00 - but wait ! --
He did n't set all the metal posts in concrete !
Actual cost : $ 62.50 .
You get the idea here .
Sometime after the fence
Well , it 's time to give Cujo the Rottweiler a home .
The dog 's actual name is Lucky .
The dog quickly learns how to jump the fence .
Once tied to a chain , he also learns that if he barks for a long time , people will come out to see him .
Unfortunately , for about the first two weeks , he wants to be " seen " late at night .
Apparently , JD8 does n't play the " let 's - see - what - the - hell - is - wrong - with - the - dog " game .
I 'm the only game participant .
After throwing a few rocks
Cujo's way , he decides he'd rather sleep at night .
Something else needs to be mentioned .
Since JD8 ’s business is booming , he decides he does n't have time to feed " Not - so - Lucky " .
Instead , he breaks open a 50 lb. bag of dog food in the middle of his storage closet and Cujo goes in there whenever he 's hungry .
Unfortunately for Cujo , the ants like dog food too .
Sometime after the dog
All work and no play is cramping JD8 ’s lifestyle !
It 's time to get in shape .
We wake up early on a Saturday morning to the sounds of a bouncing basketball .
He 's put a basketball goal about 15 feet from our bedroom window .
Mom moves in !
Nothing wrong here .
Mom seems like a very nice lady .
Unfortunately , my wife wakes me up to bad news again .
" Something weird is happening at JD8 ’s house .
His dog is chasing some chickens around the back yard . "
Unfortunate indeed .
Just as I peek out the bathroom window , I see JD8 ’s mom come out and throw some chicken feed in the middle of the yard .
About nine chickens gather around , frantically pecking at the food but Cujo crashes in and spoils the moment .
My morning is spoiled as well .
Remember the old " covenant rules " of our neighborhood ?
Well , there 's a sentence in there about livestock ( fancy word for chickens and goats ) .
We do n’t live in the country – we live in the city .
After a quick phone call to our city 's " Special enforcement " folks , they promise to come out and give JD8 a warning .
The chickens are gone within a couple days .
Can you say chicken feast ?
Shortly after this , JD8 decides that maybe the city folks do n't like chickens .
Marcy thinks she hears Canadian geese behind our house .
It 's geese alright .
JD8 has enclosed the wooden deck behind his house with some more chain - link fence and is now raising geese right on the deck !
The geese disappear weeks after without the intervention of the fine folks at Special Enforcement .
Maybe they flew away .
Mom decides she can't be without her feathery friends and moves back home shortly after .
Party number one
It 's Tuesday morning , about 2:00 am .
My wife and I wake up to what feels like a small tremor .
It 's JD8 ’s stereo , AKA the Bass Machine .
All we hear is this bass rumble ( it 's making our bedroom windows rattle ) , and what sounds like a very poor male singer .
Every song has the same monotone male singer .
Well , amusement quickly turns to annoyance and anger .
I decide to go ask them to turn it down .
I knock on the door .
Get ready for this image .
The door opens , JD8 is holding a beer .
There 's a working disco ball hanging on their ceiling fan .
There 's a guy in the background standing in front of a big screen TV ( holding a microphone ) .
The words to George Michael 's " Careless Whisper " slowly scroll to the music .
You guessed it !
It 's a Karaoke Party !!!
It takes all my strength to not laugh and remain " angry " .
I ask them to turn it down .
The music stops for tonight .

JD8 decides to put up rain gutters in front of his carport .
Unfortunately he does n't buy a piece long enough for the width of the carport .
Instead , he buys two pieces .
They 're about ten feet long .
He wedges the two pieces together by hand and proceeds to nail the now larger piece directly onto the carport .
Once again , things do n't go as planned for JD8 and he realizes the middle of the rain gutter is sagging -- right where the two pieces join .
Having no time to consult his engineer friends , he comes up with the answer -- he ties a piece of a wire coat hanger around the middle of the rain gutter .
For the finishing touch , he ties the coat hanger around a nail he 's nailed onto the carport roof shingles .
The nail is not nailed all the way into the shingles .
About an inch of the nail remains above the shingles with the coat hanger wire neatly wrapped around it .
Bob Vila would love this guy .
The Rock
This has to do with another home improvement project .
There 's no way to describe this project .
It is quite simple .
He wants to put a rock in his flower bed .
The weird part is how the rock is placed there .
When I describe this to my friends at work , I call it the " one legged table " .
I know it 's hard to picture it .
To see it , click here .
Party number two
This party follows the pattern of the first party except I did n't feel the urge to laugh .
The scenario is the same .
It 's a weeknight , it 's about 1:00 AM and the party is going strong .
I decide to again go speak to JD8 about the problem .
I knock on the door and soon realize that the music is so loud that they can't hear the doorbell or my knocking .
It 's very cold outside and I 'm VERY angry by now .
The only thing I can do is to wait for the song to end so I can pound on the door hard enough for them to hear me .
As predicted , the song ends , I bang on the door and in a few seconds , JD8 is standing there , holding a beer , smiling at me .
I explain my concerns to JD8 and he apologizes several hundred times .
I shake my head and return home .
Same night , but it 's now 3:00 am .
The music is back and with authority .
It wakes us up again and this time I 'm ready to kill somebody .
Instead , I call the police .
The funny thing is that when the police officer arrives , JD8 can't hear the officer knocking on the door .
By now , my wife and I are glued to the window hoping to see some police brutality ( yeah it 's bad ) .
The officer proceeds to walk around the house shining his flashlight into the windows hoping to get a glimpse of what 's happening inside .
As the officer is walking back towards the front of the house , JD8 opens the door and sees the police car .
He panics and slams the door shut .
The officer sees the light shining on the front lawn and runs to the front door .
The officer starts pounding on the door , and shouting .
After about thirty seconds , the door opens and the cop goes inside the house .
We can hear the officer screaming for them to turn the music off .
Sweet !
I meet the officer by his car and he tells me to call him back if I hear anything so he can take everyone to jail .
It was beautiful .
The Structure
In case you have not noticed by now , JD8 ’s favorite hobby is to build things poorly .
His next project is yet unnamed .
All my friends call it the chicken coop .
There are several theories as to what this building really is .
The theories include : chicken coop , two - story deck , two - story chicken coop , work shop , shed , etc .
It would be easier for you to see it than for me to describe it .
Once thing is certain , it is HUGE .
Unfortunately for JD8 , I called the city and he has been asked by the fine folks at " code enforcement " to stop building whatever that is .
He needs to get a building permit .
Luckily for the neighborhood , that thing will not meet building code regardless of what it is .
The lawn mower
After living here about 8 months , JD8 decides to buy a lawn mower .
Unfortunately for my wife and I , JD8 is too excited about his new purchase .
He 's so excited that he decides he needs to cut the lawn .
The only problem is that once again , the entire neighborhood is asleep .
It 's midnight !
This is the only time I curse at my neighbor but I do not know what else to do .
He explains he is " testing " the lawn mower .
I do n't think he understands my point .
He seems to think I 'm upset that he is cutting his lawn .
The fact that he is making entirely too much noise never crosses his mind .
Miscellaneous Pictures
This is a picture of part of JD8 ’s back yard .
This is the part that connects our property .
Check out the workmanship of his chain - link fence !
No words can say enough here .
JD8 also likes to work on his car .
Since this picture was taken , he poured the contents of the oil pan into a hole in his yard .
Labor Day Party
Fortunately for us , we were not home on Labor Day weekend .
However , two of my other neighbors tell me that JD8 and friends had a knock - out - drag - out fist fight in the middle of the street .
The time , of course , about 2:00 AM .
I can't tell you much about it except that the police showed up and got things under control .
I presume somebody was on the Karaoke machine singing " Everybody was Kung Fu fighting " and things got out of hand after that .
Late night project
Just when you think JD8 will take a breather , things get going again .
This time , it 's about 11:00 pm and he decides his carport is not complete .
It 's missing something – something other than a car .
JD8 is putting together a pool table .
It 's positioned directly in the center of his carport - where else do you put a pool table , right ?
I have to point out that this happened long before the Drew Carry show so he did n’t get the idea from there .
BTW – you can check out the rain gutters on that last picture .
Back to the story .
Of course , he is hammering , dropping things , and just making a whole lot of noise .
I decide to just open the window and " ask " JD8 to keep it down .
Apparently , " keeping it down " is a relative term .
The project continues .
To make a long story short , it 's now 1:00 am and the banging and hammering is still going on .
I decide to call the police .
Before the cops get here , one of JD8 ’s friends decides it 's not too late in the evening to race his car 's engine and burn some rubber all the way up the street .
It 's just wholesome fun !
The policeman arrives and I explain the situation .
I also tell him this time we ARE definitely going to court over this .
He goes over to JD8 ’s house and after about 15 minutes , motions me to come over .
It becomes evident that the cop has mentioned somebody is going to jail because the entire household is out of the house frantically apologizing , and trying to shake my hand .
The cop explains that it is up to me to decide whether or not they get to spend a night downtown .
I 'm guessing that the JD8 crew is picturing some third - world - country type jail because they are quite frantic .
I tell them that " this time " I wo n't let the police take them to jail .
However , the " next time " we have a problem , " some damn body " is going to jail .
The police officer agrees and gives me his business card .
He asks me to specifically request his presence the next time I need the police out here .
He tells them he does n't want to be back .
They are still nodding , waving , and shaking hands .
Back Yard Accident ?
Well , after many months of inactivity , JD8 surpasses his previous antics .
I come home from work to the sight of a smoking back yard .
It turns out that it was winter time and the grass was dried - up ( dormant ) – JD8 threw a lit cigarette out his back door and you can imagine the rest .
Here are two pictures of the end - result .
Luckily for us , the fire stayed far from our property .
Unfortunately , the grass did n’t burn long enough to take the wooden structure down .
The privacy fence you see in the pictures separates his yard from the property behind our houses .
That fence was about two weeks old .
Here are the pictures : ( Picture one ) ( Picture two ) .
Hibachi Hell
After a long hiatus , JD8 comes back strong .
One early morning ( around 5:15 am ) , I wake up to the sound of voices .
Marcy is wide awake - peeking out of our bedroom miniblinds .
She tells me there are a few fire department trucks outside .
Apparently , a neighbor ( from the apartment buildings behind our subdivision ) was on his way to work ( he 's a soldier ) and noticed a fire behind JD8 ’s house .
He jumped over the privacy fence , woke JD8 up , and called the fire department .
I proceeded to go out there to get the scoop on what had happened .
It turns out that JD8 had left a Hibachi grill on top of his wooden picnic table .
Unfortunately , the picnic table was sitting on top of his wooden deck .
To make a long story short , the table and a big part of the deck went up in flames .
Of course , you want to see the pictures !
Exhibit A Exhibit B Exhibit C
Check out the chain link fence around the deck .
That 's where the geese used to live .
Neighborhood thugs
In case you do n't remember , long ago , JD8 had placed a basketball goal right outside our bedroom window .
Unfortunately for JD8 , some neighborhood thugs put a couple bricks through the back - board .
Unfortunately for me , the same bricks also took a chunk off the side of my house .
JD8 decides to move the basketball goal to the curb to be picked up by our city 's waste disposal specialists ( garbage men ) .
Well , from the look of JD8 ’s house , the garbage men are n't sure if it 's really garbage so they never pick it up .
The broken basketball goal sits by the curb for several months when JD8 decides to put it back on his driveway .
He does not use it again .
Here is a picture of the basketball goal .
See the Christmas lights in the background ?
This picture was taken in the summer .
Home - grown fish ?
I really do n't know what to make of this one .
JD8 has done stuff like this before .
Again , like many of JD8 ’s antics , this one has to do with his never - ending love for home - improvement .
The premise is simple , the flower bed by the mailbox is missing something .... hmmmmmmmm , a fish tank of course !
No fish , just some green water .
Latest Home Improvements
Since there are a few of these , I 'll just bunch them together .
The first in this array of home beautification efforts has to do with the old mailbox ( the one made with 2x4's ) .
JD8 decides to use the old stolen bricks and build a brick mailbox .
It 's really nice .
However , he uses his old white plastic mailbox and leaves the flag attached to it instead of attaching a flag to the bricks ( it makes the mailbox flag inoperable – it stays up ) .
Of course , worried about mail fraud or perhaps the anthrax scare , JD8 protects his mail with a Jesus Christ statue on top of the mailbox .
Check out the handy work .
Mailbox front Mailbox back Mailbox statue
Notice the realty sign by the mailbox .
That 's right - this beautiful , well - taken - care - of home could be all yours .
PLEASE buy it .
I beg you .
( No the house has not sold ) .
Apparently the fish tank by the mailbox is not conducive to the preservation of carbon - based life forms .
JD8 decides his next project will be a pond .
Luckily for the neighborhood , he places the pond in his back yard .
The actual construction of the pond is actually the best - looking project so far ( it really is ) .
However , JD8 had to add his personal touch to it and screwed everything up .
JD8 decides to add a waterfall to the pond .
He proceeds to remove a section of rain - gutters from the carport in order to get the waterfall effect .
Here are the pictures .
Pond 1 Pond 2
The next project is a weird one .
JD8 wanted to plant some spices .
Again , he could choose to use normal plant pots to grow these .
Instead , he buys several of those blue , child - size swimming pools ( you know , the round ones that are about a foot deep ) and fills them up with top soil .
The look really nice - especially sitting next to the smelly pond .
Pools 1 Pools 2
This next project occurred long before the September 11 events .
JD8 decides to put up an American flag in front of his house .
I do n’t mind that he ’s putting up a flag .
However , the JD8 School of Home Improvement ( not yet an accredited learning institution ) states that the flag pole needs to be taller than your house .
Small aircraft , beware !
Flag pole
Flag pole update
I have to admit that I 'm impressed that JD8 has taken the time to replace the American flag with a new one since the old one was looking a little dirty .
In this unprecedented set of pictures , we get to see JD8's handy work as it happens !!
I actually took these pictures while he did the work .
The quality of the pictures is really bad because I had to take the pictures through the window screen and with the camera flash disabled .
Otherwise , my cover would have been blown .
Note that he uses his Chevy Suburban to stand on ( rather than using a ladder ) and that the flag is upside down !!
JD8 is awesome .
Of course , he figures out that the flag is upside down and fixes it .
The pictures tell the story .
Again , sorry about the poor picture quality .

Kinky Friedman : Paul telling the truth ' but nobody 's listening ' David Edwards and Nicholas Burkett
Published : Tuesday October 9 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This Kinky Friedman visited with CNN's Wolf Blitzer to provide analysis of the ongoing Presidential campaigns .
In his campaign round - up , Friedman told Blitzer , " I like Hillary .
I met her a few times .
I like -- McCain I think he elements of greatness .
And I think Ron Paul 's probably telling the truth .
Nobody 's listening . "
Friedman continued , saying , " The rest of them are really the same guy admiring himself in the mirror .
It is a government of the money , by the money and for the money . "
He added , " I think the greatest crisis we 've got in government is nobody believes [ the politicians ] . "
This led to a discussion of Friedman 's own political aspirations , past and present .
Referring to Friedman 's potential political career , Blitzer asked , " But you want to get involved in politics , and you want to have a role , is that right ? "
Friedman responded a resolute " no , I 'm not sure that I want to do this . "
He continued , jokingly , to explain his failed 2006 gubernatorial bid as simply " I gave Texas my phone number , and she never got back to me , basically . "
Friedman did not rule out a second campaign , however ; " I 'm thinking about it , " he said .
And he concluded the interview with what could well have been construed as a political platform , should that candidacy become a reality .
" I really think education , healthcare , and the death penalty in Texas are being -- y'know , the big issues ... politicians are letting them slip through their fingers . "
" What they 're doing , " Friedman said , staring at his cigar , " is criminalizing trivia like ' Kinky can't smoke a cigar . ' "
The following video is from CNN's Late Edition , broadcast on October 7 , 2007 .
Mr. Barclay himself even spoke of the role his own actions played in worsening his medical condition .
“ The guy started spraying bullets around , and I caught two of them in the back , ” Mr. Barclay said in a 1978 interview about the night he was shot .
“ I got over that pretty much , but then I had a car accident and hurt my back again .
Then I had another and hurt my back some more . ”
Allen M. Hornblum , an urban studies professor at Temple University who researched Mr. Barclay ’s history and invited Mr. Barnes to speak to his class about having turned his life around after a career in crime , said the new charges were “ vindictive , pure and simple . ”
“ Barnes served his time , but the police and the city want him to pay extra because he shot one of their own , ” he said , adding that even if the charge is dismissed , the case will probably take so long to get to that stage that Mr. Barnes , who has had two heart attacks in the last three years , will die waiting .
Ms. Abraham has denied that the victim ’s being a police officer played any role in her decision to file new charges .
Ms. Abraham also argues that double jeopardy , which means a person cannot be charged twice for the same crime , does not apply in this case because the original crime was aggravated assault and the current crime — now that Mr. Barclay is dead — is murder .
Mr. Barnes ’s court - appointed lawyer has not decided whether to challenge that view .
William Barclay , 59 , the slain officer ’s brother , feels the prosecution is justified .
“ Barnes deserves to be back in prison , ” he said “ He is 71 , and that ’s seven more years of life than my brother had . ”

“ This was murder delayed , ” Mr. Barclay added , recounting his brother ’s bouts of pneumonia , painful and constant bedsores and the full - body muscle spasms that threw him from bed .
“ The length of time since the shooting should n’t matter . ”
We 're living in a golden age of British food .
And yet , as Nigel Slater writes in his hilarious and insightful new book Eating for England : The Delights & Eccentricities of the British at Table , we remain a nation obsessed by Dairylea triangles , Jammie Dodgers and takeaway cappuccinos ...

A Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania television station was forced to broadcast its noon newscast from its parking lot on Wednesday because this month 's Windows update was n't installed in time .
The " major meltdown " occurred during a ribbon - cutting ceremony to celebrate Channel 11's new facility , attended by executives from Cox Broadcasting , the station 's parent company .
The glitch , discovered 30 minutes before the show was due to air , forced an impromptu appearance by an on - air reporter , who stood in front of a chain - link fence and read the news from a script , rather than a Teleprompter .
The station 's meteorologist gave a forecast devoid of maps and graphics .
There were no additional video or live reports , according to this story from the Post - Gazette .
The station 's general manager said the cause of the crash was a Windows update that was not installed in time .
The glitch was something that could affect any Windows - based system , including the one that drives WPXI 's new automated production system .
Station administrators fixed the problem in time for the 5 p.m. newscast .
The article did n't explain how the failure to install the patches forced the production system to crash . ®

The past year has seen the public exposure of enough evidence of old , ongoing , and new crimes , abuses of power , and impeachable offenses by George Bush and Dick Cheney that in any remotely representative democracy , these two thugs would be out of office and behind bars .
The chief reason this does not shock us is that the same could be said , and was said , of each of the previous six years .
It ’s been quite a millennium so far for Washington , D.C .
Some of us began this year expecting something different .
We had worked to elect Democratic majorities in Congress so that we might move in the direction of impeachment .
If we did n’t get to impeachment right away , we thought , at least real investigations with the power of subpoena would push a reluctant Congress in the right direction .
With House committees having come within a vote of starting investigations , with the Democrats having shut down the Senate to try to force an investigation , with Chairman - to - be John Conyers having published a book on Bush and Cheney ’s crimes and held unofficial hearings in the basement , we had reason to be hopeful .
We are , alas , forced to place our hopes in 2008 .
Some of the 2007 evidence below was exposed by Congress , but most of it was unearthed by book authors , bloggers , independent reporters , federal prosecutors , and the corporate media .
With the Democratic majorities came a complete ban on congressional investigations of war lies ( not to mention an end to serious efforts to end the occupation of Iraq ) .
Other investigations proceeded cautiously and at a glacial pace – and with no ultimate objective , Speaker Nancy Pelosi having declared impeachment “ off the table . ”
It took over 4 months for the opposition party to issue its first subpoena .
In June there was a minor burst of subpoenas .
But it was quickly established that Bush , Cheney , Condi , and their underlings , would never comply with subpoenas , and that Bush would even ( feloniously ) order former staffers not to comply .
The Democrats let it go at that and largely stopped trying to compel incriminating testimony .
That the House Judiciary Committee had , a single generation back , passed an article of impeachment against a president for refusing a subpoena was buried in our national amnesia .

Ann Coulter : Nuke
Them !
Although her arrival had been anticipated with mixed emotions on campus , I was surprised that more people did not turn up to protest that USC , a research university should give platform to Ann Coulter as guest speaker during the ‘ Islamo - facism ’ awareness week .
Guest of the college Republicans , she walked on stage dressed in a short , black cocktail dress that revealed her mid-rift .
Either she had the occasion wrong or the dress ; perhaps she had plans after the event .
Regardless , on center stage , talking about Islam and fascism among a bunch of university kids in jeans , she looked out of place .
Given that she was introduced as being one of the top 100 intellectuals of the country and a few other accompanying remarks , I was surprised to hear her insistence at wanting to divide the country , albeit that the invitation was extended to her on behalf of the Republicans .
I had never heard so much liberal / Democrat bashing .
In her eyes , they were on the same footing as the terrorists .
Coulter did not believe that the Democrats wanted to defeat the ‘ savages ’ .
As with the Bush Administration , she continued to link Iraq to 9/11 , glorified the successes , and claimed that the Democrats deliberately wanted to lose to the ‘ camel - riding Nomads ’ by “ rooting against their own country ”
She colorfully compared Guantanamo Bay to ‘ freshman dorms ’ where one eats well and gains 20 pounds , not foregoing the damning reports from the neutral Swiss - based Red Cross , and as her hatred of Muslims spewed out , she exclaimed : “ “ they are savage , and I want to kill them . ”
It is this hatred , this desire for ‘ going for the kill ’ that made her give the advice which shocked me .
During Q & A , a ‘ college Republican ’ asked her opinion about what should be done to the ‘ Moslems who go around take out their swords and want to kill and convert every one ’ ( seriously , in the 21st century , do they even make swords any more ? )
After delivering a few words here and there about pain , Coulter remarked ; “ We dropped a couple of bombs on Japan and they are as tame as sheep , a few well placed bombs should do it ” .
My friends gasped .
She was inciting genocide on a large scale .
The young Republican seemed pleased .
I took a mental pause to save my sanity .
Ann Coulter is known for her controversial remarks .
She makes her living by being hateful .
My apprehension comes from the fact that so many follow her blindly and are in total agreement with her .
They buy her books , seek her autograph , and cling to every word , considering her to be an absolute authority .
The effect that she has on so many minds is a sad reflection of our society today .
Ann Coulter not only influences young minds , but older people who are intrigued by her and according to one man ( who was recording me hoping to catch me saying something ‘ unpatriotic ’ as we were discussing Coulter ) “ I would like the 14th Amendment repealed ” .
His wife was standing next to him .
Ann Coulter is their heroin ; she is not a heroine by any stretch of the imagination .
She is a fix that makes them high so they can feel good about who they are , about themselves , but it is all a temporary illusion , induced .
When they come down , they need a stronger fix , and the time will come when such hateful discourse , the fix , will have to turn into action in order for it to be effective .
Herein lies the danger , and this is why she is dangerous .
Victim : Gang - Rape Cover - Up by U.S. , Halliburton / KBR KBR told Jones she 'd lose her job if she sought help after the rape , she says .
Dec. 10 , 2007  -- A Houston ,
Texas woman says she was gang - raped by Halliburton / KBR coworkers in Baghdad , and the company and the U.S. government are covering up the incident .
Jamie Leigh Jones , now 22 , says that after she was raped by multiple men at a KBR camp in the Green Zone , the company put her under guard in a shipping container with a bed and warned her that if she left Iraq for medical treatment , she'd be out of a job .
" Do n't plan on working back in Iraq .
There wo n't be a position here , and there wo n't be a position in Houston , " Jones says she was told .
In a lawsuit filed in federal court against Halliburton and its then - subsidiary KBR , Jones says she was held in the shipping container for at least 24 hours without food or water by KBR , which posted armed security guards outside her door , who would not let her leave .
Jones described the container as sparely furnished with a bed , table and lamp .
" It felt like prison , " says Jones , who told her story to ABC News as part of an upcoming " 20/20 " investigation .
" I was upset ; I was curled up in a ball on the bed ; I just could not believe what had happened . "
Finally , Jones says , she convinced a sympathetic guard to loan her a cell phone so she could call her father in Texas .
" I said , ' Dad , I 've been raped .
I do n't know what to do .
I 'm in this container , and I 'm not able to leave , ' " she said .
Her father called their congressman , Rep . Ted Poe , R - Texas .
" We contacted the State Department first , " Poe told ABCNews.com , " and told them of the urgency of rescuing an American citizen " -- from her American employer .
Poe says his office contacted the State Department , which quickly dispatched agents from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to Jones ' camp , where they rescued her from the container .
According to her lawsuit , Jones was raped by " several attackers who first drugged her , then repeatedly raped and injured her , both physically and emotionally . "
Jones told ABCNews.com that an examination by Army doctors showed she had been raped " both vaginally and anally , " but that the rape kit disappeared after it was handed over to KBR security officers .
A spokesperson for the State Department 's Bureau of Diplomatic Security told ABCNews.com he could not comment on the matter .
Over two years later , the Justice Department has brought no criminal charges in the matter .
In fact , ABC News could not confirm any federal agency was investigating the case .
Legal experts say Jones ' alleged assailants will likely never face a judge and jury , due to an enormous loophole that has effectively left contractors in Iraq beyond the reach of United States law .
" It 's very troubling , " said Dean John Hutson of the Franklin Pierce Law Center .
" The way the law presently stands , I would say that they do n't have , at least in the criminal system , the opportunity for justice . "
Congressman
Poe says neither the departments of State nor Justice will give him answers on the status of the Jones investigation .
Click Here for Full Blotter Coverage .
Asked what reasons the departments gave for the apparent slowness of the probes , Poe sounded frustrated .
" There are several , I think , their excuses , why the perpetrators have n't been prosecuted , " Poe told ABC News .
" But I think it is the responsibility of our government , the Justice Department and the State Department , when crimes occur against American citizens overseas in Iraq , contractors that are paid by the American public , that we pursue the criminal cases as best as we possibly can and that people are prosecuted . "
Since no criminal charges have been filed , the only other option , according to Hutson , is the civil system , which is the approach that Jones is trying now .
But Jones ' former employer does n't want this case to see the inside of a civil courtroom .
KBR has moved for Jones ' claim to be heard in private arbitration , instead of a public courtroom .
It says her employment contract requires it .
In arbitration , there is no public record nor transcript of the proceedings , meaning that Jones ' claims would not be heard before a judge and jury .
Rather , a private arbitrator would decide Jones ' case .
In recent testimony before Congress , employment lawyer Cathy Ventrell - Monsees said that Halliburton won more than 80 percent of arbitration proceedings brought against it .
In his interview with ABC News , Rep .
Poe said he sided with Jones .
" Air things out in a public forum of a courtroom , " said Rep. Poe .
" That 's why we have courts in the United States . "
In her lawsuit , Jones ' lawyer , Todd Kelly , says KBR and Halliburton created a " boys will be boys " atmosphere at the company barracks which put her and other female employees at great risk .
" I think that men who are there believe that they live without laws , " said Kelly .
" The last thing she should have expected was for her own people to turn on her . "
Halliburton , which has since divested itself of KBR , says it " is improperly named " in the suit .
In a statement , KBR said it was " instructed to cease " its own investigation by U.S. government authorities " because they were assuming sole responsibility for the criminal investigations . "
" The safety and security of all employees remains KBR 's top priority , " it said in a statement .
" Our commitment in this regard is unwavering . "
Since the attacks , Jones has started a nonprofit foundation called the Jamie Leigh Foundation , which is dedicated to helping victims who were raped or sexually assaulted overseas while working for government contractors or other corporations .
" I want other women to know that it's not their fault , " said Jones .
" They can go against corporations that have treated them this way . "
Jones said that any proceeds from the civil suit will go to her foundation .
" There needs to be a voice out there that really pushed for change , " she said .
" I 'd like to be that voice . "

By Lance Yerelian | September 20 , 2007
This is a new feature , which I hope to write monthly ( or weekly ) , to shine a spotlight on a game that I think is exciting or unique and that may have gone under the radar .
This week I am going to focus on a fantastic game called Crayon Physics .
Why play in a game environment that already has the puzzle pieces laid out for you when you can create your own in Crayon Physics ?
Video and description after the jump
Crayon Physics is simple in its design and puzzles , but excels in its intuitive and unique play mechanics .
As the title of the game implies , crayons and physics are a large part of the game .
The puzzles involve moving a ball to a star by drawing beams , blocks , and other objects to move the ball and overcome obstacles .
You can drop objects on the ball to get it rolling , or build a beam under it , and add a block under the beam to create a ramp for the ball to roll down .
When you have finished with the main levels you can always go back to the creator ’s site and download mod levels created by various fans of the game .
I initially found out about this game from listening to the Games for Windows Podcast over at 1UP and was just as much intrigued by the creator as I was by the game itself .
Petri Purho is a computer science student at Helsinki Polytechnic who enjoys making games as a hobby .
Amazingly , he tries to create a game monthly , but within a 7 day time limit .
With only 7 days one can assume that only the bare bones of game mechanics can be designed and executed , which is true , but is what also makes his games so spectacular .

About 5,000 active and retired FDNY employees are receiving medical treatment for injuries and illnesses connected to the World Trade Center attacks , according to a Fire Department document .
“ That is an absolutely staggering number , and it ’s a number that speaks volumes , ” said Andrew Carboy , a lawyer who represents more than 200 firefighters in a negligence suit against the city .
“ That ’s half of what the force was on 9/11 . ”
The FDNY had about 11,000 members on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
About 3,000 firefighters and EMS workers are receiving counseling for emotional problems .
Another 1,500 are suffering respiratory ailments .
There are also between 600 and 1,000 FDNY members – most of whom retired after 9/11 – currently receiving prescription medication for a variety of illnesses , from asthma and gastrointestinal disease to depression and anxiety .
The shocking numbers were revealed in a June 8 FDNY “ request for proposals , ” launched in search of a vendor to manage the department ’s prescription - drug program for five years .
The department announced in February that it will use millions of dollars in federal funds to help subsidize medication for workers suffering from 9/11 - related injuries , allowing them to obtain free prescription drugs .
Although all 5,000 workers suffering from ailments – who were all screened by the FDNY – are eligible for the program , many are using workers ’ compensation or other forms of insurance to obtain medication .
There are 207 drugs approved in the program , including antidepressants Prozac , Zoloft and Paxil ; anti-anxiety medication Xanax ; narcotic painkiller OxyContin ; and antipsychotics Haldol and Zyprexa , which are used to combat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder .
“ When 5,000 members of the FDNY qualify for these kinds of medications , it ’s clear this problem is n’t going to go away anytime soon , ” said Stephen Cassidy , president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association .
“ People tend to forget , or maybe it ’s just human nature , to put that event behind you , ” he said .
“ But firefighters , many of whom lost many , many friends that day , besides the physical injuries , still suffer severe emotional pain . ”

Syria revved up Tuesday its rhetoric on Israel 's reported violation of Syrian airspace by warning the United Nations that the international community 's silence over the incident could have " tragic consequences . "
In a letter sent to UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon , Syria warns Israel that its " outrageous aggression " will have serious consequences .
Syria " insists that the continuing silence of the international community vis-à - vis Israel 's illegal act will place the region as well as the peace and security of both countries in the face of uncontrollable tragedies , " read the letter .
A copy of the letter was also sent to the Security Council .
" Israel is determined to choose aggression instead of peace and by doing so it reveals its true intentions that it tries to hide using fake claims of seeking peace in the region , " the letter said .
The Syrian government said last week that Israeli jets entered Syria 's airspace from the Mediterranean Sea and jettisoned fuel tanks near the Turkish border when intercepted by Syrian air - defense systems .
Israel has remained silent on the incident .
A new study provides some of the first evidence that albatrosses in the North Pacific may be affected by environmental contamination .
Alterations in the immune function of the black - footed albatross were associated with elevated blood levels of nonpoint source contaminants .
Nonpoint source pollution comes from a wide variety of sources such as farms , cars , roads and highways , and lawns .
This kind of pollution is ubiquitous and can pose a significant threat to wildlife .
At particular risk are higher trophic level species such as albatrosses , which are at the top of the food chain .
These long - lived seabirds travel and forage over vast ranges and therefore accumulate chemicals distributed over large oceanographic regions .
The black - footed species , however , breeds mainly on the Hawaiian archipelago .
The study researchers said that although measuring physiological changes in wild populations was challenging , measuring immune function was an important step in linking changes in biomarkers to contaminant exposure .
The elevated blood levels found in the albatrosses were due mainly to mercury and various organochlorines .
Because the North Pacific is an area of high biological productivity , results from the study are important for other species as well .
Of particular concern is the health of other predators in the high - latitude regions of the Arctic , such as seabirds , polar bears , and other marine mammals , that are exposed to contaminants in the marine environment .
This study is published in the latest issue of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry .

I am a long - time fan of self - hosted languages .
In that post I listed the reasons I thought that a language should be mostly or entirely written in itself .
Here ’s another reason writing a language in itself is important :
If a language ’s core libraries and frameworks are written in that language , it is possible for every programmer to improve on them .
Ruby ’s core libraries are written in C .
Here ’s the source for Ruby ’s collect method : Perhaps you like working with Haskell - style fold and unfold rather than the Smalltalk - style collect , select , and detect .
No problem , you can hack your own in Ruby , like this :
One hitch : your fold and unfold are hundreds of times slower than Ruby ’s built - in - C methods and classes .
It reminds me of Newton programming .
Apple gave us a really cool language — NewtonScript — for writing applications .
Except , the built - in applications were written in C , and the C compiler was only for Apple engineers .
The good news about Ruby is that you can write your own classes in C if you want to .
But that is a significant barrier to entry for many programmers , shrinking the available pool of programmers who will enhance the language .
Having core libraries in C is a great choice for implementing a language that is to be used for other things like building web applications .
But it is not a great choice for a language that is to be used to build other languages .
And “ building other languages ” is exactly what Bottom - Up Programming or Meta - Linguistic Abstractions are all about .
In other words , writing the core libraries in C is not a great choice for a language where programmers write their own abstractions .
Now for many things , the speed penalty of writing your own abstractions in Ruby is negligible .
But not everything .
So there is always going to be this class of things — and I think collection manipulation is one of those things — where you need to be able to write stuff that is as good as what comes out - of - the - box .
If new stuff is an order of magnitude slower , you might be able to use it for non-critical things , but your chances of persuading anyone else to use it are very low .
Which means that the language as a whole progresses slowly because real progress can only happen in areas where performance does n’t matter .
Like database - bound web applications .
Having an implementation where the built - in stuff is on the same footing as your stuff opens up the doors for actual progress .
It forces the language itself to be Good Enough , and it makes it possible for every Ruby programmer to improve the language .
Java has this incredibly powerful and popular IDE , Eclipse .
It is so powerful that many people feel it is impossible to write production Java code without it .
Why is it so powerful ?
One of the major reasons it is both powerful and popular is the availability of plug ins .
It seems to support the language , UML diagrams , source code control , and everything up to ( I ’m pretty sure ) time tracking for client billing .
Naturally , the plug ins are written in Java , just like the almost all of the built - in functionality .
Clara Creative can write her own plug in and it wo n’t be a second - class citizen .
And since it is a tool for Java programmers , Clara Creative already knows how to write plug ins , she does n’t need to drop into another language .
Wow , that is neat .
And it does help explain why Eclipse has so many plug ins , and why they are popular : there is no low - level language barrier , and they all on an equal footing with each other .
This should n’t surprise you .
Eclipse evolved from IBM VisualAge Micro , which was written by Smalltalk programmers in Smalltalk .
And of course , Smalltalk is a language where almost everything is written in Smalltalk itself .
Smalltalk programmers expect to be able to extend the language and environment without penalty .
In the end , the choice of whether to implement core features in C or Ruby will always be difficult .
The temptation to optimize for speed will always be strong , especially when the language is fighting for mind share .
But extensibility and variety is also a win , and Ruby fights with its libraries and features as much as with its performance .
Perhaps we wo n’t all be using fold and unfold instead of collect , select , and detect .
But if we are n’t , it ought to be because we prefer the originals , not because the replacements are crippled in comparison , or because the kind of person who likes inventing new tools prefers to write them in Ruby instead of in C.I ’m looking forward to hearing more from the Rubinius team .
I really think they hold the key to the future .
Thanks , Ezra , for your comment .

Media correspondent , BBC News
In some countries people do not trust the media
Of those interviewed , 56 % thought that freedom of the press was very important to ensure a free society .
But 40 % said it was more important to maintain social harmony and peace , even if it meant curbing the press 's freedom to report news truthfully .
Pollsters interviewed 11,344 people in 14 countries for the survey .
In most of the 14 countries surveyed , press freedom ( including broadcasting ) was considered more important than social stability .
The strongest endorsement came from North America and Western Europe , where up to 70 % put freedom first , followed by Venezuela , Kenya and South Africa , with over 60 % .
Although people in Britain value freedom of the press , when we asked about the media 's truth and accuracy , respondents were critical
Chris Coulter , pollster
The fight for press freedom Viewpoints : Free speech
In India , Singapore and Russia , by contrast , more people favoured stability over press freedom .
In those countries , around 48 % of respondents supported controls over the press to ensure peace and stability .
Around 40 % expressed the view that press freedom was more important .

People were also asked to rate how free the press and broadcasters were in their country to report the news truthfully and without undue bias .
Perceptions varied widely among developing countries , ranging from 81 % giving a high rating in Kenya , to 41 % in Mexico .
In India , 72 % of respondents thought their media were free , compared with just 36 % in Singapore .
Honesty
But some developed countries which strongly believed in press freedom were critical of their own media 's honesty and accuracy .
In the United States , Britain and Germany , only around 29 % of those interviewed thought their media did a good job in reporting news accurately .
Chris Coulter , vice - president of GlobeScan , the company that led the research , says : " Despite the fact that people in Britain really value freedom of the press , when we asked specifically around news organisations how they 're doing in reporting news accurately and truthfully , respondents were quite critical . "
" Only about a third of people in Britain actually gave positive ratings to either publicly - funded news organisations or privately - funded news organisations . "
He says he was quite surprised by this finding , but points out that the research was conducted during October this year , when trust in the BBC and other public service broadcasters in Britain had been hit by a series of phone - in problems and other editorial lapses .
Owners ' views
The survey also identified concern in some countries over the concentration of private media ownership in the hands of fewer large companies .
In Brazil , Mexico , the United States and Britain , more than 70 % of respondents agreed with the suggestion that ownership was an issue because the owners ' political views emerged in the news .

Germans had a particularly poor view of their private media companies - with just 18 % giving them a high rating for accurate news .
But overall , publicly - run news organisations were viewed slightly more negatively than ones run for profit .
Only in Egypt , Germany , Russia and Singapore did people rate the public media more than privately - owned media companies .
The poll was conducted by the international research firms GlobeScan and Synovate , as part of a season of programmes marking the 75th anniversary of BBC World Service .
Polling in six of the countries was in major urban areas only .
California Secretary of State Debra Bowen has filed suit against Nebraska - based Election Systems & Software for what she alleges is the latest in a string of willful and repeated violations of California election law .
This particular shenanigan involves the sale of 972 uncertified electronic ballot marker machines ( EMBs ) to a number of California counties in the spring and summer of 2006 , a sale that Bowen claims was a flagrant violation of multiple sections of the the California Election Code .
Bowen is seeking $ 9.72 million in damages ( or $ 10,000 per machine ) , as well as refunds of over $ 5 million for the equipment and various other penalties .
The dust - up started when ES&S tried to submit for state certification a new version of its voting system — a version that includes a revision ( the A200 ) of the Automark A100 machine that was certified for use in California elections back in 2005 .
During the course of a conference call with ES&S about certifying the new system , an ES&S employee inadvertently revealed that the company had already sold 972 of the A200 - based systems to five unwitting California counties , who thought they were buying the older , certified A100 systems .
Some of these counties then used the uncertified machines in elections .
Through the course of the summer of 2006 , the California Secretary of State 's office investigated this employee 's statement , looking into the distinctions between the older A100 system and the newer A200 system .
The investigation resulted in a public hearing on October 15 , at which point Bowen 's office made the case that the sale of the 972 A200 - based voting systems had violated at least two sections of the California Election Code , both of which mandate that any voting equipment vendor give notice to and seek the approval of the Secretary of State before making any changes to a certified voting system .
( The hearing report , along with more information about the case against ES&S , is available at the Secretary of State 's web site . )
In a statement released today , Bowen said that " ES&S ignored the law over and over and over again , and it got caught .
California law is very clear on this issue .
I am not going to stand on the sidelines and watch a voting system vendor come into this state , ignore the laws , and make millions of dollars from California 's taxpayers in the process . "
ES&S released a statement on their web site in response to Bowen 's suit , claiming ( among other things ) that " the limited modifications made to the AutoMARK 's hardware were extremely minor . "
Bowen 's response to the statement in a telephone conference was picked up by the San Francisco Chronicle : " Changes ... must be submitted to the secretary of state before a voting machine can be sold or used in California , " she said .
" California law does n't ask the manufacturer to decide whether the changes are small or large or medium - size . "
DES MOINES , Iowa ( Reuters ) - The Democratic White House contenders on Tuesday criticized front - runner Hillary Clinton ’s support of a get - tough resolution on Iran , saying it aided President George W. Bush in a reckless march toward war .
Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) sits alongside former Senator Mike Gravel ( D - AK ) and Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) at a Democratic Party Debate conducted on National Public Radio in Des Moines , Iowa , December 4 , 2007 .

In a debate in Iowa , Clinton ’s rivals questioned her Senate vote earlier this year to declare an Iranian military unit a terrorist group and ridiculed her claim it was aimed to bolster an aggressive diplomatic approach .
“ Declaring a military group sponsored by the state of Iran a terrorist organization , that ’s supposed to be diplomacy ? ” asked John Edwards , a former North Carolina senator .
Clinton , a New York senator who leads national polls in the Democratic White House race and is locked in a tight three - way struggle in Iowa with Edwards and Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , said the resolution had led to some positive changes in Iran .
“ I understand politics , and I understand making outlandish political charges , but this really goes way too far , ” she told Edwards .
“ If we thought that anything in that resolution gave even a pretense of legitimacy to President Bush taking any action , we would n’t have voted that way , ” she said .
The exchange came one day after a national intelligence report said Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
Clinton and all of the Democrats condemned Bush ’s claim on Tuesday that Tehran remained dangerous and nothing had changed despite the report .
“ It is absolutely clear that this administration and President Bush continue to not let facts get in the way of his ideology , ” Obama said .
“ And that ’s been the problem with their foreign policy generally . ”
The debate , the second in four days in Iowa , was broadcast on National Public Radio and came as the race intensified ahead of the January 3 contest that opens the state - by - state battle to choose candidates for the November 2008 general election .
Clinton was the only senator in the race to support the Iranian resolution .
Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden and Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd opposed it , and Obama did not vote because he was campaigning .
A REAL DIVISION
“ We have a real division here .
I mean , among the Democratic candidates , there ’s only one that voted for this resolution .
And this is exactly what Bush and Cheney wanted , ” Edwards said .
Obama renewed his criticism of Clinton ’s vote , one day after she questioned his political courage for skipping it .
“ What I ’ve been consistent about was that this saber - rattling was a repetition of Iraq , a war I opposed , and that we needed to oppose George Bush again .
We ca n’t keep on giving him the benefit of the doubt , knowing the ways in which they manipulate intelligence , ” Obama said .
Biden said the Senate vote and Bush ’s subsequent declaration that the Iranian military unit was a terrorist group had been disastrous .
“ The moment that declaration was made , oil prices jumped over $ 18 a barrel .
The moment that declaration was made , every one of our friends , from Iraq to Pakistan , felt they had to distance themselves from us because it appears to be a war on Islam , ” Biden said .
Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , who was at a funeral , was the only Democratic contender not to attend .
While the candidates disagreed sharply on Iran , the rest of the two - hour debate focusing on China and immigration featured little of the contentious tone of earlier debates and recent campaign - trail rhetoric .
The Democrats all criticized Bush ’s leadership in dealing with the growing economic power of China and the rising U.S. trade deficits with the Asian giant .
Edwards said that would be one of the toughest problems for the next president .
“ We have not held China accountable , and the result is the loss of American jobs , the struggling of American families , the struggles of the middle class , ” Edwards said .
It was the second recent radio - only debate in a White House race , following one by the Democratic contenders in 2004 .
That was the first on radio alone since Republican primary candidates Harold Stassen and Thomas Dewey met in 1948 .
The candidates sat in a small , private room at a V - shaped table facing three moderators , with no audience .
Sponsors said the idea was to remove television cameras and allow candidates and voters to concentrate on substance .

That Same Old Problem of Religion in Politics : Mitt Romney , Mormonism , and the
White House
By : Robin A. Hardy
Historically America has been divided on whether it approves of the influence of religion in politics .
Competing and even contradictory messages existed from the beginning making it no surprise that over two centuries later the electorate remains confused as to whether the two should be co-mingled .
On one hand early Americans were proud of the fact that they no longer were beholden to the dictates of ecclesiastics characteristic of their European roots and yet the founding fathers not only employed religious rhetoric in political documents , but also in many respects viewed their new nation as a manifestation of divine will .
This essay will discuss the American landscape regarding religion in politics and more specifically , the debate over the Mormon , Mitt Romney ’s bid for the presidency in 2008 .
Thomas Jefferson ’s political theories were shaped not only by a Deist faith but also by the Enlightenment which challenged traditional assumptions of the King as the de facto extension of heaven on earth , characteristic of absolutist rule in early modern Europe .
Kenneth Thompson contends Jefferson was an optimist in that the statesman saw the American experiment as a new beginning – a challenge to old ways of government . [ i ]
Americans were proud of the fact that they were no longer subject to King or Pope .
Describing the United States in the 1780s , the Frenchman , John de Crevecoeur claimed that Americans were not aristocrats , they wanted “… no courts , no kings , no bishops , no ecclesiastical dominion … [ they ] have no princes for whom [ they ] toil , starve and bleed ; [ they ] are the most perfect society now existing in the world . ” [ ii ]
But while early Americans were aware of the perils associated with a strong connection between church and state , they nevertheless brought God into political discourse .
They saw their new country as the American Zion , “ a City on a Hill , beckoning to all mankind to follow . ” [ iii ]
Indeed , the eighteenth - century Founding Fathers brought religion into their writings , The Declaration of Independence yet remains one of the most illustrative examples with explicit references to God - maintaining that “ all men are created equal … endowed by their Creator , with certain unalienable Rights … ” [ iv ] thereby staking their claim towards political independence in religious terms .
And time did not dissipate this trend .
Almost one hundred years after the founding of the nation , Abraham Lincoln ’s leadership was significantly influenced by his religious beliefs .
Stewart Winger contends that for Lincoln religion was an integral aspect of his being , bound to take part in the political leader ’s life beyond chapel walls .
In this regard Lincoln ’s family significantly affected the President ; the American leader ’s father was a Separatist Baptist who believed in a powerful providence where humans were endowed with great responsibility , leaving little doubt that Lincoln ’s policies were substantially informed by his religious upbringing .
So much so states Winger , that “ Lincoln could not have supported the country if it [ had ] abandoned its moral commitments . ” [ v ]
But while the early United States had as one of its goals to distance itself from an authoritarian past - in part characterized by religion as a central element of state dominance , it nevertheless perpetuated the inclusion of religion in the political arena .
Yet when religion manages to work its way into the political environment , what are the key issues which concern those who object to its inclusion ?
To begin with , Martin E. Marty suggests that religion can substantially alter policy , underscoring the idea that politicians and their spiritual beliefs are inextricably linked .
And he argues that some issues are more likely to interest religious candidates .
According to Marty , “ whether our military actions should be for humanitarian purposes or not cannot be debated without addressing the religious question , because all the religious groups say that the humanitarian side must be considered . ” [ vi ]
And yet military action is not the only hot button for religious politicians and their constituents .
Marty notes that international human rights and international trade are also concerns for many religious politicians [ vii ] and therefore can be added to the highly - charged list of abortion , gay marriage , capital punishment , the environment as well as gender and racial questions .
He further argues that “ [ r] eligion is not an issue in itself .
Rather , it hitchhikes on issues .
It barnacles to issues .
It subverts issues .
It is a penumbra around issues .
It is part of a constituency on all sides of all issues . ” [ viii ]
To be sure , modern Americans continue to grapple with the issue of religion in politics .
John F. Kennedy ’s campaign in the 1960s clearly demonstrates this fact .
Religious leaders such as Norman Vincent Peale and Billy Graham argued at the time that if the Catholic John F. Kennedy were elected President , his religion raised the question of his loyalty to the Pope over that of the American Constitution and Congress .
But while Americans ultimately reconciled themselves with Kennedy ’s spiritual beliefs following his famed 1960 speech in Texas - where the candidate assured voters of his intention to keep his private religious beliefs separate from politics , their concern over religion in the political realm never went away .
To wit , Jimmy Carter in the 1970s and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s both made claims to being strong Christians as part of their campaigns for the oval office .
However , in contrast to the 1960 campaign where Kennedy ’s goal was to demonstrate a clear division between Catholicism and politics , both Carter and Reagan wanted the American public to clearly connect them with mainstream Christianity .
Therefore rather than their religious beliefs being a deterrent to voters , their spiritual commitments were perceived by many Americans as a reason to support their candidacies .
Despite an ideal by the Founding Fathers to separate church and state , almost 250 years later many Americans still closely scrutinize political candidates ’ religious beliefs .
Indeed , 2007 - 2008 reveals a heavily contested run for the office of president – where already in the early stages of the campaign the issue of religion has again resurfaced front and center .
Joan Lowy , of The Associated Press , argues that “ the personal faith of candidates has become a very public part of the 2008 presidential campaign . ” [ ix ]
She notes that this trend takes its most recent nod from George W. Bush ’s campaign in 2001 , where he made “ a direct appeal to conservative religious voters – [ citing ] Jesus Christ as his favorite philosopher during one debate . ” [ x ]
And further , she contends that now “ all the leading presidential candidates are discussing religious and moral beliefs , even when they ’d rather not . ” [ xi ]
The 07-08 campaign ’s most controversial religious candidate is without question the former governor of Massachusetts , Mitt Romney - son of Michigan ’s former governor and presidential candidate in the 1960s , George Romney .
Noteworthy however is the fact that Romney ’s father ’s presidential bid was not hampered by the level of religious scrutiny characteristic of his son ’s campaign .
Indeed , both George and Mitt Romney are Mormons – members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .
And the younger Mitt Romney has been the least willing of the current presidential candidates to discuss his spiritual beliefs .
Romney is proving to be the “ wild card ” for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination .
Notwithstanding relative obscurity , Romney ’s bid for the White House has garnered widespread attention ; he has quickly raised millions of dollars , dresses impeccably , speaks smoothly , and seems to look the part of a world leader .
But while Americans are in the process of learning more about Mr. Romney they are also finding out more about Mormonism .
Romney ’s religion has thus created more questions for the electorate regarding how a candidate ’s faith may affect his role as an American leader .

How do you know that you ’re unhappy at work ?
That something is not right and that it ’s time to either make some changes at work or move on to a new job ?
In my work , I talk to a lot of people who are not happy with their jobs .
Here are the top ten symptoms of unhappiness at work that I ’ve observed .
How many apply to you ?
1 : You procrastinate
You really , honestly try to get some work done .
But somehow you never really get around to it .
Or you only do it at the last possible moment and then only do a half - baked effort .
Many people view procrastination as a personal weakness .
To me , it ’s one of the strongest warning signs of unhappiness at work .
2 : You spend Sunday night worrying about Monday morning
“ I never sleep on Sunday night very well because I m worried about going to work on Monday morning .
My job is very stressful and you kind of have to gear up for Monday and getting back into that . ” ( source )
One of the worst things about being unhappy at work is that the unhappiness bleeds over into your free time .
If you ’ve had a lousy day at work , it ’s difficult to go home and have a great evening .
If your week sucked , it ’s hard to have a fun , relaxed , carefree weekend .
3 : You ’re really competitive about salary and titles
You do n’t like the job itself , so you focus much more on salary and perks .
Knowing that someone in a similar position is paid more than you , or is promoted when you ’re not , really eats at you .
When we ’re unhappy at work we get a lot more competitive , for one simple reason :
When work does n’t give us happiness and enjoyment we want to get something else out of it .
And what else is there but compensation and promotions .
4 : You do n’t feel like helping co-workers
Your colleagues may be struggling .
But you do n’t really feel like lending a hand .
Why should you ?
One very interesting psychological study started by putting subjects in either a good mood or a bad mood .
They were then asked to go down the hall to another room where the experiment would continue .
In the hallway the real experiment took place – the subjects passed a man holding a big box struggling to open a door .
Would the subject help that person ?
The experiment showed , that when we ’re in a bad mood , we ’re much less likely to help others .
5 : Work days feel looooong
The first thing you do in the morning , is calculate the number of hours until you can go home .
Ironically , this makes the work day feel even longer .
6 : You have no friends at work
Friends at work ?
They ’re mostly all jerks anyway .
Gallup have found in their studies of workplace engagement , that one of the strongest factors that predict happiness at work is having at least one close friend at work .
7 : You do n’t care .
About anything .
Things can go well or they can go badly for your workplace .
Either way , you do n’t really give a damn .
When you ’re unhappy , you care mostly about yourself and not so much about the workplace .
8 : Small things bug you
Small annoyances bug you out of all proportion .
Like someone taking up too much space in the parking lot , someone taking the last coffee without brewing a new pot or someone talking too loudly in the next cubicle .
When you ’re unhappy you have much thinner skin and a shorter fuse .
It takes a lot less to annoy you .
9 : You ’re suspicious of other people ’s motives
No matter what people do , your fist thought is “ what are they up to ? ”
Good or bad , big or small , all decisions and actions made by your co-workers and managers are seen in this light .
Studies show that we ’re also more suspicious of others when we ’re unhappy .
10 : Physical symptoms
You suffer from insomnia , headaches , low energy , muscle tension and / or other physical symptoms .
Studies show that when you ’re unhappy at work you ’re more prone to experience these physical stress symptoms .
Your take
How many of these apply to you in your current job ?
Did I leave any important symptoms of workplace unhappiness out ?
Please write a comment .
I ’d really like to know your take !

Most of us wo n’t think twice about insuring a new car or applying for health insurance for ourselves and our families .
But what about homeowners insurance in Florida ?
Your home is almost certainly the greatest investment you have .
It ’s probably also your only investment that is filled with both your treasured possessions and your loved ones .
With tornados frequently lashing the American coastline and severe climate changes making wildfires more prevalent than ever , can you really afford not to invest in homeowner ’s insurance ?
A meagre monthly payment now may be the only thing keeping you and your family from homelessness later , should disaster strike .
Read on to learn more about why you need homeowners insurance in Florida .
Here are six reasons to invest in Florida Homeowners Insurance today :
1 ) Severe weather conditions
According to the NAIC ( National Association of Insurance Commissioners )
President , a recent survey found that an estimated 80 % of the nation has experienced violent weather events over the past six years .
In 2011 , weather related disasters incurred a damage bill in excess of $ 43 billion .
Whether or not you live in an area prone to hurricanes or other natural disasters , it ’s important to be prepared .
If you have an existing homeowner ’s insurance policy , make sure you ’re aware of what it does and does n’t cover .
According to https://floridainsurancequotes.net/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance-florida/ hurricane insurance in Florida is really important .
2 ) Liability
Believe it or not , you ’re responsible for accidents or loss of property that occur on your property , whether you ’re present or not .
Imagine your teenage daughter has friends over while you ’re out of town .
One of those friends has been drinking and falls over , cracking her head on the stairs .
Her wound requires a trip the emergency room and a number of stitches .
More than likely , you ’ll be expected to foot the medical bill .
The same applies if your mail man slips on your front step or your gardener trips over the hose .
Some liability policies go a step further and protect you against accidents that occur outside of your property .
For example , if your child accidentally breaks a window at school while playing tennis .
Consult your potential FL insurer to find out how comprehensive your policy is and what type of policy would best suit the requirements of your family .
3 ) Theft
There are few things more frightening than home invasion .
One of those things is realising that none of your most valuable possessions are insured .
Do n’t let this happen to your family !
Move on from the trauma of being robbed more quickly by ensuring that your property and possessions are insured .
A word to the wise : in case of burglary or other sustained damages , make sure that you have an up to date home inventory to show your insurers .
More than half of insured Americans do n’t have an inventory of their possessions .
Why ?
This time consuming process involves photographing your valuables , making a detailed list of them and keeping their receipts in a safe spot .
Doing this now may seem tedious but it will save you a world of time and heart ache later .
4 ) Loss of Use
Suppose the unthinkable happens and severe weather damages ( think falling trees or roof damage ) your house to the point that you must seek temporary accommodation .
A good , standard homeowner ’s insurance policy will pay your relocation costs .
This means reimbursing you for a hotel stay , meals , and other related expenses until you ’re back in your own home .
Generally speaking , you can expect your insurance company to pay up to 20 % of your coverage price for this .
For example , if your house is insured for $ 100 , 000 , you will be entitled to approximately $ 20,000 in loss of use funds .
5 ) Satisfy mortgage lender conditions
If you ’re paying off a mortgage , your mortgage lender may insist that you have homeowner ’s insurance .
Why ?
So they can guarantee the safety of their assets .
If you do not have your own homeowner ’s insurance policy , your lender may insist you settle for forced coverage policy .
Do not do this .
Not only are these policies incredibly expensive , but they also only cover losses to your mortgage company , without protecting you or your family from hardships .
6 ) Peace of mind
If the expression “ your home is your castle ” is true , not investing in home insurance is rather a lot like lowering the drawbridge for all your enemies to storm in .
Most hard - working Americans have spent years paying off their houses with demanding 9 - to - 5 jobs .
They deserve to enjoy the fruits of their labors with peace of mind .
Home owner ’s insurance can provide that , and let you focus on things that really matter , such as your health and your family .
Remember , your home is the largest and most important investment you have .
These six reasons you need Florida homeowners insurance from here is just the tip of the iceberg .
Do n’t put yourself and your family at risk for even a day longer .
Talk to a trusted local insurance company today for complete peace of mind .
Look , I know it 's nice to keep things simple by making 100 EXP = one level up every time .
I get that .
And I know Jeanne is n't the first liberal mollycoddler to indulge experience points for inflicting a flesh wound on an enemy or healing yourself , but come on .
Where 's the EXP AWARD = EXP AWARD / CHARACTER LEVEL modifier ?
If I can't start leveling slower why can't my enemies start leveling faster ?
It 's cool for characters to be chemically imbalanced , but when it comes to the game itself a little Stoichiometry is in order .
Cause I tried - I really tried - to keep the spice in our romance .
I never ran around behind your back for any " free battles . "
I even gave up drinking ... augmentative potions ...
But when I 'd turn off the lights , climb into bed and pull you close it was like you were n't even there .
Friends and family clucked over our troubles , " In this stage , at your age , it should be easy .
The hard part comes later .
" And oh how I longed for the hard part !
But later , and later , and 24 hours and 33 minutes later , still you would n't commit .
We fought about it but you 'd just roll over .
Let me win , like you did n't care .
So now I 'm back at the blackboard , a free radical .
Time may build new bonds , but it wo n't answer the question I fear I 'll never figure out :
At the core of every RPG is a numbers game .
So why can't any do the math ?

It 's called the " Pharox " lightbulb and it gives consumers another way to reduce their carbon footprint via this new LED lighting technology .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
The Lemnis Pharox bulb is the first LED - based light to offer the warm , soft white light quality comparable to that of a traditional 40 W light bulb while using no mercury , so they are recyclable , unlike CFL bulbs .
Additionally , on an annual basis the Pharox bulb emits 90 percent fewer emissions than a traditional incandescent bulb , and is compatible with standard fittings .
The Pharox bulb is as energy efficient as a fluorescent bulb , and over its significantly longer lifetime -- up to 50,000 hours or approximately 35 years -- it creates significantly lower carbon emissions .
Lighting uses 19 percent of worldwide energy consumption .
Reducing energy consumption by using LEDs will significantly reduce the level of CO2 emissions , therefore impacting climate change .
Lemnis seeks to diminish climate change through , among other efforts , use of technologically advanced LED lightbulbs .
" The Pharox LED bulb is this year 's must - have item for anyone going green .
Even switching one bulb to a Pharox can help reduce your carbon footprint and create cost savings over CFL or traditional bulbs , " said Frans Otten , chairman of Lemnis Lighting .
" The Pharox bulb saves on energy cost over its lifespan to ultimately cost less than a traditional incandescent bulb . "
The new Pharox bulb , is available in the United States at Upscale Lighting ( http://www.upscalelighting.com/).
About Lemnis Lighting
Based in The Netherlands and San Francisco , Lemnis was launched in 2005 as a joint - venture between Gemex Consultancy BV and Tendris Holding BV .
Built upon the core mission of energy efficiency , Lemnis brings LED enhanced lighting -- the future of lighting technology -- to homes , offices and cities to significantly reduce carbon footprint .
Lemnis Lighting was founded by two great - grandsons of Anton Philips , the founder of Philips Electronics .

Bow your heads and raise the white flags .
After facing down the Third Reich , the Japanese Empire , the U.S.S.R. , Manuel Noriega and Saddam Hussein , the United States has met an enemy it dares not confront – the American private health insurance industry .
With the courageous exception of Dennis Kucinich , the Democratic candidates have all rolled out health “ reform ” plans that represent total , Chamberlain - like , appeasement .
Edwards and Obama propose universal health insurance plans that would in no way ease the death grip of Aetna , Unicare , MetLife , and the rest of the evil - doers .
Clinton – why are we not surprised ?
– has gone even further , borrowing the Republican idea of actually feeding the private insurers by making it mandatory to buy their product .
Will I be arrested if I resist paying $ 10,000 a year for a private policy laden with killer co-pays and deductibles ?
It ’s not only the Democratic candidates who are capitulating .
The surrender - buzz is everywhere .
I heard it from a notable liberal political scientist on a panel in August :
We ca n’t just leap to a single payer system , he said in so many words , because it would be too disruptive , given the size of the private health insurance industry .
Then I heard it yesterday from a Chicago woman who leads a nonprofit agency serving the poor :
How can we go to a Canadian - style system when the private industry has gotten so “ big ” ?
Yes , it is big .
Leighton Ku , at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities , gave me the figure of $ 776 billion in expenditures on private health insurance for this year .
It ’s also a big - time employer , paying what economist Paul Krugman has estimated two to three million people just turn down claims .
This in turn generates ever more employment in doctors ’ offices to battle the insurance companies .
Dr. Atul Gawande , a practicing physician , wrote in The New Yorker that ''a well - run office can get the insurer 's rejection rate down from 30 percent to , say , 15 percent .
That ’s how a doctor makes money .
It 's a war with insurance , every step of the way . ''
And that ’s another thing your insurance premium has to pay for : the ongoing “ war ” between doctors and insurers .
Note :
The private health insurance industry is not big because it relentlessly seeks out new customers .
Unlike any other industry , this one grows by rejecting customers .
No matter how shabby you look , Cartier , Lexus , or Nordstrom ’s will happily take your money .
Not Aetna .
If you have a prior conviction – excuse me , a pre-existing condition – it does n’t want your business .
Private health insurance is only for people who are n’t likely to ever get sick .
In fact , why call it “ insurance , ” which normally embodies the notion of risk - sharing ?
This is extortion .
Think of the damage .
An estimated 18,000 Americans die every year because they can’t afford or can’t qualify for health insurance .
That ’s the 9/11 carnage multiplied by three -- every year .
Not to mention all the people who are stuck in jobs they hate because they do n’t dare lose their current insurance .
Saddam Hussein never killed 18,000 Americans or anything close ; nor did the U.S.S.R .
Yet we faced down those “ enemies ” with huge patriotic bluster , vast military expenditures , and , in the case of Saddam , armed intervention .
So why does the U.S. soil its pants and cower in fear when confronted with the insurance industry ?
Here ’s a plan : First , locate the major companies .
No major intelligence effort will be required , since Google should suffice .
Second , estimate their armed strength .
No doubt there are legions of security guards involved in protecting the company headquarters from irate consumers , but these should be manageable with a few brigades .
Next , consider an air strike , followed by an infantry assault .
And what about the two to three million insurance industry employees whose sole job it is to turn down claims ?
Well , I have a plan for them :
It ’s called unemployment .
What country in its right mind would pay millions of people to deny other people health care ?
I ’m not mean , though .
If we had the kind of universal , single - payer , health insurance Kucinich is advocating , private health insurance workers would continue to be covered even after they are laid off .
As for the health insurance company executives , there should be an adequate job training program for them – perhaps as home health aides .
Fellow citizens , where is the old macho spirit that has sustained us through countless conflicts against enemies both real and imagined ?
In the case of health care , we have identified the enemy , and the time has come to crush it .
WASHINGTON , Aug. 30 — The Bush administration is signaling that it plans to turn again to a legal tool , the “ state secrets ” privilege , to try to stop a suit against a Belgian banking cooperative that secretly supplied millions of private financial records to the United States government , court documents show .
The suit against the consortium , known as Swift , threatens to disrupt the operations of a vital national security program and to disclose “ highly classified information ” if it continues , the Justice Department has said in court filings .
A hearing on the suit is scheduled for Friday in federal court in Alexandria , Va .
The “ state secrets ” privilege , allowing the government to shut down litigation on national security grounds , was once rarely used .
The Bush administration has turned to it more than 30 times in terrorism - related cases , seeking to end public discussion of cases like the claims of an F.B.I. whistle - blower and the abduction of a German terrorism suspect .
Most notably , the administration has sought to use the privilege to kill numerous suits against telecommunications carriers over the National Security Agency ’s eavesdropping program .

Is Blackwater ‘ Fire Relief ’ Part of Larger PR Campaign to Win Hearts and Minds and Timed to Influence Local Voters ?
Potrero Residents / Fire Victims Speak - Out in Wake of Up Coming Recall Election - Referendum Could Put End to Blackwater West Project– Deadline to Mail Ballots to Voters in Just Two Weeks
Conflict of Interest Questions Raised as Mercenary VP Allowed Through Sheriff ’s Blockade With Supplies While Community - Based Relief Efforts for Potrero and Immigrant Residents of Surrounding Area Were Thwarted or Delayed
EAST SAN DIEGO COUNTY , CA ( Nov. 1 ) – – Earlier this week , just a few miles from the US / Mexico border , nearly 350 residents of the small rural town of Potrero , near the proposed site of the Blackwater West training camp , were trapped by the Harris / Potrero Fire suffering from lack of power , fuel , food and relief supplies .
It was Blackwater VP Brian Bonfiglio , aided by local politicians , who was able to get through the sheriff ’s blockade to enter area and hand out supplies and Blackwater - logo pins to hungry and newly homeless residents from the back of his white Hummer , all while community - based relief efforts were thwarted and delayed by local law enforcement .
Potrero residents ' battle against Blackwater ’s plans for a mercenary training camp include a recent large protest and an upcoming recall election for members of their local Community Planning Group who initially greenlighted the project .
They put aside their differences aside momentarily .
“ I do n't care if Hitler came out of his grave and donated stuff to us , we 'd take it , ” Thell Fowler told the San Diego Union Tribune .
“ While no one in distress can be faulted for accepting help from any source , Blackwater has a clear conflict of interest , ” said Carol Jahnkow , Executive Director , Peace Resource Center of San Diego and a co-organizer of last month ’s Stop Blackwater West rally .
“ Blackwater is among the many corporations providing relief aid , but they are the only ones with a critical issue on the table that will be voted on this month , both by the citizens of Potrero in their recall vote of the Planning Board , and also by the County Board of Supervisors on their land use permit application . ”
" We need to keep in mind that this is a self - serving move by a corporation with millions of dollars at their disposal to buy votes through the influence of money , " said Carl Meyer , a Potrero resident , running to replace Gordon Hammers on the Potrero Community Planning Group .
“ Locals will hopefully see through this disaster capitalism .
When we talk to people door - to - door it does not seem to change their minds about Blackwater — they see right through this . "
" I did not need to accept any relief supplies , but if I did , I would take it , even from Blackwater , but it would not change my vote , " said Helen Kramer , Potrero resident who was evacuated but did not lose her home .
" The fact that they were working to supply relief and curry favor does not change the fact that their project is wrong for this area . ”
According to Adrian Del Rio , a volunteer from one of the many community groups attempting to bring in aid and relief supplies to Potrero , a sheriff - who has spoken publicly in support of Blackwater West Project - tried to prohibit their caravan from entering Portrero , asking , “ Why do you need to go to Potrero ?
There are not too many people – just a bunch of drug addicts . ”
His assistant added , “ They received burritos and sandwiches yesterday . ”
CitizensOversight.org discovered that relief supplies were in fact available , but they just were n’t getting into Potrero .
“ We plan to investigate to find out why Blackwater was the only option for relief supplies , ” said Raymond Lutz , Citizens ’ Oversight coordinator .
“ It ’s not appropriate for local politicians to allow this sort of activity just weeks before the recall ballots go out on November 13th , for an election which is becoming a referendum on the Blackwater West project . ”
Lutz and fellow volunteers delivered about eight tons of food and supplies to Potrero using a U - Haul moving van after locating surplus relief supplies at the Escondido Church of Christ disaster response warehouse .
State Sen. Dennis Hollingsworth ( R - 36th District ) announced today that Blackwater Worldwide is setting up a “ tent city ” in nearby Barrett Junction to provide lodging for up to 200 displaced residents .
“ This is wrong .
Where is FEMA and National Guard ?
Is n’t this a task that they should be organizing ? ” Lutz said .
Many of the residents that will be voting on the upcoming election related to the Blackwater West project may be directed to stay in Blackwater ’s tent city .
Five of the six members of the Potrero Community Planning Group facing recall on December 11th - are proponents of the Blackwater West project .
Jan Hedlun , the only member against the project , is not facing recall .
If the community votes to recall all the proponents , this would send a clear message that the community is solidly against the project .
In the weeks before the fire , after hiring Burson - Marsteller , a publicly - traded global public affairs firm , Blackwater ’s CEO Erik Prince has been prominently featured in a media blitz of national press , including The Washington Post , Newsweek , and CBS ’ " 60 Minutes . "
A week ago , Blackwater sent out a letter asking Blackwater “ family ” to write letters to elected officials supporting the company , and in the wake of the first protest outside Blackwater ’s headquarters in North Carolina , reportedly a secretive meeting has been held in attempt to appease local community members .
The Harris Ranch Fire started on October 21 at Harris Ranch Road and Highway 94 in Portrero in San Diego County and destroyed 211 homes and 262 outbuildings , burning 90,440 acres .
The first fatality of the fire occurred in the area , and four firefighters were caught in in the raging firestorm .
The cause of the fire is still under investigation .

TITLE AUTHOR DATE Disaster Capitalism = The Fox answering the Distress Call of the Rabbit Disaster Capitalism = The Fox & the Rabbit Saturday , Nov. 03 , 2007 at 3:15 AM
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Bush administration on Monday asked Congress for nearly $ 46 billion in additional war spending for 2008 , calling on U.S. lawmakers to approve the money before adjourning for the holidays .
President Bush says Monday he is requesting billions more for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Parts of this war are complicated , but one part is not -- and that is that America should do what it takes to support our troops and protect our people , " Bush said in an appearance with members of veterans groups at the White House .
Most of the $ 45.9 billion request is for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , bringing the expected cost of those conflicts to more than $ 192 billion for the budget year that began this month .
The administration has already sought $ 147 billion for 2008 .
Most of that money goes to Iraq , which is currently costing the Pentagon an estimated $ 2 billion a week .
Bush said the money will cover basic operating expenses , plus additional armored vehicles and countermeasures designed to protect U.S. troops from roadside bombs .
" Congress should not go home for the holidays while our troops are still waiting for the funds they need , " he said .
The president also called on Congress to finish the appropriations bills that fund the Pentagon and Department of Veterans Affairs before lawmakers ' holiday recess , set to begin in mid-November .
Watch how much money is really at stake »
The request is bound to kick off another debate on Capitol Hill over the course of the Iraq war .
Bush 's last supplemental spending request led to a showdown with the Democratic leaders of Congress , who pushed for a withdrawal of American combat troops in 2008 -- a demand dropped after the president vetoed the measure .
Minutes after Bush spoke , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , warned the president not to expect Congress to " rubber - stamp " the latest request .
" In the coming weeks , we will hold it up to the light of day and fight for the change of strategy and redeployment of troops that is long overdue , " Reid said .
He said the new request means the overall cost of the widely unpopular war now approaches $ 650 billion since the March 2003 invasion that toppled Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein .
" The entire war in Iraq is being paid for with borrowed money , " Reid said .
He contrasted the Iraqi funding with Bush 's October 3 veto of a $ 60 billion children 's health care bill that had bipartisan support and would have been paid for by an increase in cigarette taxes .
Bush called the bill too expensive and a step toward government - provided health care .
" It 's no wonder the American people are frustrated , " Reid said .
" We 've been fighting for America 's priorities , while the president continues investing only in his failed war strategy .
He wants us to come up with another $ 200 billion and just sign off on it -- that 's what he said today . "
The administration made the initial supplement request , which lawmakers have yet to approve , in February .
The original request submitted to Congress for $ 141.7 billion was followed by a $ 5.3 billion request to fund the purchase of more armored vehicles .
Both of those requests total $ 147 billion .
The latest request would cover more armored vehicles and repair of existing equipment that can be returned to the field , Pentagon officials said .
In addition to daily operations , the White House said the latest supplemental would fund about $ 1.7 billion in new spending on veterans ' health care , $ 1 billion for military construction projects in Iraq and Afghanistan and another $ 1 billion for training Iraqi soldiers and police .

オープンソース のWebアプリケーション開発フレームワークの最新版「 Ruby on Rails 2.0」がリリースされた。同フレームワークの開発者であるデビッド・ハイネメイヤー・ハンソン（David Heinemeier Hansson）氏が12月7日午前（現地時間）に明らかにしたもの。
新版の特徴は 、SOAP Webサービスに代えてREST
（Representational State Transfer ）Webサービスの利用に重点が置かれたこと。また、セキュリティなど各種機能の強化も図られている。オブジェクト指向のスクリプト言語「Ruby」をベースとする同フレームワークは、開発プロジェクトのWebサイトからダウンロードできる。
Hansson氏は 、Ruby on Rails 2.0の開発にあたり、「RESTの考え方と、RESTフルなアプリケーションの構築法を推進することに重点を置いた」と述べている。
同氏は、 「 以前 のRuby on Railsは 、SOAP Webサービスを使用するライブラリとともに提供されていた。だが、われわれはこのライブラリに見切りをつけ、代わりにREST

「 現在では 、SOAPよりもRESTのほうが好まれている」とHansson氏は指摘する。また、同氏によると、アジャイル開発者は、SOAPは関連するWS-*標準が多数に上り、複雑になりすぎていると感じているという。WS-SecurityなどをはじめとするWS-*標準は、Microsoftなどの企業が推進しているが、「控えめに言っても、こうした標準を使うと、何事もシンプルに進まない」とHansson氏は述べている。
加えて同氏は、 「 われわれは 、SOAP は複雑化しすぎていると感じている。この技術は大企業の人々が主導権を握っているが、そうなると大抵いいことはない。それに対してRESTは、HTTPやプレーンなXMLなど、Webの基本的な標準に基づいている」と主張している。

また 、Atomフィードのテスト・サポートや配信機能の強化によって、「アプリケーションでのフィード配信が非常に簡単になっている。これはアプリケーションの更新を行う際に大いに役立つ」（Hansson氏）としている
さらに 、Ruby on Rails 2.0では、「 ActiveResource」という新たなコンポーネントが提供される。これは、Webサービスをカプセル化し、データベースのように簡単に利用できるようにするものだ。「ActiveResourceは、旧バージョンのRuby on Railsで提供していた、データベース呼び出しのカプセル化を支援するActiveRecord機能と似ている」とHansson氏は説明している。

In the video attorneys explain how they assist employers in running classified ads with the goal of NOT finding any qualified applicants , and how they disqualify even the most qualified Americans in order to secure green cards for H - 1b workers .
Our goal is clearly NOT to find a qualified U.S. worker ... our objective is to get this person a green card ... so certainly we are not going to try to find a place where applicants would be most numerous .
- Lawrence M. Lebowitz , Vice President of Marketing , Cohen & Grigsby
And on getting rid of extremely qualified applicants :
If someone looks like they are very qualified , if necessary schedule an interview , go through the whole process to find a legal basis to disqualify them
From Dr. Norm Matloff :
The law on employer - sponsored green cards is similarly riddled with loopholes .
Though that law requires that American workers must be sought before the employer hires a foreign worker for a job , it is routinely circumvented .
I 've mentioned the outrageous comments by a well - known immigration attorney : Employers who favor aliens have an arsenal of legal means to reject all U.S. workers who apply -- Joel Stewart , Legal Rejection of U.S. Workers , Immigration Daily , April 24 ,
2000 .
Here are just a few examples of fake job ads this seminar is referring to , run in the Sacramento Bee .
The Bee ’s editor refuses to discuss the matter , and the fraudulent ads continue to run each week
This video was amplified by the Programmers Guild and the original video clips are here .
This is what Bush and Congress via the current " comprehensive " immigration reform bill really mean by a " shortage of skilled U.S. workers . "
Microsoft , Oracle , Hewlett - Packard , and thousands of other companies are running fake ads in Sunday newspapers across the country each week .
Look at this folks , this is how bad it is .
A major selling point of law firms is all about how to screw over the American worker .
UPDATE : 06.18.07 4 pm EST .
It appears Cohen & Grigsby Law Firm has taken down their seminar videos .
What a surprise but you can see at one time the originals were there .
We can not put back up the originals for it 's unclear if that would be a violation of copyright law , but let me assure you , they exist .

The commission , by contrast , said that under that law , it could establish “ such reasonable exemptions ” as it might find “ necessary and proper in the public interest . ”
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit , in Philadelphia , upheld this claim in June , in the case filed by AARP , which has asked the Supreme Court to review the decision .
In its ruling , the appeals court said , “ We recognize with some dismay that the proposed exemption may allow employers to reduce health benefits to retirees over the age of 65 while maintaining greater benefits for younger retirees . ”
But the court said the commission had shown that the exemption was “ a reasonable , necessary and proper exercise ” of its authority .
Under the new rule , employers may , if they choose , provide retiree health benefits “ only to those retirees who are not yet eligible for Medicare . ”
Likewise , the rule says , retiree health benefits can be “ altered , reduced or eliminated ” when a retiree becomes eligible for Medicare .
Further , employers will be able to reduce or eliminate health benefits provided to the spouse or dependents of a retired worker 65 or over , regardless of whether benefits for the retiree are changed .
Employers and some unions contend that retirees under 65 have a greater need for employer - sponsored health benefits because they are generally not Medicare - eligible .
Large employers have often provided some health benefits to retirees 65 and older , to help cover costs not paid by Medicare .
But employers have for years been trying to reduce retiree benefits or to shift more of the cost to retirees .
Lawyers for the commission said the new Medicare drug benefit , now nearing the end of its second year , had strengthened the case for the regulation because it guaranteed that retirees 65 and older would have access to drug coverage .
Younger retirees have no such guarantee , so employers may want to provide drug coverage to them in particular , the lawyers said .
Helen Darling , president of the National Business Group on Health , which represents large employers , welcomed the rule .
We 've seen projectors used in multi- touch applications before -- most notably in Microsoft 's Surface -- but researchers at National Taiwan University have extended the concept by using two projectors at once .
The i-m-Top system allows high - resolution overlays to appear over the main display , which can cover a 47 - inch by 31 - inch surface .
NTU says that as soon as it lands a production partner , the $ 3000 system will be ready for market within six months , with costs expected to fall dramatically after that .

Let 's say you 're about to deploy an application .
Said app has been heavily tested by your development team , who have all been infected by unit testing fever .
It 's also been vetted by your QA group , who spent months spelunking into every crevice of the app .
You even had a beta test period with real live users , who dutifully filed bugs and put the application through its paces before finally signing off on the thing .
Your application is useful and popular .
Your users love it .
Your users love you .
But over the next week , something curious happens .
As people use the application , it gets progressively slower and slower .
Soon , the complaints start filtering in .
Within a few weeks , the app is well - neigh unusable due to all the insufferable delays it subjects users to – and your users turn on you .
Raise your hand if this has ever happened to a project you 've worked on .
If I had a buck for every time I 've personally seen this , I 'd have enough for a nice lunch date .
Developers test with tiny toy data sets , assume all is well , and then find out the hard way that everything is fast for small n .
I remember a client - side Javascript sort routine we implemented in a rich intranet web app circa 2002 .
It worked great on our small test datasets , but when we deployed it to production , we were astonished to find that sorting a measly hundred items could take upwards of 5 seconds on a user 's desktop machine .
JavaScript is n't known for its speed , but what the heck ?
Well , guess which sort algorithm we used ?
InsertSort is n2 ( worst case ) , ShellSort is n3/2 , and QuickSort is n log n .
But we could have done worse – we could have picked Bubble Sort , which is n2 even in the best case .
Friends , do not do this .
Test your applications with large data sets , at least large enough to cover your most optimistic usage projections over the next year .
Otherwise , you may be sorry .
And your users definitely will be sorry .
Big O notation is one of those things that 's easier seen than explained .
But it 's a fundamental building block of computer science .
Big O notation : A theoretical measure of the execution of an algorithm , usually the time or memory needed , given the problem size n , which is usually the number of items .
Informally , saying some equation f( n ) = O ( g(n ) ) means it is less than some constant multiple of g(n ) .
The notation is read , " f of n is big oh of g of n " .
Developers rely on data structures and databases that have favorable big O notation performance baked in , without thinking much about it .
But if you stray from those well - worn paths , you can be in a world of performance pain – and much sooner than you could have possibly imagined .
The importance of big O notation is best illustrated in this graph from Programming Pearls :
The TRS - 80 algorithm is 48n , and the DEC Alpha algorithm is n3 .
When n is 10 , they 're within a second of each other .
But when n grows to 100,000 , the modern DEC Alpha takes a month to do what a prehistoric TRS - 80 can accomplish in a few hours .
Having a big O notation bottleneck in your app is a one - way ticket in the performance wayback machine to 1997 – or worse .
Much worse .
There are friendly names for the common big O notations ; saying " n squared " is equivalent to saying " quadratic " :
notation friendly name O ( 1 ) constant O ( log n ) logarithmic O ( [ log n] c ) polylogarithmic O( n ) linear O( n log n ) sometimes called " linearithmic " or " supralinear " O ( n2 ) quadratic O( nc ) polynomial , sometimes " geometric " O( cn ) exponential O( n ! ) factorial
Tom Niemann has handy charts that compare the growth rates of common algorithms , which I 've adapted here :
n lg n n7/6 n lg n n2 7/6n n! 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 16 4 25 64 256 12 20.9 trillion 256 8 645 2,048 65,536 137 quadrillion - 4,096 12 16,384 49,152 16,777,216 - - 65,536 16

Here are sample execution times , assuming one unit of execution is equal to one millisecond of CPU time .
That 's probably far too much on today 's CPUs , but you get the idea :
n lg n n7/6 n lg n n2 7/6n n! 1 < 1 sec < 1 sec < 1 sec < 1 sec < 1 sec < 1 sec 16 < 1 sec < 1 sec < 1 sec < 1 sec < 1 sec 663 years 256 < 1 sec < 1 sec 2 sec 65 sec 4.3 mlln yrs - 4,096 < 1 sec 16 sec 49 sec 4.6 hr - - 65,536 < 1 sec 7 min 17 min 50 days - - 1,048,476 < 1 sec 3 hr 6 hr 35 years - - 16,775,616 < 1 sec 3 days 4.6 days 8,923 years - -
Notice how quickly we get into trouble as the number of items ( n ) increases .
Unless you 've chosen data structures that offer ideal near - logarithmic performance across the board , by the time you get to 4,096 items you 're talking about some serious CPU time .
Beyond that , I used dash as shorthand for " forever " .
That 's how bad it can get .
Everything is fast for small n .
Do n't fall into this trap .
It 's an easy enough mistake to make .
Modern apps are incredibly complex , with dozens of dependencies .
Neglect to index one little field in your database and you 're suddenly back in TRS - 80 land .
The only way to truly know if you 've accidentally slipped an algorithmic big O bottleneck into your app somewhere is to test it with a reasonably large volume of data .

The 11 Billion Dollar Bottle of Wine The Possibilities of Interstellar Trade
This article originally appeared in Ares nr. 12 ( Jan 1982 ) , a science fiction / gaming magazine published by SPI .
I was a contributing editor at the time .
Despite its age , it holds up quite well , I believe .
Given what scientists say about the probability of intelligent life in the galaxy , it seems almost inevitable that , sooner or later , we will come into contact with another technological species .
We can expect that the same kind of interrelationships which existed between primitive peoples on our planet will occur between the two species .
There are basically two ways which individuals or groups can interact -- peacefully and violently .
Peaceful interaction implies voluntary exchange between two groups which benefit both -- that is , trade .
Violent interaction implies the attempt by one group to coerce the other -- that is , war .
Much attention has been paid to the second possibility in the gaming field , but only recently has much been paid to the first .
The reason trade exists is that different groups are efficient at doing different things .
For example , let us say there are two countries , A and B .
A takes 15 man -hours to make a widget , but only 5 to make a thingummy .
B takes 5 to make a widget and 15 to make a thingummy .
Suppose each country produces as many thingummies as widgets , and each has 100 man-hours to allocate .
Each will then produce 5 thingummies and 5 widgets ( ( 5*15 ) + ( 5*5 ) = 75 + 25 = 100 man-hours ) .
If A and B now open trade , each may concentrate on producing the item which it produces more efficiently ; A will produce thingummies and B widgets .
Since a thingummy costs A 5 man-hours , it can produce 20 ; similarly , B produces 20 widgets .
They trade 10 thingummies for 10 widgets , since each wants as many thingummies as widgets .
The final result is that each country has 10 thingummies and 10 widgets and each is twice as well off as before .
( Indeed , trade is even in the best interest of both when one party has an efficiency advantage in both products , because trade will allow him to shift production into areas where his efficiency is greater . )
One problem not taken into account in the above analysis is the cost of transportation ( and other barrier costs , such as import and export duties ) which raise the cost of doing business with another group .
Let us say that it takes 5 man-hours to transfer a unit of widgets or thingummies from country A to country B or vice versa .
Each country will then have to allocate 10 man-hours to each unit of a good transported to the other country , and 5 to each unit consumed at home .
It is still more efficient for A to concentrate on making widgets and B on making thingummies .
However , the best A can do is to make 14 widgets ( 70 man- hours ) and transport 6 to B ( 30 man- hours ) while B does the reverse .
Each country is still better off engaging in trade than not , but not as well off as they would be if transportation were costless .
This is , of course , an extremely important result for interstellar trade because the costs of transporting anything over interstellar distances is bound to be high , even given some kind of faster - than - light ( FTL ) drive .
In essence , in order to make trade in a good worthwhile , the cost of creating a good in one location and transporting it to another must be less than the cost of creating it in that distant location .
To determine what interstellar trade ( if any ) is feasible , there are then two questions we must answer , at least in principle : 1. ) what are the costs of interstellar transportation , and 2 . ) what are the costs of production in a highly advanced civilization capable of interstellar trade ?
Neither question can be easily answered , but we can , at least , make some conjectures .
Costs
In the simple analysis above , we assumed that the cost of production or transportation could be measured in " man-hours . "
For any more sophisticated investigation , this is inappropriate .
An hour of a PhD 's time is worth considerably more than an hour of an unskilled laborer 's time .
Furthermore , such things as the relative efficiency of production machinery ( and other capital goods ) and the cost of resources cannot easily be measured in man-hours .
That is the primary reason why money exists -- because it is an easy tool to measure relative costs .
Extrapolating costs into the future is difficult or impossible because technology constantly advances -- changing both costs and relative costs -- population trends are not entirely predictable , and the cost of resources may change dramatically as terrestrial resources become scarcer and extraterrestrial resources begin to be exploited .
However , the cost of transportation is dependent on three primary factors : the cost of building and operating transport vessels , time , and energy required for transportation .
The first factor is very difficult to figure , but the second two are easily calculable , at least for sublight travel .
Given a particular transportation system , it is possible to calculate the amount of energy needed to move something from point x to point y in a given amount of time .
This will be discussed in more detail later .
Ignoring the cost of maintaining and building a transportation system , the amount of energy needed to transport a unit of mass is roughly proportional to the cost of transporting it .
Thus , the less energy transportation requires , the more likely trade can occur and the more commodities it is profitable to trade .
Time is also an important factor , because the longer it takes to transport a good , the further in advance an investor must put up his capital before he will see a return .
At sublight speeds , interstellar transportation will necessarily require between 10 and 10,000 years for a round trip .
In America , there are few companies who are willing to wait even 10 years for an investment to provide a return .
Government tends to think in even shorter terms ; the insistence of Congress on space programs which produce short - term return and its reluctance to engage in projects that may prove immensely profitable over a period of decades , but costly in the short - term , is an example of this thinking .
Quite apart from this psychological reluctance to think too far ahead is the very real economic cost of delayed return on investment .
When determining whether an endeavor will be profitable , an investor must keep " opportunity costs " in mind .
If an investor has a choice of two investments , both profitable , and chooses the one which is less profitable , he has , in real terms , lost money ; he could have made more by taking the more profitable investment .
If one can earn 17 % of one 's money in a money market fund , and investing in a small game company is likely to produce a profit of 10 % , there is no reason to invest in the company .
If , say , an investor can earn 10 % of his money per year by investing in his own planet , over a period of ten years he can increase his wealth by 160 % .
To be profitable , an interstellar trading voyage would have to generate more profit than this .
So the high time required for interstellar voyages result in high opportunity costs .
( In 100 years , at 10 % an investor would have increased his wealth by more than 15,000 times . )
High opportunity costs combined with high transportation costs make interstellar trade extremely ( though not necessarily prohibitively ) expensive .
Energy Costs of Sub -Light Travel
Many different interstellar propulsion systems have been proposed , and the energy required for each is different .
Since we want to encourage interstellar trade , it behooves us to make relatively optimistic assumptions .
In Ares nr. 1 , John Boardman investigated the times and costs in energy entailed in using an anti-matter drive capable of 100 percent conversion of energy into gamma rays , accelerating off reaction from such conversion .
It is possible to conceive of even less costly drives -- such as a ramscoop which gathers its reaction mass en route -- but Boardman 's drive is at least theoretically feasible while the ramscoop concept has some real technical problems .
The Boardman anti-matter drive can then be taken as the most optimistic drive for sublight transportation .
Boardman derived a formula to determine the mass ratio needed between the initial mass of a ship and the mass of the final payload ( see table below ) assuming the ship accelerated to a given speed , coasted at that speed , and decelerated to rest at its target .
He also derived a figure ( 5704 megawatt - years ) for the amount of energy required to produce a kilogram of anti-matter .
Combining these two , we can determine the amount of energy needed to accelerate a ship to a given speed and then decelerate to rest .
Evidently , the higher the " coasting " speed , the greater the initial investment and the faster the ship will get to its target .
Historically , the US economy has grown at an average annual rate of 3 % ( corrected for inflation ) over the past 150 years .
If we assume that net human growth will continue at the rate of 3 % in the future , we can calculate the opportunity cost of tying capital up in an interstellar voyage by assuming an average 3 % rate of return were the capital invested at home .
Obviously , the longer the voyage , the higher the opportunity cost .
Compound interest mounts up very rapidly .
The important point is that the opportunity cost goes down if the maximum velocity of the ship goes up ( because the ship gets to its destination and back sooner , so the interest is compounded for fewer years ) .
The initial investment goes up , however as the maximum velocity of the ship goes up ( because more energy is required to accelerate it to a higher velocity ) .
Evidently , there is , for a voyage of a given length , a maximum velocity at which the minimum net cost is achieved .
Table 1 shows the minimum costs for voyages of several lengths between 5 and 100 light - years .

total cost in megawatt - years per kilogram .
Cost ( 1981 $ ) : total cost in billions of 1981 US dollars per kilogram .
Assumptions :
The figures in this table are drawn using the following assumptions : Boardman anti-matter drive ; refueling at destination ; vehicle mass neglected ; 100 % efficiency drive ; acceleration = 9.8 m/sec2 ; rate of return on investments at home is 3 % annually ; $.05 in 1981 dollars per kilowatt - hour ( $ 438,000 per megawatt - year ) .
The cost of the energy needed to move a kilogram of matter at the minimum cost velocity of .23 times light - speed to a point 5 light - years away and back is 6,820 megawatt - years , which at average American prices of 5 cents per kilowatt hour works out to about $ 3 billion in 1981 dollars .
When including opportunity costs , the total cost rises to about 25,000 megawatt - years , or about $ 11 billion .
Costs increase rather more than linearly ; the total cost of a 100 light - year trip is about $ 64 trillion dollars ( about 20 times the US Gross National Product in 1981 ) .
Actually , $ 11 billion is not bad when one considers that the Apollo program cost around $ 10 billion .
To look at the energy figures , the initial investment of 6,820 megawatt - years is about 3 % of the installed electrical generating capacity of the US as of 1975 -- it would take 6 fairly large nuclear plants operating full - blast for a year to produce the antimatter needed for the trip .
That is a lot of energy , but it is by no means beyond our capabilities .
( Of course , the technology does not exist at the moment , and is likely never to exist at least in the idealized form postulated by Boardman . )
This limitation implies that sending miniaturized , robot probes to the nearer stars is well within the realm of feasibility and will , barring nuclear war or some other catastrophic end to human civilization , probably occur sooner or later .
However , the cost is per kilogram , which means that human beings are unlikely ever to go to the stars , given the mass entailed in the life support system necessary to keep a human alive for several decades .
Standards of Living
Eleven billion dollars is a lot of money -- or is it ?
We have postulated that the economy will continue to grow , world - wide ( or perhaps I should say solar - system - wide ) , at a rate of 3 % per annum .
Many countries have growth - rates higher than this ( and quite a few less ) , so it seems a reasonable presumption -- assuming 1 . ) technology continues to advance , 2 . ) we begin to exploit the vast resources available in the solar system off earth , and 3 . ) economic growth does not get choked off by the continued growth of parasitic government at the expense of the productive sector of the economy ( the last is the most questionable assumption ) .
As an example , let us say that the average individual on the earth commands about $ 1,000 per year ( the figure is probably somewhat , but not much , lower , averaged over the earth 's population ) .
Figure 1 shows how much money individuals will , on the average , be able to command in the future .
Talking of " money " in this context may be confusing ; we are talking , actually , about the resources , energy , and goods which an individual commands .
The average individual will be able to command $ 1 billion in about 500 years -- which means he will be able to afford the equivalent of a Cray computer and a fleet of space shuttles .
He will not be able to hire huge numbers of domestic servants -- because the average servant will , after all , make somewhere around $ 1 billion himself .
Real economic growth comes from technological advances that permit increased productivity .
Mechanization , division of labor , computerization , robots , etc. , mean that fewer and fewer man-hours are needed to produce a given good , and thus that individuals can be paid more ( in terms of goods and services ) than they could be paid under less productive arrangements .
There may be a limit to this process , but we are nowhere near it ; indeed , mechanization of services ( as opposed to industries ) has only begun to occur with the computer revolution .
Economic growth means a greater ability to command goods and services ; it does not mean a greater ability to command others .
Some things , however , are not susceptible to growth of this kind .
There are only so many Rembrandts ; the soil of Burgundy can only support so many grand cru vineyards .
If a Rembrandt sells for $ 1 million today , when the average income is $ 1000 , it will sell for $ 1 trillion when the average income is $ 1 billion .
( All things being equal . )
Historically , per capita energy consumption has been very closely linked to economic growth .
Both have increased in the US at an average rate of around 3 % .
Consequently , as standards of living increase , the amount of energy which an individual can command increases -- and his ability to contribute to what now seems an incredibly expensive sublight trading mission increases .
If an average income of $ 1 billion does not make everyone able to own a Rembrandt , it does make it much more possible to engage in interstellar trade .
If a Rembrandt sells for $ 1 trillion , spending $ 11 billion to import the equivalent of a Rembrandt from Alpha Centauri does not sound so bad .
How reasonable is it to expect that per capita incomes will increase a millionfold over the next 500 years or so ?
Assume that the population increases at a rate of 2 % per annum ( roughly the current global average ) .
Total energy use will increase at a rate of 5 % ( 3 % per capita plus 2 % increase in population ) .
Current total world consumption of energy is around 8 x 109 MW - years per year .
The sun puts out about 1.28 x 1020 MW ; in 500 years at a growth rate of 5 % , humanity would consume a little bit more than twice the energy produced by the sun ( and the human population would be about 8 x 1013 , eighty - thousand billion people ) .
It seems unlikely that we could produce enough energy to provide the equivalent of a second sun for humanity .
However , if we assume that the population would level off at 100 billion people , humanity would consume about 5 x 1017 MW , about 1/ 2 % of the sun 's output .
Thus , if we solve the population problem sometime in the 22nd Century , all will be well and our children will be billionaires .
Assume that this picture is over - optimistic .
Assume that the $ 11 billion / kg is off by a factor of ten , and that a better figure is $ 100 billion / kg .
Even today , such a cost , though huge , could be paid .
And barring the collapse of civilization , growth will continue .
The relative cost of interstellar trade should decline .
Doubtless , it will never be as common as trans -Atlantic traffic is today ; nonetheless , it seems feasible .
Commodities
We said that in order to determine the feasibility of trade in a given good we would have to know 1 . ) the cost of transportation and 2 . ) something about the cost of production of the good .
The first question we have answered , and the second we can talk about .
If the standard of living has increased a millionfold , what this really means is that the cost of goods has decreased a millionfold .
If per capita income increases from $ 1,000 to $ 1 billion , an individual can command a million times as much energy or resources .
Effectively , we are holding the dollar cost of goods constant while increasing the number of dollars available to individuals .
This being so , it is obvious that common resources and products are not going to be worth trading over interstellar distances .
Spending 25,000 MY - years to import a kilogram of lead makes no sense .
What might be worth importing ?
First , perhaps there are extremely valuable resources which cannot easily be produced in our solar system : monopoles , or superheavy metals , perhaps ( if such things exist at all ) .
If , however , there are monopoles on Alpha Centauri because the Centaurians can manufacture them , it is likely that it will be more efficient to purchase the techniques from them rather than to import monopoles .
Which brings up the point that manufactured goods of any kind are probably not worth trading , because given the high costs of transportation , selling the manufacturing technology makes more sense than trading in the goods themselves .
What does this leave ?
This leaves goods the value of which is not transmittable , which cannot be described and reconstructed , but have somehow intrinsic value .
A Rembrandt can certainly be described and the Centaurians could certainly print copies of Rembrandt paintings from information we send them , but those copies would not be the originals .
Lithographs sell for prices about 5 orders of magnitude less than originals .
Originals have intrinsic value ; any copy , no matter how perfect , is but a copy .
So one possible category of trade objects is luxury items , not only objets d'art , but such things as exotic wines and liqueurs and the like .
( I refuse to believe that any reproduction technology , no matter how sophisticated , can reproduce the bouquet of wine to the complete satisfaction of a wine snob .
The future may see the trillion dollar wine . )
The last category of goods it might make sense to trade is genetic information , or something similar .
Given sophisticated genetic manipulation techniques , getting the raw material -- the genetic codes -- of alien species might prove extremely beneficial , especially if the species is very alien in biology .
By manipulating such beasties , we might be able to engineer new genetic products that could not be created with the genetic material available on earth .
On the other hand , the genetic code is a code ; and one day we may be able to read the precise order of amino acids on a strand of DNA , and thus be able to precisely describe a gene to an interested party .
There is , naturally , a hell of a lot of information encoded in even the simplest bacterium , and transmitting this much information might be difficult .
On the other hand , radio data transmission rates have increased by several orders of magnitude over the last few decades , and it may be that we will be able to transmit instructions for building genes in the future , thus obviating the need for trade in genes .
In summary then , though human civilization is likely to be engaged in interstellar trade , there probably will not be much worth trading , since any society capable of doing so on a major scale can probably produce almost anything it needs at home .
Trade in esoteric and extremely rare resources like superheavy metals might be possible ; genetic material is another possibility .
The most likely trade good would seem to be the relatively frivolous trade in luxuries .
Trade via Radio
There are immense gains to be made from trade with other stars through exchange of information .
A space - going civilization is almost certain to have developed technologies which we have not , and vice versa .
Exchange of scientific information would also be worthwhile , and surely both our cultures would be enriched by exchange of the artistic masterpieces of our two heritages .
Such trade would not require physical transportation of objects , however ; a more likely possibility is telecommunication .
Getting into radio contact with another civilization would be extremely profitable to both of us , and the cost to operate a large radio transmitter would be immensely less than the cost of operating an interstellar trading vessel .
This kind of trade , however , cannot be built on a direct , bargained exchange .
If it takes , say , ten years to send a message and get a response , making a deal would be an effort requiring a lifetime .
If making a profitable exchange necessarily requires first coming to an agreement on the terms of that exchange , information will be exchanged at a very slow rate .
Instead , it seems likely that both of us will transmit whatever information we think the other might find useful or interesting , transmitting other information as requested .
In essence , as Asimov suggests in one of his stories , we will both be talking at once .
Whether this kind of exchange can even be termed " trade " in the classical sense is debatable , since there is no agreed exchange of items of value ; but it is certainly a voluntary arrangement benefitting both parties .
It is also evidently the most cost - effective and simplest way to deal with alien friends .
Trade Faster than the Speed of Light
In this article , I have talked about the possibilities of sublight trade at some length .
Trade in FTL vessels may be a more interesting topic , despite the fact that FTL will probably never exist .
The problem is that any FTL drive will necessarily depend on physical principles of which we have not the slightest glimmer at the present time .
Consequently , we can not make any assumptions and have no real way of speculating about the costs of such trade or the forms which it will entail .
The basic principles , however , remain the same .
The lower the cost of transportation of goods , the more trade will go on .
One expects that any mechanism for traversing distances measured in light - years is going to be very expensive , even if it involves ( or perhaps especially if it involves ) somehow transcending Einsteinian mechanics .
Consequently , interstellar trade is always likely to be limited .
The fact that travel can occur at trans - light speeds means that opportunity costs are much reduced , of course ; the cost of building and operating an FTL - drive ship , however , cannot even be guessed at .
In the accompanying module , we investigate the costs of travel using the Traveller system , and how that system reflects ( or fails to reflect ) reality .

The Photos Washington Does n't Want You To See
Are we always alone when we think we are ?
October 6 , 2007 at 3:00 am thinkingshift
This is the premise of a new film that has me very , very intrigued .
It ’s intriguing because it ’s a film shot from the point of view of surveillance cameras and puts us on the other side of the camera – it takes us on a voyeuristic journey , nosing around in other people ’s lives , watching their embarrassing moments .
It captures the spectator view of today ’s society really – we are all spectators watching people embarrass themselves on reality TV shows ; checking out the latest photos of celebrities wearing no knickers ; zooming in on some poor sod who ’s having plastic surgery on TV in an effort to look 10 years younger .
We are sometimes shocked , or we snigger at someone ’s mistake , or we cringe when the up close and personal shots of surgery pop onto the screen .
But above all , we are titillated .
You ’re observing things that perhaps are best left private .
But privacy is not an option today ; not when you think that in the US , for example , there are 30 million surveillance cameras that generate more than 4 billion hours of footage every week .
The average American runs the chance of being snapped by a webcam 200 times per day : in department stores , on the streets … even in changing rooms .
The cameras snoop ; they are relentless .
Wait a minute : did I say changing rooms ?
yep , sure did .
I have often wondered whether the unblinking eye captures you as you ’re undressing in a changing room .
I do look out for them I must admit .
This is a place where we think we are alone – admiring our image or berating ourselves for not losing a few kilos .
But perhaps not : the website for the film , Look , has posted a number of videos of people caught unawares , in private moments .
If you look at this video of a woman undressing in a changing room , then you might hyperventilate at the thought that you too could one day be captured undressing .
If you choose to look at it , you will probably have a sense that you ’re doing something you should n’t be doing ; observing an individual ’s private moment ; but maybe you ca n’t resist looking .
WARNING : do not look at it if you think you might find it offensive .
But there are good aspects to surveillance cameras – I ’d be the first to admit this despite my carry on about how we are in the grip of surveillance .
Here ’s a video from the Look site – WARNING – someone dies in this video , so think about it before you choose to watch it .
This is our society in its dark moments .
The alleged shooter was identified , that ’s the positive part ; but again , we are participating in someone ’s life when we watch it , really someone ’s last moments on Earth .
These two videos to me show the polar extremes of the surveillance society – voyeuristic yet protective .
The film , Look , focuses on people ’s lives as captured by surveillance cameras and shows the things we all get up to when we do n’t think anyone is watching .
The film follows several characters whose lives all intersect .
Writer - director , Adam Rifkin , did n’t use real webcam footage .
Rather he used unknown actors and placed the cameras in locations and angles where real surveillance cameras might be placed .
He then degraded the film in post - production to make it look like real webcam footage .
The site also has a surveillance map and is encouraging people in the US to add to the map the location of any webcam they spot .
What a lovely twist – citizens spying on the webcams !
And you can watch a powerful trailer of the film , Look , on the Threat Level blog .

JP Morgan was later hailed as both hero and villain
Almost exactly 100 years ago at 4.45 in the morning of a November day on the corner of Madison and 35th Street in New York a group of some 50 or so exhausted men stumbled out into the street .
Some had not slept for days .
Behind them , on the other side of the monumental brass doors that closed behind them , they left a piece of paper which pledged them collectively to a loan of some $ 25 m - about $ 10 bn ( £ 5 bn ) in today 's money .
Beside it stood a large gentleman with a walrus moustache , who had forced them into the deal which ended a two - week financial panic that had come close to destroying New York 's financial system .
That man was J Pierpont Morgan .
From 1903 to 1906 the global economy had boomed and the Dow Jones had doubled .
But the global supply of gold to which all hard currency was pegged had not kept pace , and hard cash was increasingly scarce .
A hundred years later our credit squeeze had its genesis in the infamous sub - prime mortgage market of the US .
Panic triggers
The problems of a century ago were far more diverse , though many of them stemmed from London .
The San Francisco quake was one of the triggers behind the crisis
The Boer war had drained British coffers six years before .
Lloyd's of London 's vast payout to cover insurance losses in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake also sucked cash out of Britain .
The Egyptian stock exchange had crashed and the Bank of England dispatched $ 3 m in gold to bail it out .
The real crisis came in October and centred on the trust companies .
These were not the massive conglomerates such as US Steel and Standard Oil , but the thousands of unregulated financial houses that worked like commercial banks .
On Thursday and Friday - 17 and 18 October - there was a run on the Knickerbocker Trust which had been part of a group financing a failed attempt take over United Copper .
The depositors would be back in the queues outside the Trust on Monday - and other trusts too .
What 's more , thousands of American rural banks faced with customers needing cash at harvest time would also be pulling millions out of the system .
Financial help
But where would the cash come from ?
A century on , and the Federal Reserve , European Central Bank and , reluctantly , the Bank of England have been offering billions to the financial markets to allow money to flow where it was needed .
In 1907 there were no central banks , no lender of last resort .
There was , however , 70 - year - old JP Morgan - the single most important financier of the late 19th century .
He was not the richest of the so - called Robber Barons , but he had more power than any .
His efforts had channelled the wealth of Europe into funding the industrialisation of America .
If Morgan gave his blessing to a deal in railroads , shipping , steel or manufacturing , the European bankers would listen - and back it .
Crisis team
As the Knickerbocker Trust prepared to face its depositors on the Monday , Morgan set up his headquarters with five lieutenants in his luxurious Library on Madison Avenue .
World markets feared another market crash 100 years on
His team 's job was , like a central bank today , to work out which institutions were solvent and which could be supported .
They worked through the week - day and night poring over accounts , deciding who to save and who to let go .
To counter market rumours they set up an evening public relations service , dealing out reassuring bulletins for morning papers .
Behind them , chomping on a cigar , sometimes calmly playing at solitaire , sat Morgan , mulling the fate of the trusts and banks before him .
The Knickerbocker was forced to close , but early on Tuesday newspaper headlines that claimed Morgan was to help the Trust Company of America , or TCA , had depositors queuing outside its doors within hours .
Cash was haemorrhaging from other trusts too .
Line in the sand
But Morgan decided TCA was where he could stop the rot .
On Tuesday night - now sneezing and coughing with a wretched cold - he assembled the heads of a group of banks and trust companies .
As they talked around him an exhausted Morgan fell asleep in his chair .
Coming round from his slumber he simply demanded each subscribe to a loan .
With the sheer force of his personality , expressed , it is said , through his terrifying eyes , they pledged $ 8.25 m .
The next day Morgan was greeted by cheers as he drove to his office .
Market panic
But the crisis was not over and shifted instead to the stock exchange which crashed .
Today , the credit markets have been sweating with interbank rates around 7 % .
On Wednesday , 22 October 1907 , banks refused to lend to brokers at anything under 100 % interest .
Morgan pushed banks to pitch in and help end the crisis
Again Morgan brought the banks together , $ 25 m was corralled from them and as a messenger was sent over to the exchange with the news , traders ripped his coat off in the mounting hysteria .
But within 24 hours rumours sent the markets into a further panic .
Once more the banks were bullied into divvying up another $ 10 m .
By the weekend Morgan 's performance had been such that London was prepared to ship some $ 20 m in gold out to support the New York institutions , and all that following week Morgan 's team worked to shore up the trusts and banks that were threatened daily by panicking depositors .
On the brink
On Friday came the final crisis : Lincoln Trust and the TCA still needed more cash and the largest brokerage on Wall Street , Moore & Schley looked close to collapse as its creditors demanded repayments of some $ 35 m in loans .
The only security it had were shares in the Tennessee Coal Iron and Railroad Company which had halved in value in the last year .
Morgan 's solution was for his own US Steel to buy out TC&I , shore up Moore and Schley and twist the arms of the bankers one more time to support the trusts .
On Sunday 3 November , some 50 bankers and steel executives gathered in Morgan 's Library .
By early evening the steel deal was done , but the trusts were still deep in discussion .
One of Morgan 's officers , Ben Strong , tried to leave but the Library doors were bolted .
Morgan had the key and was n't going to let anyone out until the paper was signed .
As Morgan confronted the assembled throng no one appeared willing to move .
Morgan placed his hand on the shoulder of the elderly Edward King , head of the Union Trust .
" There 's the place , King , " he said , " and here 's the pen . "
One by one they put their names to the $ 25 m rescue package .
Hero and villain
The crisis was over .
But Morgan was both hero and villain .
Mr Morgan 's intervention preceded the creation of the Federal Reserve
He had stemmed the run on the trusts and saved the financial system .
But it was thought he had used the crisis , maybe even engineered it all from the start , to buy shares in yet more companies on the cheap - in particular yet another steel firm to add to his already massive US Steel empire .
Indeed , the tide was turning against Morgan and his like .
The anti-trust movement gathered pace - using the takeover of TC&I as a prime example of the abuse of monopolistic power .
Morgan 's era - the age of the Robber Baron - was coming to a close and in 1913 when he died the Federal Reserve Act started to institutionalise the power he had wielded so effectively in 1907 .
In a statement released yesterday by the Vatican , Pope Benedict XVI ranked same - sex marriage with nuclear arms proliferation , environmental pollution , economic inequality , abortion , and birth control as threats to world peace in a message for for the World Day of Peace on January 1st , according to Religion News Service :
“ Presenting the nuclear family as the ‘ first and indispensable teacher of peace ’ and the ‘ primary agency of peace , ’ the 15 - page document links sexual and medical ethics to international relations .
‘ Everything that serves to weaken the family based on the marriage of a man and woman , everything that directly or indirectly stands in the way of its openness to the responsible acceptance of new life … constitutes an objective obstacle on the road to peace , ’ Benedict writes . ”

最近，顧客などか らWebメールの利用に関する相談が多くなっている。企業内の個々の社員が勝手に利用している場合はもちろん，企業として利用する場合に，メール本文を外部に置くことで情報漏えいにつながるのではないかという危機感からだ。企業の機密が漏れることはもちろん，個人のプライバシーにかかわる問題でもある。
Webメールは，既に多くのユーザーがプライベートのメールとして利用している。
“ 実名” でビジネス用メールにGoogleやYahoo!などの外部サービスを利用しているユーザーも増えている。ただ，自分の電子メールが他人に読まれていたという事例は過去にいくつもあり，決して珍しい話ではない。事業者のサーバーにメールを置くWebメールとなると，不安はさらに膨らむ。
さすが にWebメール・サービスも，一昔前と比べるとそれなりにセキュリティ対策はとられている。それでも，必ずしも十分とは言えないのが実情である。しかもWebメールのアカウント情報を狙っている攻撃者は世界中に存在する。
組織や個人の情報を守るためには，Webメールが抱える問題点を洗い出しておく必要がある。今回はWebメールの課題と，自己防衛に向けた対策を紹介しよう。
大切なのは認証の仕組み
Webメールに関するセキュリティ上の不安要素は3点挙げられる。（1）重要情報が外部のメール・サーバーで管理されること，（2）ユーザー認証がID/パスワードのみと貧弱なこと，（3）Webアプリケーション特有の攻撃が可能になることである。安心してWebメールを利用するためには，これらの対策を考えておかなければならない。どれもネットワーク・セキュリティの観点では基本的なことだが，改めて押さえておきたい。
メールの管理を外部に任せることについては，メールの利用範囲を明確にしておくことで対処する。例えば企業の機密，あるいは個人情報にかかわるやり取りにはWebメールを使わないなどの運用ルールを決めておく。
ユーザー認証の対策は，パスワード管理の体制を整えることである。具体的には，一定期間ごとのパスワード変更を励行する。強固なパスワードの設定も欠かせない。同時に，パスワードを忘れたときに利用する「
Send email forgot password system 」の仕組みが重要になる。容易にパスワードを再発行してしまうシステムでは，攻撃者に簡単に認証を破られてしまう危険性がある。代表的なWebメール・サービスに見られる表1のような手続きがあるかどうか，確認しておきたい。

Webアプリケーションの観点で気になるのは，例えばクロスサイト・スクリプティングのぜい弱性である。実際にYahoo!Mailではクロスサイト・スクリプティングのぜい弱性を悪用され，フィッシング詐欺などが発生している。GmailやHotmailについても，同様にぜい弱性が報告されている。
現在，どのメール・サービスがクロスサイト・スクリプティングのぜい弱性を抱えているかは，/xssed（http://www.xssed.com/）などのサイトである程度確認できる。危険性をわきまえておけば，不審なURLをクリックしないなどの対処によって危険を回避できるかもしれない。
ハッキングの有無を手軽に調べる
ただし，これらは予防策でしかない。いつ，誰に不正アクセスされたのかを知ることができなければ対策とは呼べない。メールにおいてもインシデント・レスポンスは重要な要素であるのだ。その対策として，Webメールのメールボックス内に簡易的なトラップを仕掛ける方法を紹介する。これは企業内における内部犯罪対策にも応用することができるので，試してみる価値はあるだろう。
一般に，メール・サーバーへの侵入を試みる犯罪者は，何らかの目的を持って行動している。目当てはオンライン・バンキングやクレジットカードなどの金融情報，上司の情報，恋人の浮気情報などである。こうした情報が含まれていることを匂わす見出しを付けた「おとり」メールを用意し，不正アクセスをあぶり出す。
ステップは大きく，（1）おとりメールを自分のメール・アドレスに送る，（2）解析用サーバーを設ける，（3）解析するの三つである。まず，適当なWebサーバーに“秘密の画像ファイル”をアップロードし，そのURLを含むメールを自分自身のWebメール・アドレスに送信しておく。Webサーバーのログに画像へのアクセスが確認されれば，侵入者がいたことになる。Webのアクセス・ログだから，「いつ 」
「どこから」は大体把握できる。
アクセス解析サイトも便利
アクセス解析サイトを利用する方法もある。OneStatFree.comというサイトが，具体的にログを表示してくれ，分かりやすいので紹介しておこう。
（1）次のURLからOneStatFree.comにアクセスし，ユーザー情報を登録する。http://www.onestatfree.com/
（2）登録したメール・アドレスにOneStatScript.txtというファイルが添付されたメールが届く。このファイルには，ブラウザで開くと自動的にOneStatFree.comにアクセスするスクリプトが記述されている。この添付ファイルを重要情報であるようなファイル名を付けて保存する。例えば「
Online Bank Password 」や「 important」などだ。侵入者は世界各国に存在するため，英語表記の方がいいだろう。内部犯罪を検知することを目的とするのであれば，「合併」などインサイダー的な情報が効果的である。
写 真1●Webサーバーへのリンクを埋め込んだトラップ・メールの例

（3）保存したファイルをトラップ・メールに埋め込む（写真1）。
準備ができたら，監視したいメール・アドレスにトラップ・メールを送る。このWebメールを開くと自動的にスクリプトが動くため，OneStatfree.comのレポートを参照すれば第三者に侵入されたかどうかを確認することができる（写真2）。

“ I did n’t want to waste any more time at 83 years old fooling with this operation , ” he told reporters in the courtroom .
“ The quicker I got it over with , the better . ”
Mr. Wyatt ’s lawyer , Gerald L. Shargel , said the government had offered the deal , under which four of the five original charges were dropped in exchange for a guilty plea .
Those included conducting financial transactions with Iraq , an enemy nation at the time , and violating a United States embargo on that country .
“ The defense of a criminal case is complicated when the client is 83 years old , ” Mr. Shargel said .
“ That was certainly taken into account .
For the government to have offered this disposition at this point suggests both sides recognized the risks involved in having a jury decide it . ”
Michael J. Garcia , the United States attorney in Manhattan , issued a statement within two hours of the plea that said , “ When Oscar Wyatt agreed to defraud the oil - for - food program by making illegal payments to the Hussein regime , he traded the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people for the satisfaction of his own greed and the greed of the former government of Iraq . ”
Mr. Garcia ’s office , which led the criminal investigation into the troubled program , has so far extracted guilty pleas from five other defendants and won conviction of one more .
Some $ 16.5 million in illicit profits have been seized , money that officials plan to transfer to the Development Fund of Iraq .
Under the oil - for - food program , established in 1996 , Iraq was allowed to sell its oil despite sanctions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait .
But all profits from the sales were to have been used for food , medicine or any goods needed to sustain the Iraqi population .
One of the fastest ways for us personal - finance writers to annoy our readers is to raise The Starbucks ( NASDAQ : SBUX ) Issue .
You 've read this one a dozen times .
It 's the one where we say , " If normally you buy a $ 4 latte every morning , and you stop buying it and instead invest the money in an index fund in your retirement account , you 'll have $ 553,396 after 40 years , " or something like that , and it 's usually in an article with a title like " The Half - Million - Dollar Cup of Coffee . "
Sound familiar ?
The thing is , though , it 's true .
If you invest $ 4 times five days a week times 52 weeks a year annually in an index fund returning 10 % , you will have more than $ 500,000 in 40 years .
The math does n't lie .
What you wo n't have is 40 years ' worth of the pleasure of breaking your morning fog with a delicious beverage .
And if too many people adopt this strategy , Starbucks ' stock might suffer , and depending on how your retirement funds are invested , that might slow down your wealth - building a bit .
But I digress .
If you 're determined to build wealth , living below your means is the key .
And enough little savings -- like cutting out the morning cappuccino -- can add up to a significant difference in your monthly spending .
But there are tradeoffs , and like the coffee , they can seem trivial and hugely annoying at the same time .
You 've probably already made the painless cuts from your spending -- or , at least , if you have n't , you should n't need my help to find them .
Here are more ideas that may seem annoying or unreasonable at first glance but are actually worth some consideration .
Move to a smaller house .
Heresy , right ?
Downsizing one 's digs is a sign of economic failure in America , I hear you say .
Except ... it does n't need to be .
How much space do you really need ?
Can you get buy with less space -- and lower mortgage and utility payments ?
If you spend a portion of the savings on new furniture , would it really be less nice ?
How much would you save ?

Telecommute .
I work from home .
My wife works from home most days , too .
We drink great coffee , eat whatever we want for lunch , and save a bundle -- on gas , clothing , car maintenance , food , and those $ 4 lattes .
And you can't beat my commute :
It 's one flight of stairs !
It is n't for everyone , but if your workplace will let you try it , give it a shot -- you might never go back .

Lose weight .
Sure , joining Weight Watchers ( NYSE : WTW ) or a gym is n't free , but do you know how much being overweight costs ?
Getting into shape ( and eating well ) can save you lots of money on medicines , medical copays , life insurance , and lost work time , and improve your life in a whole host of other ways .
Your weight loss efforts do n't have to be expensive -- think about it .

Relocate .
Go one step further than a smaller house -- move to a less expensive part of the country .
If you 're living in an East Coast metro area , northern California , or another high - priced region , think about the tradeoffs involved in moving to a nice but less - expensive community elsewhere .
You might get more house -- maybe much more -- for less money .
Costs for things like food and entertainment might be cheaper , too .
You might make less money , but how much would you really be giving up ?
And if you 're already telecommuting , you could keep your current job .

Buy stuff used .
I 'm a big fan of buying good used cars , as I 've said before .
But you can get all sorts of other good used stuff cheap or even free .
I suspect that nearly every community that includes families with young children has a thriving underground exchange of used kid clothes , baby accessories , strollers , and the like -- even wealthy communities .
If you have kids , get access to it .
And consider trying local secondhand places -- or even eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) -- for clothes for yourself or furniture .
You might be pleasantly surprised .

Brown - bag it .
Do you buy lunch every work day ?
Is it usually good enough to justify the $ 7 - $ 8 you spend ?
How much of a pain would it be to bring something simple from home ?
Bringing lunch even once a week will save something , and you might find that the brown - bagged stuff is tastier -- and healthier , too .
See what I mean ?
Most people react to ideas like these with a roll of the eyes .
But give them a second look .
One or two might make sense for you -- and could help you save a lot more money over time .
i Rex Iliad review
The “ howls ” : http://www.boingboing.net/2007/11/20/amazon-kindle-the-we.html “ of ” : http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/11/14512.html “ derision ” : http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/11/more-kindle-com.html greeting the announcement of the Amazon Kindle last week reminds me that I never got around to reviewing the “ iRex Iliad ” : http://www.irextechnologies.com/products/iliad that I bought some months ago .
I ca n’t provide a proper comparison of the two ; not only do I not own a Kindle , obviously , but I have n’t even used the Iliad to read DRM - protected books ( this has only become a possibility in the last few months ; before that you were limited to PDFs and the like ) .
But for my particular purposes as an academic , the Iliad works very well .
It ’s still a first generation technology , and has several kinks that could , and should , be ironed out .
Even so , what I ’ve seen convinces me that academics are likely to become early adopters of this technology _en masse_ when it comes down in price and becomes a little more user friendly .
Amanda of “ Household Opera ” : http://householdopera.typepad.com/household_opera/2007/11/count-me-among.html describes the kind of e-book reader that many academics might want to own , and lays out the reasons why Kindle does n’t cut it .
I think a lightweight e-book reader with a good readable screen would be absolutely swell ( especially given how much library school reading I ’m taking on my Thanksgiving travels , and how I get twitchy if I go anywhere without something to read ) .
But on the other hand , I would n’t want it to be tied to a specific vendor , and I ’d want to be able to use it as a catchall reading device for all the random stuff I get from the ‘ net — especially journal articles from databases , free e-texts from here and there , and text - heavy web pages I ’d rather not read on a computer screen .
The thing is , Kindle will let you surf the web and download things , but they have to be either in Amazon ’s proprietary format , in . txt format , or in mobipocket format .
If you want to read HTML or PDF files , you have to pay to e-mail them to your Kindle so it can convert them .
The Iliad is a fair bit closer to what academics like Amanda are looking for ; close enough that I feel that even if I have n’t gotten to the promised land , I ’ve at least gotten a few decent glimpses of it through the mountains .
Academics usually cart around a lot of paper with them – student essays , articles that they have promised to review , articles that friends have fobbed off on them that they have promised with faintly guilty consciences to get around to commenting on one of these days , monographs , notes , scraps , pleasure reading etc etc .
We ’re book people .
The usual result is we ’re laden down with overstuffed briefcases and bags every time we get on planes , exploding with dog eared manuscripts which mate with each other while we ’re not looking , producing bizarre hybrids in which the pages from several different documents have gleefully miscegenated .
Since purchasing my Iliad , I ’ve gotten this under control .
Everything that I get in text format , I PDF in a big friendly font , anddiwbpload to the Iliad before travelling .
I ’ve quite grown to enjoy the resulting feeling of serenity and order – everything I have to read _en route_ fits in a small , light reader that can be squeezed with a bit of pushing and shoving in my coat pocket .
The screen of the reader looks lovely .
It uses digital ink rather than an LCD screen , so that you do n’t get eyestrain – instead , the text reads clearly in natural light ( or even bright sunlight ) – it ’s black ( or , for illustrations ) various shades of greyscale on an off - white - to - greyish background .
Occasionally , there is some ghosting , but not enough to be more than a minor niggle .
The screen is considerably larger than the Sony Reader , which means that it ’s possible to read documents formatted for A4 size , although it sometimes is n’t as comfortable as it might be ( while the manual suggests that 12 point font is perfectly sufficient , I find that tiring on the eyes , although doable in a pinch – I prefer , where possible , to format documents in 16 point ) .
The Iliad has a decent battery life of around 8 hours activity in real world conditions ; plenty for a transatlantic plane flight .
Its controls ( at least the controls for moving around in the text ) are n’t as intuitive as they might be , but you get used to them pretty quickly .
What distinguishes it from the competition , such as it is , is that it allows you to take notes using a stylus .
This is essential for academics – and in some ways makes it _better_ than a regular book for a certain , squeamish class of reader .
Charlie Stross had a post a while back ( I ca n’t find it now ) , which talked about how e-books simply were n’t satisfying as physical objects in the same way as regular books .
But this cuts both ways – I , for one , _do n’t like_ marking up physical books with marginalia etc , precisely because I like them as objects , but I ’m very happy to scrawl all over e-books .
With the exception of the few books that I really feel attached to , I ’d be very happy to turn my academic library into an assortment of annotated PDF files ( maybe that makes me a little weird ) .
Furthermore I ’m looking forward to the posthuman future where we can swap our notations , del.icio.us style , with our mates so as to grown vast thickets of marginalia , vigorous dissents , links and references to other authors etc around the original text .
The stylus is n’t as good as a regular pen ; it ’s about as responsive as the average stylus on a PDA ( although it is based on a different technology ) .
But this is still plenty good enough for scrawled notes and queries , comments on student papers , etc , etc , etc .
When you have finished scrawling , you can upload the annotated PDFs to your PC to print them out etc .
The downsides .
First – cost .
It ’s expensive , especially for people paying in dollars , as it is n’t available through dealers on this side of the Atlantic ( I bought it some months ago , when the euro / dollar differential was much better than it is today ) .
If / when we see similar technology at about half the price , it ’ll be a lot more attractive .
Half that price again might make for a genuine mass market .
Second – Internet access .
It has built in 802.11g , but you can only use it for a few , quite limited purposes ( primarily downloading new versions of the basic software ) .
You ca n’t use it to access the Internet more generally .
This seems to me to be a little crazy – there are lots of fun things that you could do with a cut - down browser etc that you simply ca n’t do .
While , for example , you can use RSS feeds , you have to set up to download them on your computer using Mobipocket or similar , and then munge them over to the reader .
Third – user modifiability .
There is some interesting homegrown software out there for the Iliad ( its operating system is based on a cut - down version of Linux ) .
But the manufacturers do n’t seem to go especially out of their way to encourage people to come up with interesting mods .
A useful comparison is with Neuros ’s media recorders , which run on entirely modifiable open source software , and which have built up a thriving community of modders and home - brewers as a result .
I suspect that the Iliad people want to preserve some control in the hope that they can then use distribution channels ( see above under Internet access , dearth of ) as an additional revenue stream .
This seems unlikely to fly , especially given the competition from Amazon – better by far to differentiate your product in the marketplace by becoming the anti-Amazon ( I suspect that most of the documents that people _actually_ want to read on a set - up like this are n’t going to be traditional e-books , but instead user generated documents , downloaded PDFs and the like – the easier you make it for people , say , to download material without restrictions from the WWW , the more likely it is that they will like your product ) .
Fourth .
Some technical clunkiness around the edges of the software .
This is clearly a product that is n’t designed for non-technically savvy users – the set up procedure in particular was frustrating , with glitches that suggested stupid design decisions ( e.g. you _have_ to register and upgrade when you plug the reader into your computer , and are given an automatically generated password , which in my case included characters that are n’t available on the Iliad keyboard , requiring further password change etc etc etc ) .
These annoyances aside , I think that it ’s a good product .
More generally , I suspect that over the next decade or two , devices like this might help bring through a radical change in academic publishing and reading practices .
Scott wrote a “ piece ” : http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/07/31/ricepress
a few months ago talking about the problems of academic publishing , and linking to the “ Ithaka report ” : http://www.ithaka.org/strategic-services/university-publishing on new models of digital publishing in the academy .
One of the problems with digital publishing of monographs is that very few people want to read anything longer than a short - ish article online , and the alternative , of printing out reams of 12 point Times New Roman A4 is n’t always that attractive either .
Decent e-book readers , which allow you to mark up text , mean that you can read and annotate long texts easily without having to print them out .
They ’re an important underlying technology for whatever new ecology emerges .
There ’s a broad consensus among the digerati that e-book readers are a solution to a problem that does n’t exist – but in the academy , not only does the problem exist , but it ’s threatening to undermine the basic system of scholarly publishing .
E - book readers are n’t a complete solution to this problem by any means , but I suspect that they will be an important part of that solution as it begins to emerge .
I ’m reading two very good management books right now .
The first is a classic : Up the Organization , by Robert Townsend .
Apparently this book first came out in 1970 , was widely admired , and slowly fell off everyone ’s radar , until Wiley republished it last month .
Townsend ran
Avis back in the day , and when you start to read a management book written in the 1960s , you expect to find secretaries , two - martini lunches , executive golf club memberships , etc .
What you find instead is rather refreshing even by today ’s standards .
On Mergers :
If you have a good company do n’t sell out to a conglomerate … .
Conglomerates will promise anything for your people … but once in the fold your company goes through the homogenizer along with all their other acquisitions of the week , and all the zeal and most of the good people leave .
PS for Y Combinator kids :
Do n’t be smug because you think that conglomerates went the way of the dodo .
“ Conglomerate ” is just an old word for what you call “ Yahoo , Microsoft , and Google . ”
Oh and Condé - Nast .
Anyway .
Townsend on management consultants :
[ They ] waste time , cost money , demoralize and distract your best people , and do n’t solve problems .
They are people who borrow your watch to tell you what time it is and then walk off with it .
It sounds like a cliché , right ?
Townsend probably invented that cliché , boychik .
And it ’s still true , and the jibe at Booz Allen later on in the book is still 100 % on the money .
Even better is his disdain for marketing departments :
Marketing … is the name of the game .
So it had better be handled by the boss and his line , not by staff hecklers .
Once or twice a year for three or four days the boss takes ten , twenty or thirty of his key people … away to some secluded spot .
On average they spend twelve hours a day asking unaskable questions , rethinking the business ( What are we selling ?
To whom ?
At what prices ?
How do we get it to him ?
In what form ? ) , four hours a day relaxing and exercising , and eight hours a day sleeping .
It ’s hard work .
But more good marketing changes will come out of such meetings than out of any year - round staff department of “ experts ” with “ marketing ” signs on the door .
Boy , I sure wish I had learned that one a few months ago .
Two years ago , Seth Godin wrote essentially the same thing .
Anyway , that ’s just a few of the M’s .
The whole book is full of great advice like that , albeit focused on larger corporations .
If you ’re looking for something a little more , er , contemporary , Michael Lopp and his alter - ego Rands have just published Managing Humans : Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager , which originated with some essays on his excellent blog Rands in Repose .
( You can do that ? )
Lopp has worked at Netscape , Borland , and Apple .
He ’s the quintessential Silicon Valley middle manager .
I hope he does n’t find that term insulting : he ’s probably the best Silicon Valley middle manager there is .
He ’s brilliant , charismatic , and a poet - philosopher , and I could imagine no better boss .
You ’ll find that an awful lot of his book is about managing managers , big company politics , and the human side of getting technical teams to work together .
And he has a style quite his own .
You can get a taste of it from his classic Incrementalists & Completionists :
What was intriguing about my email repartee with the co-worker was that we were n’t disagreeing about whether or not we should do something about the problem .
We ’re arguing about how much we should do .
The disagreement reminded me there are two distinct personalities when it comes to devising solutions to problems : Incrementalists and Completionists .
Incrementalists are realists .
They have a pretty good idea of what is achievable given a problem to solve , a product to ship .
They ’re intimately aware of how many resources are available , where the political landscape is at any given moment , and they know who knows what .
They tend to know all the secrets and they like to be recognized for that fact .
Completionists are dreamers .
They have a very good idea of how to solve a given problem and that answer is SOLVE IT RIGHT .
Their mantra is , “ If you ’re going to spend the time to solve a problem , solve it in a manner that you are n’t going to be solving it AGAIN in three months . ”
I used to think that architects were the only real Completionists in an organization , but I was wrong .
Architects are the only RECOGNIZED Completionists in the company , but the personality is hiding all over the place .
Finally .
One more book .
The same publicist who sent me Up the Organization also included a copy of Ben Casnocha ‘s new book My Start - Up Life .
Ben is a charismatic , energetic , brilliant 19 year - old who founded a successful software company , Comcate , at age 14 .
It ’s all very adorable .
He ’s the Doogie Howser , MD of software startups , except for the fact that he probably has no idea who Doogie Howser is , given that the show went off the air when he was 4 years old , and , frankly , at age 4 he was probably too busy working on his second IPO to watch much television .
Ben is a seriously cool 19 year old .
He ’s very smart .
He ’s quite a good writer .
But .
But but but .
His book , unfortunately , tells you almost nothing about starting a company .
It ’s really , really thin on stories of what the actual company did and how things worked .
Worse , the book is padded with really , really embarrassing sidebars in which Ben gives you jejune Great Thoughts about business management .
Great entrepreneurs show up , take small risks ( and sometimes , large risks ) , raise their hand when they ’re confused , and try to figure out what ’s going on and how a situation could be made better .
When you show up and raise your hand , you ’ve already outperformed 90 percent of the crowd .
And :
The person on the receiving end of the mentoring relationship should work hard to insure it ’s not totally a one - way street .
Ben Ben Ben .
Yes , you ’re smart and good looking .
Yes , you know more about starting a software company than practically any other 19 year old .
And sure , I ’ll be happy to invest in your next startup , or hire you , or adopt you , whatever .
But .
Mark my words .
You ’re going to reach the ripe old age of 23 , and you ’re going to look back on this book you wrote , and you ’re going to say , “ how on earth did anyone let me publish such self - important crap , ” and you ’re practically going to die of embarrassment .
Trust me : I ’m in my 40s , and I ’m still morbidly embarrassed by the pompous , arrogant , self - important crap I write on this site here , up to and including this very sentence .
Feel free to skip this book .
If there are any lingering doubts as to whether the age of oil is nearing its end , the International Energy Agency has put them to rest and made it clear that only a massive and immediate investment in sustainable energy will prevent a global crisis .
The agency states in no uncertain terms in its annual World Energy Outlook that " alarming " growth in worldwide energy needs will within a generation threaten energy security , accelerate global climate change and possibly bring worldwide shortages and conflicts .
It ’s an unusually pessimistic view from an agency that has long said oil production , with trillions of dollars of investment , could meet rising energy needs .
But the explosive growth of China and India has caused a seismic change in thinking at the IEA , which says we must move swiftly , boldly and decisively beyond fossil fuels if we are to avert a crisis .
" All countries must take vigorous , immediate and collective action to curb runaway energy demand , " Nobuo Tanaka , head of the IEA , said .
" The next ten years will be crucial for all countries …
We need to act now to bring about a radical shift in investment in favor of cleaner , more efficient and more secure energy technologies . "
Find out why after the jump …
The burgeoning economies of China , which will within three years surpass the U.S. to become the world ’s leading energy user , and India have inalterably changed the global energy landscape , making them the focus of the 675 - page report released today .
Its projections are staggering .
To cite a few : China ’s energy needs will grow 5.1 percent annually through 2015 .
Fuel needs will quadruple as its vehicle fleet approaches 270 million in 2030 – at which point China also will need an additional 1,300 gigawatts of electricity , an amount equal to what the United States currently produces .
The projections for India are no less daunting .
The IEA makes a point of saying the two nations ’ growth has improved the quality of life for two billion people and therefore " must be accommodated and supported . "
But it also says " the consequences of unfettered growth in global energy demand are alarming for all countries . "
That demand is expected to increase 55 percent by 2030 , with China and India accounting for almost half the growth , the IEA says .
Fossil fuels will remain the leading source of energy , providing 84 percent of the world ’s needs , and oil will continue to dominate the picture as daily demand rises from 85 million barrels today to 116 million in 2030 .
The IEA says we ’ve got enough oil to make it to 2030 even if we do n’t do anything to change course , but you ’ve got to wonder how , and at what cost ?
The CEO of the French oil firm Total recently told the Financial Times the industry is going to have a hard time producing even 100 million barrels a day , and IEA officials told the Guardian that crude oil could hit $ 159 a barrel by 2030 .
More and more of the energy we need will come from the Middle East , as oilfields in the North Sea and Mexico peter out and Canada ’s oil sands generate just 3 million barrels a day , the IEA says .
That will leave the industrialized world ever more dependent on an increasingly volatile region for its energy .
As an overall piece of the global energy pie , oil will shrink as demand for coal skyrockets 73 percent and the use of natural gas and electricty climb too , the IEA says .
Meeting the demand for all that fossil fuel will require investing $ 22 trillion in the supply infrastructure .
But of perhaps greater concern is the environmental impact of such growth .
Without sweeping changes , the report states , carbon dioxide emissions will rise 57 percent to 42 gigatons by 2030 .
Even under the best case - scenario , which assumes the various proposals by industrialized nations to reduce emissions come to pass , emissions will climb 25 percent .
China and India will account for two - thirds of the increase , and even under the best circumstances any meaningful effort to cut emissions below current levels will require " exceptionally quick and vigorous policy actions by all countires , and unprecedented technological advances , entailing substantial costs , " the report states .
So what can we do ?
The IEA does n’t offer a whole lot of solutions beyond saying improving energy efficiency – of everything , from automobiles to refrigerators – will be the quickest and cheapest way to begin curbing energy demand and carbon emissions .
Clearly that wo n’t be enough , and the IEA makes that point clear when it says we must explore every option and " a substantial increase is called for in public and private funding for energy technology research , development and demonstration . "
How much funding ?
As we reported in " How Hydrogen Can Save America , " the U.S. could shift much of its economy from oil to hydrogen within a decade for $ 100 billion – about what we spent in today ’s dollars to put a man on the moon .
Hydrogen is not without significant hurdles , but they are engineering issues , not scientific ones , which means they can be overcome with enough money .
Wind , solar and geothermal power and cellulosic ethanol , to name a few , also hold promise , and nuclear power can serve as a stopgap while they mature .
As we noted in " Why $ 5 Gas is Good For America , " all of these options grow more attractive – and viable – as the price of oil moves ever closer to $ 100 a barrel , and all of them should be pursued .
Market forces and other factors will sort out what ’s feasible and what ’s not .
The IEA says " we do not have the luxury of ruling out any of the options for moving the global energy system onto a more sustainable path , " and it ’s right .
It ’s time to move beyond oil .
Airliners 'n ' deathware behemoth Boeing announced yesterday that it had fitted a high - energy laser cannon aboard a C - 130 Hercules military cargo plane , creating a " Laser Gunship " .
The company expects to commence blasting " mission representative " test targets next year , firing deadly energy bolts from a " rotating turret that extends through the aircraft 's belly " .
Try making a cellphone call now , bitch .
This flying - raygun project is called the Advanced Tactical Laser ( ATL ) , as distinct from Boeing 's other aerial beam cannon effort - the jumbo - jet mounted Airborne Laser ( ABL ) .
The 747 laser is intended to fry enemy nuclear missiles lifting from their silos , and needs immense range and power - hence the requirement for a massive carrying aircraft .
The ATL Hercules blaster - weapon is seen more as a raygun for every day , zapping things or people during more routine battles as opposed to saving the USA from atomic destruction .
This should let it operate closer to its targets , reducing the weight of the system and thus the size of aeroplane required to carry it .
" The installation of the high - energy laser shows that the ATL program continues to make tremendous progress toward ... a speed - of - light , precision engagement capability that will dramatically reduce collateral damage , " said Boeing exec Scott Fancher .
" Next year , we will fire the laser at ground targets , demonstrating the military utility of this transformational directed energy weapon . "
Like the jumbo-ray , the ATL is a Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser ( COIL ) .
This means that it uses large amounts of hazmat fuel and produces similarly copious amounts of deadly toxic crap every time it gets fired .
However , Boeing reckon they have this covered .
The ATL's COIL is " closed - cycle " , keeping its deadly exhaust products contained .
The whole system supposedly weighs 20 tonnes , taking up most of a Hercules ' payload .
Exact specs on performance are hard to come by , but usually reliable sources have suggested useful ranges up to 10 or 20 km , and power outputs in the 100 kilowatt range - perhaps focused on an area only four inches wide .
Chemical fuel capacity for 100 useful blasts has been mentioned , after which the six - tonne sealed laser module would need draining , refuelling with chemicals and liquid - nitrogen coolant and probably maintenance too .
These dangerous , specialised activities would most likely have to be done by Boeing in the USA .
According to Boeing , the ATL's " final US Air Force exam will be twofold : to surgically destroy a communication tower and to disable a moving truck . "
The ability to knock out a cell tower or a truck silently and precisely from 10 km without collateral damage is mildly cool , but whether it 's cool enough for all this bother is questionable .
A sniper with a .50 calibre anti-material rifle can stop a truck from a helicopter nearby or a hide further off ; a cell tower can be shot out too , or jammed or spoofed .
A normal AC - 130 would seem at least as useful as a " Laser Gunship " , and considerably cheaper .
Even if Boeing can actually get it done , it 's hard to say that these tests would " demonstrate military utility " or show anything " transformational " . ®
BANGALORE , India ( AP )  A 2 - year - old girl who was born with four arms and four legs left a hospital in southern India on Saturday , little more than a month after surgeons successfully removed her extra limbs .
The surgeon who led more than 30 doctors in the marathon surgery said Lakshmi was making good progress and should be mobile soon .
" Lakshmi is fine and stable , " chief surgeon Dr. Sharan Patil told The Associated Press .
" She should face no problem in walking . "
Lakshmi was born joined at the pelvis to a " parasitic twin " that stopped developing in her mother 's womb .
The surviving fetus absorbed the limbs , kidneys and other body parts of the undeveloped twin .
A team of more than 30 surgeons performed a 24 - hour operation on Nov. 7 at the Sparsh hospital in Bangalore , the capital of southern Karnataka state .
They removed the extra limbs , transplanted a kidney from the twin and reconstructed Lakshmi 's pelvic area .
" Lakshmi is a hero , " Patil said Saturday .
" Lakshmi , who never turned ( over ) earlier , started turning after the surgery .
She was even able to stand for 10 minutes on the bed holding the window grill , which is remarkable , " the Press Trust of India news agency quoted Patil as saying .
Lakshmi's parents said they were taking her back to their rural village in eastern Bihar state where she had been revered by some as an incarnation of the four - armed Hindu goddess she was named after .

How To Start Playing With Ruby 1.9 Right Now !
By Peter Cooper
Ruby 1.9 is almost upon us !
With an expected release date around this Christmas , it wo n't be long until you can start to play with Ruby 1.9 and enjoy some of the much - hailed performance increases ( not to mention features ) .
" But I want it now ! " you say .
Well , as an open source project with an active ruby - core community working on a public code repository , it 's totally possible to get yourself a copy of Ruby 1.9 and begin playing with it today .
You can't expect to run production code on it and you should n't expect any code to be rock solid , but with the release date such a short time away , you might find it feels " close enough " now for you to really get knee - deep in the new features , and you know how great it 'll be to pull out some great new techniques later on when the rest of your co-workers are still upgrading ..
I 've just exported the latest version of Ruby 1.9 from the ruby - core trunk .
If you have SVN and you 're happy to do this too , follow the instructions given here , otherwise follow the instructions below to use my " no SVN required " technique :
Fire up your shell or terminal app .
Download and un-tar : http://s3.amazonaws.com/rubyinside/ruby1.9-trunk-2007-11-27.tar.gz
On some operating systems this is as simple as : wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/rubyinside/ruby1.9-trunk-2007-11-27.tar.gz
tar xzvf http://s3.amazonaws.com/rubyinside/ruby1.9-trunk-2007-11-27.tar.gz
Then get installing .. cd ruby1.9 - trunk
autoconf
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ruby1.9
make
sudo make install
By now you should have Ruby 1.9 installed in its own directory ( so it wo n't mess up your existing Ruby 1.8 install ) .
Do n't worry if an error crops up during documentation generation ( I get a " Bus Error " ) as the key items are already installed and ready to use like so :
/usr/local/ruby1.9/ruby -v /usr/local/ruby1.9/irb
Double check that you 're running the right version when you 're in IRB and try out a new feature :
iMac2007:ruby19 peter $ /usr/local/ruby1.9/bin/irb
irb ( main ) : 001:0 > Time.now.to_s
=> " 2007-11-27 20:15:44 +0000 "
irb ( main ) : 002:0 > Time.now.tuesday ?
=> true
Enjoy !
Give some of your usual Ruby apps a try if you like , run some performance tests , or check out this insanely detailed list of changes and new features in Ruby 1.9 .
Have a play , and if you find anything other readers might find interesting , leave a comment here at Ruby Inside !
We 've seen quite a few next - gen nav device concepts , but none with as much potential as the Virtual Cable , from a New Jersey company called Making Virtual Solid .
The system uses a laser , a set of lenses , and a moving mirror mounted in the dashboard to project a 3D route - guidance line above the road ahead , as though it 's actually out in front of the driver .
Besides making driving that much more like a video game , the company says mass - produced versions will cost somewhere around $ 400 as a factory - installed option , and can be easily interfaced with existing GPS systems .
Sadly , there do n't appear to be any live videos of the system in action , but judging from the number of patent applications and incredibly detailed schematics and explanations on the website , the vapor factor seems pretty low .
Check the read link for a set of video mockups of the system in action .
Beginning today , eight years of episodes of “ The Daily Show with Jon Stewart ” are fully accessible on the show ’s Web site .
Videos of every skit , every joke and every guest are available for free , fully searchable on TheDailyShow.com .
According to Comedy Central , 13,000 videos will be stored in the database .
In an interview today , MTV’s Erik Flannigan said he does n’t believe any other television program has opened its archives so freely on the Internet .
“ There are many many years of shows that have n’t been seen since the day they aired , ” said Mr. Flannigan , the executive vice president of digital for MTV Networks Entertainment Group .
“ It ’s not a show that would go on DVD and it ’s not a show that would go into syndication , so it ’s essentially been lost to history . ”
Now the content can live forever online .
While Web sites increasingly offer streaming versions of television shows , “ The Daily Show ” is unique because the videos have been made fully searchable through a system of tags .
Thanks to those tags , the site serves as a handy archive of correspondent reports : 301 videos are tagged with Steve Carell ’s name ; 187 are tagged Mo Rocca .
It also records years of jokes about newsmakers : a search for George W. Bush finds 844 videos ; a search for Al Gore returns 159 .
Mr. Flannigan said the show ’s writers and producers are thrilled to use it as a resource .
The video archive is part of a larger MTV strategy to create branded Web sites for popular shows .
“ With a show that ’s as deep and rich and such a part of the American zeitgeist as ‘ The Daily Show , ’ just having it live as a section of ComedyCentral.com does n’t do it justice , ” Mr. Flannigan said .
The new site incorporates banner advertisements , video commercials before and after a show excerpt , and advertising messages stripped across the bottom of the screen during the segments .
Tivo , Hyundai , and AT&T are launch sponsors for the new site .
Mr. Flannigan said videos from the Craig Kilborn era of “ The Daily Show ” will be added to the site early next year .
A similar site for “ The Colbert Report ” is also in development .
Galaxies are not distributed evenly throughout the universe .
Like the Local Group , they tend to be gathered in clusters , which are separated from each other by voids .
The bigger the void , the rarer it should be .
The problem with the great void is that it is so big it should n't exist .
Its size challenges the standard inflation model of how the universe developed after the big bang .
Laura Mersini-Houghton , of the University of North Carolina , caught the attention of the world 's cosmologists with a radical theory — radical to the layman perhaps — but in the bizarre world of quantum mechanics and big bang inflation theory , actually quite sensible .
" It is the unmistakable imprint of another universe beyond the edge of our own , " she told New Scientist .
" Any fluctuation leading to a void as big as ( this ) is exceedingly unlikely , according to standard cosmology . "
Dr Mersini-Houghton 's theory is based on the " multiverse " concept , the increasingly accepted idea that our universe is just one of many .
In the first split - second of its existence after the big bang , our universe and its neighbours were each the size of a sub-atomic particle .
Objects of that size are subject to quantum entanglement — they can affect each other 's properties even if they are physically separated .
Our tiny universe entangled itself with a neighbouring universe , the result of which is the great void .
" Such an entangled state remains for all time , " Dr Mersini - Houghton told New Scientist .
" So although inflation quickly pushed our region beyond the reach of neighbouring regions , it should still retain the imprint of its quantum entanglement with its neighbours … we are amazed that the void is there just as we predicted . "
The void is about 6 - 10 billion light years away in the constellation of Eridanus , which is visible from Melbourne .
Cosmologists believe that the tiny imperfections in the microscopic universe are directly reflected in the large - scale structures of galactic clusters and voids that we see today , so the idea of something sub-atomic causing a billion light - year void is actually quite reasonable .
But no models of the universe 's expansion predict a void as big as this .
" What we 've found is not normal , based on either observational studies or on computer simulations of the large - scale evolution of the universe , " said co-discoverer Liliya Williams , from the University of Minnesota .
Dr Mersini-Houghton 's entanglement theory offers a a way around this .
Nevertheless , she 's had a mixed reception among cosmologists .
" If it ( the void ) is real , then it could be the sign of something like this ( entanglement ) happening during the birth of the universe , " said astronomer Brian Schmidt , from the Australian National University .
" But it could have a multitude of other explanations … because we only get one look at the universe , so it is really hard to say if what we are seeing is really crazy , or just a statistical fluctuation . "
Karl Glazebrook , from the Centre for Astrophysics at Swinburne University , said the statistical evidence for the void was still in question .
" ( The discoverers ) have only looked at radio galaxies .
There could be problems with having enough data , there could be problems with the statistics . "
Professor Glazebrook said he did not accept the explanation that the void was evidence of another universe .

The Pareto Principle , also known as the 80 - 20 rule or the law of the vital few , is an observation that 80 % of the effects come from 20 % of the causes .
I often use the Pareto Principle in my job , primarily when we work on quality or process improvement projects .
A beautiful thing about Pareto is that we can apply it to almost anything .
Today , I will show you how to use the Pareto Principle to improve your finances .
The graph above shows a rough approximation of my categorized household expenses in percentages .
To follow along , you can set up your budget and list out the most expensive category to the least expensive .
You can do it in dollar amount or use percentages .
You can also group them in different categories .
It is all your choice !
You can also try online tools , such as Personal Capital , which will help you visualize your expenses automatically .
If you are disciplined about budgeting , you will have this number handy and can create a similar graph based on your budget categories .
Unlike typical budget numbers , this graph is organized from the highest to the lowest category .
What 80/20 Rule Revealed About My Finances
The graph ( also known as the Pareto Chart ) shows that 80 % of my expenses are in just six categories .
These are the six categories where I want to start making adjustments to improve my finances .
For example :
Mortgages –
Is there any opportunity to reduce my mortgage payments ?
Maybe refinancing my mortgage ?
What about downsizing ?
In general , you want to keep your total home - related expenses under 25 % — so I can make some improvements here .
– Is there any opportunity to reduce my mortgage payments ?
Maybe refinancing my mortgage ?
What about downsizing ?
In general , you want to keep your total home - related expenses under 25 % — so I can make some improvements here .
Taxes –
This is usually the biggest or second - biggest category .
However , this might not show up in your budget because most people start with their take - home pay and do not include deductions and withholdings in their budget .
Since I am self - employed and also own my own businesses , my budget keeps track of gross income and shows taxes .

Since I am self - employed and also own my own businesses , my budget keeps track of gross income and shows taxes .
Retirement Savings – Technically , saving for retirement is not an expense .
But I do recommend you keep track of this in your budget so you can see what percentage of your income goes toward retirement savings .
The recommended amount is 15 % of your gross income .
Again , I have some room to improve here .

Travel –
This is one thing my family spends more than we should on .
Also , it is bigger than a typical budget because we usually pay for both sets of parents to travel with us .

Child Related –
Our son attends public school for free , but there are several extracurricular activities that he is involved in .
Maybe it is time to spend less on these activities ?
What does your Pareto Chart reveal about your finances ?
Applying the Pareto Principle to Reduce Expenses
If you want to start improving your finances , the best place to start is in the few categories that make up your 80 %
Why ?
Let ’s assume you spend the same amount of effort and were able to reduce your expenses 10 % across the board ( which would be terrific ) .
On the 80 % side , you ’d realize a net saving of 8 % of your total budget , whereas the same 10 % on the 20 % side only saved you 2 % .
Here is another perspective .
If your total monthly expense is $ 5,000 and you need to shave off $ 500 .
It would be a much easier task to cut $ 500 from the 80 % side ( which is $ 4,000 in expenses ) vs. trying to cut $ 500 from the 20 % side ( which is $ 1,000 in expenses ) .
Based on the example above , I can put together a plan as follow :
Mortgages – Evaluate whether refinancing or downsizing would be a good option .
– Evaluate whether refinancing or downsizing would be a good option .
Taxes – Implement tax reduction ideas , perhaps by contributing more to retirement savings so that we can get more deductions .
– Implement tax reduction ideas , perhaps by contributing more to retirement savings so that we can get more deductions .
Retirement Savings – Look for opportunities to add more to retirement savings .
– Look for opportunities to add more to retirement savings .
Travel – Spend less money on travel .
May be replaced longer and overseas trips with local activities .
– Spend less money on travel .
May be replaced longer and overseas trips with local activities .
Home Improvements – A lot of the expenses in this category was a one - time thing , and I think this will go back down to the average level for the foreseeable future .
– A lot of the expenses in this category was a one - time thing , and I think this will go back down to the average level for the foreseeable future .
Child Related – Evaluate and see if there are any unnecessary expenses we can cut here .
* However , Pareto is n’t an excuse to ignore other expenses .
It is a great way to prioritize where to focus when we have limited resources — i.e. , time , money , energy , etc .
Bottom Line
The 80/20 Rule is a great tool that can be applied to just about anything .
If you have n’t considered it before , try using it on your budget and see if you can improve your finances with the Pareto Principle .
Try it and let me know what you think .
Murtha says the surge is working , while Hoyer says the public clearly backs the Democratic view of the war .
( Composite image by Politico.com ) Democrats : Voters shifting focus from Iraq
Congressional Democrats are reporting a striking change in districts across the country : Voters are shifting their attention away from the Iraq war .
Rep. Jim Cooper , a moderate Democrat from Tennessee , said not a single constituent has asked about the war during his nearly two - week long Thanksgiving recess .
Rep. Michael E. Capuano , an anti-war Democrat from Massachusetts , said only three of 64 callers on a town hall teleconference asked about Iraq , a reflection that the war may be losing power as a hot - button issue in his strongly Democratic district .

First - term Rep. Nancy Boyda ( D - Kan. ) — echoing a view shared by many of her colleagues — said illegal immigration and economic unease have trumped the Iraq war as the top- ranking concerns of her constituents .
In an interview with Politico , House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer ( D - Md. ) attributed the change to a recent reduction of violence and media coverage of the conflict , saying there is scant evidence that more fundamental problems with the Bush administration ’s policy are improving .
Even so , he agreed voters are certainly talking less about the war .
“ People are not as engaged daily with the reality of Iraq , ” Hoyer said .
The change in mood perceived by Democratic lawmakers comes as one of Congress ’ most vocal war critics , Rep. John P. Murtha ( D - Pa. ) , returned from a trip to Iraq and told reporters Thursday that “ the surge is working ” to improve security , even though the central government in Baghdad remains “ dysfunctional . ”
On Friday , Murtha , chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , clarified his remarks .
The surge , he said , “ has created a window of opportunity for the Iraqi government , ’’ which he added has “ failed to capitalize on the political and diplomatic steps that the surge was designed to provide . ”
“ The fact remains that the war in Iraq can not be won militarily , and that we must begin an orderly redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq as soon as practicable , ” Murtha said .
Rep. Norm Dicks ( D - Wash . ) , who traveled to Iraq with Murtha over the Thanksgiving break , also agrees the surge is working , adding another high - profile Democrat to the list of lawmakers who believe there has been improvement .
Like Murtha , though , Dicks still favors troop withdrawal and points out that political reconciliation in Iraq has been a failure .
“ There is a sense of normalcy you did n’t see before .
In that sense , the surge is being successful , ” Dicks said in an interview with the Seattle Times .
“ But there is no success on political reconciliation .
From that standpoint , it ’s not working . ”
The apparent shift in voter intensity about Iraq , also captured in some polls , shows how dramatically the political context of the war debate has changed from last summer .
Democrats believed then that mounting public pressure would soon force Republicans to take flight from President Bush , allowing Congress to impose a more rapid end to the war on an unwilling administration .
It has not happened yet , and if anything it shows Democrats are facing a stiffer challenge at year ’s end than they had at the beginning to frame the public debate on their terms .
Hoyer said the public clearly backs the Democratic view of the war : that it was a major foreign policy blunder that must be ended quickly .
That is true , based on dozens of public polls over the past year .
The diminished attention to Iraq , moreover , could end in an instant with a new burst of violence or other unfavorable turn of events .
For now , however , Democratic leaders are reckoning with a more complex , if fragile , reality both in Iraq and their congressional districts .
The military surge ordered by Bush over Democratic opposition is helping pacify pockets of Iraq , according to many official and journalistic accounts , with 175,000 U.S. troops showing at least temporary success in reducing violence and death .
Cooper , who represents a moderate Nashville - area district , said Democrats " should n't be against good news " in Iraq .
At the same time , even military planners fear the situation could quickly worsen once U.S. troop levels are reduced , or if delicately crafted ceasefires collapse .
For now , voters appear more upbeat as the war ’s progress than at any point this year .
The nonpartisan Pew Research Center for the People and the Press released a report this week showing that nearly half of Americans believe the military operation is going well — an 18 - point increase since February .
You have to go back to the days before the last election , in 2006 , to find Americans feeling this positively about the war effort .
Still , Democrats are showing no sign of backing down in their fight to demand a swift end to the war .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) on Thursday said Democrats would continue to resist President Bush ’s demand they immediately fully fund his $ 200 billion request to finance military operations .
Pelosi , in a strategy backed by party leaders in both chambers , is pushing for legislation that would provide $ 50 billion in exchange for a commitment to end the war in about one year .
Anti-war Democrats believe that voters are simply war - weary and have made up their minds about Iraq , so it might not be as hot an issue right now .
“ There used to be more [ questions about Iraq ] .
I ’m just not getting the calls , ” Capuano said .
“ It ’s not because the vehemence has gone down .
Ninety percent [ of my constituents ] are all against the war , but most people have checked this off as a major topic . ”
But the fact that Iraq might be slipping as top voter priority , coupled with clear strides in the security situation in Iraq , seems to have reduced the sense of urgency in the political debate .
In fact , Democrats are putting off further debate on the $ 196 billion supplemental spending bill until February .
Meanwhile , Democrats are planning to shift their attention to the economy when they return next week .
Democrats are considering holding an " economic summit , " and the first order of business in the House will be an energy bill , aimed at elevating discussion of environmental issues .
Boyda , who beat a conservative Republican last year , said : “ Generally the feeling in Kansas is get us out of the war but do n't do it so fast .
Do it responsibly . "
The large number of anti-war Democrats , who have been frustrated by their inability to impose limits on the war or end it outright , are concerned their efforts will lose steam as they wrap up the congressional sessions .
Some of those anti-war members worry the changing environment already has had negative consequences at the presidential campaign level .
“ They ’ve been fairly bland , certainly not bold , " said Rep. Lynne Woolsey ( D - Calif. ) , a leader in the Out of Iraq Caucus .
" Probably they want to be careful — the swing voter and all that .
But the swing voters want leadership . ”
One House Democratic aide summed up the challenge for the leadership , and admitted that it may be a smart move for Democrats to focus on the economy since they have n't been able to deliver on Iraq .
Republicans plan to exploit any cracks they see in the Democratic message .
“ Democrats made a strategic calculation last January that has proven to be dead wrong , ” said Kevin Smith , a spokesman for Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) .
“ Their message of failure and retreat makes little sense in light of our troops ’ remarkable progress , and the American people are responding to their successes . ”

Last week , software developer Cliff Biffle wrote a blog post pointing out certain discrepancies in the source code archive made available by Asus for the Linux - based software platform distributed on the Eee PC .
According to Biffle , the 1.8GB archive made available online by Asus following the launch of the Eee PC did not include changes made by the company to the asus_acpi kernel module .
Failing to provide the public with access to those changes could potentially constitute a violation of the General Public License ( GPL ) , the open source license under which the Linux kernel is distributed .
In response to criticism from Linux enthusiasts , Asus has made additional source code archives available for download with code for the asus_acpi module , BusyBox , and several other components .
The code released by Asus brings the company into compliance with its obligations under the GPL and should satisfy most of the critics .
The source code changes made by Asus are important because the availability of that code will simplify the process of making other Linux distributions perform better on the Eee PC .
GPL infringement lawsuits are very rare and are almost always settled outside of court .
In most cases , it seems like GPL violations are the result of negligence or misunderstandings rather than willful intent to misappropriate intellectual property .
Companies that are using code licensed under the GPL should consult with the Free Software Foundation or the Software Freedom Law Center if they need help understanding the implications of the GPL and the legal obligations implied by using GPL - licensed code .
KATHMANDU , Nepal ( CNN ) --
Rescuers were searching through the night Tuesday for hundreds of people who fell into a river after a footbridge collapsed during a religious festival in Nepal .
The bridge collapsed under the weight of hundreds of people , police said .
" The rescuers have not given up yet .
They 're still there , and they 're still looking for bodies , " journalist Manesh Shrestha told CNN from Nepal 's capital , Kathmandu .
The suspension bridge in remote Surkhet collapsed with as many as 1,000 Hindu pilgrims on it , police said .
While many swam to safety , about 200 people who were on the bridge were missing , police said .
Only 15 bodies had been recovered so far .
Rescuers took 20 women and 12 men to a hospital , police added .
While initial reports suggested the river 's currents were swift , photographs of the scene sent to CNN showed a relatively slow - flowing river .
However , Shrestha said the current is more swift below that point .

The pictures also showed the bridge was just a few yards above the water , contrary to earlier reports that it spanned a gorge with the river as far as 100 feet below .
Watch what rescuers are up against »
" The bridge collapsed because there were hundreds of people on it , " said Nepalese police officer Nibandha Budha .
" They had gone to the river for a three - day Hindu religious festival on the occasion of full moon . "
The 120 - yard - long bridge spanned the Bheri River in the Surkhet district , southwest of Kathmandu .
The river is fed by snow from the Himalayas .

Seven hundred to 1,000 people were on the bridge when it gave way , Budha said .
Many people were just standing on the bridge rather than crossing it , adding to the stress on the structure , Shrestha said .
He added that most of the people on the bridge were women and children , and that women in Nepal are not encouraged to learn how to swim .
The bridge linked two temples involved in the festival , which was in its final day , he said .
Nepalese soldiers , police officers and civilians were involved in the rescue effort , which was hampered by darkness and the remoteness of the location .
Nepal has been roiled by political upheaval since the early 1990s .
A Maoist insurgency that began in 1996 ended with a cease - fire in November 2006 .
The crown prince massacred 10 members of the royal family and killed himself in 2001 .
King Gyanendra fired the prime minister and cabinet in 2002 .
A government was established in 2004 but dissolved in 2005 .
The king retained absolute power until mass demonstrations led to a new parliament in April 2006 .
A new constitution that includes the Maoists took effect in January 2007 .
Shrestha said this year 's festival was the first since the conflict with the Maoists ended , and marked the first time in 10 years that festival - goers could move about freely , so attendance was larger than usual .

Wikileaks has published a second leaked Standard Operating Procedures manual that provides detailed instructions about how guards at Guantanamo's Camp Delta were instructed to treat detainees at the military prison in 2004 .
Like the 2003 Gitmo manual that Wikileaks published last month , this document is unclassified but still contains significant information about the isolation of prisoners , the use of dogs at Guantanamo , and forms of punishment for detainees .
Wikileaks editor Julian Assange has put together a handy side - by - side comparison showing changes between the 2003 and 2004 documents .
Wikileaks also published a second document this week that details instructions for dealing with rendition flights involving the air transport of detainees .
The document includes a diagram [ pictured above ] of an airplane used for renditions .
The document is fairly large and Wikileaks has n't had time to analyze it .
Therefore the organization is asking readers to help them review it and post interesting findings .
Have you been putting off the need to change hosting companies because of dreading the move of your WordPress database ?
For a static website a hosting change is no big deal , but things can be a little bit more involved for a database - driven site like a WordPress blog .
Fortunately , WordPress has an easy solution that can make it a fast , painless process .
When I started my WordPress blog I had no intentions or thoughts of large spikes of traffic from sites like Digg .
While our inexpensive hosting held up just fine under normal conditions , it was n’t sufficient for days with high traffic .
The obvious solution is to switch to a host that can handle higher volumes of traffic , but I was n’t very eager to move the blog .
Within the WordPress dashboard there is an import / export feature that makes this situation pretty routine .
The feature was created to help WordPress users migrate a blog from other platforms such as Blogger , Movable Type and TypePad , as well as to allow for moving from one WordPress blog to another .
( And even if you ’re not considering a move , it serves as a great backup option ) .
For moving from one host to another the process works like this :
When you are ready to make the switch , login to your current blog and go to Manage , Export ( see the 1st picture below ) .
Click on Download Export File and WordPress will create an XML file that they call eXtended RSS ( or WXR ) that serves as your backup .
Save this file somewhere on your hard drive .
Once your hosting has been switched and your site is on the new server , install WordPress in the same location as on your old server .
Login to WordPress and go to Manage , Import and choose WordPress .
Then click on Browse and find the XML file that you exported ( see the 2nd picture below ) .
Of course , you ’ll also have to upload whatever theme and plugins you were using on the old server ( and do n’t forget to set your permalinks to the same setting used on the old blog ) .
Export :
Import :
The whole process for my recent switch took about 5 minutes .
One additional step was needed with my new hosting company .
I had to edit the php.ini file to allow for an import of this size , but this will vary from host to host .
If you are having issues with this , the new hosting company should be able to help , although most hosts will provide little help for actually moving a database .
Another thing to consider is that the process is easier if you move to a host that offers a one - click WordPress installation .
Most hosts now offer this , some of them through services like Fantastico .
Otherwise the installation of WordPress will take a little bit more effort , but is still very feasible .
One thing I ’ve missed from Perforce since using Subversion is the “ p4 annotate - a ” command .
This annotates a file with the revisions that introduced each line , much like the “ svn blame ” command .
But the - a switch tells it to include every revision of every line .
This is a way of getting the complete history of the file in one textual output .
It ’s great for finding a snippet that you suspect existed somewhere in the file ’s past .
Blameall.py provides the same feature , but for Subversion .
For example , let ’s say you have a file with a number of revisions .
Revision 26 :
Shopping List
- Milk
- Bread
- Eggs
Revision 27 :
Shopping List
- Milk
- Juice
Revision 28 :
Shopping List
- Juice
- Cereal
- Ice Cream
Running blameall shows the history of the file in one series of lines :
$ python blameall.py shoplist.txt
26 27 28
26 head Shopping List
26 head
26 27 - Milk
26 26 - Bread
27 head - Juice
26 26 - Eggs
28 head - Cereal
28 head - Ice Cream
26 head
This shows us that “ Milk ” appeared in revision 26 and was present through revision 27 .
“ Shopping List ” appeared in 26 , and is still in the file in the head revision .
It can be slow to get all the revisions , but it ’s faster than manually searching through old revisions for that piece you know was back there somewhere .
You can provide a -r argument to blameall to limit its attention to a particular range of revisions .
Getting it
Blameall is a single - file Python script , no need to install anything .

Growing Hate Amsterdam to Study Gay Bashers
With the number of homophobic attacks rising in the Dutch metropolis , Amsterdam officials are commissioning a study to determine why Moroccan men are targeting the city 's gays .
AFP /AP
THEY cannot both be right .
For the Spanish prime minister , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , the European Union treaty agreed in Lisbon in the early hours of Friday October 19th will “ open new horizons ” for the EU , finally giving the 27 member block the international profile it deserves .
But Gordon Brown , attending his first EU summit as Britain 's prime minister , had earlier announced that the new “ reform treaty ” was a modest piece of housekeeping , that merely tweaks the way decisions are taken after a dozen new members have been absorbed in the past few years .
He called it clearly less significant than previous EU milestones such as the 1992 Maastricht treaty ( which ushered in the single European currency ) .
Neither man , of course , is a neutral judge of the new treaty 's heft .
For Mr Brown , minimising its importance helps him with some painful domestic politics , caused by his refusal to offer British voters a referendum on the new treaty ( crafted as a replacement for the EU constitution that was killed off by voters in French and Dutch referendums in 2005 ) .
The governments of other countries , including France and the Netherlands , have made similar arguments for avoiding fresh referendums .
That is to be expected : avoiding more popular votes was the sole rationale for crafting this new document , which reworks the bulk of the grandly worded constitution into the form of a dull and legalistic treaty .
All in all , it has not been Europe 's finest hour .
But the treaty has probably created something of substance , despite its furtive birth .
Two big innovations stand out , involving the creation of a pair of important new posts .
In years to come , the holder of one of these new posts has a good chance of becoming the answer to the famous question posed by Henry Kissinger : if a world power needs to talk to Europe , whom do they call ?
First , the new treaty will create a European foreign minister in all but name , beefing up a foreign - policy job currently held by a Spaniard , Javier Solana , who currently glories in the Euro - title of “ High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy ” .
As things stand , Mr Solana wields political clout as the representative of national governments , but lacks staff and funds , because the EU 's considerable aid budget and worldwide network of quasi-embassies is controlled by the bureaucratic arm of the EU , the European Commission .
The new quasi - foreign minister ( whose title will continue to be High Representative ) will work for both national governments and the commission , giving him money , a diplomatic corps , and political power .
The new foreign supremo will have a rival , however .
The Lisbon treaty creates a new post of an EU president .
More properly , the new office - holder will be the standing president of the European Council ( the body that represents national leaders ) .
The holder will probably be a European former head of government , elected by serving heads for a two - and - a - half - year term , renewable once .
The new president will chair all summits , ending the current system which sees nations taking six - month - long turns to preside over EU leaders ' gatherings .
For Euro - enthusiasts , a “ Mr Europe ” would fill an important vacancy in the global diplomatic order .
He would “ permit us to better transmit our values and affirm our role as defenders of peace on the international scene , ” Mr Zapatero wrote in the French newspaper , Le Figaro , this week .
To many Europeans , that sounds like code for : someone must speak for the Western democratic world , who is not America .
Europe has advanced , in the past , by taking the view “ build it and they will come ” , which means creating new posts and institutions , and hoping that political unity catches up with those structures .
Yet creating unity in foreign policy is harder , arguably , than anything that the EU has tried before ( nobody has forgotten how the invasion of Iraq left the continent horribly divided ) .
The Lisbon treaty may yet be seen as more than a painful footnote , but doubts remain about whether this is the moment that finally establishes the EU as a big diplomatic player .

This is many more than had been expected , including big differences that extend far beyond the single - letter changes that account for much of the variation seen so far .
“ I think the biggest surprise is we are lot more different from one another than we thought , ” Venter said in a telephone interview .
But there are still some mysteries .
“ I found out that I have a high probability of having blue eyes , ” the blue - eyed Venter said in a telephone interview .
“ You ca n’t even tell with 100 percent accuracy if I would have blue eyes , looking at my genetic code , ” he laughed .
“ We all thought that would be simple . ”
The researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Maryland , along with teams at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and the University of California San Diego , analyzed Venter ’s genetic code to compare it with the rival human genome maps published in 2001 by Venter ’s private company and the publicly funded Human Genome Project .
Both the 2001 genomes used DNA from several volunteers , pooled and then sequenced .
Writing in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Biology , the researchers said it would also be useful as a rare exercise to thoroughly examine a single person ’s genome and compare it to these averages .
DISPELLING FEAR
James Watson , who helped discover the double - helix structure of DNA in 1953 , has also had his personal genome sequenced and is offering it to other scientists for study .
Both Venter and Watson have said they wanted to serve as examples to a public often afraid of genetic sequencing , in part for fear of being denied jobs or insurance coverage and in part because of privacy concerns .
One thing the researchers wanted to find was if an individual ’s risk for disease could be discerned just by looking at his or her genes .
Only for a few illnesses is this a certainty .
Huntington ’s disease is one -- if a person carries the mutated Huntington ’s gene , he or she will develop the deadly and incurable disease .
But most other diseases are the result of a more complex interaction between genes and environment .
Venter , 61 , said his father died at the age of 59 of sudden cardiac arrest .
Venter has versions of three genes believed to lower the risk of heart disease and carries two copies of a gene mutation that raise the risk of a heart attack , the study found .
Venter said he started taking a cholesterol - lowering statin drug years ago , even though his cholesterol levels were below those recommended for taking such medications .
“ I do n’t have to have a 100 percent chance of heart disease to think of taking preventative measures , ” Venter said .
His mother is 84 and still active , he noted .
“ Knowing something does n’t change what ’s in our genetic code .
But knowing things maybe gives us a chance to change what could be part of our genetic destiny , ” Venter said .
MUCH effort is quietly going into the pursuit of what is probably the world 's greatest store of fossil fuel — caches of methane , the primary component of natural gas , stored in structures called methane hydrates , or clathrates ( a general term for gas molecules trapped by water molecules ) .
Looking just like ice , they are methane molecules trapped within tiny cages of water molecules .
They form where temperatures are low and pressures are high , which is to say , on the sea - floor at the continental shelves , and within the permafrost at the Earth 's poles .
As with all fossil - fuel resources , it is hard to estimate just how much methane is trapped in clathrates worldwide .
But there is a lot .
One litre of clathrates can hold more than 150 litres of methane .
Numerous deposits have been identified off the coasts of all of the continents .
Even a few of the lakes in Central Asia are just frosty enough to support clathrate formation .
Some guess that clathrate methane reserves could equal twice the rest of the world 's fossil fuel supplies combined .
America 's National Energy Technology Laboratory put together a consortium of other government agencies and petroleum companies to drill for clathrates with some success in the Gulf of Mexico ; they were promptly hired by India to perform the trick there .
A Japanese government collaboration has drilled about 30 wells , with a timeline to start production and distribution of methane from hydrates by 2016 .
In June China reported having pulled up some first methane - bearing samples from the South China Sea .
All of this might sound like the beginnings of the solution to the world 's energy problems .
And it may yet be .
But , as always , there are some daunting details to sort out first .
Many deposits will yield just a fraction of the hoped - for methane , and harvesting even that will be difficult .
The little cages of water around the methane are dangerously delicate , so that collection has to take place on the sea - floor .
Much work is now under way on adapting conventional drilling equipment for large - scale deep - sea methane recovery .
Clathrates are suspects in a number of geo-crimes great and small .
Mixed with sea - floor sediment , they can constitute vast unstable deposits prone to underwater landslides .
Such a landslide 8000 years ago in the North Sea created a tsunami that flooded much of coastal Scotland and Norway .
Vast releases of methane from clathrates are widely thought to have played a part in two global temperature spikes that led to mass extinctions about 250 m and 55 m years ago
And , given their delicate nature , clathrates tend to release their methane bounty during these landslides .
Methane is the cleanest of the fossil fuels when burned ; but released directly into the atmosphere , it is a “ greenhouse gas ” significantly more potent than carbon dioxide .
Vast releases of methane from clathrates are widely thought to have played a part in two global temperature spikes that led to mass extinctions about 250 m and 55 m years ago .
Because the icy slush left over after methane removal is less structurally stable than the clathrates , stripping the seafloor of some of its methane might result in frequent landslides that release much more methane .
Many clathrate deposits sit atop grand reservoirs of free gas , so that drilling might unleash a methane burp of enormous size , with environmental impacts to match .
One brilliant - sounding idea , now being studied , calls for pumping carbon dioxide into the clathrates .
The carbon dioxide would make the clathrates more stable ; and , its presence would case them to give up their methane , sequester the carbon dioxide , and let off a little heat that kept the reaction going .
The technological challenge is vast , but no more so than the potential economic rewards .
The trick is to get the gas , without the pains .
Ruby on Rails でのモックとスタブの作 成
RSpec、Mocha、そして Flex Mock に関する Ruby のテスト戦 略
私が前回 RSpec に関する記事を公開した後、何人かの読者が、RSpec ではモック・オブジェクトはどんな風になるのかと質問してきました。正直に言うと、前回はモック作成用フレームワークの話題を意図的に避けたのです。
RSpec チームでは、モック作成用フレームワークの構築と保守のための投資を続けるべきか、あるいは既存のフレームワークの
1 つを採用すべきかについて、内部で少し議論がありました。この記事ではスタブとモックを作成するための基本を、順を追って説明します。そしてスタブの作成とモックの作成の両方の例を、一般的な
3 つの Ruby フレームワークを使って説明します 。
問題
テストを自動化するための、ほとんどすべての戦略は、いくつかの基本的な概念に基づいています。テストは下記の条件を満足する必要があります。
反復可能なこと。テストを自動化する場合には、テスト結果を検証できるように、テスト・ケースは毎回同じ結果を返す必要があります。
実行時間が短いこと。テスト・ケースの実行に時間がかかりすぎるようだと、テスト・ケースを実行しなくなるのでテスト・ケースが役に立ちません。
単純なこと。テストの作成が難しすぎると、テストを作成しなくなります。
こうした条件をテストが満足する必要があることから、優れたプログラマーはアプリケーションの実行に時間がかかる部分や、予測できない部分、あるいは複雑な部分を置き換えるための方法を探します。長年の経験の積み重ねによって、この業界はシステムのさまざまな部分を置き換えるための方法として、少なくとも 2 つの重要な手法を確立しています。これは建築業者が建設中の構造物を支えるために一時的な支持物を構築するのと似ています。
モックはスタブではありません
約 4 年前、ThoughtWorks の Martin Fowler が、Mocks Are n't Stubs ( モックはスタブではありません ) という有名なブログ・ポストを公開しました
( 「 参考文献」にリンクがあります ) 。それから 4 年経ちましたが、大部分の開発者は相変わらずこの 2 つの概念を混同しています。(話がそれますが、もしかすると私達は、これらの概念の表現としては不適切な言葉を選んでしまったのかもしれません。しかし今や、これらの言葉を使わざるをえません。) では、「 たとえ話」を使って 2 つの概念を明確にしてみましょう。
毎年クリスマスには、私と妻はクリスマス・ツリーを取り出し、それに飾り付けをします。ツリーの飾り付けは楽しい思い出となる作業のはずですが、私にとっては悪夢です。私は電球と格闘しなければなりません。毎年、電球がいくつか切れてしまい、その電球がついた電線の他の電球まで点灯しなくなってしまいます。実際には、作業は簡単です。切れている電球を探せばよいのです。点灯しない電球を含んだ電線を、1 つずつ電球をテストしながらたどっていきます。各電球のテストは、少なくとも 2 つの方法で行うことができます。この 2 つの方法が、スタブを作成する方法とモックを作成する方法に似ているのです。
スタブの作 成
私は、電線に付いている電球を、点灯する電球まで含めて
1 つずつ取り外して交換する必要はないことを学習しました。複数の電球が切れている可能性がありますが、1 つずつ電球を交換する代わりに、1 つずつ電球をテストするのです。テストには 2 つの方法が有効です。最初の方法は、電球を 1 つ外し、ちょっとした電池駆動のライトにつけてみます。もし点灯すれば、その電球には問題はなく、次の電球に進むことができます。もし点灯しなければ、その電球をハンマーでたたき潰し、点灯する電球と交換します。私が何をしているのか、理解できると思います。私は複雑に電球が接続された電線を、ずっと単純な装置で置き換えているのです。次に、電球に電気を通してチェックし、結果を観察し、そしてそれによってテストの合否を判断します。
さて、この電球を、クラスまたはコンポーネントと考えてみてください。このオブジェクトを使用するクライアント・コードは、電球付きの電線です。ソケットはインターフェースです。スタブを作成する場合はインターフェースを保持しますが、テスト対象のオブジェクトに対するクライアント・コードの一部あるいは全部を置き換えます。
モックの作 成
モック・オブジェクトも似ていますが、もう少し複雑です。もし私が電球をテストする装置を持っていなかったら、テスター
( 回路計 ) と呼ばれるツールを気軽に使うことができます。テスターは、電球に電気が流れるかどうかを計測します。このプロセスは似ています。1 つずつ電球を外し、電球にテスターの 2 本の電極を当ててテストします。テスターはその回路に少量の電気を供給し、電気が流れるかどうかを計測します。少し頭を働かせてみれば、この計測で実際に行っていることは、電球がその回路をどう利用しているかをテスターで測定している、ということがわかります。つまりモック・オブジェクトは一種のスタブです。モック・オブジェクトは、テスト対象のオブジェクトを使用するクライアント・コードを置き換えます。しかしモック・オブジェクトはそれ以上のことを行い、テスト対象のオブジェクトがクライアント・コードを実際にどう使うかを測定するのです。
データベース・スタブは、クエリーへの応答として偽のレコードを返します。モックも同じことをしますが、モック・データベース・オブジェクトは、そのクライアント・コードがある種の一連のクエリーを呼び出し、最終的には close を呼び出して接続を閉じたことまで確認します。インターフェースの使い方をテストする場合にはモックを、インターフェースの使い方をまったく気にしない場合にはスタブを使う必要があります。
欠点
スタブを作成する方法とモックを作成する方法は強力な手法であり、テスト・ケースに要する時間が短くなり、コードを分離し、テストを単純化し、そして
( 一部の人は信じていますが ) 世界の飢餓を解決します。しかし、そこには必ず大きな「ただし書き」があることに注意してください。モックとスタブを作成する際には、実際のコードを置き換えすぎないように注意する必要があります。私は、最終的に実際のコードに似せて何でもスタブ化してしまった顧客を数多く見てきています。ある時点で、やっかいなデータベース・コードをアプリケーションの他の部分と合わせてテストする必要があることを忘れないでください。皆さんにも注意しておきます。
スタブ作成の基 本
どのようなフレームワークに対してどのようなスタブを作成する場合も、基本的な方法は同じです。下記の 2 つを行う必要があります。
テスト・ケースの中で、実際のシステムの一部をスタブで置き換える。
対象とする、実際の動作をスタブの中に複製する。
オブジェクト全体を置き換える場合もあれば、あるいは単に 1 つのメソッドの結果を変更するだけの場合もあります。オブジェクト全体を置き換える場合は簡単で、新しいオブジェクトを作成してテスト・ケースの中で置き換えるだけです。一部の言語では、メソッドの結果を変更するのは難しいかもしれません。しかし
Ruby のような動的言語を使えば、メソッドを再定義するだけなのでスタブの作成は容易です。やれやれ、この理論は少し抽象的になりすぎました。今度は、こうした概念を現実にします。
文書を印刷するユーザー・インターフェースがあるとしましょう。印刷の失敗を処理するコードをテストしたいとします。print
メソッドが呼び出されるかどうかは気にしません。コードが実際に print を呼び出すかどうか、失敗した print をコードが適切に処理するかどうかのみを検証したいとします。この場合の擬似コードの文がどんな風になるかを考えてみてください。
文書オブジェクトのインスタンスに対して print メソッドのスタブを作成し、偽を返す。
この文は 2 つの部分に分割することができます。最初の部分はスタブを作成したい対象を特定します。2 番目の部分はスタブが何をすべきかを定義します。では、このスタブを
3 つのフレームワークを使って作成しましょう。
Mocha / Stubba
現在のところ、モックとスタブを作成するための最高のフレームワークの
1 つは Mocha です 。Mocha は gems を使って簡単にインストールすることができます。
リスト 1 . Mocha をインストールす る
batate$ gem install mocha Bulk updating Gem source index for : http://gems.rubyforge.org
Successfully installed mocha-0.5.5
Installing ri documentation for mocha -0.5.5 ... Installing RDoc documentation for mocha-0.5.5 ...
Mocha のデモンストレーションを行うためにはアプリケーションが必要です。リスト 2 のアプリケーションは、 Document というモデル と View というビューで構成されています。このユーザー・インターフェースは印刷を
Document に委任します 。
リスト 2 . document.rb によるアプリケーション
class Document def print # does n't matter -- we are stubbing it out end end class View attr : document def initialize ( document ) @document = document end def print ( ) if document .
print puts " Excellent ! " true else puts " Bummer . " false end end end
Document クラスを結局スタブにしてしまうので、このクラスにはシェルを作成する以上の手間はかけません。実際、スタブ作成用フレームワークの大きな利点の
1 つは、少しずつ追加しながらテスト駆動開発を行えることです。この場合では、ユーザー・インターフェースを作成するために完全な
Document モデルを持つ必要はありません 。
リスト 3 はテスト・ケースを示しています 。
リスト 3 . Mocha を使ってテストす る
require ' test /unit ' require ' rubygems ' require ' mocha ' require ' document ' class ViewTest < Test :: Unit :: TestCase def test_should_return_false_for_failed_print document = stub ( " my document " ) document.stubs ( : print ) .returns ( false ) ui = View.new ( document ) assert_equal false , ui.print end end
この動作は理解できると思います。 stub ( " my document " ) という命令を使って、単純な、名前付きのスタブ・オブジェクトを作成します。次に、 document.stubs ( : print ) .returns ( false ) というコード行によって、印刷動作をこのスタブ内で定義しています。注意深く見ると、このコード行は先ほどの擬似コードと驚くほど似ています。
文書オブジェクトのインスタンスに対して print メソッドのスタブを作成し、偽を返す。
このテスト・メソッドの最初の 2 行は、下記のように 1 行に単純化することができます。
リスト 4 . テストを単純化する
Document.any_instance.stubs(:print).returns ( false )
リスト 4 のバージョンは、 print 用のスタブ を Document クラスの任意のインスタンスに置き換えています 。Ruby フレームワークの中でスタブを作成することによる便利な点の
1 つは、構文は少し変更が必要であっても、基礎となる概念と構造はまったく同じに維持されることです。
Flex Mock でスタブを作成す る
Flex Mock も Mocha と同じように、よく使われるモック作成用フレームワークです。rake など日常的に使用す る
Ruby ツールの作成者として有名な Jim Weirich が、Ruby のテストでの基本的なモックとスタブの作成を行うために
Flex Mock を作成しました。人気と実用性の点で 、Mocha と Flex Mock は非常に似ています 。Flex Mock のインストールは、gems ( これも Jim Weirich のプロジェクトです ) を使えば簡単です 。
リスト 5 . Flex Mock をインストールす る
gem install flexmock
flexmock メソッドを使ってスタブを作成することができます。そしてスタブを作成したいメソッドの名前をキーとし、値を戻りとするハッシュを与えます。スタブの作成はリスト 6 のように行います 。
リスト 6 . Flex Mock を使ってスタブを作成す る
require ' rubygems ' require ' test/unit ' require ' flexmock/test_unit ' require ' document ' class ViewTest < Test :: Unit :: TestCase def test_should_return_false_for_failed_print document = flexmock ( : print => false ) ui = View.new ( document ) assert_equal false , ui.print end end
構文は少し異なりますが、概念はまったく同じです。ここでは document を、 print に対して false を返す単純化したスタブで置き換えています 。
RSpec
RSpec では Mocha と Flex Mock の両方が使えることを忘れないでください。とは言うものの、RSpec でスタブを作成するための構文は Mocha と似ています。リスト 7 はその方法を示しています 。
リスト 7 . RSpec でスタブを作成す る
document.stub !( : print).and_return( false )
この構文は 、Mocha の構文と驚くほど似ています 。RSpec に関して判断が必要となる主なポイントは、間もなく非推奨となる可能性のある
API を使うか、あるいは別のテスト・フレームワークを RSpec に追加するかどうか、という点です。現状では、RSpec の良いところの 1 つは 、RSpec がテスト用のワンストップ・ショップであることで、RSpec は重要な懸念事項をすべて処理してくれます。しかし
Mocha と RSpec の構文を並べて比較してみると 、RSpec テスト・ケースの中で Mocha を使っても失うものは少ないことに異論はないでしょう。
モック作成の基 本
ここまでで学んだように、モック・オブジェクトの作成は、スタブの作成とよく似ています。違いは、スタブは受動的であるということです。スタブは、スタブの作成対象のメソッドに対して呼び出しを行う実在のソリューションを単にシミュレーションするにすぎません。一方モックは能動的であり、モック・オブジェクトを使って行うその方法を実際にテストします。想定の動作と一致する方法でモックを使わないと、テストは失敗します。下記はモックを使う場合の基本的なステップです。
テスト・ケースの中の、実際のシステムの一部をスタブで置き換える。
対象とする、実際の動作をスタブ内に複製する。 想定の動作を定義する。 テストの後、実際に起きたことを想定の動作と比較する。
テスターとクリスマス電球の話を思い出してください。私は、テスト対象のオブジェクトを表す電球を外しました。そして実際のアプリケーションを表す、たくさんの電球がついた電線を、テスト対象のオブジェクトを表すテスターで置き換えました。私は 2 つの暗黙のステップを定義する必要があります。まずはテスターを使用しました。その理由は、電球が切れていないかどうかテスターの針が示してくれることを期待したからです。そして私はテスト結果としてテスターを見ました。これらの暗黙のステップが、ステップ 3 とステップ 4 を表しています。実際には、通常はテスト・ケースが完了すると、テスト・フレームワークがステップ 4 を処理します。この文書印刷アプリケーション用のモック・オブジェクトを記述する擬似コードは次のようになります。
document オブジェクトに対して 、( 偽を返す ) print メソッドへの呼び出しを想定する 。
Mocha 、Flex Mock、そして RSpec を使ったモックの作 成
ある概念を 1 つの文で表現できる場合には、その概念を 1 行か 2 行の Ruby コードで実装できることが多いものです。リスト 8 は、リスト 4 のスタブをモックに変更する、信じられないほど単純な Mocha コードを示しています 。
リスト 8 . テストを単純化する
Document.any_instance.expects(:print).once.returns( false )
ここでは私の想定を反映させるためにメソッド stubs を expects に変更しました。またクライアント・コードが print を何度呼び出す必要があるかを示すために once メソッドを追加しました。このテスト・ケースは、テスト対象のアプリケーションが
Document クラスの任意のインスタンスに対して print メソッドを正確に 1 度だけ呼び出すと成功し、それ以外の場合は成功しません。
モックの作成を実装するための Flex Mock のコードは Mocha の場合とほとんど同じですが、メソッド名は少し異なります。リスト
9 はその違いを示しています。
リスト 9 . Flex Mock を使ったモックの作 成
document = flexmock ( " my document " ) document.should_receive(:print).times(1).and_return( false )
そしてリスト 10 は同じことを RSpec で行った場合を示しています 。
リスト 10 . RSpec を使ったモックの作 成
document = mock ( " my document " ) document.should_receive(:print).and_return( false )
これらのモック作成用フレームワークにはかなりの数の修飾子を追加することができ、呼び出しパラメーターや、呼び出し回数に対する想定を指定することができます。スタブやモックを作成する対象となりうるのは、オブジェクト全体や、あるオブジェクトの 1 つのメソッド、あるいはクラスのメソッドなどです。私としては、少なくとも非推奨に関する議論が少し収まるまで、モックの作成には
Flex Mock または Mocha を使うことをお勧めします 。
まとめ
過去 2 年間 、Ruby を積極的に使ってきた人であれば、高度なテストの概念に巨大な投資が行われていることに気付いたはずです。一部のテスト・ツールは昔からありますが、今や非常に多くの人がテスト・ツールに注目し始めています。熱狂的な
Ruby 主義者がさらにテスト・ケースを開発するにつれ、モックを作成するような手法は、もっと一般的になるでしょう。
Ruby のコーディングを行うすべての人にとって、スタブやモックを作成する方法は貴重な方法です。「テスト・ファースト」主義の開発者は、完全に開発されていないインターフェースのモックを作成できる機能を便利だと思うでしょう。実行に時間のかかるテスト・スイートを抱えるプログラマーは、スタブとモックを使えばコストの高いインターフェースを除外することができます。すべてのテスターは、これらの手法を使ってテストに関する予測を立てられるようにする必要があります。
ここでは 、Ruby のモック作成を行うライブラリーを延々と説明する代わりに、モック作成の背後にある概念を説明しました。また、一般的な
3 つのモック作成を行うライブラリーを簡単に調べました。これらの概念が初めての人は、まだまだ多くのことを学ぶ必要がありますが、先に進むための十分な基礎はできたはずです。いつものことですが、さらに学ぶための最善の方法はコーディングすることです。

Last year I consulted to an IT project of about one hundred and twenty people working on it .
The company did n't have enough space in their offices to house the project , so they leased a large , local office .
Unfortunately , the only space available locally that could accommodate the project was an open office which had previously been a call center .
It was n't the ideal workplace for the team , but they " made do . "
The one thing people struggled with most was the canteen food — they hated it .
Everyone moaned about it , yet most ate it because there were no alternatives nearby .
Some people made do by bringing their lunch in from home , others coped by moaning , and others just ate the chips and then took an after - lunch nap when they got back to their desks .
As you read this , I bet you 're forming an image of the canteen in your mind .
Perhaps you imagine a bunch of canteen staff and management who do n't care - how could they serve such food otherwise ?
Perhaps you 're annoyed at the project 's management who did n't seem to care — how could they let things get so bad ?
That 's what I thought when I first visited the office , but it turned out I was completely wrong .
In turn , I also rediscovered something that 's useful for software developers .
The canteen staff and management did care ( as did the project 's management , but I 'll come back to them later ) .
The guy who ran the canteen — a nice chap called Graeme — was a very engaging guy who always gave great service .
One day , he told me that he was genuinely hurt because his boss kept getting negative comments back from my colleagues about the quality of his canteen 's food .
Yet , Graeme was proud of what his team accomplished given the severe budget constraints they were under .
He said that he'd love to do better , but this was n't the Ritz and his hands were tied .
He said that they 'd put out a comments and suggestions box a few weeks earlier , but he got little feedback .
They 'd added a few items to their breakfast menu that sold OK , but they did n't make a big difference to their takings .
They 'd also started serving special meals .
They were a little bit more expensive than the normal meals , which they were contractually obliged to sell at low prices , but they 'd been quite popular despite being more expensive .
I nodded as I chewed over what he'd just said .
They had put on special BLT Panini for lunch , and , although they were n't spectacular by high - street standards , a few of my colleagues had commented that they were nice which I relayed to Graeme .
He said he was pleased but he did n't look all that cheered up .
I felt sorry for him , but I did n't know what to say .
There was an awkward silence that I felt I had to fill , so I burst out , " You know what Graeme ?
I 'd quite happily pay more if the food were , um , more up - market . "
I was surprised by my comment , and so was Graeme .
" Pay more ? "
" Yes , and I bet a lot of the people I work with would , too . "
" Pay more ? " he asked again .
" Yeah , " I added , realizing that I was on to something .
" And you know the coffee you sell ?
I 'd quite happily pay five times what you currently charge if it were good , strong espresso . "
" You do n't like the instant stuff ? "
" Not really . "
He told me that they 'd tried selling good , expensive coffee in the previous year , when the same office space was used as a call center , but no one bought it .
And that was then the light dawned .
Our project 's facilities department was still operating on the lease set up when call center staff was the main user of the canteen .
When my client 's facilities managers negotiated the lease , they specifically negotiated low canteen prices in order to keep their staff costs down .
The problem was that what the call center staff thought of as " good value , " the more highly paid IT folk thought of as " cheap slop . "
In coffee terms the canteen service was n't even offering the " small " cup , let alone the super - sized cappuccino topped with whipped - cream .
They were annoying their customers with poor choices and losing money because of it .
Without using the words " cheap slop , " I explained my theory to Graeme .
He thought for a moment then said that , in that case , he was sure that he could find a way to sell more " up market " food at a higher price which would keep us happy with new choices , and , at the same time , continue selling the " value range " items which some of his customers still wanted and which he was contractually obliged to sell .
His eyes glazed over for a moment as ( I suspect ) he worked out how the higher margins from the up - market food would positively affect his canteens profits .
I 've since done the numbers and since most of his costs are fixed , not matter how many customers they served , Graeme could easily have doubled his profits even if only one in five of his customers " upgraded " to the higher margin products .
So , what 's this got to do with the world of software development ?
Well , to start with , I think you get a lot more work done if you have access to good quality food and facilities and if you feel like you 're working for someone who cares about you , but that 's not why I wrote this article .
Also , I find it fascinating how digging down into the causes of problems by politely asking " Why ? " a few times can help you lead to false or no-longer - valid assumptions and then to simple improvements — but you already knew that .
No , the reason why this is important is that if you , like Graeme 's canteen , serve many customers , but you only charge one price then you may be charging some customers less than they 're happy to pay — or charging others more than they are willing to pay .
Just like Graeme , you need to find a way of charging different prices for your product so that you not only make as much money as you can , but you keep your customers happy .
Marketers call this " customer segmentation . "
Look around and you 'll see that this is common business practice — one that we all benefit from .
A few years ago in the UK , Microsoft released a low - price home — and — student version of Microsoft Office .
By doing so , they made it possible for students and home users to use their products at a reasonable cost , and Microsoft made more money .
It was , in other words , a win for both parties .
Airlines have been doing similar for decades , charge massively different prices for two seats next to each other on the same flight depending , often , on how far in advance the flight was booked ; they also charge much higher prices for business and first class seats , giving their customers the opportunity to pay more or less , according to their budgets .
Some big -iron computer makers are reputed to have done the same by selling two versions of the same mainframe — one high powered , one low powered — where the only physical difference between the two was an additional component which slowed down the otherwise full - powered machine .
Supermarkets sell their " own brand " products at much lower prices than the better known but similar big - brand products .
So what can you do ?
If you sell a software product but only give your customers one price , then consider how you can charge a variety of prices for the same product — perhaps an individual version , a professional version , and a corporate version .
Perhaps the individual version is a free , but less powerful version of the fully featured professional version , and the corporate version adds on the ability to use corporate databases .
If you 're used to treating all of your customers alike , you 'll have to start treating each market segment differently — they 'll each have different budgets , priorities , and needs from your product .
Wherever you work , whatever your role , you may find it profitable to sit down for fifteen minutes with a nice strong cup of coffee and a couple of blank sheets of paper .
Ask yourself , " Who are my customers ? " , " What do I offer them ? " , and " How are they different ? "
Jot down your answers .
Then talk to your customers and colleagues and ask them the same questions .
Jot down their answers .
You may be pleasantly surprised by the results .
The same idea applies even if you work in a corporate IT department .
The project I mentioned at the start of this article is a good example .
Like many software projects , when this team spoke of " the customer , " they referred to the dozen or so " subject matter experts " who worked with the IT team to identify then flesh out the project 's requirements and features .
The subject matter experts knew their business well and were easy to work with , but they were n't the only customer and they were n't paying for the project .
One of the project 's biggest problem was that the designated customers would eventually have to work with the resulting software .
They kept ordering the super - sized white - chocolate frappuccino when their bosses only had budget for a tall americano , also known as the " minimum viable solution . "
The project ran into major difficulties until the two customer segments aligned their requirements .
Say you work as a freelancer ( or contractor here in the UK ) and you 're finding it hard to find work in the current economy ?
Try segmenting your customers .
If you normally work on longer term contracts and that work has dried up , then ask yourself if there are potential customers out there , perhaps with smaller budgets , who can't afford to hire you long term , but could pay to have smaller pieces of work done .
If you do n't know how to find these potential customers then ask your friends and family if they can ask their work colleagues if they know of any such work .
A few weeks of good work ending with a satisfied customer may well lead to more work with the same customer , to a reference site , or to another recommendation .
When a three - month court deadline to remove the entire monkey population expired in June , a member of the enforcement committee asked for an extension , arguing that it was cruel to capture the animals during the summer because so many were pregnant then .
The monkeys that were caught were held in specially built structures at the edge of the city , while officials waited for a deal to be negotiated with neighboring states so they could be released into forest areas far from the capital .
But those states refused to take the refugees , and the animals remained in captivity , enraging wildlife protection agencies , until a disused mine area on the fringe of the city was declared a sanctuary .
The lawyer charged by the High Court with ensuring the monkeys ’ removal said recently that things were as bad as ever , even in some leading hospitals .
“ They attack patients who are being rolled inside the hospital , pull out IV tubes and scamper off to drink the fluids , ” the lawyer , Meera Bhatia , told Indian journalists .
It took the death of the deputy mayor to inject new vitality into the removal drive .
The mayor , Aarti Mehra , said in a telephone interview that “ after the incident , the process has really speeded up . ”
Already , she said , 35 municipal monkey catchers have been hired , divided into five teams across the city .
Over the next few months , a total of 100 will be working in 14 teams , she said .
She estimated , however , that 20,000 to 25,000 monkeys still had to be caught .
Part of the difficulty lies in people ’s ambivalence toward the animals , she added .
On Tuesdays and Saturdays , followers of the Hindu monkey god , Hanuman , risk being fined to feed the monkeys .
“ We have a serious problem because of our religious ways , ” Ms. Mehra said .
“ People feed them liberally .
But they do attack .
In the past three years , there have been 2,000 cases of monkey bite in Delhi . ”
In fact , a wild monkey went on a rampage in a low - income neighborhood of the capital on Monday , injuring several people , mostly children , The Associated Press reported .
Such incidents are surprisingly common .
My husband , at 74 , is the baby of his bridge group , which includes a woman of 85 and a man of 89 .
This challenging game demands an excellent memory ( for bids , cards played , rules and so on ) and an ability to think strategically and read subtle psychological cues .
Never having had a head for cards , I continue to be amazed by the mental agility of these septua- and octogenarians .
The brain , like every other part of the body , changes with age , and those changes can impede clear thinking and memory .
Yet many older people seem to remain sharp as a tack well into their 80s and beyond .
Although their pace may have slowed , they continue to work , travel , attend plays and concerts , play cards and board games , study foreign languages , design buildings , work with computers , write books , do puzzles , knit or perform other mentally challenging tasks that can befuddle people much younger .
But when these sharp old folks die , autopsy studies often reveal extensive brain abnormalities like those in patients with Alzheimer ’s .
Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas and Yaakov Stern at Columbia University Medical Center recall that in 1988 , a study of “ cognitively normal elderly women ” showed that they had “ advanced Alzheimer ’s disease pathology in their brains at death . ”
Later studies indicated that up to two - thirds of people with autopsy findings of Alzheimer ’s disease were cognitively intact when they died .
“ Something must account for the disjunction between the degree of brain damage and its outcome , ” the Columbia scientists deduced .
And that something , they and others suggest , is “ cognitive reserve . ”

Coach , 40 , Weds 16 - Year - Old Student Windy Hager 's parents felt they had little choice but to sign a consent form .
June 22 , 2007  --
The Hagers are trying to figure out how life went off track for their teenage daughter , Windy .
They envisioned that life for the good student and promising athlete would be filled with dreams of the prom and college , but that all changed this week when Windy , 16 , married her high school track coach .
" She was a dream kid , " said her mother , Betty Hager .
" We 'd never have to worry about Windy trying to get by with something . "
At South Brunswick High School in North Carolina , Windy 's greatest passion was track and field .
" She just always was outside , always running , and her name 's Windy — I guess she was predestined to do love to do that , " Betty said .
But that passion led her down a troubling path .
Special Attention From Coach
During Windy 's freshman year , her 38 - year - old track coach , Brenton Wuchae , began taking a more active interest in her , offering to give the 14 - year - old rides home from practice .
What Do You Think ?
VOTE !
" He just seemed like a genuine guy , like he was there for the kids , " said Windy 's father , Dennis Hager .
But the Hagers eventually grew uneasy .
Their phone bills showed text messages between Wuchae and Windy as late as 2 a.m .
They also discovered worrying e-mails .
In one , Windy wrote to a friend , " I do n't care to look at anyone other than him .
He is the apple of my eye , I 've never felt this way for someone , but I just do n't want to lose him because of my parents ' power trips . "
The Hagers confronted Wuchae .
" He assured me there was nothing like that going on , [ and that ] they were just friends .
His intentions were purely appropriate , " Dennis said .
Not satisfied with that answer , the Hagers turned to the school district , which spoke to the coach .
The principal of the high school wrote to the Hagers , " I have seen nothing but a cooperative attitude from the teacher , and to the best of my knowledge , he has not had any contact with Windy since then . "
" School officials can't be responsible for what happens the other hours of the day , and I would think the relationship developed much more outside of school , " said Brian Shaw , an attorney for the school district .
The Hagers contacted police ; they even tried to get a restraining order .
" We 've tried everybody .
We 've been to the law .
We 've been to the school board , " Betty said .
" Our family has come and tried to talk to her .
We 've had people on the phone with her for hours — family , friends .
We 've been to our pastor asking for guidance .
We 've been to his pastor . "
Meanwhile , the Hagers say Windy withdrew , refusing to speak to them until she asked them to sign a consent form so that she and her coach — a man more than twice her age — could get married .
Although anguished , her weary parents gave in .
" Signing those consent forms was the hardest thing I did in my whole life , but we had to move on , it was going to kill us all , " Dennis said .
Monday , Windy and Wuchae married , and he resigned from the school .
But was Windy really old enough to understand her decision ?
Experts say it 's a difficult situation .
" With most teenagers , they 're not sure yet who 's who and what 's what and what should be done , " said Henry Paul , author of the book " Is My Teenager OK ? "
" It 's obviously up to the adult figure to set the boundaries . "
Windy and her new husband would not comment for this story , but the Hagers realize what they 've lost .
" She could have done anything , " Betty said .
" She could have set the world on fire .
She threw it all away . "

The # 5 story on Monday 's Countdown delivered a bombshell - John Kiriakou , a former CIA agent who actually led the team of agents who appeared on the destroyed torture tapes has come forward in an interview with ABC to confirm the tapes DID show waterboarding and that while he believes the technique was effective , he now believes it is torture and is wrong .
It 's becoming more and more difficult for President Bush to convince the world that he has n't committed war crimes .
Keith spoke with Richard Wolffe and Jonathan Turley about this revelation and the enormous damage it does to the CIA 's claim that the tapes were destroyed purely to protect the identities of the agents involved .
They also give hell to Senator Jay Rockefeller and other Democratic leaders who knew that Bush was illegally torturing as far back as 2002 , but did not speak out against it .
HELSINKI , Finland ( CNN ) --
An 18 - year - old authorities say shot eight people inside his high school in southern Finland , before turning the gun on himself , has died , police said .
An image from a video posted on YouTube by " Sturmgeist89 . " more photos »
The shooting appeared to have been planned out in graphic videos posted on Internet file - sharing site YouTube .
At a news conference this afternoon , police confirmed the dead numbered two girls , five boys and the school 's headmistress at Jokela High in Tuusula , a quiet town around 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) north of Helsinki .
Ten other people were taken to a hospital with minor injuries .
The shooter , whom police identified as Pekka Eric Auvinen , died at Toolo Hospital , authorities said .
Police said he took his own life .
It was the first school shooting in Finland since 1989 , when a 14 - year - old student shot and killed two others in the coastal town of Rauma , the Finnish news agency STT reported .
Police said Auvinen is from Tuusula and who acted alone .
He had no previous criminal record and had never threatened anyone from the school before , they added .
Auvinen published a manifesto online demanding war on the " weak - minded masses " and pledged to die for his cause .
Watch Auvinen fire weapons in video from his Web page »
YouTube appeared to have removed 89 videos linked to his account , many of them featuring Nazi imagery , shortly after the incident .
Finnish media reported someone posted a message two weeks ago on the Web site , warning of a bloodbath at the school .
A video posted earlier Wednesday , by " Sturmgeist89 , " was titled " Jokela High School Massacre - 11/7/2007 . " " Sturmgeist89 " identified himself as Auvinen , and said he chose the name " Sturmgeist " because it means " storm spirit " in German .
The video showed a picture of the school , which then disintegrated to reveal two images of Auvinen against a red background , pointing a gun at the screen .
The clip is accompanied by the song " Stray Bullet " from rock band KMFDM .
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold , the students behind the 1999 Columbine High School massacre , also cited that group 's lyrics .
Another short video clip , called " Just Testing My Gun , " showed Auvinen loading and cocking a handgun .
He fired and hit several pieces of fruit in a wooded area ; the camera then showed a close - up of the destroyed fruit , and then a full - screen shot of him again .
He waved at the camera and then walked out of view .
The site indicated that the youth appeared to be fascinated with killing .
As well as video footage of the Columbine school shootings , it also included clips of the 1993 Waco siege in the United States , the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo , and bombs falling on Baghdad during the 2003 invasion .
Many showed victims being wheeled away or people running for their lives .
Throughout all of this , the single word " DIE " constantly flashed across the screen .
Other video clips included Nazi - war - criminal footage .
In the rambling text posted on the site , Auvinen said that he is " a cynical existentialist , anti-human humanist , anti-social social - Darwinist , realistic idealist and god - like atheist .
" I am prepared to fight and die for my cause , " he wrote .
" I , as a natural selector , will eliminate all who I see unfit , disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection . "
The police said at this afternoon 's press conference that they had been fired at when they arrived at the school at 11.45 p.m. local time ( 9.45 a.m. GMT ) .
They described the scene as chaotic , with some of the 460 students , ranging in age from 12 to 18 , breaking windows in an attempt to escape .
When the police 's special SWAT unit entered the high school they found the gunman unconscious and in critical condition in the lower lobby of the building with a gunshot wound to his head .
Police assume he tried to take his own life as no officers fired at him .
Several bodies were also found in the same location , where the shooting is believed to have begun , they added .
They could not confirm comments by some students that Auvinen was firing through doors .
Police also said that the gun Auvinen used , which was fully licensed , had been purchased less than a month ago on October 19 .
The legal age limit to own a gun in Finland is 18 , which Auvinen passed in June of this year .
He had a recommendation from a shooting club when he obtained the gun , police added , and practised sharp - shooting as a hobby at a shooting range .
Finland , which enjoys a strong tradition of hunting , has a high proportion of gun ownership , with two million firearms owned in a nation of only five million .
The Associated Press reported comments from Kim Kiuru , one of the school 's teachers , on radio station YLE .
Kiuru described how the headmistress used the public address system around noon to tell pupils to stay in classrooms .
He said he locked his classroom door , then waited in the corridor for more news .
" After that I saw the gunman running with what appeared to be a small - caliber handgun in his hand through the doors towards me , after which I escaped to the corridor downstairs and ran in the opposite direction , " Kiuru said .
The agency reported Kiuru as saying that he saw a woman 's body as he fled the school , before telling his pupils to leave the building through the windows .

Here 's one tip for how to eat at the holidays :
Do n't take your cues from Santa .
The sugary cookies and fat - laden fruitcakes the mythical North Pole resident eats are a no - no .
But you do n't have to go no -carb to stay fit at the holidays , either , University of Florida researchers say .
In fact , many dieters may actually be cutting out the wrong foods altogether , according to findings from a UF paper published recently in the European Journal of Nutrition .
Dieters should focus on limiting the amount of fructose they eat instead of cutting out starchy foods such as bread , rice and potatoes , report the researchers , who propose using new dietary guidelines based on fructose to gauge how healthy foods are .
" There 's a fair amount of evidence that starch - based foods do n't cause weight gain like sugar - based foods and do n't cause the metabolic syndrome like sugar - based foods , " said Dr. Richard Johnson , the senior author of the report , which reviewed several recent studies on fructose and obesity .
" Potatoes , pasta , rice may be relatively safe compared to table sugar .
A fructose index may be a better way to assess the risk of carbohydrates related to obesity . "
Many diets -- including the low - carb variety -- are based on the glycemic index , which measures how foods affect blood glucose levels .
Because starches convert to glucose in the body , these diets tend to limit foods such as rice and potatoes .
While table sugar is composed of both glucose and fructose , fructose seems to be the more dangerous part of the equation , UF researchers say .
Eating too much fructose causes uric acid levels to spike , which can block the ability of insulin to regulate how body cells use and store sugar and other nutrients for energy , leading to obesity , metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes , said Johnson , the division chief of nephrology and the J. Robert Cade professor of nephrology in the UF College of Medicine .
UF researchers first detailed the role of uric acid on insulin resistance and obesity in a 2005 study in rats .
" Certainly we do n't think fructose is the only cause of the obesity epidemic , " Johnson said .
" Too many calories , too much junk food and too much high - fat food are also part of the problem .
But we think that fructose may have the unique ability to induce insulin resistance and features of the metabolic syndrome that other foods do n't do so easily . "
About 33 percent of adults in the United States are overweight or obese , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

Studies at other institutions have shown that following a low - glycemic diet can reduce the risk for diabetes and heart disease , but the effect could occur because these dieters often are unintentionally limiting fructose as well by cutting out table sugar , Johnson said .
" Processed foods have a lot of sugar , " Johnson said .
" Probably the biggest source ( of fructose ) is soft drinks . "
Johnson also noted that , in relation to obesity , the type of fructose found in foods does n't seem to matter .
For example , the fructose in an apple is as problematic as the high - fructose corn syrup in soda .
The apple is much more nutritious and contains far less sugar , but eating multiple apples in one sitting could send the body over the fructose edge .
In another UF paper , published in October in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , Johnson and his collaborators tracked the rise of obesity and diseases such as diabetes with the rise in sugar consumption .
The rates of hypertension , diabetes and childhood obesity have risen steadily over the years .
" One of the things we have learned is this whole epidemic brought on by Western diet and culture tracks back to the 1800s , " he said .
" Nowadays , fructose and high - fructose corn syrup are in everything . "
Aside from soft drinks , fructose can be found in pastries , ketchup , fruits , table sugar and jellies and in many processed foods , including the sugar substitute high fructose corn syrup .
advertisement
UF researchers plan to test a low - fructose diet in patients soon , Johnson said .
Kathleen Melanson , an associate professor of nutrition and food sciences at the University of Rhode Island , said establishing a fructose index for foods could " be an appropriate approach , " depending on how foods are classified .
It makes sense to limit foods prepared with high fructose corn syrup and table sugar , which often contain empty calories , but fruits are an important part of a person 's diet , she added .
" One concern I have always had with the glycemic index is the potential to pigeonhole foods as good or bad , " she said .
I mentioned this yesterday in the ( somewhat - insiderish ) realm of the Atlantic 's " Aspen Ideas Festival " blog , but the point seemed worth repeating in this marginally more public venue .
The item appears after the jump , or at this link .
It concerns the war that some public officials tried to prevent , and the war that at least one official tried to foment :
I have a lot of time for Gary Hart , long - time senator from Colorado and for a while a possible president of the United States .
By which I mean , I have a lot of respect for his persistence and prescience on the national security front .
The first time I ever heard of the " military reform movement " -- and of the very influential military thinker John Boyd , and of the insightful Pentagon budget analyst Chuck Spinney -- was when I visited Hart 's ofice in the Senate in 1979 and talked with his eccentric - but - brilliant staff assistant Bill Lind .
Actually , eccentric - but - brilliant would apply to Spinney and Boyd as well ; but Lind was the only one of the three to have posters of Mussolini on his office wall while working at the U.S. Capitol .
I do n't know any other major political figure who has been as right about as many national - security matters , as consistently , and as early , as Gary Hart has been .
I 'm thinking about his role in creating and leading the Congressional " military reform caucus " in the 1980s .
But I know that the most famous illustration in most people 's minds is his role as co-chair of the " U.S. Commission on National Security in the 21st Century , " aka the Hart - Rudman Commission .
Early in 2001 , the commission presented a report to the incoming G.W. Bush administration warning that terrorism would be the nation 's greatest national security problem , and saying that unless the United States took proper protective measures a terrorist attack was likely within its borders .
Neither the president nor the vice president nor any other senior official from the new administration took time to meet with the commission members or hear about their findings .
The commission had 14 members , split 7 - 7 , Republican and Democrat , as is de rigeur for bodies of this type .
Today
Hart told me that in the first few meetings , commission members would go around the room and volunteer their ideas about the nation 's greatest vulnerabilities , most urgent needs , and so on .
At the first meeting , one Republican woman on the commission said that the overwhelming threat was from China .
Sooner or later the U.S. would end up in a military showdown with the Chinese Communists .
There was no avoiding it , and we would only make ourselves weaker by waiting .
No one else spoke up in support .
The same thing happened at the second meeting -- discussion from other commissioners about terrorism , nuclear proliferation , anarchy of failed states , etc , and then this one woman warning about the looming Chinese menace .
And the third meeting too .
Perhaps more .
Finally , in frustration , this woman left the commission .
" Her name was Lynne Cheney , " Hart said .
" I am convinced that if it had not been for 9/11 , we would be in a military showdown with China today . "
Not because of what China was doing , threatening , or intending , he made clear , but because of the assumptions the Administration brought with it when taking office .
( My impression is that Chinese leaders know this too , which is why there are relatively few complaints from China about the Iraq war .
They know that it got the U.S. off China 's back ! )
Lee Hamilton , who had also been on the commission , was sitting at the same lunch table and backed up Hart 's story .
Another chapter in the annals of missed opportunities in recent years .
TEHRAN , Iran ( AP )  Iran has sent a formal protest note to Washington for " spying " on Iran 's nuclear activities , Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said Saturday , in the wake of the latest U.S. intelligence report on the Iranian weapons program .
The note was handed over to the Swiss Embassy in Tehran , which looks after U.S. interests in Iran in the absence of diplomatic relations between Tehran and Washington , the state IRNA news agency said .
" The day the report was issued , the Foreign Ministry submitted a formal note of protest to the Swiss Embassy and demanded an explanation over ( America 's ) espionage activities taking place ( on Iran 's nuclear program ) , " Mottaki was quoted as saying .

Boom Computing
He kept his homemade , oversized , “ nuclear weapon effects computer ” in a room packed floor to ceiling with puzzles .
To me , smugly distanced from the fearful zeitgeist of the atomic age ( and its pragmatic preparations ) this choice seems perfectly fitting .
I can think of none better in fact .
Circular slide rules manufactured to calculate the various effects and time lengths of a post nuclear landscape were once fairly common items .
If you handed me one today and expected an important calculation in return you might as well hand me a icosahedron - shaped rubik ’s and expect in return a nice slice of strawberry pie .
Detail of the homemade slide rule showing just a few of it ’s charming variables .
Let ’s do a visualization exercise .
Try to let go of your movie - induced visions of post - apocalyptic struggle , centered on flesh eating irradiated men , broken eyeglasses , and thunderdomes , and focus instead on standing in a dark , rubble - strewn bunker trying to make heads or tail out of a ( greek to me ) number - laden slide rule … do you see what I see ?
Now that ’s horror !
( Why , oh why , am I so unprepared ?
And why did I take so many gad damned Humanities courses anyway ?
Fucking art school ! )
Personally I do n’t remember ever even seeing one of these items first hand .
That seems to have as much to do with the timing of my birth ( 1974 ) as with my decidedly hippy - leaning parentage .
Let ’s look to John Walker ( maintainer of fourmilab.ch and co-author of AutoCAD ) for some firsthand accounting -
Quote : “ Anyway , when some champion of human liberty in a Che Guevara T - shirt and Mao jacket was haranguing his audience with claims like “ A single Hiroshima bomb set off downtown would annihilate this university and all of us in the blink of an eye ” , what better way to burnish one ’s Strangelovian credentials than to whip out a handy - dandy nuclear bomb computer slide rule , whip — slip — slide , and interrupt , “ Naaah . . . fifteen kilotons at five miles ?
Surface burst ?
Why , that ’s only a quarter to a third of a pound per square inch overpressure — it ’ll probably break some window glass but that ’s about it . ”
Flipping the slide rule over , “ The flash is n’t even enough to cause sunburn , and the immediate radiation is next to nothing . ”
For some unfathomable reason , this never seemed to either carry the argument or suitably impress chicks .
Back in those psychedelic days of yore , you could order your own fantastic pastel plastic nuclear bomb effects computer directly from the U.S. Government Printing Office for a single green dollar , and for three dollars more , obtain the authoritative 730 page book , The Effects of Nuclear Weapons , upon which it was based .
With the winding down of the nuclear arms race and eventual end of the Cold War , interest in the actual consequences of setting off nuclear weapons waned .
The book and computer were last updated in 1977 , and subsequently went out of print . ”
Indeed .
Well that explains why when I look at one of these circular slide rules all I see is some nifty looking , though totally opaque , information design and why rather than envisioning all sorts of weighty cause and effect scenarios my first thoughts are instead , “ mmmm pretty ” and “ I bet Tufte would approve of those . ”
Have a look at some for yourself and see what you think .
The Commander ’s Radiation Guide , ca. 1960 ’s .
Also described as the “ Fission Fragment Fallout Decay and Dose Guide . ”
Nuclear Bomb Effects Computer by EG&G ca. 1960 .
Quoting the Instructions : “ As a convenience to those interested in the effects of nuclear weapons , this circular computer was designed to make data easily available on various weapon effects . ”
The Radiation Dosage Calculator was developed in 1950 or 1951 by William Orr at the University of Connecticut for the Connecticut State Office of Civil Defense .
They were sold to the general public for one dollar each .
The RADIAC Calculator No. 2 ca. late 1950’s .
It works as follows : if the exposure rate ( roentgens / hr ) is known at a given time after a nuclear explosion , the calculator predicts the exposure rate at any other time .
It also estimates the dose to personnel who are in the area at specified periods of time after the explosion .
The RADIAC Calculator No. 1 ca 1952-1956 .
A somewhat unique feature of this slide rule is the fact that the central two circles have two sides : a blue side for calculations involving contamination generated at sea , and a pink side for contamination generated by detonations over land .
Isotope Handling Calculator Mk. III ca. 1960s .
The ABC - M1A1 RADIAC Calculator , used by the US Army to determine the dose rates and doses to personnel after a nuclear explosion .
Nuclear Bomb Effects Computer , Revised Edition ca. 1960s .
Distributed in a pocket on the inside back cover of the Atomic Energy Commission publication “ The Effects of Nuclear Weapons . ”
I must admit the very thought of some determined engineer brandishing one of these after a bomb blast , to calmly draw even a smidgeon of rational data out of the situation , is a heartening thought .
Where as most of us would immediately set about trying to cobble together flying machines out of lawnmower parts or riot down at the sporting - goods store in covetous search of hockey masks and shoulder pads some among us might yet be able to do something useful .
Obviously the slide rule in general has largely become a outmoded technology with the coming of the scientific calculator and more recently , these , how - you - say , computronics .
But as with all technological corpses there remains a fervent underground of admirers and collectors who keep a fire burning in the tomb .
Which in the case of slide rules , nuclear themed specimens especially , is a blessing .
After all with a few well placed electromagnetic pulses - care of some lovely nuclear explosions - they could very quickly return to state of the art , technophile coveted , status .
If you ’re a true technology junky and want to get a jump on the apocalyptic gadget frenzy ( sure to be kicked off in the pages of the mimeographed editions of endgadget and gizmodo ) or would simply like to feel less stupid when all hell breaks loose , Fourmilab offers the Build Your Own Nuclear Bomb Effects Computer page as a public service .
Happy computing !

UU minister performs Iowa 's first same - sex wedding
UU minister performs Iowa 's first same - sex wedding
UU World Magazine , published by the Unitarian Universalist Association
Families & Faith Development
When the Rev. Mark Stringer finished scraping paint in his bathroom at 3 a.m. on Friday August 31 , little did he know that he would be a national celebrity by noon .
Stringer , minister of the First Unitarian Church of Des Moines , conducted the first — and so far , only — legal same - sex marriage in Iowa later that morning .
The marriage of Sean Fritz and Tim McQuillan happened during an hours - long window of time between a ruling legalizing same - sex marriage in Polk County , Iowa , and a stay that immediately halted the proceedings .
Same - sex marriage is not yet legal in Iowa .
However , on Thursday , August 30 Polk County Judge Robert Hanson ruled that the state ’s Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional in a suit brought by six same - sex couples .
In response to pressure from Polk County Attorney John Sarcone , Hanson stayed his ruling the following day .
When the ruling came down Thursday , same - sex couples mobilized to get marriage licenses while they could .
McQuillan and Fritz were at the Des Moines courthouse bright and early Friday morning and obtained the license .
By paying an extra five dollars and getting a waiver signed by a judge , they were able to skip the normally required three - day waiting period .
Then , they were off in search of a minister .
At 10 a.m. , Stringer received the call .
“ I told them I would meet them at noon at the church , ” Stringer told UU World in a phone interview .
“ I wanted to get myself organized and take a shower . ”
He recognized immediately , however , the importance of the event and was n’t surprised when McQuillan and Fritz called back five minutes later asking whether they could advance the ceremony .
Within 15 minutes the couple arrived with a handful of family and friends — and a phalanx of reporters .
“ I could n’t even find a dress shirt , ” said Stringer , who is in the process of readying his house for sale .
So he threw a ministerial stole over a polo shirt and went out to conduct the wedding on his front lawn .
“ I hardly remember what I said , ” he added , although a video of the ceremony is available at WHO , a local Des Moines TV station .
After signing the marriage certificate , McQuillan and Fritz , along with their entourage , left to file the certificate at the courthouse .
They were the only pair out of 20 couples to return with a signed license before the stay took effect .
Stringer stressed that such quick weddings are not normally the way he conducts business .
However , as a marriage equality activist , he knew that this was not the average wedding .
“ I knew that I owed it to those couples who did n’t have that piece of paper .
Any one of my UU colleagues , I ’m sure , would have done the same .
I ’m so proud to serve in this movement . ”
So far the emails that Stringer has received have been overwhelmingly positive , he said .
“ I told the couple that I would be happy to conduct another ceremony for them at a later date , and they told me that they ’d like to do that in the summer of 2008 , ” he said .
The pair attended a service on September 2 at the Des Moines church where they received a standing ovation .
Stringer is enjoying his time in the spotlight and using it to advance the cause of marriage equality and Unitarian Universalism .
“ All of a sudden we ’ve got a national audience for the Unitarian Universalist cause , ” he said .
“ It ’s such a gift ! ”
“ I ’ve lived in Chicago and New York .
And it ’s really great to say , ‘ you ’ve got to catch up to Des Moines ! ’ ”

Discrimination rife in Indian economy
Jo Johnson in New Delhi | December 04 , 2007
M ale graduates applying for private sector jobs in India are far more likely to progress to the next round if they have high - caste Hindu names than if they have surnames associated with dalit ( formerly untouchable ) or Muslim origins , new research has found .
Far from being a hangover from the past found only at the margins of a newly meritocratic society , such discrimination is rife in the most dynamic sectors of the Indian economy , according to a joint study undertaken by academics from Princeton University and the Indian Institute for Dalit Studies .
Making use of techniques pioneered in the US to measure discrimination against blacks and other minorities , researchers made 4,808 job applications to 548 graduate level openings advertised in newspapers by blue chip Indian and multinational companies , changing only the names of identically qualified candidates .
Appropriately qualified applicants with a dalit name had odds of progressing to the next stage of the recruitment process that were two thirds of those of an equivalently qualified candidate with a high caste Hindu name , while those of an equally qualified Muslim candidate were only around a third as good .
The findings , published in India 's Economic and Political Weekly , have been released at a politically sensitive time , with the government threatening to extend a system of quotas to the private sector unless businesses voluntarily boost the number of recruits from disadvantaged social groups .
The private sector has argued that the under - representation of dalits , tribes people and Muslims should be solved by improving the public education system - on the grounds that these communities attend inferior schools - rather than through quotas that would crimp freedom to hire and fire .
The studies , however , cast some doubt on whether , without government intervention , the self - interest of theoretically economically " rational " recruiters , who would want to minimise wage bills by recruiting from the widest possible pool of qualified talent , would be sufficient to correct the problem .
" Reaching the pinnacle of what the Indian education system has to offer is not sufficient to create full and open opportunity , " wrote Sukhadeo Thorat , founder of the Indian Institute of Dalit Studies , and Katherine Newman , a sociologist and director of Princeton University 's Institute for International and Regional Studies , two of the academics involved with the project .
" Far from fading as India modernises , the problem of discrimination remains a serious one , even at the very top of the human capital hierarchy , " the authors said , arguing that recruiters in major companies continued to " subject low caste applicants to negative stereotypes that may overwhelm their formal accomplishments " .
Business groups have argued that mandatory extension of quotas to the private sector would hit productivity .
They say the organised private sector , which accounts for less than 5 per cent of the workforce , is already suffering from labour market rigidities , such as the need to secure government approval to fire employees .

Singh recently became the first sitting Indian prime minister to acknowledge openly the parallel between " untouchability " and apartheid , describing the latter as a " blot on humanity " .
His government is poised to establish an Equal Opportunity Commission , whose powers have yet to be defined .
Researchers have developed a low - cost , low - power computer memory that could put terabyte - sized thumb drives in consumers ' pockets within a few years .
Thanks to a new technique for manipulating charged copper particles at the molecular scale , researchers at Arizona State University say their memory is , bit - for - bit , one - tenth the cost of – and 1,000 times as energy - efficient as – flash memory , the predominant memory technology in iPhones and other mobile devices .
" A thumb drive using our memory could store a terabyte of information , " says Michael Kozicki , director of ASU 's Center for Applied Nanoionics , which developed the technology .
" All the current limitations in portable electronic storage could go away .
You could record video of every event in your life and store it . "
The new memory technology – programmable metallization cell ( PMC ) – comes as current storage technologies are starting to reach their physical limits .
At the tiny scale envisioned for new devices , flash memory becomes unstable .
The physical limits of flash are already being approached , and could be reached in the near future , which could slow product development for portable device makers like Apple and Sandisk .
PMC memory stores information in a fundamentally different way from flash .
Instead of storing bits as an electronic charge , the technology creates nanowires from copper atoms the size of a virus to record binary ones and zeros .
In research published in October 's IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices , Kozicki and his collaborators from the Jülich Research Center in Germany describe how the PMC builds an on - demand copper bridge between two electrodes .
When the technology writes a binary 1 , it creates a nanowire bridge between two electrodes .
When no wire is present , that state is stored as a .
The key enabling technology for the memory is nano - ionics , a field that focuses on moving and transforming positively charged atoms .
In PMC memory , the charged atoms , or ions , are harnessed by applying a negative charge , which transforms them into copper atoms lined up to form nanowires .
Kozicki says the process is like condensing a crystal from a solution , except that the process is almost infinitely reversible .
If the PMC is fed a positive charge , the copper atoms return to their previous free - floating state , and the nanowires disassemble .
Kozicki says the technology can be built from materials commonly used in the memory industry , which should help keep manufacturing costs down .
The memory industry has already taken an interest .
Three companies , Micron Technology , Qimonda and Adesto ( a stealth - mode startup ) have licensed the technology from Arizona State 's business spin-off , Axon Technologies .
Kozicki says the first product containing the memory , a simple chip , is slated to come out in 18 months .
Market - research firm iSuppli projects the flash - memory market growing from $ 20 billion in 2006 to $ 32 billion in 2011 .
Mark DeVoss , a senior analyst in flash memory at iSuppli , says a lot of companies are gunning for a share of that $ 12 billion in growth , but it 's hard to handicap the likely winners .
" There 's a lot of elegant technologies , " DeVoss says .
" But you have to be able to scale it down and deliver a low cost - per - bit . "
Kozicki's licensees believe the technology will deliver the outsize improvements that could drive the memory mainstream .
" No other technology can deliver the orders - of - magnitude improvement in power , performance and cost that this memory can , " says Narbeh Derhacobian , CEO of Adesto , who previously worked at AMD 's flash - memory division .
Adesto has received $ 6 million from Arch Venture Partners and additional funding from Harris & Harris , a venture firm specializing in nanotechnology .
Inspired by FDR's Works Progress Administration , the WGA utilizes the Environmental Protection Agency to put millions of Americans back to work rebuilding our schools , bridges , roads , ports , water systems , and environmental systems .
Not only does the bold practicality of the plan lie in putting Americans back to work by investing in the national wealth of our own infrastructure , but the plan also incorporates environmental and energy concerns to further create wealth for the country and save individual families more money .
For example , not only will the public works projects stress green building and renewable energy technology , but the plan will enable homes to be retrofit with green building , solar and wind microtechnology which will save families money on their energy bills .
The WGA rebuilding effort will incorporate sustainable development and renewable energy from our public infrastructure to the millions of private homes that choose to retrofit with wind and solar technologies to save on family energy costs .
In fact , they will be able to sell energy back to the grid .
The role of utilities will change dramatically because it will no longer be a centralized approach toward energy production .
Utility companies will have to provide support for green alternatives .
They will no longer be dictating energy costs , as Kucinich will work to break up the monopolies and ensure close regulation of their activities .
They will be required to go green as license conditions and shut down if they violate the Clean Air Act .
We will finally have a strict and EPA .
Further , Kucinich will finally committ the U.S. to the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol , as well as incorporating a carbon tax to create disincentives for using carbon - based energies .
However , he believes this is n’t enough ; simply punishing those people who are using carbons is not the answer .
Rather , Kucinich wants to put the emphasis first on the government supporting renewable technologies , to move the country toward a renewable portfolio standard of at least 30 % by 2020 .
Kucinich will create a cooperative and synergistic relationship between all departments and administrations within the government for the purpose of greening America .
Whether it's the Small Business Administration , or the Housing and Urban Development Department , or the Department of Agriculture , or the Department of Labor , each would incorporate green goals into its policies .
Internationally , as President , Kucinich will work with the leaders of China and India and other nations to promote an environmental consciousness and sustainable economies .
After withdrawing from NAFTA , the new trade agreements will include requirements for protecting the air and the water and the land of all the countries we do business with .
Dennis Kucinich has a long history and strong committment of fighting for the environment .
He was active in helping draft the first environmental law protecting the air , as a member of the Cleveland City Council 30 years ago and led the effort in Ohio challenging nuclear power as being unsafe , unreliable , and unsustainable .
Internationally he attended the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg , advocating a plan with Mikhail Gorbachev for a Global Green Deal that would enable the introduction of $ 50 billion of new solar projects around the world .
Support Dennis Kucinich and make America a leader in protecting our environment and creating a sustainable future .

10 Great Examples How Not To Write A Personal Ad
75 Gnomes Take Over Police Station In Oregon
How many copyright violations does an average user commit in a single day ?
John Tehranian , a law professor at the University of Utah , calculates in a new paper that he rings up $ 12.45 million in liability ( PDF ) over the course of an average day .
The gap between what the law allows and what social norms permit is so great now that " we are , technically speaking , a nation of infringers . "
Tehranian 's paper points out just how pervasive copyright has become in our lives .
Simply checking one 's e-mail and including the full text in response could be a violation of copyright .
So could a tattoo on Tehranian 's shoulder of Captain Caveman — and potential damages escalate when Tehranian takes off his shirt at the university pool and engages in public performance of an unauthorized copyrighted work .
Singing " Happy Birthday " at a restaurant ( unauthorized public performance ) and capturing the event on a video camera ( unauthorized reproduction ) could increase his liability , and that 's to say nothing of the copyrighted artwork hanging on the wall behind the dinner table ( also captured without authorization by the camera ) .
Tehranian calculates his yearly liability at $ 4.5 billion .
And all of this infringement could easily be done without even engaging in " wrong " behaviors like P2P file - sharing .
Tehranian wants to make clear how such copyright issues do n't simply affect those operating in the grey or black zones of the law ; they affect plenty of ordinary people who are n't doing anything that they consider to be illegal , immoral , or even a little bit naughty .
The " vast disparity between copyright law and copyright norms " simply highlights the need for effective copyright reform .
Since the 1976 Copyright Act , when all creative works automatically gained copyright protection without the need for registration , our lives have been awash in the copyrighted materials of other people .
The advent of digital technology means not only that such works are simpler to use and to share , but that content owners for the first time have a realistic shot at enforcing their maximum rights .
That has led to plenty of bad press for copyright holders , as in the case of the " terminally ill Mexican immigrant on welfare " whose case Tehranian handled when the man was sued by the RIAA for his son's alleged file - swapping .
More serious than such isolated cases , though , is the fact that the law currently gives so much power ( even if much of it is not used ) to content owners that it risks eroding respect for the necessary and even important uses of copyright law .
What better way could there be to create a nation of constant lawbreakers than to instill in that nation a contempt for its own laws ?
And what better way to instill contempt than to hand out rights so broad that most Americans simply find them absurd ?
No More Mercenaries

MUNICH — Private armies have a very sinister reputation in Europe .
Memories still linger of Germany ’s post WWI army veterans , the " Stahlhelm , " and Nazi Brownshirts , who battled Communist street toughs here in Munich and Berlin .
Europeans remember Italy ’s fascist Blackshirts and , most recently , Serb neo -fascist gangs like Arkan ’s " Tigers " and the " White Eagles " who committed some of the worst atrocities in Bosnia and Kosovo .
Germany also remains haunted by folk memory of the hordes of blood - crazed mercenaries who turned much of this nation into a wasteland during the savage 30 Year ’s War .
The name of the great mercenary captain , Wallenstein , still resounds , and of those most feared mercenaries of all , the ferocious Swiss , who once terrorized Europe .
Wrote Machiavelli : " where there is gold and blood , there are the Swiss . "
The Vatican ’s Swiss Guard is a faint reminder of the " furia Helvetica . "
Small numbers of mercenaries have been used in many modern wars , from Vietnam to Central America .
The most famed modern mercenary force is France ’s tough Foreign Legion .
The rise of powerful mercenary armies within the United States , and their use in Iraq and Afghanistan , is an entirely new , deeply disturbing development .
Last weekend , mercenaries from the US firm " Blackwater " gunned down 11 Iraqi civilians during an attack on a convoy they were guarding .
Iraq ’s prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , ordered Blackwater ’s thousands of swaggering mercenaries expelled from Iraq .
But his order was quickly countermanded by US occupation authorities .
There are 180,000 to 200,000 US - paid mercenaries in Iraq — or " private contractors " as Washington and the US media delicately call them .
They actually outnumber the 169,000 US troops there .
Britain pays for another 20,000 .
At least half are armed fighters , the rest are support personnel and technicians .
Without them , the US and Britain could not maintain their occupation of Iraq .
These fighters , like the Renaissance ’s Italian condotierri , German landsknecht , and Swiss pikemen , are lawless , answering to no authority but their employers .
Democrats in the US Congress are rightly demanding these trigger - happy Rambos to be at least brought under American military law .
The US State Department now has its own little army in Iraq and Afghanistan of about 3,000 Blackwater gunmen who protect American officials and their local collaborators .
Some reports say State has spent $ 678 million alone with Blackwater since 2003 .
Afghanistan ’s US - installed leader , Hamid Karzai , is surrounded at all times by 200 American bodyguards , his own people not being trusted to protect their president .
Iraq ’s US - installed leaders are similarly guarded by US mercenaries .
Nearly all Washington ’s contracts for mercenaries are awarded without competitive bidding to firms close to the Republican Party .
Blackwater ’s owners are major contributors .
Their 7,000 - acre base in the southern United States is likely the world ’s largest non-government military operation and a menacing creation straight out of the famous film , Seven Days in May .
This unprecedented use of mercenaries has masked the depths of US involvement in Iraq and clearly shows how little the occupying forces can rely on the locals , whom they supposedly " liberated . "
It has also allowed the US to sustain an imperial war that could never have been waged with conscripted American soldiers , as Vietnam clearly showed .
Vice President Dick Cheney took Vietnam ’s lesson to heart by championing the use of mercenaries for nasty foreign wars .
But democracies should have no business unleashing armies of hired gunmen on the world .
Worse , these private armies hardwired to the Republican Party ’s far right are a grave and intolerable danger to the American Republic .
Congress should outlaw them absolutely .
The great Roman Republic held mandatory military service by all citizens was the basis of democracy , while professional armies were a grave menace .
How ironic that colonial America , which rose up in arms in response to the British crown ’s use of brutal German mercenaries , is today resorting to the same tactics in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Europe wants no more of private armies .
Americans have yet to learn this painful lesson .

The fire fight broke out in the middle of the day in a busy area
Both the US embassy in the Iraqi capital and the Iraqi interior ministry say they are looking into the incident .
The private security workers , who were employed by the US State Department , apparently opened fire after their convoy came under attack on Sunday .
At least 13 people were also injured in the shooting in a busy part of Baghdad .
It broke out at about 1230 local time on Nisour Square in the predominantly Sunni neighbourhood of Mansour , a police officer told the Associated Press news agency .
A witness said the shooting erupted after an explosion .
" We saw a convoy of SUVs passing in the street nearby .
One minute later , we heard the sound of a bomb explosion followed by gunfire that lasted for 20 minutes between gunmen and the convoy people who were foreigners and dressed in civilian clothes .
" Everybody in the street started to flee immediately , " Hussein Abdul - Abbas , a local shop owner , told AP .
Heavily armed
Another witness , Muhammad Hussein , saw his brother killed in the gunfight .
Critics say private security contractors are unregulated
Private contractors in Iraq
" I was driving behind my brother 's car and suddenly there was an explosion and firing .
I tried to figure out what was happening when I saw a black convoy ahead of us , " he told the AFP news agency .
" Soon after I saw my brother slump in the car .
I dragged him out of the car and tried to hide to avoid the firing but realised that he had been shot in the chest and was already dead , " he said .
Thousands of private security staff are employed by businessmen , journalists and dignitaries in lawless Iraq .
They are often heavily armed , but critics say some are not properly trained - even trigger - happy - and are not accountable except to their employers .
Iraqi state television said Prime Minister Nouri Maliki had condemned the shooting .
Civilian toll
Sunday 's violence followed the publication of a survey of Iraqis which suggested that up to 1.2 m people might have died because of the conflict in Iraq .
A UK - based polling agency , Opinion Research Business ( ORB ) , said it had extrapolated the figure by asking a random sample of 1,461 Iraqi adults how many people living in their household had died as a result of the violence rather than from natural causes .
The results lend weight to a 2006 survey of Iraqi households published by the Lancet , which suggested that about 655,000 Iraqi deaths were " a consequence of the war " .
However , these estimates are both far higher than the running total of reported civilian deaths maintained by the campaign group Iraq Body Count which puts the figure at between 71,000 and 78,000 .
COLOGNE , Germany ( Reuters ) - German police said on Sunday they had prevented a planned killing spree by two teenage pupils in a school in the western city of Cologne .

Local police said the two youths , aged 17 and 18 , aimed to “ kill and injure ” people at their secondary school on Tuesday and then commit suicide exactly a year after an attack by a gunman on a school in a town north of Cologne .
The motive for the planned attack was not clear and police said initial searches had uncovered only two crossbows and air guns at the youths ’ homes .
The guns were not deadly , they said .
The younger of the two suspects committed suicide on Friday , while the second had been taken into custody , police said .
“ ( The 18 - year - old ) who was questioned said they wanted to kill and injure people and then take their own lives , ” Cologne police spokesman Norbert Wagner told a news conference .
The school alerted police after pupils discovered the 17 - year - old had posted images on an Internet Web site of the 1999 Columbine High School shootings in the United States , when two students killed 13 people in Littleton , Colorado .
Wagner said officers went to the school on Friday and interviewed the 17 - year - old , who they described as an “ inconspicuous ” pupil who did not appear a threat to others .
The youth told police he would remove the pictures , and threw himself under a tram on his way home .
He later died .
Investigators believe the two also planned to use pipe bombs , which they had learnt how to make in advance , a police spokeswoman said .
No bombs have been found so far .
Police also discovered a list of 17 names of teachers and pupils believed to be intended victims .
The elder of the two friends felt bullied at school and fitted the profile of a potential killer , police said .
Last year on November 20 , the date of the planned attack , an 18 - year - old stormed a secondary school in the town of Emsdetten , injuring 37 , some seriously , before he committed suicide .
In April 2002 , 19 - year - old Robert Steinhauser shot dead 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt , eastern Germany .
Earlier this month , an 18 - year - old gunman went on a shooting rampage in a school in Finland , killing seven of his fellow pupils , the head teacher and later himself .

Disabled retroviruses — fossils of molecular battles that raged for generations — make up eight per cent of the human genome .
JOOST SWARTE
Thierry Heidmann ’s office , adjacent to the laboratory he runs at the Institut Gustave Roussy , on the southern edge of Paris , could pass for a museum of genetic catastrophe .
Files devoted to the world ’s most horrifying infectious diseases fill the cabinets and line the shelves .
There are thick folders for smallpox , Ebola virus , and various forms of influenza .
SARS is accounted for , as are more obscure pathogens , such as feline leukemia virus , Mason - Pfizer monkey virus , and simian foamy virus , which is endemic in African apes .
H.I.V. , the best - known and most insidious of the viruses at work today , has its own shelf of files .
The lab ’s beakers , vials , and refrigerators , secured behind locked doors with double - paned windows , all teem with viruses .
Heidmann , a meaty , middle - aged man with wild eyebrows and a beard heavily flecked with gray , has devoted his career to learning what viruses might tell us about AIDS and various forms of cancer .
“ This knowledge will help us treat terrible diseases , ” he told me , nodding briefly toward his lab .
“ Viruses can provide answers to questions we have never even asked . ”
Viruses reproduce rapidly and often with violent results , yet they are so rudimentary that many scientists do n’t even consider them to be alive .
A virus is nothing more than a few strands of genetic material wrapped in a package of protein — a parasite , unable to function on its own .
In order to survive , it must find a cell to infect .
Only then can any virus make use of its single talent , which is to take control of a host ’s cellular machinery and use it to churn out thousands of copies of itself .
These viruses then move from one cell to the next , transforming each new host into a factory that makes even more virus .
In this way , one infected cell soon becomes billions .
Nothing — not even the Plague — has posed a more persistent threat to humanity than viral diseases : yellow fever , measles , and smallpox have been causing epidemics for thousands of years .
At the end of the First World War , fifty million people died of the Spanish flu ; smallpox may have killed half a billion during the twentieth century alone .
Those viruses were highly infectious , yet their impact was limited by their ferocity : a virus may destroy an entire culture , but if we die it dies , too .
As a result , not even smallpox possessed the evolutionary power to influence humans as a species — to alter our genetic structure .
That would require an organism to insinuate itself into the critical cells we need in order to reproduce : our germ cells .
Only retroviruses , which reverse the usual flow of genetic code from DNA to RNA , are capable of that .
A retrovirus stores its genetic information in a single - stranded molecule of RNA , instead of the more common double - stranded DNA .
When it infects a cell , the virus deploys a special enzyme , called reverse transcriptase , that enables it to copy itself and then paste its own genes into the new cell ’s DNA .
It then becomes part of that cell forever ; when the cell divides , the virus goes with it .
Scientists have long suspected that if a retrovirus happens to infect a human sperm cell or egg , which is rare , and if that embryo survives — which is rarer still — the retrovirus could take its place in the blueprint of our species , passed from mother to child , and from one generation to the next , much like a gene for eye color or asthma .
When the sequence of the human genome was fully mapped , in 2003 , researchers also discovered something they had not anticipated : our bodies are littered with the shards of such retroviruses , fragments of the chemical code from which all genetic material is made .
It takes less than two per cent of our genome to create all the proteins necessary for us to live .
Eight per cent , however , is composed of broken and disabled retroviruses , which , millions of years ago , managed to embed themselves in the DNA of our ancestors .
They are called endogenous retroviruses , because once they infect the DNA of a species they become part of that species .
One by one , though , after molecular battles that raged for thousands of generations , they have been defeated by evolution .
Like dinosaur bones , these viral fragments are fossils .
Instead of having been buried in sand , they reside within each of us , carrying a record that goes back millions of years .
Because they no longer seem to serve a purpose or cause harm , these remnants have often been referred to as “ junk DNA . ”
Many still manage to generate proteins , but scientists have never found one that functions properly in humans or that could make us sick .
Then , last year , Thierry Heidmann brought one back to life .
Combining the tools of genomics , virology , and evolutionary biology , he and his colleagues took a virus that had been extinct for hundreds of thousands of years , figured out how the broken parts were originally aligned , and then pieced them together .
After resurrecting the virus , the team placed it in human cells and found that their creation did indeed insert itself into the DNA of those cells .
They also mixed the virus with cells taken from hamsters and cats .
It quickly infected them all , offering the first evidence that the broken parts could once again be made infectious .
The experiment could provide vital clues about how viruses like H.I.V. work .
Inevitably , though , it also conjures images of Frankenstein ’s monster and Jurassic Park .
“ If you think about this for five minutes , it is wild stuff , ” John Coffin told me when I visited him in his laboratory at Tufts University , where he is the American Cancer Society Research Professor .
Coffin is one of the country ’s most distinguished molecular biologists , and was one of the first to explore the role of endogenous retroviruses in human evolution .
“ I understand that the idea of bringing something dead back to life is fundamentally frightening , ” he went on .
“ It ’s a power that science has come to possess and it makes us queasy , and it should .
But there are many viruses that are more dangerous than these — more infectious , far riskier to work with , and less potentially useful . ’’
Thanks to steady advances in computing power and DNA technology , a talented undergraduate with a decent laptop and access to any university biology lab can assemble a virus with ease .
Five years ago , as if to prove that point , researchers from the State University of New York at Stony Brook “ built ” a polio virus , using widely available information and DNA they bought through the mail .
To test their “ polio recipe , ” they injected the virus into mice .
The animals first became paralyzed and then died .
( “ The reason we did it was to prove that it can be done , ’’ Eckard Wimmer , who led the team , said at the time .
“ Progress in biomedical research has its benefits and it has its downside . ’’)
The effort was widely seen as pointless and the justification absurd .
“ Proof of principle for bioterrorism , ’’ Coffin called it .
“ Nothing more . ”
Then , two years ago , after researchers had sequenced the genetic code of the 1918 flu virus , federal scientists reconstructed it , too .
In that case , there was a well - understood and highly desired goal : to develop a vaccine that might offer protection against future pandemics .
Larry Page announced the video store in Las Vegas
In an e-mail to users the web giant said that money spent on videos would not be refunded .
Customers are being offered fixed credit on the firm 's online payment system , Google Checkout , instead .
The move comes nine months after Google paid $ 1.65 bn for online site You Tube , which also sells some video .
Google started selling video content on its video site in January last year , offering programs such as Survivor , CSI and Star Trek for about $ 1.99 ( £1 ) .
Google co-founder Larry Page launched the service at the Consumer Electronics Show , in Las Vegas , but the success of YouTube has made Google Video increasingly irrelevant .
Jupiter analyst David Card said Google 's decision to stop people from watching content they had already bought from the service was a mistake .
" No wonder consumers are still a bit cautious about digital content , " he wrote on his blog .
He added : " We 've seen a physical format - device combo go out of manufacture before : wax cylinders , 8 - tracks .
But can you think of any consumer - purchased medium that actually becomes unusable while there are players that still work ? "
Google said users would be offered a Google Checkout credit of $ 5 ( £ 2.50 ) , which would expire within 60 days .

CIA Recruiters Expelled from UCSB Campus ucsbsaw [ at ] gmail.com )
Friday Nov 16th , 2007 9:59 AM by UCSB SAW
The CIA was scheduled to hold an “ infosession ” for students interested in jobs with the agency .
Right as the session began , four activists entered the room and began to demonstrate waterboarding , a torture technique used by the CIA .
After only one minute of the waterboarding demonstration the room was plunged into chaos by a group calling itself the Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army .
The Rebel Clowns , joined by several dozen antiwar organizers took over the meeting room and began passing out information on the CIA ’s use of illegal torture techniques and literature related to the agency ’s long history of subverting foreign governments , assassinating foreign leaders and subverting democracy .
The CIA agents fled the room but were pursued by a crowd of protestors chanting , “ C - I - A , Go Away ! ”
The agents were caught totally off - guard by the direct action .
Protestors were overheard shouting to the escaping agents never to come back to UCSB .
A routine CIA information and recruitment session was suddenly disrupted on the campus of the University of California , Santa Barbara today when a small group of student protesters walked in and lead a man with bound hands to the front of the room , where he was laid on a table and ( voluntarily * ) tortured with a CIA - approved technique used to simulate drowning , known as water - boarding .
The CIA speakers were struggling to speak over the " torture victim's " coughs and cries for help , while potential CIA recruits looked on with bewilderment at the grotesquely real portrayal of torture .
UC Santa Barbara Students Drive Out CIA

A routine CIA information and recruitment session was suddenly disrupted on the campus of the University of California , Santa Barbara today when a small group of student protestors walked in and lead a man with bound hands to the front of the room , where he was laid on a table and ( voluntarily * ) tortured with a CIA - approved technique used to simulate drowning , known as water - boarding .
The CIA speakers were struggling to speak over the " torture victim's " coughs and cries for help , while potential CIA recruits looked on with bewilderment at the grotesquely real portrayal of torture .
As the torture victim screamed in terror , a large group of students , with a faction of the Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army ( CIRCA ) at the lead , stormed the room .
CIRCA members untied the bound man and pushed his torturers aside to chants of ' NO TORTURE AT UCSB !' and ' CIA , GO AWAY !'.
One of the rebel clowns even took advantage of a CIA operative 's vacant chair at the head of the room to begin a new , and interactive , information session with the crowd to discuss the true history of the CIA and why they must be resisted .
Meanwhile , clowns and students mingled with the potential recruits to discuss the truth of the organization , and other options for those who had attended the meeting .
People got on tables , chairs were overturned , and the projector screen was rolled up .
The two CIA recruiters heading the meeting appeared to be caught completely off guard .
They packed up and began to leave , followed first by a few of the students who had come for the recruiting session , and then by the entire clown - and - student insurgency , which proceeded to disrupt every attempt at meeting in other parts of UCSB 's U - Cen , or University Center , building , by surrounding CIA agents and confronting them with a battery of questioning and shame , making it clear that torturers will not be tolerated at UC Santa Barbara .
When it was apparent that any attempt at recruitment would fail , the meeting dispersed and one agent was escorted off the university by the chanting , confrontational insurgency .
When it was clear that the agent was no longer a threat to impressionable University students , the crowd returned to the U - Cen to forcibly eject the other agent , only to discover that he had already left as well .
The former meeting room was occupied and used for a networking and debriefing session , where the insurgency was able to use the energy of the event to lay down the foundations for future resistance .
* The volunteer in question was , per his request , actually tortured using the water - boarding technique , so as to give the students the necessary picture of what the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States is guilty of doing to human beings .
Although the demonstration was obviously painful , he felt it was essential , and bravely allowed himself to be put through this terrible experience .
Do n't try this at home , and do n't let anybody do it to you ; especially if they work for the government .

The clowns interrupt the CIA informational meeting to criticize torture tactics and other allegedly negative influences of the program yesterday .
They distributed pamphlets on campus and used the clown theme to try to make a mockery out of the CIA .
A group of several protesters dressed in clown costumes and painted faces followed a CIA recruiter last night from his presentation in the UCen to his car behind the Thunderdome .
A CIA recruitment and informational meeting was taking place in a conference room on the UCen ’s lower level , when , at 5 p.m. , a group of protesters interrupted the recruiter ’s PowerPoint presentation by placing one of their fellow clowns on the front table , binding his hands and arms , and pouring water on his face to simulate waterboarding torture in front of the presentation ’s unsuspecting audience .
The group also held a mock press conference citing historical torture statistics and played limbo with a fuzzy green boa before the recruiters quickly packed up their equipment and left the room .
The crowd of a dozen clowns and almost 50 onlookers followed the lead recruiter through the halls of the UCen , up and down two flights of stairs , and out to Storke Plaza , chanting “ No torture at UCSB ” and “ CIA , go away . ”
The recruiter , who did not stop for comment , said only “ I ’m not in violation of anything , ” before getting into his car at the lot next to Pardall Tunnel .
Jennifer Bamberg , a UCSB alumni and protester , was passing out anti-torture signs to fellow supporters in front of the UCen throughout the protest .
She said students should reject the CIA and cited various allegations .
“ It ’s the fact that they practice torture since their inception , ” Bamberg said .
“ They had a hand in the coup in Chile in ‘ 73 , they go into places like Afghanistan and assure opium gets to poor black areas in the U.S. ; they supported crop dusting in Columbia and poisoned thousands of families ’ farm supplies . ”
According to third - year environmental studies major Whitney Walberg , “ Community Members Against War ” is the unofficial group behind the protest .
The group has no set roster of members , but serves as a place for concerned students to plan action .
Walberg said that the group chose the clown motif to embarrass the CIA and make a joke out of their meeting .
“ The reason they feel this is effective is because they completely make the situation a joke , ” Walberg said .
“ It takes the seriousness and legitimacy away from the CIA .
UCSB is one of the only UCs that the CIA recruits at and we want them to stop what they ’re doing . ”
After the recruiter left , Will Parish , the most costumed of the protesters , spoke against the CIA while in character as a high - pitched clown .
“ All I wanted to know was if , by Western standards , it ’s OK for me to tickle you in the butt if it ’s okay for you to torture people , ” Parish said .
“ That guy was an evasive asshole . ”
The protesters also distributed pamphlets detailing several instances of alleged CIA international abuses .
First year zoology and film studies major Lindsey Parker said she heard about the event through Facebook and came to protest what she deemed as unacceptable practices by the CIA .
“ We claim to support a peaceful cause but then we do shady things like this , ” Parker said .
“ There are all sorts of barbaric acts that are going on . ”
The agent told us " you ca n't take photos " and tried blocking one photographer 's camera .
Just after this photo was taken he attempted to call the police .

Activists see Senate Dems backing down to Bush , ready to give immunity to phone companies Nick Juliano

As lawmakers hurry to clear their legislative plates before rushing home for Christmas dinner , it appears all - but - certain that Congress will not finish work to update a foreign spy law before the new year .
But votes expected this week and next in the Senate have civil libertarians worried about their prospects to block a proposal that would free telecommunications companies from legal oversight of their facilitation of President Bush 's post - 9/11 warrantless wiretapping scheme .
As the timeline appears to be shaking out , Democrats seem headed for an 11th - hour showdown with the White House over updates to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
In a similar showdown this summer , Republicans said a failure to act on FISA would endanger the country .
On its way out the door for summer vacation , Congress passed a temporary update to the law that was widely panned for its lack of judicial oversight and constitutional protections .
Although Democrats succeeded in keeping telecom immunity out of the August bill , it seems likely to worm its way into this latest version , at least in the Senate , despite voracious opposition from prominent Democrats there , including all the party 's presidential candidates .
" People who had some faith that [ congressional Democrats ] were going to live up to their campaign promises are a little disappointed , " Caroline Fredrickson , the top Washington lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union , told RAW STORY Friday .
The House and Senate have spent the last few months crafting permanent FISA updates that would close loopholes in the 1978 law that President Bush says limits US intelligence agencies ' ability to spy on suspected terrorists .
The Senate is expected to begin debate on dueling FISA updates Friday and into next week , although it remains unclear whether the Senate will pass a bill before recessing just before Christmas .
There is some common ground between Bush and the Democratic congress on closing that loophole , which required US spies to get court warrants before listening in on phone calls between intelligence suspects abroad .
But there is substantial opposition among Democrats to a companion proposal put forward by Bush and Republicans in congress to grant legal immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated the president 's post - 9/11 warrantless wiretapping program .
Last month , the House passed a FISA update that did not include immunity for telecommunications companies , but the Senate still has not voted on companion legislation , although a bill could come to the floor as soon as this week .
The Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees share jurisdiction over the FISA law , but the committees have come down on different sides of the immunity issue .
It is up to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) to decide which proposal the full chamber will consider .
As things stand now , Reid is expected to send to the floor the Intelligence Committee 's bill , which includes immunity , with the immunity - free Judiciary bill pending as a substitute amendment .
The way things stand now , observers expect 60 votes would be required to substitute the immunity - free judiciary proposal for the intelligence committee bill , a standard few believe could be reached .
Debate on the bill will begin Monday , Reid said from the Senate floor Friday .
" This is one of the most bizarre procedural scenarios that I 've ever dealt with , " said Fredrickson , who spent nine years as a Senate staffer .
Further muddling matters , Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , a dark - horse presidential candidate , announced his intention to place a " hold " on any FISA update containing immunity .
Reid is apparently ignoring his request , but Dodd has vowed to filibuster the bill and says he will work to block immunity any way he can .
On Thursday , the Judiciary Committee voted down a proposal from Sen. Arlen Specter that would have allowed the 40 or so lawsuits that have been filed to go forward , but it would have made the government the defendant in those suits , not the telecoms .
Specter , the committee 's ranking Republican , could re-introduce his amendment when the FISA update comes to the Senate floor .
Opponents of telecom immunity see the lawsuits against the telecoms as the only opportunity to find out whether the warrantless wiretapping was constitutional , as the Bush administration has claimed executive privilege and state secrets doctrines in dodging Congress 's attempts to investigate the program .
Specter said his proposal was aimed at allowing those suits to go forward without bankrupting the telephone and internet companies defending themselves .
" What rankles me is that we 're being asked to approve of something that we do n't even know what happened , " Specter said during a Judiciary Committee meeting today .
His proposal failed on a 5 - 13 vote .
The Senate has a raft of spending bills and other legislation to address before it goes to recess at the end of next week , so it 's still up in the air whether the FISA update will come to the floor before then .
Whatever happens , the House and Senate are not expected to meet in conference or send a bill to the president until January .
" Practically speaking , how do you do that ? "
Judiciary Committee spokeswoman Erica Chabot said in an interview Thursday .
In August , Congress rushed through a temporary FISA update , which many Democrats and civil libertarians found unacceptable , under heavy pressure from the Bush administration .
The president , along with members of his administration and GOP lawmakers , issued ominous warnings that a failure to act immediately would leave the country vulnerable .
The House and Senate passed a temporary FISA update , the Protect America Act , less than 24 hours before each adjourned for a month - long recess , and lawmakers later complained that the tight deadline they faced forced them to adopt an unacceptable bill .
Congress has spent more time on the current FISA - update proposals , but they still seem headed for a potential showdown with the White House under a looming deadline .
The PAA expires Feb. 1 , but Congress does not return to session until week of Jan. 15 , giving them about two weeks to finalize a bill for the president .
Further complicating measures is Bush 's vow to veto any bill without telecom immunity -- such as the version passed in the House -- and he will give his State of the Union address Jan. 29 , two days before the PAA would expire .
Democrats could feasibly pass an immunity - free bill that gives the president what he wants except for telecom immunity and dare him to veto it , thereby allowing the PAA to expire and re-opening the loopholes he says endanger national security .
Whether there is enough support for such a strategy remains to be seen .
Plenty of Democratic senators seem to have been convinced of the merits of giving immunity to telecommunications companies , and the Democrats have demonstrated in the past that they are willing to bow the Republican attacks that they are weak in fighting terrorism , Fredrickson said .
" Anything that 's the slightest bit of a risk ... they decide not to deal with it , " she said .
Rather , the mantra among Democrats seems to be " keep the majority at all costs . "

Delta 4 - Heavy rocket fires away from Cape Canaveral
BY JUSTIN RAY
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : November 11 , 2007
It is America 's largest unmanned space booster .
Its level of complexity causes engineers to liken it to launching three rockets at one time .
And its fiery blastoffs create a dazzling yet heart - in - your - throat sight .
Now , the mammoth Delta 4 - Heavy has entered operational service with Saturday night 's successful ascent carrying a critical surveillance satellite .

Towering more than 230 feet tall and packing nearly two million pounds of thrust from its three hydrogen - fueled main engines , this rocket is built to loft big payloads .
And the roomy nose cone offers spacious accommodations for exceptionally large spacecraft .
The Delta 4 - Heavy 's characteristics make it well suited for launching a Defense Support Program ( DSP ) missile warning satellite into geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the planet .
But in its lone previous flight three years ago , the Heavy encountered an unexpected problem within its fuel lines , causing the engines to snuff out a few seconds early and leaving the rocket well short of the intended orbit .
That December 2004 launch was only a test , an Air Force - financed demonstration flight designed to uncover the unknown flaws in the system before expensive and vital national security payloads were entrusted to the big booster .
" It 's always better to find a problem than to have a latent and yet - to - be - discovered ( problem ) .
That 's part of why we considered the Heavy demo such a success .
It was a very subtle problem , but we found it and we fixed it , " said Col. Jim Planeaux , the Delta group commander at the Space and Missile Systems Center .
The test rocket was outfitted with vast amounts of data - collecting sensors to understand all aspects of the ascent , leading to some other changes before the first operational launch .
Credit : Ben Cooper / Spaceflight Now
" We took a lot of readings on accelerations , vibrations , acoustics in the various compartments of the vehicle .
In a few cases ( we ) determined that they were higher than we expected and we either modified the hardware slightly or moved some of the components to a more benign environment .
We finished all of those ( modifications ) late last year , and we 're very comfortable with the vehicle we 've got . "
Rocket - maker United Launch Alliance and the Air Force , both confident that the Heavy was ready for a real mission , fired off the rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 8:50 p.m. EST ( 0150 GMT ) Saturday evening .
Hidden inside the long metallic nose cone rode the Defense Support Program 23 spacecraft , the last in a series of eye - in - the - sky satellites designed to spot enemy missile launches and nuclear explosions .
DSP satellites have been flying since November 1970 , rocketing into orbit aboard various versions of now - retired Titan rockets and the space shuttle .
This final one -- DSP 23 -- has been waiting more than two years for the new Heavy to hoist it into space .
The Delta 4 - Heavy is created by taking three Common Booster Cores -- the liquid hydrogen - fueled motor that forms a Delta 4 - Medium 's first stage -- and strapping them together to form a three - wide rocket , and then adding the powerful upper stage .
Each 15 - story booster core features a Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne RS - 68 main engine that generates 650,000 pounds of thrust while burning supercold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants .
The cryogenic upper stage has the Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne RL10B - 2 powerplant .

As the countdown entered the final seconds , liquid hydrogen rushed through the three RS - 68 engines and then the powerplants roared to ignition .
A massive cloud of fire raced up the rocket , creating a visually awesome but terrifying display .
A dozen explosive bolts holding the vehicle to pad 37B detonated as clocks struck zero to free the Heavy to begin climbing as three launch pad swing arms pulled back .
Data from the test flight showed the ignition fireball created hot temperatures around the nose cone , leading to another change for the DSP satellite launch .
" We 've done a lot of thinking about it since ( the test ) .
It does get pretty hot up around even the payload vents .
So to mitigate that , we 've added some modifications to this particular payload fairing to essentially keep the plume out as the vehicle rises and still allow the payload compartment to vent properly , " Planeaux said .
" When you 've got a payload that 's very sensitive to contamination , we had to go through some fairly elaborate measures to ensure we were well protected there . "
The three identical main engines , the world 's largest hydrogen - fueled rocket engine and each capable of generating 17 million horsepower , propelled the vehicle into a clear night sky with three distinct red - hot plumes trailing more than 200 feet long .

About 50 seconds into flight , the center Common Booster Core 's engine was throttled back to its minimum power level of 57 percent thrust to conserve fuel that became important later .
The starboard and port boosters continued firing at full throttle -- 102 percent thrust -- through the launch 's first four minutes before emptying their liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant tanks and shutting down the RS - 68 engines .
The boosters peeled away and plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean .
Once the outer boosters were shed , the center stage finally throttled back up to 102 percent for more than a minute of propulsion , consuming that fuel supply saved during the period of reduced thrust .
The stage was jettisoned about five minutes , 40 seconds after liftoff , leaving the rocket 's upper stage and payload to continue the journey to orbit .
About 13 minutes into flight , the upper stage completed its first burn to achieve an initial parking orbit above Earth and entered an hour - long coast mode until it reached the extreme western Pacific Ocean northeast of Australia .
That is where the RL10 engine was re-ignited to reach a geosynchronous transfer orbit stretching 22,000 miles at its high point .
The stage then coasted in this orbit , eventually reaching the apogee where the RL10 engine was fired for a third time starting at T+plus 6 hours , 10 minutes .
The three - minute burn circularized the orbit over the equator off the western coast of South America .
At 3:09 a.m. EST , the 5,179 - pound DSP satellite was released from the Delta 4 - Heavy rocket to complete the launch .
" Last night 's successful countdown and flight culminate a tremendous amount of hard work by the entire Air Force launch team and our industry partners .
Congratulations to all who made this challenging and spectacular launch of the DSP 23 satellite a reality , " Planeaux said .

" As the first operational launch of a Delta 4 Heavy Lift Vehicle , it marks a major milestone accomplishment for the EELV program and for assured access to space . "
Bringing the Heavy version of the Air Force 's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle family into operational service , the military has now successfully replaced the retired Titan rocket fleet for deploying large satellite payloads .
" This success highlights the continued maturization of our EELV program , " said Brig .
Gen. Susan Helms , 45th Space Wing commander at Cape Canaveral .
Another Heavy is next up on the Delta 4's launch schedule .
An April liftoff is planned from Cape Canaveral to deliver a classified spy satellite into orbit for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office .
Officials plan a five - month gap between Saturday 's flight and the subsequent launch while engineers complete a thorough review of data .
" That has a five - month standoff to digest all of the analysis and redo all of the loads for the payload .
But we look forward to not taking any more time than that to launch NROL - 26 , " said Mark Wilkins , United Launch Alliance vice president for Delta Programs .
Another secret NRO launch using a Heavy from the Cape is planned in 2009 , followed no sooner than 2010 the first Heavy flight from California 's Vandenberg Air Force Base with another NRO payload .
Outfitting of that West Coast pad to install equipment for the larger rocket has begun .

Water changing from blue to brown could be a good sign
A major reduction in acid rain since the 1970s has resulted in more dissolved organic carbon entering the regions ' waters , researchers suggest .
Writing in Nature , they say soils are becoming less acidic , resulting in more carbon being washed away by rainfall .
The staining has previously been linked to global warming and land - use change .
" The solubility of organic carbon is pH - dependent , so the more acidic a soil gets , the less soluble a number of these organic compounds are , " explained co-author Don Monteith , from University College London , UK .
Acid test
Acid rain is caused by burning fossil fuels , especially coal .
Sulphur and nitrogen emissions from large industrial sites , such as power stations , react with water in the atmosphere to fall to the ground as acid rain .
The problem reached its peak in Europe and North America in the 1970s , damaging forests , lakes and even buildings .
Since then , legislation has curbed the amount of the pollutants being pumped into the air .
People have been living with the impact of acid rain for so long that no - one alive today really has an idea of what the waters were like before
Don Monteith , UCL
" This issue was identified about five years ago , and since then there have been a number of papers trying to explain what is going on , " Mr Monteith told BBC News .
" A lot of these ideas would suggest that that there is this global process which is linked , in some way , to global warming .
" What we are demonstrating here is that the main driver is acid rain .
It is unlikely that this process is occurring globally - it is going to be confined to these industrialised nations that are cleaning up their emissions . "
Although the discolouration is a sign that waters are becoming less acidic , Mr Monteith , said many people would view it as a deterioration in water quality .
" The problem is that people have been living with the impact of acid rain for so long that no - one alive today really has an idea of what the waters were like before acid rain took hold , " he said .
" A lot of the drinking water in the UK is drawn from upland catchments , where we do have the browner water .
" The public tend not to like any evidence of discolouration so the water industry has to spend quite a lot of money to treat the water to remove the colour . "
Murky issue
However , he added that the increased release of dissolved organic carbon was not without problems .
" One impact is the distribution of sunlight in lakes .
In some aquatic ecosystems , plants will not be able to grow as deeply as they did before , because light will be attenuated in the upper levels of the lake . "
Another potential issue Mr Monteith pointed up was that some toxins , particularly industrial heavy metals such as mercury , copper and aluminium , bind very tightly with organic molecules .
" At the moment we do not know what the implications are for the cycling and transport of these toxic compounds now that the carbon is becoming more soluble . "
He said that the team of researchers who worked on the paper hoped the findings would settle the debate about the cause of the brown water and help move things forward .
" We believe that there should be a lot more work going into the consequences of the potential changes in the [ carbon ] cycle - we do n't have any real idea as to the fate of this ( dissolved organic carbon ) , " he admitted .
" In theory , we should be seeing larger amounts of organic carbon reaching the oceans , but we do n't really know what happens when it reaches the water and to what extent the carbon will end up in sediments or be lost to carbon dioxide . "

Scientists in the US have also been studying a Titan balloon concept A mission could be launched before the end of the next decade to put a balloon on Titan , the hazy Saturnian moon .
The balloon is one of several ideas being considered by the European Space Agency as it sketches out where its science should be focussed in future .
Other proposals include an X - ray telescope that flies in two parts ; and a sample - return mission to an asteroid .
All the ideas will be subjected to further study ; and are likely to evolve as international partners get involved .
Eventually , two missions will be selected , one to fly no earlier than 2017 and the other no earlier than 2018 .
Esa 's future - scoping project is known as Cosmic Vision .
It assesses the big questions currently in space science and then tries to find mission architectures that can best deliver the answers .
Xeus would fly two elements in formation
There are two categories : large ( L - Class ) , which will cost Esa something in the region of 650 m euros ; and medium ( M - Class ) , which is projected to cost the agency about 300 m euros .
For the big missions , international partnerships are necessary because the costs involved are so great .
A recent US space agency ( Nasa ) report found that no meaningful mission to the Saturnian system could be undertaken for less than $ 1bn ( 700 m euros ) and would in all events cost considerably more .
The Cosmic Vision 2015 - 2025 candidates will undergo an internal review in Esa before contracts are awarded to industry to carry out feasibility studies .
The L - Class candidates include : Laplace :
This mission would go to Jupiter and its moons .
A key target of interest would be the icy moon Europa which is thought to harbour an ocean under its icy crust .
The mission would deploy three orbiting platforms to perform coordinated observations of Europa , the other Jovian satellites , Jupiter 's magnetosphere and its atmosphere and interior .

The mission would explore both Titan and Enceladus , the other Saturnian moon currently fascinating scientists .

Xeus :
This next - generation telescope would study the X -ray Universe .
It comes in two parts : a mirror satellite and a detector satellite which have to be flown in formation with extreme precision .
The M - Class candidates include : Cross - scale : A swarm of 12 spacecraft to make simultaneous measurements of plasma ( charged gas ) surrounding Earth .

Dune and Space :
These are two mission ideas before Esa that would tell us more about the mysterious " dark matter " and even stranger " dark energy " that seem to dominate our Universe but which have proven frustratingly difficult to explain with current observation technologies .

Plato : A mission to find and study planets beyond our Solar System .
It would be capable of observing rocky ( similar to Earth ) exoplanets around brighter and better characterised stars than its predecessors , such as the recently launched Corot mission .

Spica :
The Japanese are proposing a mission which would launch a telescope to study the cosmos at far infrared wavelengths .
If Europe became involved , it would bring expertise and technology developed for its own Herschel telescope due to launch next year .
At the end of the assessment process , it is likely Esa will select just one L - Class and one M - Class to take forward to full development and launch .
GRAVITATIONAL WAVES Gravitational waves are an inevitable consequence of the Theory of General Relativity
They describe the gravity force as distortions made by matter in the fabric of space - time Any moving mass will produce waves ; they are expected to propagate at the speed of light Detectable sources to include exploding stars , merging black holes and neutron stars
If Lisa is made to work , it would see remnant radiation from the Big Bang itself
Path to a new astronomy
One complicating factor is the desire to loft an observatory into space that can test a key prediction of Albert Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity - by making a detection of gravitational waves .
Europe and the US are together developing a mission known as Lisa which would detect these " ripples " in the fabric of space - time - but it is proving an immense challenge from a technological standpoint .
Whether or not one of the L - Class missions listed above gets to be developed may depend on how well , or not , progress is made on Lisa ( Laser Interferometer Space Antenna ) .

The pushback against the recent finding [ . pdf ] by America ’s 16 intelligence agencies that puts " high confidence " in their evaluation that Iran stopped its covert nuclear weapons project in 2003 has the Lobby going into overdrive  with ( who else ? )
John Bolton leading the charge , crying " Putsch ! " and decrying the NIE as pure " politics . "
Bolton and his neoconservative co-thinkers are really just echoing the Israelis , however , who have sullenly asserted their own dissent , albeit discreetly enough to maintain the fiction of their own complete lack of influence .
For the Israeli view , however , all we have to do is go over to The New Republic , which has always reflected the allegiances of its publisher and sometime owner , where Yossi Klein Halevi derides the NIE as an " insult to intelligence . "
The it ’s - all - political theme , echoed by the Wall Street Journal ‘s editorial page , Bob Baer in Time , and the Israeli - occupied regions of the blogosphere , is neatly summarized by Halevi :
" No one with whom I ’ve spoken believes that professional considerations , such as new intelligence , were decisive in changing the American assessment on Iran .
What has been widely hailed in the American media as an expression of intelligence sobriety , even courage , is seen in the Israeli strategic community as precisely the opposite : an expression of political machination and cowardice .
‘ The Americans often accuse us of tailoring our intelligence to suit our political needs , ’ notes a former top security official .
‘ But is n’t this report a case study of doing precisely that ? ' ”
Anyone who has been following this story is bound to wonder : what world is Halevi living in ?
The provenance of the NIE has been widely discussed in several news articles , which reveal a number of sources for fresh intelligence utilized by U.S. analysts , including intercepts of conversations between at least one Iranian military officer connected to " Project 1 - 11 " ( the code name for the Iranian nuclear program ) and some unidentified others in which the officer complains bitterly that the project has been nixed , and speculates on the question of whether or not it will be revived at some future date .
That sure sounds like new intelligence to me .
Yet there is a deeper level of deception here , which we can dig into when we pose the same question posed by the NIE ’s critics , such as Norman Podhoretz , who asks :
" A full two years after Iran supposedly called a halt to its nuclear program , the intelligence community was still as sure as it ever is about anything that Iran was determined to build a nuclear arsenal .
Why then should we believe it when it now tells us , and with the same ‘ high confidence , ’ that Iran had already called a halt to its nuclear - weapons program in 2003 ? "
Since Podhoretz is arguing from his own a priori assumption that the 2005 NIE was correct , he never asks what was the basis of the American contention  made with " high confidence "  that Iran was " determined " to build nukes ?
It all goes back to what is called " the laptop of death "  a portable computer obtained in mid-2004 from a " walk - in " source , who had supposedly received it from another unidentified person in Iran , which contained " voluminous " plans for the construction of a missile containing a nuclear warhead .
U.S. officials used this " find " to convince the Europeans that the Iranian nuclear threat is real and menacing : it was a key part of the rationale for the alarming 2005 NIE .
Yet the story of where this treasure trove of intelligence allegedly came from kept getting murkier and more dubious .
According to Dafna Linzer , reporting in the Washington Post , it was " allegedly stolen from an Iranian whom German intelligence tried , unsuccessfully , to recruit as an informant .
It was whisked out of the country by another Iranian who offered it up to foreign intelligence officials in Turkey as evidence of a nuclear weapons program . "
If this sounds like the Niger uranium papers , the crude forgeries that somehow got past the president ’s Praetorian Guard and formed the basis for the infamous " sixteen words , " then the question asked by Podhoretz and his pals  how did we get it so wrong ?
 takes on a meaning they never intended .
Because , if we look at the timeline of this evolving narrative , the discrepancy between the discovery of the " laptop of death " in mid-2004 and the termination of the Iranian nukes program in 2003 raises a simple question :
Was " the laptop of death " a deliberate effort to deceive ?
Given the record of this administration in the run-up to war with Iraq , and the extremely dicey " intelligence " that was created out of whole cloth by Iraqi exiles in league with our own domestic neocons , alarm bells ought to be going off about now .
Ewen MacAskill , writing in the Guardian , reports that the authors of the new NIE " have gone back over the material and subjected it to a higher level of scrutiny .
They took the same data but reached different conclusions .
They also had some new material . "
In other words , they went back and looked at the " intelligence " used to justify the last NIE  and rejected it .
The new material , including the intercepts , debunked the claim that Iran was developing nuclear weapons .
Apparently , the single official mentioned in the " laptop of death " documents , one Mohsen Fakrizadeh , was one of the individuals we spied on , recording his complaints about the program ’s demise .
And there are yet more clues about the walking - back process that provide a clue to our earlier cluelessness .
In a Washington Post piece on the laptop documents published two years ago , we get this :
" After more than a year of analysis , questions remain about the trove ’s authenticity .
‘ Even with the best intelligence , you always ask yourself , " Was this prepared for my eyes ? " ’ one American official said .
Several intelligence experts said that a sophisticated Western spy agency could , in theory , have produced the contents of the laptop .
But American officials insisted there was no evidence of such fraud . "
While the laptop documents , according to one account , were convincing because they described progressive developments in the Iranian nuclear program extending into " early 2004 "  a year after the secret effort was ended  the fraud perpetrated here is n’t necessarily a pure forgery .
What apparently happened is that someone stole the documents , some or most of which may have been authentic , in order to pass off a defunct operation as an active enterprise .
In other words , someone  whether a foreign intelligence service or some U.S. officials is not known  tried to deliberately deceive us .
Now , who , I ask you , would try to pull off such a dastardly deed ?
Incredibly , there is to be no investigation into the case of the " laptop of death "  or how the phony intelligence contained therein became the basis of U.S. policy toward Iran .
Instead , a gaggle of " liberal " policy wonks are crying out that the " threat " from Iran still needs to be dealt with , and they are calling for the imposition of stricter sanctions  in other words , they ’re going along with the Israeli - neoconservative line that the whole thing is " political " and does n’t involve any new intelligence .
They ’d rather be deceived , and please do n’t burden them with any inconvenient facts  they ’ve already made up their minds .
That list includes Anthony Lake , a top foreign policy adviser to Barack Obama , who says that the NIE shows we have to take " action " ( i.e. , impose sanctions via the UN ) and that it is n’t too late to " stop " the Iranians from doing what they are n’t trying to do .
We were almost lied into war again  and the Lobby may yet succeed in manipulating us into a conflict with Iran .
As I said last week , the danger of war has not yet passed , and may even be increased on account of the new NIE  because the War Party never rests .
At any moment , some fresh " intelligence " similar to the " laptop of death , " the infamous " dodgy dossier , " or the Niger uranium forgeries could come out of the woodwork .
All we know is that the current crop of national security bureaucrats is going to put up a fight before they allow us to be duped again .
The question that cries out for an answer , however , is : who duped us the last time around ?

Behind The Glass
In our modern world where most of us are generally surrounded by and marketed to with uninspiring things , this serves as my attempt to counter that with moments I 've found to be interesting and special .
I 've taken and post - processed all the photos here since 2002 .
I currently call Austin home and have lived throughout the United States ( to include Washington State , Florida , Indiana , Virginia & Texas ) during my lifetime .
I currently work as a front - end designer and developer during the day and enjoy travelling to new places and wandering around with my gear .
Whilst snapping , nothing is ever pre-arranged .
No lighting setup .
No props .
No actors .
When I find myself exploring and traversing areas unknown to me , armed with only a simple Canon DSLR , some lenses and a curious perspective I 'm fully immersed in the moment .
At that point it 's almost impossible not to find interesting , special and unique moments that are all too often ignored and passed by .
I take them back home afterwards and play with them .
I get lost in them .
To me it is an intimate process of projecting myself and my perspective onto the world , and the images that I produce are essentially a reflection of myself .
I always try my best to get everything right before I snap the shutter , but if I feel there is something I can do in the post ( coloration , adjust lighting , etc . )
I hold no hesitation in doing it .
Ansel Adams is quoted as saying dodging and burning are steps to take care of mistakes God made in establishing tonal relationships .
I could n't agree more and treat the use of Photoshop the same way ( since it is , essentially , a digital dark room ) .
Photography snobs with their rule of thirds and immediately dismissive view of any aesthetically chosen post work as " ruining " an image are essentially slapping him and many others in the face .
In my opinion the only sort of photographic ' morals ' that should exist for anyone who takes pictures should be for photo - journalists .
And one I am not , so I choose to see the world as well as I can imagine it !

That 's me ... very contently hanging on to the back of a tuk - tuk in Siem Reap , Cambodia .
Come this week , a congressional conference committee will pass a gigantic defense spending bill that includes no requirement for withdrawal of troops from Iraq and no prohibitions on attacking Iran .
Sometime later this month , the " continuing resolution " will be renewed , allowing the war to continue being funded at the same levels as last fiscal year .
There are no pledges or plans to add withdrawal language to the continuing resolution .
The chance that withdrawal language – and language on Iran – will be added to the supplemental war - spending bill in January is minuscule .
The chance that the bill will not eventually be approved by a majority of Congress is nil .
Thus , by this time next year , assuming no supplemental supplements are approved , the U.S. will have spent $ 660 billion for five - and - a - half years of war and occupation in Iraq compared with the ( inflation - adjusted ) $ 673 billion spent in the most expensive eight years of the Vietnam War ( 1964 - 72 ) .
In current dollars , the average month in Vietnam cost $ 5.5 billion , while Iraq costs us $ 12 billion a month .
The government is going to have to do without my family ’s portion of this .
As well as a portion of the rest of its " defense " budget .
Because that budget underpins a war and occupation in which 750,000 to 1.5 million Iraqi civilians have died , in which 4150 " coalition " soldiers have died and nearly 40,000 have been wounded , in which billions of dollars have disappeared .
A budget that sustains more than 725 known military bases overseas , and some secret number of secret bases .
A budget of which some " black " portion provides sustenance for all kinds of classified work – all kinds , including rendition and torture and secret prisons , and clandestine activities that , were they directed against America , would be labeled " terrorism . "
Neither my wife nor I oppose the 16th Amendment .
We are neither anarchists nor libertarians .
We abhor the Grover Norquists who would first starve government social services and then drown them .
Nor are we pacifists .
We believe in self - defense , both personal and collective .
War as a last resort in the most extreme circumstances is not morally unacceptable to us .
Sometimes , in our view , the only choice is kill or be killed .
But empire building ?
concocted war ? war for the benefit of profiteers ?
war for oil and strategic position ?
war to play out a perverted vision of America as the New Rome ?
That we can no longer condone with our taxes .
Yet how to calculate the correct percentage ?
The Office of Management and Budget , for instance , claims the federal spending pie looks like the pie chart on the left .
But when you chop out the Social Security trust fund money , and you distinguish between current military spending and past military spending , the pie looks more like the pie chart below .
We chose the latter version .
We ignored the 20 % dedicated to the consequences of past military spending , which includes interest on the debt and veterans ’ benefits , money which cannot in the first case be cut and should not in the second case be .
That leaves 31 % of the budget .
Even with the billions that slip ( or are forced ) through the cracks , it ’s not hard to estimate how much of the total goes for Iraq .
But how much goes for empire all together , and how much goes for legitimate national security needs ?
Depends on your definitions .
We arbitrarily chose half .
That is , 50 % of 31 % .
We will , as we always have , file our 1040s .
But we will refuse to pay 15 % of what Washington says we owe it .
We do this not because we have any illusion that two citizens holding back a few dollars will stop the war , the building of empire , the commission of atrocities .
We do it because we cannot hold up our heads and continue to be accomplices in the schemes of those for whom " democracy " and " freedom " are buzzwords and " liberation " is a cruel and perverted joke .
Thoreau wrote the first draft of his treatise " On the Duty of Civil Disobedience " while another of America ’s unjust wars was being prosecuted , against Mexico .
The war was fought purely for theft , eagerly backed by slave owners , promoted under the pernicious and murderous rubric of Manifest Destiny , and like today ’s war , initiated on the basis of government lies and spurred along by a media conduits of propaganda .
Just one of the many perversities of that war can be seen in the actions of General Winfield Scott , a man proclaimed a hero , even in our own time , who refused to allow the women and children to leave Vera Cruz during his March 1847 artillery siege of that city , where half the total 1100 fatalities were civilians .
Read by millions with admiration , an ethical foundation for protest by men as far removed from one another in time and place as Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. , Thoreau ’s work today seems to many people little more than a relic , an idealistic utopianism unsuited in temperament and tone for the modern world .
This could not be more wrong .
As the activist historian Howard Zinn writes in his introduction to The Higher Law : Thoreau on Civil Disobedience and Reform ( a collection of Thoreau ’s polemical writing published in 2004 ) :
At the center of Thoreau 's great essay ( though he does n't make the reference ) is that stunning idea expressed in the Declaration of Independence : governments are artificial creations , set up to serve the interests of the people .
That idea was soon overwhelmed by the reality of the Constitution and the establishment of an actual government .
Now a small group of powerful men could use the government to advance their own interests , to make war , to compromise with slavery .
But why should people of conscience defer to such a government and its laws ?
Why should they not exercise their own moral judgment ?
When a government supports evil , it is the duty of its citizens to withhold their support from the government , to resist its demands .
Unlike the first seven years of the Vietnam War , when conscription grabbed up living bodies to stoke the machinery of unjustified war , today – for those of us not caught up in the backdoor draft of extended tours of duty – it is only our finances that are conscripted .
My wife and I refuse to continue to allow that .
We believe that resistance is the essence of democracy .
We also will keep marching against the war and occupation .
But in the future , we wo n’t march except when it is a precursor to non-violent action that disrupts business as usual , even if only for a few minutes .
Along with thousands ( but , sadly , not millions ) of others , we ’ve been marching for five years , complying with permits , staying on the sidewalk or on the designated streets , being polite good citizens .
No more .
We wo n’t let specific actions of civil disobedience be undermined by announcing them in advance .
Call this peaceful militancy or call it fruitless and fringy , we see no alternative with which our consciences can reside without turmoil .

Remember 10 months ago , when the Democrats , following success in the midterm elections , briefly held out the promise that they had teeth , and Donald Rumsfeld , the former strongman who had become a laughingstock , resigned his post as defense secretary ?
There were , at that time , high hopes that his successor , former CIA director Robert Gates , would take a less bullish approach to Guantánamo than that of the lonely Bush and the dominant Cheney cabal .
Those with a surfeit of optimism even dared to think that , having tackled the tip of the iceberg , the country might then be ready to probe the dark and largely unexplored mass beneath : the network of secret and semi-secret prisons run or maintained by the CIA and its proxies , which had begun to attract ferocious opposition not just from human - rights groups , but also from the United Nations and the Council of Europe .
Soon after taking office , Gates declared that he wished to close Guantánamo and conduct trials on the U.S. mainland , explaining that , “ because of things that happened earlier at Guantánamo , there is a taint about it , ” and adding that he felt that “ no matter how transparent , no matter how open the trials , if they took place in Guantánamo , in the international community they would lack credibility . ”
Despite support from Condoleezza Rice , however , who had inherited the State Department ’s profound opposition to Guantánamo from the intel - cuckolded Colin Powell , the malignant swamp of Cheneydom was not to be drained .
In no uncertain terms , the vice president and his little puppet boy , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , shut down all discussion of Gates ’ plan .
As the months wore on , Gates ’ pragmatic opposition to Guantánamo was slowly but surely undermined , as five new “ terror suspects ” arrived at Guantánamo  mostly announced without fanfare , separated by sufficient time to avoid undue attention , and hidden behind the coattails of other , more distracting events .
The first to arrive was Mohammed Abdul Malik , an apparently “ dangerous terror suspect . ”
According to the DoD , Malik had “ admitted to participation in the 2002 Paradise Hotel attack in Mombasa , Kenya , in which an explosive - filled SUV was crashed into the hotel lobby , killing 13 and injuring 80 , ” and had also “ admitted to involvement in the attempted shootdown of an Israeli Boeing 757 civilian airliner carrying 271 passengers , near Mombasa . ”
Malik was flown in from Kenya two weeks after 9/11 architect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ’s spectacular “ confession ” was still fresh , and at almost exactly the same time that Guantanamo ’s remaining Australian , David Hicks , was prevailed upon to accept a plea bargain before his trial by military commission at Guantánamo .
This should have been a humiliation for the administration , as a man it had long touted as one of the “ worst of the worst ” ( of the worst )  one of just a handful of detainees considered eligible for the administration ’s new wave of “ war crimes ” trials  was sent home with a smacked wrist to serve just nine months in prison in Australia after confessing that he had “ provided material support for terrorism . ”
Remarkably , however , the administration rode through the criticism  primarily , that the military commissions were a total farce , and that Hicks was so desperate to go home that he agreed to drop all his legitimate and well - documented claims that he was abused by the U.S. military in Afghanistan , on U.S. warships , and in Guantánamo  and emerged relatively unscathed .
In addition , the administration managed to smuggle a relative nobody into Guantánamo from Kenya without having to reveal anything of the new front in the “ War on Terror ” that it had embarked upon in the Horn of Africa .
However malign , this was quite an achievement .
Almost unnoticed , the waning world of “ disappearances ” and secret prisons was revived with a vengeance in Africa , conducted , this time , by FBI agents instead of the tarnished operatives of the CIA , but with the innovative addition of kidnapping dozens of women and children as well as their allegedly militant menfolk .
A month later , the administration followed this up with a more audacious delivery : Abdul Hadi al - Iraqi , a suspect who was sold more aggressively to the public , as he ticked a lot of boxes that the administration wished to have connected in voters ’ minds .
Al - Iraqi was described in a DoD press release as “ a high - level member of al - Qaeda ” and “ one of al - Qaeda ’s highest - ranking and experienced senior operatives . ”
The DoD added that , at the time of his detention , he was “ associated with leaders of extremist groups allied with al - Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan , including the Taliban , ” and that he had “ worked directly with the Taliban to determine responsibility and lines of communication between Taliban and al - Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan , specifically with regard to the targeting of U.S. forces . ”
In a separate “ high - value ” detainee profile  similar to those issued after 14 other “ high - value ” detainees , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Abu Zubaydah , were transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006  further details were provided about al - Iraqi ’s activities and connections , including claims that he was “ known and trusted by [ Osama ] bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri ” and “ at one point was al - Zawahiri ’s caretaker . ”
He was also said to have worked “ for a long time ” as an instructor in an al - Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan and to have been a member of al - Qaeda ’s ruling Shura Council and its Military Committee .
Speaking after the announcement of his transfer was made , Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman added a few additional morsels of information , explaining that he had been transferred to DoD custody from the custody of the CIA , although he “ would not say where or when al - Iraqi was captured or by whom . ”
Expanding on the CIA custody angle , USA Today reported that a U.S. intelligence official , “ speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter , ” explained that al - Iraqi had actually been captured “ late last year in an operation that involved many people in more than one country . ”
This admission confirmed , therefore , that al - Iraqi had been secretly held in U.S. custody for at least four months before his transfer to Guantánamo .
It also suggested that the time of his transfer was chosen for its political impact .
The third arrival came in early June .
Abdullahi Sudi Arale , a Somalian , received little fanfare , perhaps because the spotlight on terror had been dimmed following the death , the week before , of a fourth detainee at Guantánamo , a Saudi  and long - term hunger striker  named Abdul Rahman al - Amri .
Possibly , however , his arrival was little trumpeted because it involved the deliberately underreported “ War on al - Qaeda ” in the Horn of Africa , and because the administration had very little information to offer about him .
In almost questioning terms , Arale was described as a “ suspected ” member of “ the al - Qaeda terrorist network in East Africa ” who served as “ a courier between East Africa al - Qaeda ( EAAQ ) and al - Qaeda in Pakistan . ”
In a press release , the DoD added that , after returning to Somalia from Pakistan in September 2006 , he “ held a leadership role in the EAAQ - affiliated Somali Council of Islamic Courts ( CIC ) . ”
It also noted , with distressing vagueness , that there was “ significant information available ” to indicate that Arale had been “ assisting various EAAQ - affiliated extremists in acquiring weapons and explosives , ” that he had “ facilitated terrorist travel by providing false documents for AQ and EAAQ - affiliates and foreign fighters traveling into Somalia , ” and that he had “ played a significant role in the reemergence of the CIC in Mogadishu . ”
Unmentioned , of course , was the subtext of the situation in Somalia : the role of the CIC in returning some semblance of order to one of the world ’s least - governed countries , and the U.S. government ’s use of Ethiopia as a proxy army in yet another secret , dirty war .
The fourth new Guantánamo detainee arrived a fortnight later .
Buoyed , perhaps , by midsummer weather and secure that the media was not paying much attention to who was arriving in Guantánamo , and were , instead , agitating about the departure from Guantánamo of two cleared detainees who were sent to Tunisia where they faced the risk of torture , the DoD touted Haroon al - Afghani as a “ dangerous terror suspect ” who was “ known to be associated with high - level militants in Afghanistan ” and had apparently “ admitted to serving as a courier for al - Qaeda Senior Leadership ( AQSL ) . ”
The Pentagon also reported that there was “ significant information available ” that he was a senior commander of Hezb - e - Islami Gulbuddin ( HIG ) , an anti-U.S. militia led by renegade Afghan warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar .
Despite never having disguised his loathing of the United States , Hekmatyar was , ironically , one of the major recipients of billions of dollars of American money to fight the Soviet Union in the 1980s , which was channeled to him through his supporters in Pakistan ’s intelligence services , the ISI .
According to the DoD , al - Afghani “ commanded multiple HIG terrorist cells that conducted improvised explosive device ( IED ) attacks in Nangarhar Province ” ( centered on Jalalabad ) and was “ assessed to have had regular contact with senior AQ [ al - Qaeda ] and HIG leadership . ”
Haroon al - Afghani arrived with less aplomb than al - Iraqi , presumably because , despite the links between al - Qaeda and Iraq that the administration had so mercilessly pumped in the latter ’s case , some churlish commentators had refused to ignore the implied existence of secret prisons that were not supposed to exist anymore .
They had attempted to rake up issues that the administration considered dead and buried  or at least locked up far away in grave - like tombs in unnamed foreign countries .
The misunderstanding was based on an announcement by the president , in September 2006  after KSM and the 13 other “ high - value ” suspects arrived at Guantánamo  that the secret prison program , which had not entirely escaped the notice of the Supreme Court in June , had now been closed down .
Speaking to the world from the White House , the president claimed , “ The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA [ secret prison ] program . ”
This appeared to be a clear - cut confession that the program had been closed down , but it was followed by a warning that , “ as more high - ranking terrorists are captured , the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical  and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting lifesaving information . ”
Just seven months after Bush ’s speech , the case of al - Iraqi revealed that , at best , the CIA ’s secret prisons had only remained empty for a couple of months .
And finally  for now , at least  on Wednesday another new boy , an Afghan identified only as Inayatullah , flew into Guantánamo from Afghanistan .
He had been captured , according to the DoD ’s press release , “ as a result of ongoing DoD operations in the struggle against violent extremists in Afghanistan . ”
The DoD claimed that Inayatullah had “ admitted that he was the al - Qaeda Emir of Zahedan , Iran , and planned and directed al - Qaeda terrorist operations , ” adding that he “ collaborated with numerous al - Qaeda senior leaders , to include Abu Ubaydah al - Masri and Azzam , executing their instructions and personally supporting global terrorist efforts . ”
( Al - Masri and Azzam were not identified in the DoD ’s press release , but the former is an Egyptian - born al - Qaeda commander in Afghanistan ’s Kunar province , and the latter is possibly the American Adam Gadahn , known as Azzam the American , who has produced al - Qaeda propaganda with Ayman al - Zawahiri . )
In unwieldy prose , the DoD noted , “ Inayatullah attests to facilitating the movement of foreign fighters , significantly contributing to transnational terrorism across multiple borders , ” claiming that he “ met with local operatives , developed travel routes , and coordinated documentation , accommodation , and vehicles for smuggling unlawful combatants throughout countries including Afghanistan , Iran , Pakistan , and Iraq . ”
Like the other new arrivals , he will  at some unspecified time in the future  be subjected to a Combatant Status Review Tribunal , which will find that he has been correctly designated as an “ enemy combatant , ” and the administration will then , presumably , push all five men forward for trial by military commission .
These new deliveries have done little for the reputation of Robert Gates , confirming that the White House has as much disdain for the new - look DoD as it does for the State Department .
The arrival of these men at Guantánamo also demonstrates that , although the administration is willing to depopulate Guantánamo by sending home the husks of innocent men and Taliban foot soldiers who have been ruthlessly exploited for “ intelligence ” for over five years , it is still committed to pressing ahead with the military commissions .
Sidestepped by David Hicks in March , the commissions remain as toxic and unreliable to those concerned with the rule of law as the tribunals at Guantánamo , designed to conceal all evidence of torture on the part of the U.S. authorities , obscure secret evidence from the defense lawyers , and secure preordained guilty verdicts .
To recap briefly , the entire military commission process began in November 2001 , when , with the utmost stealth , and with no oversight whatsoever , Dick Cheney arranged for the president to grant himself the power to detain anyone at will and try them in kangaroo courts of his own devising .
After starting and stalling several times in the intervening years , the commissions were ignominiously extinguished by the Supreme Court in June 2006 , which ruled decisively that they were illegal under U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions .
Following this decision , the administration responded to a sliver of hope offered by one of the Supreme Court judges  Justice Stephen Breyer , who pointed out that “ Nothing prevents the president from returning to Congress to seek the authority he believes necessary ”  by doing just that , drafting new legislation , which was almost exactly the same as the old legislation , on the back of a cigarette packet and pushing the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) through a comatose Congress last fall .
Resuscitated , zombie - like , through this complete failure on the part of Congress to challenge the White House ’s lust for unbridled power , the commissions spluttered unchallenged through the Hicks farrago .
But they failed to blaze back to life in June , when Omar Khadr , a child soldier , and Salim Hamdan , one of Osama bin Laden ’s chauffeurs , were wheeled out to face the “ war crimes ” charges evaded by Hicks .
The new military commissions were regarded by those still in touch with the rule of law  primarily the detainees ’ own government - appointed military lawyers  as being as ad hoc and monstrously illegal as the system thrown out by the Supreme Court .
The lawyers were looking forward to a fight , relishing the opportunity to challenge the spurious basis of the “ war crimes ” charges and prevent the administration from destroying a centuries - old judicial system that was just and efficient only to replace it with show trials that would have done Stalin proud .
Astonishingly , the revived system collapsed on its first day , when , in independent decisions , both of the government - appointed military judges , Army Col. Peter Brownback and Navy Capt .
Keith Allred , shut down the proceedings , pointing out , with a lawyer ’s eye for detail , that the MCA mandated them to try “ illegal enemy combatants , ” whereas the two men before them  and everyone else in Guantánamo , for that matter  had only been determined to be “ enemy combatants ” in the tribunals that had made them eligible for trial in the first place .
Blustering impotently about semantics ( and ignoring its own semantic crimes over the preceding five years ) , the administration responded by wailing that it would appeal the decision in the appeals court for the military commissions .
Yet the court in question  like so much of the architecture of the commissions themselves  had not yet been established .
This oversight was finally remedied two weeks ago , and the court is due to make a decision in the coming weeks .
But the military lawyers representing Khadr and Hamdan have refused to be cowed , and one of them , Lt. Cmdr.
William Kuebler , explicitly told journalists after the hearing , “ This is a lawless process , ” and stressed that the hoped - for demolition of the rigged system was “ about the credibility of the United States and the perception around the world of our commitment to the rule of law . ”
The future of the entire system of military commissions hangs in the balance  and schools of lawyers are already circling the Supreme Court in the hope that the wavering justices will soon deliver a crushing verdict on the whole Guantánamo operation .
This does not seem to be the right time to brag , as the administration did last week , that it was building a vast tent city , on an unused runway at Guantánamo , to hold “ war crimes ” trials beginning in March 2008 , with as many as six trials taking place simultaneously , and to follow this up by flying yet another detainee into Guantánamo .
But this is , perhaps , no longer the real world , and is , instead , just the latest and most outrageous manifestation of the blinkered , belligerent , bellicose Bush - and - Cheney World , an ever shrinking war bunker in which the will alone matters , and it has been entirely forgotten that one man ’s will power may be another man ’s psychotic delusions .
Staff at the agency , which announced last week that California 's proposed limits were redundant , said the agency 's chief went against their expert advice after car executives met Cheney , and a Chrysler executive delivered a letter to the EPA saying why the state should not be allowed to regulate greenhouse gases .
EPA staff members told the Los Angeles Times that the agency 's head , the Bush appointee Stephen Johnson , ignored their conclusions and shut himself off from consultation in the month before the announcement .
He then informed them of his decision and instructed them to provide the legal rationale for it , they said .
" California met every criteria ... on the merits , " an anonymous member of the EPA staff told the Times .
" The same criteria we have used for the last 40 years ...
We told him that .
All the briefings we have given him laid out the facts . "
In an editorial , the New York Times described the decision as , " an indefensible act of executive arrogance that can only be explained as the product of ideological blindness and as a political payoff to the automobile industry " .
Johnson said that because Bush signed an energy bill last week which raised fuel economy standards , there was no justification for separate state regulation .
The president , the agency said , had provided a " clear national solution " and there was no need for a " confusing patchwork of state rules to reduce America 's climate footprint from vehicles " .
But Johnson 's staff gave him the opposite advice , warning him that should he block California , the state would probably sue him in the courts and would probably win .
The state 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , immediately announced that he would challenge the EPA 's ruling in the courts , describing it as " legally indefensible " .
California had wanted to implement a 2002 law limiting greenhouse gas emissions from cars and lorries .
Had it been successful , 16 other states had said they would follow suit , effectively creating a national standard that car makers would have been obliged to follow .
The Nigerian government is suing the world 's largest drug manufacturer , Pfizer , for allegedly carrying out illegal trials of an anti-meningitis drug that killed or disabled children .
Nigeria is demanding $ 7bn in damages from the US company for the families of children it says died or suffered serious side effects when the antibiotic Trovan was administered in the northern state of Kano during a meningitis outbreak in 1996 .
The Kano state government also has civil and criminal cases pending against Pfizer .
The Nigerian authorities say that 200 children were part of the Trovan experiment without the approval of local regulatory authorities .
They allege that as many as 11 died as a result of the treatment and others developed conditions including brain damage and paralysis .
Trovan was approved in the US in 1997 for use by adults but not children .
Two years later the US Food and Drug Administration warned that the drug could cause liver damage and it has since been discontinued .
In court papers filed in Abuja yesterday , the government accuses Pfizer of conducting illegal tests on children .
" The plaintiff contends that the defendant never obtained approval of the relevant regulatory agencies ... nor did the defendant seek or receive approval to conduct any clinical trial at any time before their illegal conduct , " it said .
A Pfizer spokesman in New York , Bryant Haskins , said in a statement that the drug was administered in accordance with Nigerian law .
" These allegations against Pfizer , which are not new , are highly inflammatory and not based on all the facts .
We continue to maintain , in the strongest terms , that the Nigerian government was fully informed in advance of the clinical trial ; that the trial was conducted appropriately , ethically and with the best interests of patients in mind ; and that it helped save lives , " he said .
Pfizer has previously said that it obtained " verbal consent " from the parents of the affected children , and that the drugs were administered in a way that was " sound from medical , scientific , regulatory and ethical standpoints " .
Two years ago , a US court dismissed a lawsuit by several Nigerian families who allege that they were not sufficiently warned that their children could be affected by the antibiotic .
A civil and criminal suit by the Kano state government against Pfizer was postponed yesterday until next month .
It is seeking $ 2bn in damages .
The Nigerian government is looking for compensation for the cost of treatment of the victims of the drug test and their families .
It is also seeking $ 450 m for what it says is the suspicion of western medicines created by the case .
The country 's health authorities say that the Pfizer controversy is partly responsible for many families in northern Nigeria refusing to allow their children to be vaccinated against polio .
That in turn has been blamed for an outbreak that spread across parts of Africa .
The Kano authorities also refused to distribute the polio vaccine .
Oh dear what can the matter be ?
A retired teacher got stuck in a lavatory ,
He was discovered last Thursday ( not Saturday ) ,
And nobody knew he was there .
The old school rhyme came true last week when a retired teacher got trapped in a bowling club toilet in Aberdeen for four days after the door jammed behind him .
David Leggat , 55 , survived on tap water and fought off the cold by dipping his feet in a basin of warm water .
He was eventually freed after the club 's cleaner , Cathy Scollay , heard his cries for help and raised the alarm .
She said today : " There was no reason for anyone to come looking for him . "
Leggat 's ordeal began when he went to use the gents at the Kittybrewster and Woodside Bowling Club last Monday .
He became trapped because the outside handle of the WC had fallen off .
When he went into the building , the inside handle jammed .
Leggat feared he was in for a long wait because the club is rarely used in winter .
The retired English and history teacher told Aberdeen 's Evening Express newspaper : " I had nothing with me to eat so I sipped cold tap water to keep me going .
" I did a survival course once and knew I had to keep my feet warm , so I kept running a basin of hot water and putting my feet in to send the heat through my body . "
Scollay found Leggat on Thursday morning after hearing his cries .
She said : " I just heard a voice shouting , ' I have been locked in here for four days . '
I just could n't believe it . "
Scollay could not free the trapped man , so she called the club secretary , who used a screwdriver to open the door .
" David looked awfully grey and shaky when he came out , " Scollay said .
" But he managed to walk up the road to his house . "
The cleaner said it was the first time she had come across such a situation .
" Nothing ever happens here , just bowling , " she said .
Leggat told the Evening Express : " At least there was a toilet to use .
The only thing I regret is not getting trapped behind the bar . "
In light of Congress ’ low approval ratings , some have suggested that the wave that washed Republicans out of the congressional majority 12 months ago has already subsided , and both chambers will once again be up for grabs 12 months from now .
CQ ’s Bob Benenson and Jonathan Allen took a very thorough look at the landscape and have come to the opposite conclusion .
[ E]very traditional indicator of election forecasting — from public opinion polls and issue resonance to candidate recruitment and the “ over / under ” balance of seats in play — suggests that congressional Democrats have just as much going for them in 2008 as they had in 2006 , if not more .
They now have the power of incumbency to give them added advantages in raising money , attracting top - tier candidates , controlling the legislative agenda and capturing the political zeitgeist .
All this leads Democrats to profess clear confidence that they ’ll retain majority control next fall .
And not only that , but they may now harbor realistic visions of emerging with 55 to 58 seats in the Senate ( pushing them within arm - twisting distance of the 60 votes needed to bust a filibuster ) as well more than 240 seats in the House , a cushion that neither party has enjoyed since the end of the last Democratic era in the House , in 1994 .
As Kevin Drum noted , the report added , " [ T ] he biggest factor working in the Democrats ’ favor continues to be that they are not the Republicans . "
Something to consider the next time the right brags about Congress ' low approval ratings .
Michael Gambon plays Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films
She made her revelation to a packed house in New York 's Carnegie Hall on Friday , as part of her US book tour .
She took audience questions and was asked if Dumbledore found " true love " .
" Dumbledore is gay , " she said , adding he was smitten with rival Gellert Grindelwald , who he beat in a battle between good and bad wizards long ago .
The audience gasped , then applauded .
" I would have told you earlier if I knew it would make you so happy , " she said .
" Falling in love can blind us to an extent , " she added , saying Dumbledore was " horribly , terribly let down " and his love for Grindelwald was his " great tragedy " .
" Oh , my god , " Rowling , 42 , concluded with a laugh , " the fan fiction " .
Rowling said her books are a " prolonged argument for tolerance "
Fan sites have long speculated on Dumbledore 's sexuality as he was known for having a mysterious , troubled past .
Rowling told the audience that while working on the planned sixth Potter film , Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , she saw the script carried a reference to a girl who was once of interest to Dumbledore .
She said she ensured director David Yates was made aware of the truth about her character .
Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell welcomed the news about Dumbledore and said : " It 's good that children 's literature includes the reality of gay people , since we exist in every society .
" But I am disappointed that she did not make Dumbledore 's sexuality explicit in the Harry Potter book .
Making it obvious would have sent a much more powerful message of understanding and acceptance . "
And a spokesman for gay rights group Stonewall added : " It 's great that JK has said this .
It shows that there 's no limit to what gay and lesbian people can do , even being a wizard headmaster . "
Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter in the films
Rowling also did a brief reading from the seventh book in her best - selling series , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , as part of her Open Book Tour of the US - her first there for seven years .
She said she regarded her novels as a " prolonged argument for tolerance " and urged her fans to " question authority " .
But she added that not everyone likes her work .
Christian groups have alleged the books promote witchcraft .
The author said her revelation about Dumbledore would give them one more reason .
The seventh Potter book broke sales records on both sides of the Atlantic when it was published in July , selling 11 million copies in 24 hours .
The fifth film adaptation of the series , Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released this summer .
Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince is due for release late next year .
First off , you may be surprised to find that Albert Einstein is not included on this list .
The reason is that I have used a table of IQ estimates for historical geniuses to determine the members and order of this list , and Einstein ’s IQ ( around 160 ) did not make the grade .
Despite that , he is still the first person to pop in to most people ’s minds when thinking of a genius .
Having said that , here is a list of the ten greatest geniuses in history .
10 . Madame De Stael IQ : 180
In full – Anne- Louise - Germaine Necker , Baronne ( baroness ) de Staël - Holstein , byname Madame de Staël .
Madame de Stael was a French - Swiss woman of letters , political propagandist , and conversationalist , who epitomized the European culture of her time , bridging the history of ideas from Neoclassicism to Romanticism .
She also gained fame by maintaining a salon for leading intellectuals .
Her writings include novels , plays , moral and political essays , literary criticism , history , autobiographical memoirs , and even a number of poems .
Her most important literary contribution was as a theorist of Romanticism .
Madame de Stael is on an equal level with René Descartes but I chose to include her rather than him in order to put at least one woman on this list .
9. Galileo Galilei IQ : 185
Galileo was Italian natural philosopher , astronomer , and mathematician who made fundamental contributions to the sciences of motion , astronomy , and strength of materials and to the development of the scientific method .
His formulation of ( circular ) inertia , the law of falling bodies , and parabolic trajectories marked the beginning of a fundamental change in the study of motion .
His insistence that the book of nature was written in the language of mathematics changed natural philosophy from a verbal , qualitative account to a mathematical one in which experimentation became a recognized method for discovering the facts of nature .
Finally , his discoveries with the telescope revolutionized astronomy and paved the way for the acceptance of the Copernican heliocentric system , but his advocacy of that system in support of his view that the Bible contained errors , eventually resulted in an Inquisition process against him .
8. Bobby Fischer IQ : 187
Bobby is the byname of Robert James Fischer , an American chess master who became the youngest grandmaster in history when he received the title in 1958 .
His youthful intemperance and brilliant playing drew the attention of the American public to the game of chess , particularly when he won the world championship in 1972 .
Fischer learned the moves of chess at age 6 and at 16 dropped out of high school to devote himself fully to the game .
In 1958 he won the first of many American championships .
In world championship candidate matches during 1970 – 71 , Fischer won 20 consecutive games before losing once and drawing three times to former world champion Tigran Petrosyan of the Soviet Union in a final match won by Fischer .
In 1972 Fischer became the first native - born American to hold the title of world champion when he defeated Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a highly publicized match held in Reykjavík , Iceland .
In doing so , Fischer won the $ 156,000 victor ’s share of the $ 250,000 purse .
7. Ludwig Wittgenstein IQ : 190
in full – Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein was an Austrian - born English philosopher , regarded by many as the greatest philosopher of the 20th century .
Wittgenstein ’s two major works , Logisch - philosophische Abhandlung ( 1921 ; Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus , 1922 ) and Philosophische Untersuchungen ( published posthumously in 1953 ; Philosophical Investigations ) , have inspired a vast secondary literature and have done much to shape subsequent developments in philosophy , especially within the analytic tradition .
His charismatic personality has , in addition , exerted a powerful fascination upon artists , playwrights , poets , novelists , musicians , and even filmmakers , so that his fame has spread far beyond the confines of academic life .
6. Blaise Pascal IQ : 195
Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician , physicist , religious philosopher , and master of prose .
He laid the foundation for the modern theory of probabilities , formulated what came to be known as Pascal ’s law of pressure , and propagated a religious doctrine that taught the experience of God through the heart rather than through reason .
The establishment of his principle of intuitionism had an impact on such later philosophers as Jean - Jacques Rousseau and Henri Bergson and also on the Existentialists .
Read all about his inventiveness in Works of Blaise Pascal at Amazon.com !
5. John Stuart Mill IQ : 200
John Stuart Mill was an English philosopher , economist , and exponent of Utilitarianism .
He was prominent as a publicist in the reforming age of the 19th century , and remains of lasting interest as a logician and an ethical theorist .
Mill was a man of extreme simplicity in his mode of life .
The influence that his works exercised upon contemporary English thought can scarcely be overestimated , nor can there be any doubt about the value of the liberal and inquiring spirit with which he handled the great questions of his time .
Beyond that , however , there has been considerable difference of opinion about the enduring merits of his philosophy .
4. Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz IQ : 205
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz ( also Leibnitz or von Leibniz ( July 1 ( June 21 Old Style ) 1646 – November 14 , 1716 ) was a German philosopher of Sorbian origin who wrote primarily in Latin and French .
Educated in law and philosophy , and serving as factotum to two major German noble houses ( one becoming the British royal family while he served it ) , Leibniz played a major role in the European politics and diplomacy of his day .
He occupies an equally large place in both the history of philosophy and the history of mathematics .
He discovered calculus independently of Newton , and his notation is the one in general use since .
He also discovered the binary system , foundation of virtually all modern computer architectures .
In philosophy , he is most remembered for optimism , i.e. , his conclusion that our universe is , in a restricted sense , the best possible one God could have made .
3. Emanuel Swedenborg IQ : 205
Emanuel Swedenborg was a Swedish scientist , Christian mystic , philosopher , and theologian who wrote voluminously in interpreting the Scriptures as the immediate word of God .
Soon after his death , devoted followers created Swedenborgian societies dedicated to the study of his thought .
These societies formed the nucleus of the Church of the New Jerusalem , or New Church , also called the Swedenborgians .
2. Leonardo Da Vinci IQ : 205
Leonardo Da Vinci , Italian painter , draftsman , sculptor , architect , and engineer whose genius , perhaps more than that of any other figure , epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal .
His Last Supper ( 1495 –98 ) and Mona Lisa ( c. 1503 –06 ) are among the most widely popular and influential paintings of the Renaissance .
His notebooks reveal a spirit of scientific inquiry and a mechanical inventiveness that were centuries ahead of their time .
The unique fame that Leonardo enjoyed in his lifetime and that , filtered by historical criticism , has remained undimmed to the present day rests largely on his unlimited desire for knowledge , which guided all his thinking and behaviour .
1. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe IQ : 210
Goethe , German poet , playwright , novelist , scientist , statesman , theatre director , critic , and amateur artist , is considered the greatest German literary figure of the modern era .
Goethe is the only German literary figure whose range and international standing equal those of Germany ’s supreme philosophers ( who have often drawn on his works and ideas ) and composers ( who have often set his works to music ) .
In the literary culture of the German - speaking countries , he has had so dominant a position that , since the end of the 18th century , his writings have been described as “ classical . ”
In a European perspective he appears as the central and unsurpassed representative of the Romantic movement , broadly understood .

Cusack : Bush photo ban one of ' most cowardly political acts ' in my lifetime David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday December 4 , 2007

When the Bush administration began enforcing a controversial policy banning photographs of military caskets returning from Iraq , the move provoked outrage -- and now , a film -- from actor John Cusack , who calls the media ban " one of the most cowardly political acts " of his lifetime .
Appearing on PBS with host Tavis Smiley , Cusack explained that his new movie , Grace is Gone , is the result of a storytelling interest largely inspired by the Bush photo policy .
" The screenwriter , James Strouse , had approached my company and I had been looking for a story , a human drama to tell about the Iraq conflict , " said Cusack .
" It stemmed from a place of outrage for me when the Bush administration banned the photos of the dead coming home . "
That directive , ordered in 2003 at Dover Air Force Base , was technically on the books prior to Bush 's presidency , but was seldom enforced .
" I thought that was one of the most cowardly political acts I 'd seen in my lifetime , in some ways " the actor said .
" So I thought , we have to tell the story of one of those coffins coming home , right ?
It seemed clear that would be a really smart thing to do . "
Asked by Smiley to explain his characterization of the Bush decision as " cowardly , " Cusack said that if the war was worth fighting , its casualties should be appropriately honored .
" I just think that , if this war is going to be fought and if it is as important as he says it is , I think the least we can do is stop our days and pay honor to the people making the ultimate sacrifice for this , " he added .
" I mean , they were trying to say ... we 'll tell you when we can grieve and get our photo ops when we go to the bases and visit the families and we 're going to control this along with everything else . "
Concluded Cusack , " I thought , my God , if this is really happening , we should all know about this every day .
We should stop our days , right ?
"

Malaysia ’s highest court rejected a Hindu woman ’s plea to stop her Muslim - convert husband from changing their 4 - year - old son ’s religion to Islam , in a case that has raised more concerns over minority rights .
The couple , who are seeking a divorce , are ethnic Indians .
The court ruled a child could be converted to Islam with the consent of one parent .
The ruling means the woman could lose custody , as Malaysia ’s Islamic courts will not give custody to a non-Muslim parent .

When you read stuff like this , you ca n’t help but feel that IT is , without a doubt , doomed .
The gist of the posting is
REST is too hard for the average developer
Dynamic languages are too hard for the average developer
Along these same lines , a couple of folks told me in person that my recent blog entries about REST , dynamic languages , and ESBs were misguided because today ’s enterprises are interested only in approaches , frameworks and platforms that allow average developers to produce quality systems .
This all strikes me as nothing but wrong - headed thinking .
On the dynamic language front , the worst code I have seen in my career has always , always , always been in compiled imperative languages , most often Java and C ++.
I would much rather let an average developer loose with a dynamic language , because the surface area is smaller , there ’s a lot less rope available for self - hanging , and if they ’re going to fail , they ’ll fail way faster and thus allow much more time for recovery .
The fact that dynamic language programs are usually smaller than their compiled counterparts means that they ’re easier to read and review , and statistically , they ’re likely to have fewer bugs .
Furthermore , counting on the static language compiler to save you is simply wishful thinking .
To paraphrase Tim Ewald from a conversation he and I had during lunch a week or so ago , compilation really amounts to just another unit test .
On the REST front , if you ’re claiming that it ’s harder than the alternatives , to me that ’s just a sign that you do n’t understand it .
Is REST simple ?
No , but neither is SOA .
However , unlike SOA , which is fairly wishy - washy , noncommittal , and loose , REST ’s constraints provide real , actual guidance for developers , and those same constraints also provide opportunities for significant flexibility , extensibility , performance , scalability , and serendipity .
SOA ’s contracts come with no rules or constraints , and thus can easily result in a system that ’s extremely brittle , tightly - coupled , and virtually impossible to upgrade .
SOA itself is n’t inherently bad , as it ’s certainly a step above the “ every application for itself ” mode of development that ’s so widely practiced .
Unlike REST , though , SOA does n’t go nearly far enough to provide real , useful guidance to the poor developer who has to actually write the stuff , make it work , and keep it running .
And finally , regarding the overall notion that enterprises cater only to average developers , I ’m not sure I agree .
In my former life I met countless enterprise developers who were extremely sharp .
While I have no doubt that there are numerous bean - counting CIOs and middle IT managers out there who think they can build high - quality IT systems with low - quality developers , at the end of the day , businesses generally know better than to think they can get something for nothing .
Or to put it another way , they know they get what they pay for , and if they pay only for average developers or worse , they ’ll get only average software and average systems , or worse .
That ’s a no-brainer .
If you ’re in a position of technical leadership or project management and you ’re asked to come in ahead of schedule and under budget , my advice is that you ’re generally more likely to succeed with REST and dynamic languages than with the alternatives because their inherent constraints allow for better focus .
Also , if you find yourself in such a position , you owe it to yourself and your team to continually lobby your superiors to help them understand the very real costs of their budgetary stinginess .
4 ) Skins Mobile ... for Safe Phone Sex
Over half a billion condoms are sold in Japan each year but it seems the manufacturers still have extra capacity and are looking for new markets to , umm , penetrate .
Witness " Skins Mobile " , basically condoms for your cell phone .
No , they are n't lubricated , so do n't get any " hey , guess where I 'm calling from ! " ideas .
Skins Mobile are sold in 3 - packs for $ 6.99 and are thin enough to let sound waves - but not hot - tub waves - pass right through .

3 ) When it comes to Nuts , ask a Squirrel
OK , the fur - bearin ' varmints may know about nuts but does that qualify them to advertise condoms ?
Evidently it does , but the poor critters seem a mite confused : they 're using them as rain hats !
Or , pardon the phrase , Pith Helmets ( I slay me ) .
We assume human users will know better .
What I 'd like to know is , do the actual condoms really display a smiling squirrel 's face ?

2 ) " We are all brack people " , so ca n't we all get a wrong ?
What can I say ... the " Power BLACK Color Rubber " is so wrong on so many levels , I 'm speechless .
Heck , the Reverend Jesse Jackson would be left speechless , and that takes some doing .
If he sees these condoms he just might cancel Operation PUSH !
Seeing this condom package reminded me that Japan is a very strange place indeed .
The image of a very black panther and his " you go girlfriend " is enough to make Eldridge reach for a Cleaver , but it 's nothing compared to the copy on the package .
On the left we have " Keep it real .
Keep on faith .
Keep on going .
Piece !
So cool .
Respect ! "
You tell 'em , Aretha !
Then on the right there 's " Stay real !
WE are all brack people " ...
Hallelujah !
It 's like they locked up the package designer in a room with a few rap CDs and some bad acid for a week and this was the result .

1 ) Super Big Boy Condoms ... to Win , Place or Show !
You know , there is a sort of endearing innocence to the Japanese sensibility that comes through from time to time , and this is one of those times .
The earnest marketers at Okamoto seized upon a single , archetypal image to illustrate the boxes of their largest condoms .
Yes , it 's a horse .
A horse , people !

It not only can happen here , it is happening here .
Mussolini created the blueprint ( with inspiration from Lenin ) , Hitler elaborated on it , Stalin studied Hitler ...
Here 's how it works ( notice how many Bush & Co. is using now . ) :
1. Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy
2. Create a gulag
3. Develop a thug caste
4 . Set up an internal surveillance system
5. Harass citizens ' groups
6 . Engage in arbitrary detention and release
7 . Target key individuals
8. Control the press
9 . Dissent equals treason
10 .
Suspend the rule of law
Wolf 's conclusion ?
Impeachment of Bush and Cheney is not enough .
Prosecuting ( and jailing ) them for crimes committed is the only rational solution .

NASA scientists predict average summer temperatures in the eastern United Stateswill rise as much as five degrees Celsius by the 2080s as a result of global warming from rising amounts of greenhouse gases .
The study 's climate model predicts temperatures in the region higher than those predicted by global models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which said temperatures would rise betweentwoand 3.5 degrees C in the same region by 2100 .
This difference in predicted temperature is in large part because the NASA model takes into account the variationof rainfall in the region , said lead author Barry Lynn of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies .
" There is the potential for extremely hot summertime temperatures in the future , especially during summers with less - than - average frequent rainfall , " said Lynn .
The study looked specifically at the eastern United States and found areas with summer daily average temperatures currently in the high 20s would most likely rise to averages in the low 30s by 2080 if greenhouse gases continued to rise at current levels .
In extreme seasons with less than average rainfall , average temperatures in urban centres such as Chicago , Washington and Atlanta could rise to the low 40s , the authors contend .
The models used by the IPCC suggested annual mean precipitation is very likely to increase in Canada and the northeast U.S. and to decrease in the southwest U.S.
In southern Canada , the report said , precipitation is also likely to increase in winter and spring , but decrease in summer .
But Lynn and his co-authors said the IPCC climate models simulated rainfall too frequently by not looking at local climate patterns or taking into account the effect of rising temperatures on future precipitation .
" Less frequent storms result in higher surface and atmospheric temperatures that then feed back on the atmospheric circulation to further reduce storm frequency and raise surface temperatures even more , " said co-author Richard Healy of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution .
The authorscontend that previous future models of global climate also predict precipitation that falls too frequently and falls too early in the day .
Both of these predictions would lead to increased daytime cloud cover , blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause surface temperatures to rise .
" Since the weather prediction model simulated the frequency and timing of summer precipitation more reliably than the global model , its daily high temperature predictions for the future are also believed to be more accurate , " added co-author Leonard Druyan , of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University .
The study is published in the April 2007 issue of the American Meteorological Society 's Journal of Climate .
But the new report essentially disavows a judgment that the intelligence agencies issued in 2005 , which concluded that Iran had an active secret arms program intended to transform the raw material into a nuclear weapon .
The new estimate declares instead with “ high confidence ” that the military - run program was shut in 2003 , and it concludes with “ moderate confidence ” that the program remains frozen .
The report judges that the halt was imposed by Iran “ primarily in response to increasing international scrutiny and pressure . ”
It was not clear what prompted the reversal .
Administration officials said the new estimate reflected conclusions that the intelligence agencies had agreed on only in the past several weeks .
The report ’s agnosticism about Iran ’s nuclear intentions represents a very different tone than had been struck by President Bush , and by Vice President Dick Cheney , who warned in a speech in October that if Iran “ stays on its present course , the international community is prepared to impose serious consequences . ”
The estimate does not say when intelligence agencies learned that the arms program had been halted , but officials said new information obtained from covert sources over the summer had led to a reassessment of the state of Iran ’s nuclear program and a decision to delay preparation of the estimate , which had been scheduled to be delivered to Congress in the spring .
The new report came out just over five years after a 2002 intelligence estimate on Iraq concluded that it possessed chemical and biological weapons programs and was determined to restart its nuclear program .
That estimate was instrumental in winning the Congressional authorization for a military invasion of Iraq , but it proved to be deeply flawed , and most of its conclusions turned out to be wrong .
Intelligence officials said the specter of the 2002 estimate on Iraq hung over their deliberations on Iran even more than it had in 2005 , when the lessons from the intelligence failure on Iraq were just beginning to prompt spy agencies to adapt a more rigorous approach to their findings .

Allow me to introduced myself .
I am a police officer .
More importantly to this post , I am a police officer who is sick and damned tired of dealing with certain things on a day to day basis:1 ) Contrary to what you might think , I am not an idiot .
That ring on my finger is a BA from Texas Tech .
My GPA was a 3.71 and I was in fact the president of my frat ( which means I got a lot of stories that start out " So , this one time , we were fucked up , and ... ) .
So , when I make the mistake of mispronouncing your name ( the last name with 17 fucking letters , only two of which are vowels ) , dont give me that look like I just kicked your puppy .
While I may not be an idiot , I am human and I do fuck things up from time to time .
When I apologize for pulling you over because I thought your tags were out , just take the sorry and be on about your way .
DO NOT get a high and mighty attitude .
Our state has over 5000 traffic laws , I can find one to help you get over your tude .
2 ) No , I do not have " real criminals " I should be out looking for .
Did you happen to notice the fucking Harley parked behind you with LED 's blinking ?
Lemme give you a hint - if you see a motorcycle officer , our entire job relates to asshole drivers .
Asshole drivers are the ones who make your daily commute dangerous ( Or , a complete standstill , once they wreck out ) .
With that in mind , shut up about the other " important " things I " should be doing . "
Believe it or not , I tried to get this job .
Dont act like you wouldnt like to get paid to ride a Harley for 8 hours a day .
But , the main benefit of this job , is I dont have " Real criminals " to fuck with .
No shagging calls , dealing with domestics , and so on .
My worst days are telling someone they lost a loved one in a wreck I just worked .
Which , brings me to my next point :3 ) If I was a dick from the beginning of the stop , I apologize .
I mean that with all sincerity .
I am human .
If I 've dealt with 10 assholes before I stopped you or maybe delivered a death notification , I may have done the wrong thing and assumed you were gonna be one too .
Believe it or not , after my shift on the way home , I 'll probably reflect on my day and feel a bit shitty if our interaction stands out because I was a jerk .
Yours wouldnt be the first citation I 've " lost " because I thought I was being an overbearing prick at the time I wrote it .
We all have our bad days .
4 ) No good deed goes unpunished .
I know that .
But , if I give you a warning - DO NOT assume I pulled you over for a bullshit reason and then lost my nerve .
Just because I didnt write you for 7 over the limit , doesnt mean I was profiling and you should set up a meeting with my Chief and your NAACP rep .
You complaining that " He stopped me for nothin , oterwise he'd have given me a ticket , " is bullshit and , frankly , is the reason most of us have stopped giving warnings .
Profiling is BULLSHIT , by the way .
You 're hauling ass past me at 70 + mph .
I have to see your speed , if you have a front license plate , registration sticker , inspection sticker and if you 're wearing a seatbelt in the split second you pass me .
I couldnt give two shits if your black white or green .
5 ) No , you may not see my RADAR gun .
For a few reasons .
First , I dont have to show it to you .
You bestfriend 's roommate 's boyfriend who talked to a cop once is fucking wrong .
I dont have to show it to you , I dont care what you heard .
Second , I dont want to show it to you , because I dont want you out of your car .
Why ?
You may not know that you 're not gonna attack me , but I dont know that .
If you 're seated , you 're less of a threat and I like feeling as comfy as I can .
Also , I dont have a RADAR anymore .
I have LIDAR .
If you 're gonna act like a lawyer on the side of the road , get your shit squared away first and know what you 're talking about .
Finally , you cant see the LIDAR for your own safety .
You feel that way your car rocks every time an 18 wheeler flys by ?
I 'd rather not get sued becuase your stupid ass fell into traffic and got killed on my stop .
While I 'm on my good pal LIDAR , it has some neat features .
It 's a laser beamed device , so - no , I couldnt have gotten the guy next to you .
It 's got a scope on it , and the scope 's dot was aimed directly at your car 's grill .
Also , it tells me the distance in feet that i clocked you at .
So , dont tell me , I couldnt have gotten you from that far , because I can .
Its accurate to 2500 feet ( half a mile or so ) , and I can clock you , get two swigs of coffee and eat three donut holes by the time you get close enough to see my motorcycle on the shoulder .
6 )
Arguements take place in court , not on the side of the road .
No exceptions .
And , yes , I will show up to court .
Even on my day off .
I get paid ( by you , thanks for reminding me ) OT to show up to court , and I 'm trying to con my wife into letting me buy a new boat , so I need that money .
Now , once we get to court , follow a few easy rules : Dont lie .
My bike has a video camera on it , and that box on my belt is a mic .
The camera is hooked into my fixed 4 way RADAR , so it shows your speed ( if I didnt clock you with a LIDAR unit , that is ) .
Oh , and judges dont like all those cuss words you used out at the scene ... Dont yell at me outside the court room .
This is not a personal matter to me , even if it is for you .
After this ,
Im going home and watching my Texas Rangers fuck up another promising season .
You will be the furthest thing from my mind .
Guys and gals , we are the same as you .
We 've got a home life that might suck , bills to pay , college loans , the damned team that never wins ( Tech losing in the first fuckin round !
Damn you Bobby Knight ) , and so on .
We have feelings , personalities , and dreams just like you .
When
Im at your window , look at my face .
You met a hundred guys like me in college , and loved em .
I was that guy a few years ago , and not much has changed .
Im still a nice guy , treat me like one and you might just get a warning .
The Five Sexes : Why Male and Female Are Not Enough
By Anne Fausto- Sterling
The Sciences March / April 1993 , p. 20 - 24
Anne Fausto - Sterling is Professor of Biology and Women 's Studies in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry at Brown University .
Professor Fausto - Sterling 's new book , entitled Sexing the Body : Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality , appeared in February , 2000 .
In 1843 Levi Suydam , a twenty - three - year - old resident of Salisbury , Connecticut , asked the town board of selectmen to validate his right to vote as a Whig in a hotly contested local election .
The request raised a flurry of objections from the opposition party , for reasons that must be rare in the annals of American democracy : it was said that Suydam was more female than male and thus ( some eighty years before suffrage was extended to women ) could not be allowed to cast a ballot .
To settle the dispute a physician , one William James Barry , was brought in to examine Suydam .
And , presumably upon encountering a phallus , the good doctor declared the prospective voter male .
With Suydam safely in their column the Whigs won the election by a majority of one .
Barry 's diagnosis , however , turned out to be somewhat premature .
Within a few days he discovered that , phallus notwithstanding , Suydam menstruated regularly and had a vaginal opening .
Both his / her physique and his / her mental predispositions were more complex than was first suspected .
S/he had narrow shoulders and broad hips and felt occasional sexual yearnings for women .
Suydam's " ' feminine propensities , such as a fondness for gay colors , for pieces of calico , comparing and placing them together , and an aversion for bodily labor , and an inability to perform the same , were remarked by many , " Barry later wrote .
It is not clear whether Suydam lost or retained the vote , or whether the election results were reversed .
Western culture is deeply committed to the idea that there are only two sexes .
Even language refuses other possibilities ; thus to write about Levi Suydam I have had to invent conventions -- s/he and his / her -- to denote someone who is clearly neither male nor female or who is perhaps both sexes at once .
Legally , too , every adult is either man or woman , and the difference , of course , is not trivial .
For Suydam it meant the franchise ; today it means being available for , or exempt from , draft registration , as well as being subject , in various ways , to a number of laws governing marriage , the family and human intimacy .
In many parts of the United States , for instance , two people legally registered as men cannot have sexual relations without violating anti-sodomy statutes .
But if the state and the legal system have an interest in maintaining a two - party sexual system , they are in defiance of nature .
For biologically speaking , there are many gradations running from female to male ; and depending on how one calls the shots , one can argue that along that spectrum lie at least five sexes -- and perhaps even more .
For some time medical investigators have recognized the concept of the intersexual body .
But the standard medical literature uses the term intersex as a catch - all for three major subgroups with some mixture of male and female characteristics : the so - called true hermaphrodites , whom I call herms , who possess one testis and one ovary ( the sperm - and egg - producing vessels , or gonads ) ; the male pseudohermaphrodites ( the " merms " ) , who have testes and some aspects of the female genitalia but no ovaries ; and the female pseudohermaphrodites ( the " ferms " ) , who have ovaries and some aspects of the male genitalia but lack testes .
Each of those categories is in itself complex ; the percentage of male and female characteristics , for instance , can vary enormously among members of the same subgroup .
Moreover , the inner lives of the people in each subgroup -- their special needs and their problems , attractions and repulsions -- have gone unexplored by science .
But on the basis of what is known about them I suggest that the three intersexes , herm , merm and ferm , deserve to be considered additional sexes each in its own right .
Indeed , I would argue further that sex is a vast , infinitely malleable continuum that defies the constraints of even five categories .
Not surprisingly , it is extremely difficult to estimate the frequency of intersexuality , much less the frequency of each of the three additional sexes : it is not the sort of information one volunteers on a job application .
The psychologist John Money of Johns Hopkins University , a specialist in the study of congenital sexual - organ defects , suggests intersexuals may constitute as many as 4 percent of births .
As I point out to my students at Brown University , in a student body of about 6,000 that fraction , if correct , implies there may be as many as 240 intersexuals on campus -- surely enough to form a minority caucus of some kind .
In reality though , few such students would make it as far as Brown in sexually diverse form .
Recent advances in physiology and surgical technology now enable physicians to catch most intersexuals at the moment of birth .
Almost at once such infants are entered into a program of hormonal and surgical management so that they can slip quietly into society as " normal " heterosexual males or females .
I emphasize that the motive is in no way conspiratorial .
The aims of the policy are genuinely humanitarian , reflecting the wish that people be able to " fit in " both physically and psychologically
In the medical community , however , the assumptions behind that wish -- that there be only two sexes , that heterosexuality alone is normal , that there is one true model of psychological health -- have gone virtually unexamined .
The word hermaphrodite comes from the Greek name Hermes , variously known as the messenger of the gods , the patron of music , the controller of dreams or the protector of livestock , and Aphrodite , the goddess of sexual love and beauty .
According to Greek mythology , those two gods parented Hermaphroditus , who at age fifteen became half male and half female when his body fused with the body of a nymph he fell in love with .
In some true hermaphrodites the testis and the ovary grow separately but bilaterally , in others they grow together within the same organ , forming an ovo-testis .
Not infrequently , at least one of the gonads functions quite well , producing either sperm cells or eggs , as well as functional levels of the sex hormones -- androgens or estrogens .
Although in theory it might be possible for a true hermaphrodite to become both father and mother to a child , in practice the appropriate ducts and tubes are not configured so that egg and sperm can meet .
In contrast with the true hermaphrodites , the pseudohermaphrodites possess two gonads of the same kind along with the
usual male ( XY ) or female ( XX ) chromosomal makeup .
But their external genitalia and secondary sex characteristics do not match their chromosomes .
Thus merms have testes and XY chromosomes , yet they also have a vagina and a clitoris , and at puberty they often develop breasts .
They do not menstruate , however .
Ferms have ovaries , two X chromosomes and sometimes a uterus , but they also have at least partly masculine external genitalia .
Without medical intervention they can develop beards , deep voices and adult - size penises .
No classification scheme could more than suggest the variety of sexual anatomy encountered in clinical practice .
In 1969 , for example , two French investigators , Paul Guinet of the Endocrine Clinic in Lyons and Jacques Decourt of the Endocrine Clinic in Paris , described ninety - eight cases of true hermaphroditism -- again , signifying people with both ovarian and testicular tissue -- solely according to the appearance of the external genitalia and the accompanying ducts .
In some cases the people exhibited strongly feminine development .
They had separate openings for the vagina and the urethra , a cleft vulva defined by both the large and the small labia , or vaginal lips , and at puberty they developed breasts and usually began to menstruate .
It was the oversize and sexually alert clitoris , which threatened sometimes at puberty to grow into a penis , that usually impelled them to seek medical attention .
Members of another group also had breasts and a feminine body type , and they menstruated .
But their labia were at least partly fused , forming an incomplete scrotum .
The phallus ( here an embryological term for a structure that during usual development goes on to form either a clitoris or a penis ) was between 1.5 and 2.8 inches long ; nevertheless , they urinated through a urethra that opened into or near the vagina .
By far the most frequent form of true hermaphrodite encountered by Guinet and Decourt -- 55 percent -- appeared to have a more masculine physique .
In such people the urethra runs either through or near the phallus , which looks more like a penis than a clitoris .
Any menstrual blood exits periodically during urination .
But in spite of the relatively male appearance of the genitalia , breasts appear at puberty .
It is possible that a sample larger than ninety - eight so - called true hermaphrodites would yield even more contrasts and subtleties .
Suffice it to say that the varieties are so diverse that it is possible to know which parts are present and what is attached to what only after exploratory surgery .
The embryological origins of human hermaphrodites clearly fit what is known about male and female sexual development .
The embryonic gonad generally chooses early in development to follow either a male or a female sexual pathway ; for the ovo-testis , however , that choice is fudged .
Similarly , the embryonic phallus most often ends up as a clitoris or a penis , but the existence of intermediate states comes as no surprise to the embryologist .
There are also uro-genital swellings in the embryo that usually either stay open and become the vaginal labia or fuse and become a scrotum .
In some hermaphrodites , though , the choice of opening or closing is ambivalent .
Finally , all mammalian embryos have structures that can become the female uterus and the fallopian tubes , as well as structures that can become part of the male sperm - transport system .
Typically either the male or the female set of those primordial genital organs degenerates , and the remaining structures achieve their sex - appropriate future .
In hermaphrodites both sets of organs develop to varying degrees .
Intersexuality itself is old news .
Hermaphrodites , for instance , are often featured in stories about human origins .
Early biblical scholars believed Adam began life as a hermaphrodite and later divided into two people -- a male and a female -- after falling from grace .
According to Plato there once were three sexes -- male , female and hermaphrodite -- but the third sex was lost with time .
Both the Talmud and the Tosefta , the Jewish books of law , list extensive regulations for people of mixed sex .
The Tosefta expressly forbids hermaphrodites to inherit their fathers ' estates ( like daughters ) , to seclude themselves with women ( like sons ) or to shave ( like men ) .
When hermaphrodites menstruate they must be isolated from men ( like women ) ; they are disqualified from serving as witnesses or as priests ( like women ) , but the laws of pederasty apply to them .
In Europe a pattern emerged by the end of the Middle Ages that , in a sense , has lasted to the present day : hermaphrodites were compelled to choose an established gender role and stick with it .
The penalty for transgression was often death .
Thus in the 1600s a Scottish hermaphrodite living as a woman was buried alive after impregnating his / her master 's daughter .
For questions of inheritance , legitimacy , paternity , succession to title and eligibility for certain professions to be determined , modern Anglo - Saxon legal systems require that newborns be registered as either male or female .
In the U.S. today sex determination is governed by state laws .
Illinois permits adults to change the sex recorded on their birth certificates should a physician attest to having performed the appropriate surgery The New York Academy of Medicine on the other hand , has taken an opposite view .
In spite of surgical alterations of the external genitalia , the academy argued in 1966 , the chromosomal sex remains the same .
By that measure , a person 's wish to conceal his or her original sex cannot outweigh the public interest in protection against fraud .
During this century the medical community has completed what the legal world began -- the complete erasure of any form of embodied sex that does not conform to a male - female , heterosexual pattern .
Ironically , a more sophisticated knowledge of the complexity of sexual systems has led to the repression of such intricacy .
In 1937 the urologist Hugh H. Young of Johns Hopkins University published a volume titled Genital Abnormalities , Hermaphrodites and Related Adrenal Diseases .
The book is remarkable for its erudition , scientific insight and open - mindedness .
In it Young drew together a wealth of carefully documented case histories to demonstrate and study the medical treatment of such " accidents of birth . "
Young did not pass judgment on the people he studied , nor did he attempt to coerce into treatment those intersexuals ; who rejected that option .
And he showed unusual evenhandedness in referring to those people who had sexual experiences as both men and women as " Practicing hermaphrodites . "
One of Young 's more interesting cases was a hermaphrodite named Emma who had grown up as a female .
Emma had both a penis - size clitoris and a vagina , which made it possible for him / her to have " normal " heterosexual sex with both men and women .
As a teenager Emma had had sex with a number of girls to whom s/he was deeply attracted ; but at the age of nineteen s/he had married a man .
Unfortunately , he had given Emma little sexual pleasure ( though he had had no complaints ) , and so throughout that marriage and subsequent ones Emma had kept girlfriends on the side .
With some frequency s/he had pleasurable sex with them .
Young describes his subject as appearing " to be quite content and even happy . "
In conversation Emma occasionally told him of his / her wish to be a man , a circumstance Young said would be relatively easy to bring about .
But Emma 's reply strikes a heroic blow for self - interest :
Would you have to remove that vagina ?
I do n't know about that because that 's my meal ticket .
If you did that , I would have to quit my husband and go to work , so I think I 'll keep it and stay as I am .
My husband supports me well ,
and even though I do n't have any sexual pleasure with him , I do have lots with my girlfriends .
Yet even as Young was illuminating intersexuality with the light of scientific reason , he was beginning its suppression .
For his book is also an extended treatise on the most modem surgical and hormonal methods of changing intersexuals , into either males or females .
Young may have differed from his successors in being less judgmental and controlling of the patients and their families , but he nonetheless supplied the foundation on which current intervention practices were built .
By 1969 , when the English physicians Christopher J. Dewhurst and Ronald R. Gordon wrote The Intersexual Disorders , medical and surgical approaches to intersexuality had neared a state of rigid uniformity .
It is hardly surprising that such a hardening of opinion took place in the era of the feminine mystique -- of the post - Second World War flight to the suburbs and the strict division of family roles according to sex .
That the medical consensus was not quite universal ( or perhaps that it seemed poised to break apart again ) can be gleaned from the near - hysterical tone of Dewhurst and Gordon 's book , which contrasts markedly with the calm reason of Young 's founding work .
Consider their opening description of an intersexual newborn :
One can only attempt to imagine the anguish of the parents .
That a newborn should have a deformity ... [ affecting ] so fundamental an issue as the very sex of the child ... is a tragic event which immediately conjures up visions of a hopeless psychological misfit doomed to live always as a sexual freak in loneliness and frustration .
Dewhurst and Gordon warned that such a miserable fate would , indeed , be a baby 's lot should the case be improperly managed ; " but fortunately , " they wrote , " with correct management the outlook is infinitely better than the poor parents -- emotionally stunnedby the event -- or indeed anyone without special knowledge could ever imagine . "
Scientific dogma has held fast to the assumption that without medical care hermaphrodites are doomed to a life of misery .
Yet there are few empirical studies to back up that assumption , and some of the same research gathered to build a case for medical treatment contradicts it .
Francies Benton , another of Young 's practicing hermaphrodites , " had not worried over his condition , did not wish to be changed , and was enjoying life . "
The same could be said of Emma , the opportunistic hausfrau .
Even Dewhurst and Gordon , adamant about the psychological importance of treating intersexuals ; at the infant stage , acknowledged great success in " changing the sex " of older patients .
They reported on twenty cases of children reclassified into a different sex after the supposedly critical age of eighteen months .
They asserted that all the reclassifications were " successful , " and they wondered then whether reregistration could be " recommended more readily than [ had ] been suggested so far . "
The treatment of intersexuality in this century provides a dear example of what the French historian Michel Foucault has called biopower .
The knowledge developed in biochemistry , embryology , endocrinology , psychology and surgery has enabled physicians to control the very sex of the human body .
The multiple contradictions in that kind of power call for some scrutiny .
On the one hand , the medical " management " of intersexuality certainly developed as part of an attempt to free people from perceived psychological pain ( though whether the pain was the patient 's , the parents ' or the physician's is unclear ) .
And if one accepts the assumption that in a sex - divided culture people can realize their greatest potential for happiness and productivity only if they are sure they belong to one of only two acknowledged sexes , modern medicine has been extremely successful .
On the other hand , the same medical accomplishments can be read not as progress but as a mode of discipline .
Hermaphrodites have unruly bodies .
They do not fall naturally into a binary classification ; only a surgical shoehorn can put them there .
But why should we care if a " woman , " defined as one who has breasts , a vagina , a uterus and ovaries and who menstruates , also has a clitoris large enough to penetrate the vagina of another woman ?
Why should we care if there are people whose biological equipment enables them to have sex " naturally " with both men and women ?
The answers seem to lie in a cultural need to maintain clear distinctions between the sexes .
Society mandates the control of intersexual bodies because they blur and bridge the great divide .
Inasmuch as hermaphrodites literally embody both sexes , they challenge traditional beliefs about sexual difference : they possess the irritating ability to live sometimes as one sex and sometimes the other , and they raise the specter of homosexuality .
But what if things were altogether different ?
Imagine a world in which the same knowledge that has enabled medicine to intervene in the management of intersexual patients has been placed at the service of multiple sexualities .
Imagine that the sexes have multiplied beyond currently imaginable limits .
It would have to be a world of shared powers .
Patient and physician , parent and child , male and female , heterosexual and homosexual -- all those oppositions and others would have to be dissolved as sources of division .
A new ethic of medical treatment would arise , one that would permit ambiguity in a culture that had overcome sexual division .
The central mission of medical treatment would be to preserve life .
Thus hermaphrodites would be concerned primarily not about whether they can conform to society but about whether they might develop potentially life - threatening conditions -- hernias , gonadal tumors , salt imbalance caused by adrenal malfunction -- that sometimes accompany hermaphroditic development .
In my ideal world medical intervention for intersexuals would take place only rarely before the age of reason ; subsequent treatment would be a cooperative venture between physician , patient and other advisers trained in issues of gender multiplicity .
I do not pretend that the transition to my utopia would be smooth .
Sex , even the supposedly " normal , " heterosexual kind , continues to cause untold anxieties in Western society .
And certainly a culture that has yet to come to grips -- religiously and , in some states , legally -- with the ancient and relatively uncomplicated reality of homosexual love will not readily embrace intersexuality .
No doubt the most troublesome arena by far would be the rearing of children .
Parents , at least since the Victorian era , have fretted , sometimes to the point of outright denial , over the fact that their children are sexual beings .
All that and more amply explains why intersexual children are generally squeezed into one of the two prevailing sexual categories .
But what would be the psychological consequences of taking the alternative road -- raising children as unabashed intersexuals ?
On the surface that tack seems fraught with peril .
What , for example , would happen to the intersexual child amid the unrelenting cruelty of the school yard ?
When the time came to shower in gym class , what horrors and humiliations would await the intersexual as his / her anatomy was displayed in all its nontraditional glory ?
In whose gym class would s/he register to begin with ?
What bathroom would s/he use ?
And how on earth would Mom and Dad help shepherd him / her through the mine field of puberty ?
In the past thirty years those questions have been ignored , as the scientific community has , with remarkable unanimity , avoided contemplating the alternative route of unimpeded intersexuality , But modem investigators tend to overlook a substantial body of case histories , most of them compiled between 1930 and 1960 , before surgical intervention became rampant .
Almost without exception , those reports describe children who grew up knowing they were intersexual ( though they did not advertise it ) and adjusted to their unusual status .
Some of the studies are richly detailed -- described at the level of gym - class showering ( which most intersexuals avoided without incident ) ; in any event , there is not a psychotic or a suicide in the lot .
American military aid to Israel has been increased yet again , which leads us to ask the inevitable question :
What are we getting for our money ?
Well , we ’re getting this , as well as this , and this  not to mention this .
The regularly quoted figure is $ 3.5 billion per year .
John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt go with the figure of $ 3 billion in their new book , The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , averring that this is " generous , but it is hardly the whole story . "
This " canonical " figure , they say , " omits a substantial number of other benefits . "
The authors cite former congressman Lee Hamilton as saying that Israel is one of three countries whose aid total " substantially exceeds the popularly quoted figures . "
The actual figure , said Hamilton , is more than $ 4.5 billion .
As Mearsheimer and Walt have pointed out , neither the practical nor the moral case for this extraordinary amount of material support is justified : our Israel - centered foreign policy has been a burden to us in our dealings with the other nations of the Middle East , and it is increasingly clear that U.S. and Israeli interests have diverged since the end of the Cold War .
Contrary to the Lobby ’s assertion that 9/11 made their fight our fight , the exact opposite is the case .
Anti-Americanism in the Muslim world is a deadly danger to our national security and a great boon to Osama bin Laden and his many imitators around the globe .
This arming of the Israeli Sparta is a strategic and diplomatic liability that grows with each passing year .
This post by Matt Yglesias over at The Atlantic makes a lot of sense , as far as it goes .
An argument made by the Amen Corner is that the Israelis are performing a valuable service by refining the technical expertise of the military - industrial complex : they ’re doing the research and development that is giving America the weapons of tomorrow .
But " this does n’t really make sense , " Yglesias writes , " since defense contractors  American , Israeli , French , whatever  get paid for their work as is , so it ’s not clear why the Israeli government would need extra payment . "
It ’s hard to differentiate between private and public industry in socialist Israel , especially when it comes to the military - industrial complex , where no clear line of demarcation exists .
Indeed , in the United States , and throughout the world , such companies are virtual arms of the government , which is their primary and often only customer .
The point to be made is this : Just as America ’s policy of military intervention in the Middle East benefits Israel strategically , serving as an ever expanding protective shield against the hostility of its neighbors , so American subsidies in the form of military aid are designed to bolster the burgeoning Israeli arms industry , so that government - supported Israeli companies can sell us new weaponry developed on our dime .
The system works a little differently in Eastern Europe , where the installation of missile defense - systems purportedly defending against a very unlikely Iranian attack is a direct subsidy to the American companies that developed it .
Again , aid to the Israelis is given on unusually favorable terms , and this underscores once more the central point made by Professors Mearsheimer and Walt , which is that the existence of the Lobby  as the single most powerful influence on the conduct of American foreign policy  explains the discrepancy .
Israel is a rich country .
They do n’t need this enormous outpouring of free cash to shore up their military machine , which amounts to around one - sixth of our total foreign aid outlay and about 2 percent of the Israeli gross domestic product .
It is the equivalent of roughly $ 500 per year to each and every citizen of Israel .
So why this incredible amount of military aid ?
After all , the Israelis are unofficial members of the nuclear club .
They could turn Tehran into a molten puddle of glass at a moment ’s notice , and maybe someday they will .
Which is precisely the point .
Israel is one of the most warlike countries on earth , given that it has been , since its inception , perpetually at war with its neighbors .
Israel ’s partisans claim this is no fault of the Israelis , yet that question is not only highly debatable , it is utterly irrelevant as far as determining what the American interest is in all this .
This new aid package will accelerate a process that was begun some time ago and help make Israel America ’s confidante and primary ally , a post once occupied by the British , ensconcing the Jewish state as the primary armaments - producer to the American empire .
Israel will profit from the rise of the American empire not only monetarily , but also geopolitically .
This strengthening of the Israeli military - industrial complex fills the coffers of the War Party to overflowing and helps keep the political and economic dynamics of this uniquely binational war economy flowing and politically viable .
As regards the latter , as we have seen , the Lobby and allied groups and individuals take a leading role in plumbing for an aggressive policy in the Middle East , pushing for policies that increase war profits .
It ’s the economics of that famous " cycle of violence " that everyone is always talking about breaking , yet it wo n’t be broken until the power of the military - industrial complex is successfully curtailed , and , with it , the decisive influence of the Lobby .
One effect of The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy will be to reopen discussion of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and how it ’s not being enforced in the case of AIPAC .
As the arrest , trial , and conviction of Pentagon analyst Larry Franklin makes all too clear , Israel ’s top lobbying organization in the U.S. is an agent of a foreign government : the upcoming trial of top AIPAC officials Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman on charges of passing classified information gleaned from Franklin to Israeli government officials threatens to uncover what it means to really function as a foreign agent  including engaging in espionage , in addition to routine cheerleading for the Israeli government talking point of the moment .
Many people have written me  given that I have covered the implications of the AIPAC spy trial in detail but have n’t published anything on the subject recently  asking whatever happened to Rosen , Weissman , and the case , and darkly implying that since the supposedly all - powerful " Jewish cabal " that ( in their view ) runs the world could n’t possibly allow this to come to trial , it wo n’t ever see the light of a courtroom .
Ah , not so : the trial , though delayed  through the successful legal tactics of the defense  has not been derailed .
A trial date of Jan. 14 , 2008 , has been set  although this , too , is tentative , given the outcome of several pending legal maneuvers .
Another reason for the successful delaying tactics by the defense : the media has n’t paid any attention to this case , apart from a brief flurry of interest when the story first broke .
For the reasons why that is so , you ’ll just have to read The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy .
I ’m just finishing it up now and hope to have a report for you soon .
In the meantime , the Lobby marches on , devastating all opposition with its virulent smear campaigns , and pulling in a good chunk of change for the mother country in the process .
So , what are we getting for our involuntary " contribution " to the IDF ?
Well , nothing .
But our politicians , and the corrupt corporate interests whose sock - puppets they are , are getting plenty  of that you can be sure .
The former are getting reelected , thanks to huge campaign contributions by the special interests , including the armaments industry , and the latter are getting rich off the backs of the American taxpayers .
And the beat goes on
Art teachers are being warned about the potential danger
The 16 - year - old girl is said to have suffered third degree burns as the plaster set .
It happened in January at Giles School and Sixth Form Centre in Old Leake , Lincolnshire , a visual arts specialist .
The Health and Safety Executive is investigating and safety warnings are being circulated to other schools .
The Giles School 's head teacher , Chris Walls , said in a statement : " I can confirm that a serious accident did occur in our art department at the end of January and that the Health and Safety Executive are involved .
" They are in the initial stages of their enquiry into this accident and we do not wish to make any further comment until this has been completed . "
The executive told the BBC News website that the girl had lost her thumbs and most of her fingers .
Fractures
The warning is now circulating in safety bulletins distributed to schools by local authorities .
It was sent out by the school science advisory service , Cleapss .
" In the incident a girl was mixing plaster of Paris with water by hand , intending to make a plaster cast of her hand , " it said .
It said there had been a similar incident a few years ago , in which a pupil had lost two fingers .
" Plaster of Paris is of course used for setting fractured bones but in such cases it is never put in direct contact with the skin .
" In addition , it is used in relatively thin layers so the heat can dissipate .
In bulk , the temperature can reach 60 °C or so . "
Reaction
Other experts say plaster and similar products such as stucco and concrete do get extremely hot as they set .
One industry website warns : " When you pour a plaster statue or mix a large batch of plaster a chemical reaction takes place during the setting process and the cast plaster heats up as it hardens .
" The larger the volume you cast , the more it will heat up .
Temperatures may reach 150° deep within the mass of a large casting .
" Do not encase any of your body parts or anyone else 's in plaster . "
Evidently hardware assisted brute force password cracking has arrived :
A technique for cracking computer passwords using inexpensive off - the - shelf computer graphics hardware is causing a stir in the computer security community .
Elcomsoft , a software company based in Moscow , Russia , has filed a US patent for the technique .
It takes advantage of the " massively parallel processing " capabilities of a graphics processing unit ( GPU ) - the processor normally used to produce realistic graphics for video games .
Using an $ 800 graphics card from nVidia called the GeForce 8800 Ultra , Elcomsoft increased the speed of its password cracking by a factor of 25 , according to the company 's CEO , Vladimir Katalov .
The toughest passwords , including those used to log in to a Windows Vista computer , would normally take months of continuous computer processing time to crack using a computer 's central processing unit ( CPU ) .
By harnessing a $ 150 GPU - less powerful than the nVidia 8800 card - Elcomsoft says they can be cracked in just three to five days .
Less complex passwords can be retrieved in minutes , rather than hours or days .
GPUs , with their massive built - in paralellism , were built to do things like this .
I 'm encouraged that we 're finally able to harness all that video silicon to do useful things beyond rendering Doom at 60 frames per second with anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering .
There 's a bit more detail on the elecom approach in their one - page PDF .
They provide actual numbers there .
Using the " brute force " technique of recovering passwords , it was possible , though time - consuming , to recover passwords from popular applications .
For example , the logon password for Windows Vista might be an eight - character string composed of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters .
There would about 55 trillion ( 52 to the eighth power ) possible passwords .
Windows Vista uses NTLM hashing by default , so using a modern dual - core PC you could test up to 10,000,000 passwords per second , and perform a complete analysis in about two months .
With ElcomSoft 's new technology , the process would take only three to five days , depending upon the CPU and GPU .
Preliminary tests using Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery show that the [ brute force password cracking ] speed has increased by a factor of twenty , simply by hooking up with a $ 150 video card 's onboard GPU .
ElcomSoft expects to find similar results as this new technology is incorporated into their password recovery products for Microsoft Office , PGP , and dozens of other popular applications .
It 's fun , and it makes for a shocking " Password Cracking Supercomputers On Every Desktop Make Passwords Irrelevant " headline , but password cracking supercomputers on every desktop does n't mean the end of password - protected civilization as we know it .
Let 's do the math .
How many passwords can we attempt per second ?
Dual Core CPU 10,000,000 GPU 200,000,000
How many password combinations do we have to try ?
528 = 53,459,728,531,456
That 's a lot of potential passwords .
Let 's stop playing Quake Wars for a few days and get cracking :
53,459,728,531,456 / 10,000,000 pps / 60 / 60 / 24 = 61.9 days
53,459,728,531,456 / 200,000,000 pps / 60 / 60 / 24 = 3.1 days
As promised by elecom , that works out to a little over three days at the GPU crack rate , and two months at the CPU crack rate .
Oooh .
Scary .
Worried yet ?
If so , you should n't be .
Watch what happens when I add four additional characters to the password :
5212 / 200,000,000 pps / 60 / 60 / 24 = 22,620,197 days
For those of you keeping score at home , with a 12 character password this hardware assisted brute - force attack would take 61,973 years .
Even if we increased the brute force attack rate by a factor of a thousand , it would still take 62 years .
Elecom 's idea of an 8 character password is awfully convenient , too .
Only lowercase and uppercase letters , a total of 52 possible choices per character .
Who has passwords without at least one number ?
Even MySpace users are smarter than that .
If you include a number in your 8 character password , or a non-alphanumeric character like " % " , attack times increase substantially .
Not enough to mitigate the potential attack completely , mind you , but you 'd definitely put a serious dent in any brute forcing effort by switching out a character or two .
628 / 200,000,000 pps / 60 / 60 / 24 = 13 days 728 / 200,000,000 pps / 60 / 60 / 24 = 42 days
Personally , I think it 's easier to go with a pass phrase than a bunch of random , difficult to remember gibberish characters as a password .
Even if your pass phrase is in all lower - case -- a mere 26 possible characters -- that exponent is incredibly potent .
2610 / 200,000,000 pps / 60 / 60 / 24 = 8 days 2612 / 200,000,000 pps / 60 / 60 / 24 = 15 years 2614 / 200,000,000 pps / 60 / 60 / 24 = 10,228 years
By the time you get to a mere 14 characters -- even if they 're all lowercase letters -- you can pretty much forget about anyone brute forcing your password .
Ever .
So what have we learned ?
Brute force attacks , even fancy hardware - assisted brute force attacks , are still for dummies .
If this is the best your attackers can do , they 're too stupid to be dangerous .
Brute forcing is almost always a waste of time , when vastly more effective social vectors and superior technical approaches are readily available .
Hardware - assisted brute force attacks will never be a credible threat .
But short , simple passwords are still dangerous .
If your password is only 8 alphabet characters , and if it 's exposed in a way that allows brute force hardware assisted attack , you could be in trouble .
All you need to do to sleep soundly at night ( well , at least as far as brute force attacks are concerned ) is choose a slightly longer password .
It 's much safer to think of your security in terms of passphrases instead of passwords .
And unlike " secure " 8 character passwords , passphrases are easy to remember , too .
Have you considered helping me evangelize passphrases ?
Special methods of questioning Essentially indistinguishable from " enhanced coercive interrogation technique " , this seems to be a broad - brush term covering a range of interrogation methods likely to arouse disquiet in the kind of people who worry about such matters as the Geneva Convention , the Convention Against Torture and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
Black sites
The secret CIA prisons and / or interrogation centres where the above techniques are practised .
Illegal combatants
The people to whom the above techniques are applied .
Sleep management Deluded liberals may prefer the term " sleep deprivation " .
Stress position Detainee is forced to stand erect for several hours .
Or forced to stand erect for several hours , with his arms held out to the side .
Or shackled to the ceiling with his arms extended , sometimes without his feet touching the ground .
Whichever , it 's certainly stressful .
Special renditions
Er , kidnapping .
Fear up Ranges from leaving a truncheon on the table to throwing furniture around or , as the website Slate has pointed out , if the prisoner is religious , allowing him to think that he may face eternal damnation by threatening to show him pornographic images .
Sexual humiliation Detainee forced to strip naked , or adopt sexually explicit poses .
Mild , non-injurious physical contact A cuff round the ear .
Or - whoops , we never meant to go that far - a broken leg .
Refined interrogation techniques Actually , that was the Gestapo 's favourite euphemism .
But then , they did n't practise torture either , did they ?
Colorado and Texas residents may like their drink a little too much .
That 's at least according to a study conducted by Men's Health magazine to determine the nation 's most dangerously drunk cities .
Topping the list as the nation 's " Drunkest City , " according to the study , was Denver .
Fellow Colorado communities Colorado Springs and Aurora rated third and 19th respectively .
Denver was rated the most dangerously drunk city in 2006 as well .
Meanwhile , Texas joined Colorado as the only state with more than one city falling in the " top " 10 on the list , with San Antonio ranking sixth , Austin coming in seventh and Lubbock in the ninth spot .
Other communities making the top 10 list included second - ranked Anchorage , Alaska , fourth - ranked Omaha , Neb. , fifth - ranked Fargo , N.D. , eighth - ranked Fresno , Calif. , and 10th - ranked Milwaukee , Wis .
The magazine says it looked at factors such as annual death rates due to alcoholic liver disease , drunk - driving arrests and the percentage of fatal accidents involving intoxicated motorists .
Also factored in is the report card from Mothers Against Drunk Driving on state efforts to cut down on excessive drinking .
On the other end of the scale , Durham , N.C. , was named the least dangerously drunk city , earning an A - plus from MADD .
Because self - destructive drivers tend to buy alcohol impulsively and at late hours , the magazine recommended readers visit the Alcohol Policy Information System 's
Web site to review which states put strict limits on where and when alcohol can be sold .

Google believes the technologies need to go to the next level
The Californian firm wants to make green energy sources of electricity cheaper than that produced from coal .
Its new initiative will focus in the first instance on solar thermal power , wind power and enhanced geothermal systems .
The support , to be channelled through philanthropic arm Google.org , will go to firms , R&D labs and universities .
Google also plans to do research itself , and will be hiring its own engineers and energy experts .
It says renewables have to be taken to the next level if fossil fuel burning 's impact on the climate is to be tackled effectively .
Need for speed
" With talented technologists , great partners and significant investments , we hope to rapidly push forward , " said Larry Page , Google co-founder .
" Our goal is to produce one gigawatt of renewable energy capacity that is cheaper than coal .
We are optimistic this can be done in years , not decades . "
One gigawatt can power a city the size of San Francisco , one of California 's biggest cities .
Google is already backing fuel - efficient cars .
Google.org is giving out grants to help commercialise plug - in hybrids and fully electric vehicles .
The company itself has a 1.6 - megawatt solar panel system installed at its headquarters in Mountain View , California .
Google said it expected to focus its early efforts on solar thermal technology , and would be spending " tens of millions " of dollars in 2008 on the initiative .
In the future , however , this support should grow considerably .
Positive feedback
The firm has already begun working with what it regards as promising approaches in the state of California itself .
These include Makani Power Inc , which is developing ways to generate electricity by harnessing high - altitude winds .
Google thinks it has to get renewables producing electricity for a price of 1 - 3 cents per kilowatt - hour .
" Solar is currently substantially more expensive than coal , depending on the type that you have ; but we see a lot of evidence from all the people working hard on this that the costs can come down quite a bit , " said Larry Page .
" It 's an ambitious goal to get it cheaper than coal but it seems obtainable ; and certainly if we can , it will have a huge impact . "
Yet many Iraqis have told reporters they still do not feel secure , despite General Petraeus ’s charts showing drops in violence .
Internal displacement has doubled since the “ surge ” began , reaching 1.1 million people nationwide , according to the International Office of Migration and the Iraqi Red Crescent Society .
Shiite militias have continued their steady march to force Sunni Arabs from an ever - expanding area of Baghdad and surrounding villages .
That has been compounded by mass roundups of Sunni Arabs suspected of being insurgents , who are held for months in dangerously crowded detention centers without trial or charges .
Shiite judges concede that 40 percent to 50 percent of those detainees are innocent .
Meanwhile , fighting within sects is on the rise .
Shiites have sunk into a violent struggle between factions loyal to rival clerics , Abdel Aziz Hakim and Moktada al - Sadr .
Two provincial governors in the Shiite south were assassinated in August , in Muthanna and Diwaniya Provinces .
Both were members of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , led by Mr. Hakim .
Assassinations and other attacks have persisted for months in the south , including the outbreak of fighting in Karbala barely two weeks ago between factions loyal to the clerics .
Mr. Crocker interpreted the fighting , which left at least 52 people dead , as a catalyst to a cease - fire by Mr. Sadr ’s forces .
However , Mr. Sadr ’s word has rarely proved effective or lasting .
He issued a similar command in February at the start of the American troop increase in Baghdad , and after a hiatus of a few weeks , the killings of Sunni Arabs resumed , although at a lower level , and so did the sectarian purging of neighborhoods .
Among Sunni Arabs , the divide splits those in Parliament who were early participants in the political process and the tribal sheiks in Sunni- majority areas , notably Anbar Province , who have recently become American allies and rivals for power .
This struggle adds yet more uncertainty to the fraught political situation .
Power has essentially shifted in a number of directions , geographically and socially .
Some provinces have become dominions unto themselves ; other provinces are impoverished , unable to get Baghdad to deliver resources that the provinces can not procure themselves .
Cheney revs up anti-Iran rhetoric ; says US ' will not allow ' Iran to go nuclear David Edwards and Jason Rhyne

In what may be the boldest statements yet from the Bush administration regarding Iran 's pursuit of nuclear capability , Vice President Dick Cheney pledged on Sunday that the US and international community is " prepared to impose serious consequences " on the Iranian regime if the nation did not abandon its uranium enrichment program .
" The United States joins other nations in sending a clear message -- we will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon , " Cheney said during a speech to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
The remarks come on the heels of comments at a press conference last week by President Bush warning of " World War III " if a nuclear weapon was ever developed by Iran .
But White House spokesman Tony Fratto said on Monday that the Cheney remarks were not significantly different in substance than previous comments on the subject from Bush administration officials .
" I would n't call it stepping up the rhetoric , " Fratto said , asked if the close timing of comments about Iran from both President Bush and Cheney was purely coincidental .
" In fact what the vice president said was a very clear review of the situation in the Middle East . "
" And by the way , it 's not at all different from what he has said before , what the president has said before , what Secretary [ Condoleeza ]
Rice has said before , " he continued , adding that the administration was seeking a " diplomatic solution , " and " working with our international partners in a unified way to put pressure on Iran to stop its activities . "
In his speech , Cheney detailed what he characterized as repeated violations of UN sanctions by Iran .
" The Security Council has twice imposed sanctions on Iran and called on the regime to cease enriching uranium , " the vice president stated .
" Yet the regime continues to do so , and continues to practice delay and deception in an obvious attempt to buy time . "
" Given the nature of Iran 's rulers , " he continued , " the declarations of the Iranian President , and the trouble the regime is causing throughout the region -- including direct involvement in the killing of Americans -- our country and the entire international community cannot stand by as a terror - supporting state fulfills its most aggressive ambitions . "
According to the AFP , " Cheney 's warning to Iran recalled UN Security Council resolutions in 2002 that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein faced ' serious consequences ' if he failed to come clean on his alleged stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction . "
" This week we heard a significant ratcheting up of the rhetoric , " former Middle East envoy Dennis Ross , who served under Presidents Clinton and George H.W. Bush , told the New York Times .
Cheney 's remarks were " strong words " with " serious implications , " he says , according to the paper .
Vice President Cheney in his speech sought to draw a distinction between the aims of the Iranian government and the people of the country , who he said he believed " have every right to be free from oppression , from economic deprivation , and tyranny in their own country . "
" The spirit of freedom is stirring in Iran , " he stated .
" The voices of change and peaceful dissent will not be silent .
We can expect to hear more from the courageous reformers , the bloggers , and the advocates of rights for women and ethnic and religious minorities , because these men and women are more loyal to their country than to the regime . "
" America , " he remarked , " looks forward to the day when Iranians reclaim their destiny ; the day that our two countries , as free and democratic nations , can be the closest of friends . "

If quarks are made of preons , then stars made of the stuff should be detectable .
Bits within bits : is there something smaller than a quark , which in turn makes up protons and neutrons ?
ArSciMed / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
Are there pea-sized objects as heavy as the Moon out there in space ?
Perhaps so , if quarks , the constituent particles of atoms , are themselves made up of still smaller particles .
Fredrik Sandin and Johan Hansson of Luleå University of Technology in Sweden say that these hypothetical particles , called preons , might exist in super - dense chunks left over from the beginning of the Universe .
Their work predicts that these heavy objects should be detectable with current astronomical techniques1 .
This helps to turn a highly speculative hypothesis into a testable idea .
If preon nuggets exist , they might account for a significant proportion of the mysterious dark matter known to make up a big chunk of the tangible mass of the Universe .
Smaller and smaller
It ’s been long known that matter has a Russian - doll nature .
Atoms are made of protons and neutrons ( together called hadrons ) , along with lighter electrons .
In turn , hadrons consist of particles called quarks , of which there are six varieties .
In addition , there are six varieties of fundamental particles related to the electron , called leptons .
In 1974 , physicists Jogesh Pati and Abdus Salam speculated that a small family of particles they called preons could explain the proliferation of quarks and leptons .
In 1999 , Hansson and his coworkers proposed that three types of preons would suffice to build all the known quarks and leptons23 .
Then in 2005 , Hansson and his student Sandin went on to explore whether some matter could have got stuck at the preon stage , rather than ‘ condensing ’ into quarks or hadrons4 .
They predict that it could .
Such lumps of preons would be even denser than quark stars or neutron stars .
Neutron stars , for comparison , are thought to compact the mass of our Sun into a ball the width of Long Island in New York .
Big bubbles
The lumps of preon matter they envisage would n't be made from collapsed stars , but would be relics from the Big Bang .
As the newborn Universe expanded , the matter it contained gradually thinned out , switching from preon matter to quark matter and eventually to the atoms that now make up stars and interstellar gas .
Sandin and Hansson say , however , that some of the preon matter might have got stuck as stable bubbles that never made the switch .
They calculate that these bubbles would be less massive than ordinary stars , at no more than 100 times the mass of Earth , and less than a metre across .
There ’s no lower limit , but Sandin and Hansson have considered preon nuggets down to the size of a pea , which would be a little less massive than the Moon .
Such objects , scattered sparsely through space , would be too small to see directly .
But the researchers say that there are various ways they might reveal themselves .
Heavy bending
Such ultra - dense objects would bend light that passed nearby .
This effect is called gravitational lensing : the objects acts as a kind of lens for the light of more distant stars that lie behind it when viewed from Earth .
Gravitational lensing is well known for visible light bent by large , dark objects .
But Sandin and Hansson say that , because preon nuggets are so small , they would exert their strongest influence on γ-rays , such as those emitted from extremely violent cosmic outbursts called γ- ray bursts .
The preon lenses would n’t brighten the γ-ray signal , as a normal gravitational lens does , but would produce a characteristic wobble in the spectra .
ADVERTISEMENT
Another approach could spot two preon nuggets bound in mutual orbit by gravity .
Such ‘ binaries ’ would emit gravity waves — ripples in space - time , which could be detected with gravity - wave detectors if the binary is near the Sun .
Diminutive preon binaries would excite waves of high frequency , making them detectable by table - top devices rather than the immense gravity - wave detectors currently used to search for such waves from star - sized objects .
And tiny preon nuggets that collide with Earth would excite seismic waves that can be identified by seismic detectors .
“ They ’re so small , they would just drill a hole through the planet ” , says Hansson .
But they would leave a trail of seismic waves along their path , which , being a straight line , would clearly differ from the rumbles created by the grinding of continents .
Shot in the dark
Making preon matter seems to be out of the question : it would involve recreating the conditions of the early Big Bang , before the putative switch to quark matter .
That would require energies way beyond the reach even of the Large Hadron Collider , which is now nearing completion at Europe 's particle - physics laboratory , CERN , near Geneva in Switzerland .
How do other physicists react to the notion of preon stars — quite literally a shot in the dark ?
“ They ’re either very enthusiastic , or they think it ’s rubbish ” , says Hansson .
“ There ’s not much in between . ”
But John Charap , a theoretical physicist at Queen Mary College in London , seems to sit in the middle ground .
“ It ’s not a completely daft idea ” , he says .
“ And after all , we need some pretty daft ideas to make any progress in understanding dark matter .
We ’re currently floundering around looking for ways to explain it .
This might be as good a candidate as any . ”

Buyers are given a private entrance to the mall , along with access to a gym and Club Nouvelle , a social club with a screening room , game room and wine bar .
Perhaps the most coveted amenity is a private parking spot , erasing the misery of searching for a car in a sea of parked cars .
The development group is banking on what it perceives as women ’s love of shopping at the mall , so its target market is decidedly female .
Tamara
Roy , the architect of the project , loaded the design with what she feels are women - friendly features , like full - length mirrors in the bathrooms , curving plaster walls and flowers dotting the facade of the parking lot .
Still , women are not the only ones excited about the development .
“ We were calling them , hounding them to get in last February before they even opened up the sales office , ” said Michael DuGally , 39 , the president of an office furniture company .
Along with his wife , Kellie , 37 , the president of an online media distribution company , he bought a penthouse unit for $ 1.6 million .
New residents see the development as the best of both worlds , with a downtown downstairs .
“ It ’s like having the city come out to the suburbs , ” Ms. Sandell said .
The DuGallys ’ new home is a five - minute drive from their favorite yoga studio and a five - minute walk from California Pizza Kitchen , neither of which they had in their industrial loft in the suburb of Everett .
And living at the mall , so close to the Massachusetts Turnpike and Route 9 , cuts their commute in half .
Why Is Family Guy Okay When Imus Was n’t ?
Don Imus is back on the radio , brimming with apology and announcing a new cast that includes two African - American comedians .
He was run off the air a few months ago for calling the Rutgers women ’s basketball team “ nappy headed ho’s . ”
I understand why he was canned .
I understand why he is back .
I understand that our culture loves the whole hero - sins / is - sent - into exile / then - is - redeemed cycle .
It seems to perfectly embody the Christian ideals on which much of our culture operates .
What I do n’t understand is why Imus got fired for his sins , albeit temporarily , while Family Guy rolls merrily along .
I am not saying that Family Guy should be canned , or that Imus should n’t have been , but it ’s a pretty curious situation .
I have n’t seen Family Guy all that much , but whenever I do I am pretty surprised that it ’s allowed on the airwaves right there during prime time on broadcast TV ( not cable ) .
It ’s a cartoon comedy that packs more gags per minute about race , sex , incest , bestiality , etc. than any other show I can think of .
( It may have been beaten by South Park and a dozen others for all I know , but I ca n’t think of anything that comes close on broadcast TV . )
Its characters include a father whose cartoon chin is drawn as a pair of testicles , a masochistic toddler , and a talking dog who , I believe , is both homosexual and an alcoholic .
Let me put it this way : if you have or had a mother , any sort of mother , it is the kind of show you would not dare watch while sitting beside her .
Keep in mind that PBS was forced to clean up Ken Burns ‘s World War II documentary because some of the soldiers had the temerity to swear .
Keep in mind that Santa Clauses in Australia are no longer allowed to say “ Ho ho ho ” since it has been deemed offensive to women ( I wonder if they have Don Imus to thank for that ? ) ; instead , they are encouraged to say “ Ha ha ha . ”
Keep in mind , too , that Family Guy is broadcast on Fox , which was recently charged with censoring the notoriously rough language at the Emmy Awards .
Now read this simple but elegantly illustrative line from a Family Guy episode I saw not long ago , a repeat from last year I believe :
Stewie ( the evil toddler ) :
What kind of a man would I be if I ran off now ?
Brian ( the dog ) :
Well , you ’d be a black man .
This and many other clips used to live on YouTube , but have been taken down because of copyright issues .
There ’s still a lot of Family Guy stuff there , however ; though the clips probably do n’t last long .
For a longer discussion of this episode , and a nice piece of writing on the very Imus point I ’m trying to make here , see this National Review article by Mark Goldbatt .
FWIW , also keep in mind that the show is currently being produced without its creator , Seth McFarlane , because of the writers ’ strike .
And finally , especially if you are a media - conspiracy - theorist type , keep in mind that one recent episode was super pro-Al Gore — which might not mean much except that Fox is part of News Corp. , the realm of the putatively uber - conservative Rupert Murdoch .
So , keeping all that in mind , let me ask you this :
Why is Family Guy okay when Imus was n’t ?
Here are a few thoughts that come to mind ; I ’m eager to hear from you too .
1. Imus is human and Family Guy is a cartoon .
2. Imus is non-fiction and Family Guy is fiction ( although it often has non-fiction elements ) .
3. Imus aspires to some level of intellectual sophistication while Family Guy is brazenly juvenile .
4. Imus is live talk while Family Guy is taped entertainment .
5 . There is no real difference between the two , but the kind of big public storm that resulted in Imus being fired is essentially a random event , unpredictable and nearly inexplicable , and it typically arises when political , social , and media pressures all align just right .
It ca n’t be concocted , or controlled .
It happened to Imus because it happened ; and it has n’t happened to Family Guy just because it has n’t .
I woke up this morning to a flood of mail regarding Tony Mobily ’s commentary on Ubuntu vs Red Hat .
This would be a good time to remind all of us in the Ubuntu community that Red Hat ’s demise is not our goal , and not how we should measure our success .
My own view is that Red Hat will continue to do well in the specific areas that they have targeted – they are extremely well established in the high - availability enterprise Linux server market , and it will take some years before Ubuntu can make the same claim .
Our focus is different to that of Red Hat – we want to ensure that there are free ( in both FSF and economic senses ) platforms for commodity requirements , like desktops and typical web or email of HPC servers , where the existing free software stack does everything that people typically want .
And we want to ensure that this free offering is sustainable , so that it is independent of the whims of any large corporate ( and frankly independent of my own whims , too ) .
Essentially , we want to create a sustainable , practical home for the very best Linux engineers and architects ( initially drawing primarily from the pool of Debian developers but now we ’re starting to bring in upstream folks too ) .
If that can be sustainable , and charged with delivering a free platform that anyone can use for a desktop or a standard server , then I think we will have accomplished something remarkable and unique .
Much like the FSG , and OSDL , Ubuntu will have a role to play in making Linux widely and freely available and keeping it at the cutting edge .
Our job is to make the amazing , cutting edge work of thousands of free software developers available in a neat , elegant package that anybody can deploy free of charge , with easy access to the whole universe of free software , and for which they can get commercial grade support if they want it .
That ’s a much less grand vision than Red Hat ’s goal to challenge the establishment – SUN , Microsoft et al – and create a new enterprise serving other enterprises .
It ’s true that competition with Red Hat and Novell is part of what energises the Ubuntu team – we strive to produce something that is cleaner , crisper , faster and better engineered than the alternatives that are out there , and we value the bar that they set .
But our primary competition is ourselves – we set extremely high standards for our own team , and we aim to beat that with every release .
So , Red Hat will I think retain a place in the world .
Given that their balance sheet is almost as strong as ( ours ) , I would expect them to be around for some time ;-) .

Wikileaks exclusive investigative report by
JULIAN ASSANGE ( ja@iq.org ) & staff
November 8 , 2007
This spectacular 2,000 page US military leak consists of the names , group structure and theatre equipment registers of all units in Iraq with US army equipment .
It exposes secretive document exploitation centers , detainee operations , elements of the State Department , Air Force , Navy and Marines units , the Iraqi police and coalition forces from Poland , Denmark , Ukraine , Latvia , Slovakia , Romania , Armenia , Kazakhstan and El Salvador .
The material represents nearly the entire order of battle for US forces in Iraq and is the first public revelation of many of the military units described .
Among other matters it shows that the United States may have violated the United Nations Chemical Weapons Convention .
Funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is currently a critical issue in the US .
A majority of Democratic party candidates was elected to both houses of the US Congress in 2006 on an anti-war platform .
Under the US Constitution , Congress has the ' power of the purse ' to cut off funding for war , but Democrats have not yet sought to use this power .
In late April , Congress passed a bill , HR 1591 , which did not cut off funding , but instead authorized war funding through 2008 and into 2009 .
However , the bill was vetoed by President Bush on 1 May ( 2007 ) because it contained a non-binding timetable for withdrawal of US forces .
With pressure building in Washington , further cracks are appearing within the US government itself .
Some within the government believe enough is enough .
They have leaked several confidential military documents to Wikileaks .

C hemical weapons
“ The use of chemical weapons by US forces was explicitly banned by President Gerald Ford in 1975 after CS gas had been repeatedly used in Vietnam to smoke out enemy soldiers and then kill them as they ran away .
Britain would be in a particularly sensitive position if the US used the weapons as it drafted the convention and is still seen internationally as its most important guardian .
The [ UK ] Foreign Office [ Minister of State , Mike O'Brien ] said : " All state parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention have undertaken not to use any toxic chemical or its precursor , including riot - control agents .
This applies in any armed conflict . " [ 1 ]
„ — US Prepares to Use Toxic Gases in Iraq , The Independent ( London ) , March 2 , 2003
The M33A1 bulk CS chemical dispenser , 21 of which appear together with their M254 high pressure loading kits in the leaked U.S weapons list for Iraq
Friday November 9 , 2007
Wikileaks exclusive investigative report .
The United States has been caught with at least 2,386 " non-lethal " chemical weapons deployed in Iraq .
The items appear in a spectacular 2,000 page leak of nearly one million items of US military equipment deployed in Iraq given to the government transparency group Wikileaks .
The items are labelled under the military 's own NATO supply classification Chemical weapons and equipment .
In the weeks prior to the March 19 , 2003 commencement of the Iraq war , the United States received a widely reported rebuke from its primary coalition partner , the United Kingdom , over statements by then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that the US military might use CS gas in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Subsequently Washington has been quiet about whether it has deployed CS gas and other chemical weapons or not , except to deny , then admit , to using white phosphorus during the gruesome 2004 assault on Fallujah as " a smoke screen " and " an incendiary " — uses not technically covered by the Chemical Weapons Convention . [ 2 ]
The use of chemical weapons such as CS gas for military operations is illegal .
The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997 , drafted by the United Kingdom and ratified by the United States , declares “ Each State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare ” .
It only grants permissible use to " law enforcement including domestic riot control . "
Riot control agents , according to former Clinton Administration National Security Council analyst Elisa D. Harris , speaking to the New York Times , are cited explicitly because they have a history of escalating misuse leading into uncontrolled chemical warfare .
They given special treatment under the convention in a number of ways .
They are uniquely and explicitly :
defined ( Art. II.7 ) , prohibited for use as a method of warfare ( Art. I.5 ) , required to be declared ( Art. III. 1 ( e ) ) , cited in Art. X.8 ( b ) on investigation and assistance if used against a State Party , and permitted for a purpose not prohibited by the Convention , namely , “ law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes ” ( Art. II.9 ( d ) )
[ 3 ]
Most items on the Chemical weapons and equipment list were registered via the US Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command Edgewood Chemical Biological Center , 5183 Blackhawk Rd , Gunpowder , Maryland . [ 4 ]
There is the M33A1 , as pictured above , a high pressure backpack CS / CR gas or liquid dispenser and the M254 , its high pressure loading kit .
On April 11 , 2003 the US military TACOM contracting office put out a tender solicitation for 75 to 225 units . [ 5 ]
The most numerous item on the chemical weapons equipment list is a vehicle mounted gas canister launcher , the " DISCHARGER GRSCL XM7 " , used to launch 66 mm smoke and CS gas grenades ....
See US violates chemical weapons convention for the full article and list .
A rms & equipment lists of notable military units
There are 1,347 military units described by the material .
Some notable units are :
See US military units in Iraq for the complete list .
I mprovised explosive devices ( IEDs ) hit hard
Half of all equipment purchases have been diverted to dealing with home made mobile phone and radio bombs .
Not since the post war nuclear build up has there been such a decisive shift in US military spending priorities .
The 2007 May - July period , saw 203 US military deaths from Improvised Explosive Devices ( IEDs ) in Iraq and Afghanistan , accounting for 66 percent of all US combat fatalities . [ 6 ]
Those numbers have climbed steadily from the same three - month period in 2004 , when 54 Americans were killed by IEDs , 31 percent of total fatalities .
Since the first recorded IED death in July 2003 , at least 1,509 Americans have been killed in Iraq by makeshift roadside bombs , out of a total 3,707 fatalities .
The daily number of IED attacks has increased six - fold since 2003 , according to the Pentagon .
In response , vast expenditures are being made on advanced technology to prevent , jam , detect , and destroy such devices .
The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization , or JIEDDO was predicted last year to have spent US $ 13,000,000,000 ( 13 billion ) across all theaters , on detectors and robots to defuse bombs , improvements to vehicle armour , training and other means to counter home made weapons .
That sum is comparable , in inflation - adjusted dollars , to what the US spent building the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945 , based on figures compiled by Washington 's Brookings Institution . [ 7 ]
The leak reveals 12,097 “ Warlock ” radio frequency jammers ( US $ 1,100 million for the first 7,530 ) , which prevent radio signals , such as from mobile phones , from triggering explosives . [ 8 ]
If we view IEDs as a rebel investment , to which the US must pay dividends in defensive equipment costs , then every insurgent dollar spent has a return on investment of somewhere around thousand fold .
Significant price gouging by counter - IED defense contractors is evident .
For comparison , each briefcase - sized " Warlock " IED jammer , of which is there is on average more than one per vehicle , is worth $ 150,000 ; however , as can be seen by this analysis , that is more costly than nearly every vehicle it was designed to protect .
The " Warlock " producer , defense contractor EDO Corp , predicts financial year 2007 will see a 400 % total revenue increase over its 2003 levels . [ 9 ]
M ilitary robots
TALON robot and corpse in Iraq .
Over 400 ground robots appear in the leaked database
The leak reveals over 400 US military robots operating in Iraq .
The majority are used for IED ( improvised explosive devices ) work and reconnaissance .
However some robot designs have a lethal capability .
See US Military Equipment in Iraq ( 2007 ) / Robots for the complete list .
D rone ( robot ) aircraft
144 drone aircraft , corresponding to NATO Supply Classification 1550 - Drones
See US Military Equipment in Iraq ( 2007 ) / Drone aircraft for the complete list .
P rotective Armor and Equipment
Another interesting feature is the vast amount of protective armor and equipment supplied .
There are 446,476 items of body armor . [ 10 ]
Using prices from the publicly accessible NSN database , these inserts together come to a total over well over $ 233 million . [ 11 ]
B ulk cash counters
From the invasion of Iraq in April 2003 until June 2004 , the US Army shipped nearly US $ 12,000,000,000 in cash , weighing 363 tonnes , to Baghdad for disbursement to Iraqi ministries and US contractors .
Of this over $ 9,000,000,000 went missing . [ 12 ]
The funds were drawn from the Iraq Development Fund , which had been formed from US seized Iraqi assets .
Using C - 130 planes , the deliveries took place once or twice a month with the biggest of $ 2,401,600,000 on June 22 2004 , six days before the legal handover of the fund to the new Iraqi government . [ 13 ]
The cash payment system has continued as there is no functional Iraqi banking network .
With so much cash flowing into the country it comes as no surprise to find that the US Army has deployed 39 automatic cash counting machines .
See US Military Equipment in Iraq ( 2007 ) / Money counters for the complete list .
O ver a thousand safes for secrets and cash
“ [ S ] ome American contractors correctly believed they could walk off with as much money as they could carry .
The circumstances that surround the handling of comparatively small sums help explain the billions that ultimately vanished .
In the south - central region of Iraq a contracting officer stored $ 2 million in a safe in his bathroom .
One agent kept $ 678,000 in an unsecured footlocker .
„ — Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele , Billions over Baghdad
Safes have played an important role for US Army in Iraq : not only for securing important documents and official funds , but also as a way to hide away largess obtained corruptly from the US federal reserve , via authorities which did not care to introduce even minimal oversight or accounting mechanisms .
The October 2007 edition of Vanity Fair reports on US $ 12,000,000,000 in cash brought into Iraq under the auspices Coalition Provisional Authority , of which $ 9,000,000,000 cannot be accounted for .
Below are listed the types and unit assignments of 1,056 US military safes in Iraq .
See US Military Equipment in Iraq ( 2007 ) / Safes for the complete list .
C ryptographic and communications security equipment
A huge list of US Military secret communications systems corresponding to NATO Supply Classifications 5810 - Communications Security Equipment and Components ( 12,081 items ) and 5811 - Other Cryptologic Equipment and Components ( 2,165 items ) .
See US Military Equipment in Iraq ( 2007 ) / Comsec for the complete list .
C hemical and biological portables
[ 14 ]
A slide used by Colin Powell in his famous Feb 5 2003 pre-war address to the United Nations .
Powell claimed ( falsely ) that Iraq was producing weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) using mobile biological weapons laboratories .
During the lead up to the 2003 Iraq war , the United States famously accused Iraq of possessing portable mobile chemical and biological laboratories .
Post invasion no such facilities were found .
Ironically Iraq now has at least five portable mobile chemical and biological stations — held by the United States Army .
The portables are valued at US $ 622,051 a piece and used for defensive purposes . [ 15 ]
M inimum equipment costs per unit
Item prices were were located for approximately 1/5 registered items , so the following list is a minimum guide only .
Over six thousand million dollars ( US ) is represented in total , however for the reasons just stated this is a substantial underestimate of the total equipment outlay .
See US Military Equipment in Iraq ( 2007 ) / Min cost per unit for the full list .

A nalyzing the Contents of the Leaked Document
The document lists US Army managed equipment in Iraq held by Army , Marines , Air Force and coalition forces , the Iraqi government , and at least one military contractor as of April 2007 .
It does not cover expendables such as munitions , printer cartridges or fuel .
The list itself does not include pricing information , however we were able to obtain pricing information for around 1/5 of the items by cross referencing with information obtained from public US logistics military hardware catalog databases .
This process reveals that there is at least $ 6,601,015,731 worth of US Army managed military equipment in Iraq ( nb. this is a minimum , the real value is likely to be five to fifteen times higher ) [ 16 ]
The list contains codes for military units , item codes , as well as other logistics data .
The most useful of these for investigatory purposes is the NSN , or NATO Stock Number .
Several internet sites allow public searches of the NSN catalog , such as https://www.webflis.dlis.dla.mil/WEBFLIS/ASPscripts/pub_search.aspx[17], which identifies many items on the list and includes prices .
The columns in the spreadsheet are as follows :
UIC , or Unit Identification Code , which is a six - character , alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each Active , Reserve , and National Guard unit of the United States Armed Forces .
Unit Name . [ 18 ]
LIN , or ( supply ) Line Item Number ; [ 19 ]
NSN , NATO Stock Number ; [ 20 ]
Item Name ;
PBIC , or Property Book Identification Code , which categorizes the type of property listed into 10 basic divisions ;
Type , which is listed as either TPE , Theater Provided Equipment , LTT , Long Term Training , or APS , Army Prepositioned Stock ; [ 21 ]
DND , or Do Not Deploy , which is a Yes / No Column ;
OH Qty , or On Hand Quantity , the number of items .
We cannot analyze the document fully : it is a long list .
We encourage informed users and citizens , especially those with military or intelligence experience , to examine it for themselves and submit their findings .

Improve links and information for US war funding legislation and bills .
Include more details on what the various codes in the spreadsheet mean .
Is there a public searchable database for Unit abbreviations or UICs ?
There are specific issues with NSN codes .
NSN codes are a 13 - digit code .
Of those 13 digits , 12 are decimal .
But one of those digits , the seventh , is alphanumeric .
The publicly searchable NSN database seems to be able to locate items if they have a number in the seventh place , but not if there is a letter in the seventh place .
What is the reason for this ?
What does a letter as opposed to a number signify ?
Is there a fuller public database for NSN codes than the one given ?
Are these alphanumeric NSNs , Management Control Numbers as speculated ?

スーパーコンピュータの 「 地球シミュレータ」が2009年3月にもその役目を終えることが本誌の取材で分かった。保有する独立行政法人の海洋研究開発機構は次期機種の選定を10月末から本格化させており、来年春にも入札を実施。09年度中に次期地球シミュレータを稼働させたい考えだ。現在の地球シミュレータは電源が落とされ、引き取り手がなければ廃棄される可能性が高い。
地球シミュレータは登場した02年から04年6月まで、世界で稼働中のスパコン性能をランクするTOP500で首位を保ち、日本のスパコン開発力を世界に知らしめた。しかし、最新のスパコンに比べると、性能当たりの電気代など運用費の負担が大きい。
そこで、海洋研究開発機構は独自開発の地球シミュレータから汎用製品に転換し、コストを抑えて性能向上を図る方針を固めた。現在の地球シミュレータの性能は35.8テラFLOPSでTOP500の世界20位。次期地球シミュレータは倍以上の性能とし、100テラFLOPS程度まで引き上げたい考え。これは現段階では世界2位を狙える値だが、09年の時点ではトップ10位入りも難しいと見られる。
地球シミュレータはNECが開発したベクトル型アーキテクチャのスパコン。このため業界内では、NECが10月25日に発表し来春に出荷するベクトル型スパコンの最新機「SX-9」の採用を有力視する声がある。この点について海洋研究開発機構は「クラスタ構成によってスカラー型の性能も上がってきている。ベクトル型に限定せず、広く仕様の提案を募る考え」としている。
Spencer Ackerman's been taking a look at how American aid gets delivered to Pakistan and it basically amounts to handing over billions of dollars of cash stuffed into garbage bags .
More specifically , " the U.S. gives Musharraf 's government about $ 200 million annually and his military $ 100 million monthly in the form of direct cash transfers . "
That 's basically untraceable , unaccountable money .
Over a billion a year goes direct to the Pakistani military in what CSIS 's Rick Barton characterizes as " a sort of a handshake deal between militaries " in which we " we do n't have a lot of record - keeping . "
Keep that in mind , and then flip back to Joshua Hammer 's recent Pakistan article for The Atlantic :
Ayesha Siddiqa , a well - known analyst in Islamabad and the author of Military Inc. : Inside the Pakistani Military Economy , says that the armed forces are major players in real estate , agribusiness , and several other industries .
The empire includes banks , cable - TV companies , insurance agencies , sugar refineries , private security firms , schools , airlines , cargo services , and textile factories .
The Fauji Foundation , for instance , is a “ welfare trust ” that is run by the defense ministry and spans 15 business enterprises .
It provides cushy jobs for hundreds of retired officers ( many retire in their late 40s ) , pays few taxes , and channels profits into a fund that is intended to benefit retired military personnel .
And it is just one of several giant military - run foundations and companies that were set up decades ago and have grown steadily ever since .
The military ’s intrusion into commerce is quite visible in Islamabad , if you know what to look for .
The logos of the Fauji Foundation and other military - run conglomerates appear on trucks , boxes , and buildings throughout the city .
As Hood­bhoy told me , “ They own gas companies .
They make fertilizer , cement , soap , bottled water .
They even make cereals , so when I have breakfast , I ca n’t get away from them . ”
Basically , this money could be going anywhere for any purpose -- it 's just a kind of giant bribe to Pakistan 's military and political elite ( and in a military dictatorship it's not such a key distinction ) not something that goes to support particular programs .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

In 1992 , I met Francis Fukuyama when he was touring his book The End of History and the Last Man and explaining to anyone who would listen that the world had reached a point where there was no longer any meaningful dispute between Marxism and the market .
More particularly , he said , it looked as though Western liberal democracy was becoming ' the final form of human government ' .
It was such an alluring and hopeful phrase , as though a process of evolution was about to reach its happy conclusion .
The rest would be simply a matter of management and education .
I wonder how he accounts for the state of affairs at the end of the 2007 in which Russia and China appear to be doing rather well without following the example of Western liberal democracy and , indeed , challenge the model with disdain .
The Russians , for instance , rather than becoming more democratically inclined have become less so .
In a recent poll , just 20 per cent of Russians said they favoured democracy and a market economy .
For a vast number of the world 's people , democracy is an aspiration that comes some way after security and prosperity .
The two great powers of the communist era end this year more confident than at any moment since the fall of the Wall .
And what is interesting is that their sense of purpose and defiance is accompanied by doubts in the West about the strength of our economies and uncertainty about the direction of our democracies .
Forget Islam and Islamism : these are the important undercurrents of 2007 .
Within less than a decade or so of the founding of the slightly risible organisation the Project for the New American Century , Time magazine has honoured - even though it says it is not an honour - Putin for making his country ' critical to the 21st century ' .
The dollar has collapsed to hover at 50 p and America 's war in Iraq , which now well exceeds its involvement in the Second World War , has cost $ 600bn , a sum which Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz believes will reach $ 1 trillion .
This is a credit - card war .
Americans will be paying Chinese banks for years after George W Bush has left office .
Even though the current war costs about 1 per cent of America 's annual $ 13,247bn GDP ( Vietnam represented about 9 per cent ) , it is difficult not to see a perfectly plotted story line in this .
America , the only superpower of the moment , is financed by its chief competitor in a prolonged exercise of distraction that absorbs a huge amount of money and much of its policy making and diplomatic energies .
At the same time , the very nature of that distraction weakens US influence all over the world .
While the US frets about surges and troop withdrawal and bringing democracy to people who do not necessarily see its advantages , China extends its influence across the world , increases its defence budget by 17 per cent , fires something called a direct ascent anti-satellite missile to atomise one of its own weather satellites , the implications of which were certainly not missed by the Pentagon , and launches massive computer hacking operations against Western governments and businesses .
There have been some 37,000 attempts to breach American security which emanated from China .
A few years ago , I visited Sudan with a friend .
In our few days there , we encountered just two or three Americans .
Other than the impotent rage about Darfur , there appeared to be no useful American engagement with Khartoum .
The Chinese , on the other hand , were flying planeloads of oil and construction workers into the country , building Chinese hotels that would be exclusively serviced by Chinese staff .
Nothing seemed to represent the rise of one influence and the decline of another .
If you want a further example , it is the acquiescence of the fifth most valuable company in America , Google , to Chinese censorship .
The project for the new Chinese century has been well underway for some time and it is striking how intelligent the Chinese have been , extending their influence while rarely indulging in the big swinging dick diplomacy which can so easily sidetrack a government .
That is not true of Russia , which over the last year has opted to challenge the West at practically every turn , whether by planting a flag on the seabed beneath the Arctic icecap , testing the massive ordnance air blast bomb with all the joy of kids letting off fireworks in the park or disputing the siting of US early - warning defence systems in eastern Europe .
All this goes down very well at home , where people are beginning to feel the benefits of a GDP which is three times what it was in the 2002 .
Oil prices account for most of the rise , but there is a growing middle class with more money to spend and a sense of renewed national pride .
Putin has done little to update the infrastructure of his country , but Russians see that the modest improvements in the standard of living have been achieved at the same time as their President was moving against a free press and political opposition .
The phrase used by the Kremlin is ' sovereign democracy ' , which makes a nationalist virtue of the decline of civil society and the rule of law , presenting both as an unwholesome foreign influence .
So much for Fukuyama 's ' final form of human government ' .
Putin openly denies America 's right to claim moral superiority or to know the secret of how governments should act in the 21st century .
People who lecture Russians about democracy and the rule of law are told by Putin that ' they do not want to learn the lessons themselves ' .
It is a bully 's argument , but he can at least demonstrate that the West 's record is not perfect in this regard .
Guantanamo , the Patriot Act and the general attack on constitutional rights in America and Britain do not help our case .
A recent poll published in the International Herald Tribune showed that a majority of Americans believed that their country is a threat to world peace and a similar proportion say that America is weaker today than at the start of the Bush administration .
These are the great challenges that face the individual who will succeed Bush this time next year .
America is still vastly more powerful and wealthy than any other nation on earth .
With just one - fifth of China 's workforce , America 's GDP is nearly five times that of China's .
Whatever the economic crisis of the year ahead , that relationship is not going to change overnight .
The new President will need to go on a charm offensive that must begin before he or she is even elected .
America has to find a way of speaking more quietly while still carrying that big stick and if it is going to persuade the new middle classes of China and Russia that it has a moral leadership to offer the 21st century , it must adhere to the democratic values that it wishes to seed elsewhere and lead rather than follow on climate change .
To sound a note of optimism at the end of this rather scratchy , chaotic year , there are definite signs that opinion in both these areas is on the move among Americans .

CNN profiles anti-gay minister 's conversion to preaching tolerance
Reverend Dennis Meredith used to condemn homosexuality in his sermons , reports CNN's Dan Lothian in a video from CNN's Sunday morning broadcast , but had a change of heart due to a family secret .
Nothing is understated about Reverend Meredith of Tabernacle Baptist Church in Atlanta : not the bright yellow Harley he drives to work , not the music , and definitely not his message .
" If you can come down the aisle , holding your partners hand ,  Rev. Meredith yells into a microphone as he pulls a church - goer to his feet ,  I m happy for you . 
Rev. Meredith says the majority of his congregation is made up of gays and lesbians  about 85 percent .
He preaches about tolerance in nearly every sermon , and believes if the Lord has set you free , you ought to be free indeed . "
The Reverend has come full circle : he used to condemn homosexuality from the same pulpit .
" I was put in touch with the feelings of the pew ,  he says .
But theres another reason for Rev. Merediths change of heart : his son , Michael Meredith .
Michael came out to his family on his 21st birthday .
His mother was disturbed , but his father had a change of heart ,  and vowed to put as much energy into embracing homosexuality as he had in denouncing it .
Rev. Meredith has lost money , church members , and speaking engagement offers due to his turnaround .
" I did not want to follow in the way of a man who may lead to destruction ,  Demarcus Hill , a former member of Tabernacle Baptist Church , told CNN .
The Reverend used to recieve offers to speak all around the country .
 I dont get those invitations no more ,  he says with a smile .
Although Rev. Merediths alternative style faces opposition , the Tabernacle Church has become filled with new faces that would be unwelcome elsewhere .
Michael Meredith acts as the churchs music director .
Taylor Meredith , the Reverends other son , is also involved in the church .
 It s about appreciating diversity and all the differences in the world ,  says Taylor .
Yes , yes , yes !!!
This may make some people sick , but I think it 's the most exciting thing Tiny Head Hewitt has ever done !
Now if she 'd just stay in the ocean forever , we 'd all be happy .
Mr Gaubert said he suffered severe post - traumatic stress
Nicholas Gaubert has described how the incident happened in July 2005 , just a week before the fatal shooting of Brazilian man Jean Charles de Menezes .
Mr Gaubert , 34 , said he was suffering severe post - traumatic stress as a result of the shooting .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) is investigating .
Mr Gaubert , who lives in Leeds , said he had now decided to speak out after the Crown Prosecution Service ruled no officers involved should be charged with any criminal offences .
The IPCC is still considering whether any disciplinary matters will be brought against the officers .
Armed police deployed
Mr Gaubert said he was on his way to meet friends when he suffered a fit on the bus and slipped into a coma which left him slumped on his seat clutching his rucksack .
Armed police were called to the bus depot in Headingley and when he failed to respond to their challenges he was shot with the Taser .
He said as this was happening , another officer was pointing a real gun at his head .
He was restrained and eventually came round in the police van .
He said it was only then that the officers realised it was a medical emergency , despite him wearing a medical tag round his neck to warn of his condition , and took him to hospital .
Mr Gaubert said he was told the police believed he looked " Egyptian " .
He is completely traumatised by this - he is living with it every day
Solicitor Ifti Manzoor
Mr Gaubert 's solicitor Ifti Manzoor said the incident had clear parallels with the shooting of Mr Menezes at Stockwell tube station and showed there was evidence of a breakdown in communication between the police on the ground and their commanders .
Mr Gaubert said : " When I heard about that Brazilian man in London I just thought , 'oh no , that could have been me ' . "
Mr Manzoor added : " The evidence is there was an order that officers be deployed and contain the scene .
This direct order seems to have been ignored .
" I really appreciate that under the circumstances and at that time the police had an enormously difficult job .
" But Mr Gaubert was alone in a bus depot .
" He is completely traumatised by this .
He is living with it every day . "
' Potential security threat '
A statement from the IPCC said : " The IPCC managed an investigation into an incident on 13 July 2005 in which West Yorkshire Police discharged a Taser at a man while he sat on a bus in Leeds .
" The man was mistakenly treated as a potential security threat when he was , in fact , in a hypoglycaemic state .
The investigation report was submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) in November 2006 .
" The CPS returned its initial decision in February 2007 stating that no officers should be charged with any criminal offences .
" Consideration was then given by the CPS as to whether any offences had been committed under health and safety law .
" A decision was received recently to advise that no charges would be brought under this legislation .
" The IPCC must determine whether any disciplinary matters need to be considered against the officers involved .
" Initial recommendations regarding discipline put forward by the police forces involved have not been agreed by the IPCC and discussions are ongoing . "
West Yorkshire Police said the matter was in the hands of the IPCC .
When Giuliani ’s tenure as mayor ended , he left behind a city that was grateful , and more than a little relieved to see him go .
PHILIP BURKE
Correction appended .
The South Carolina State House , a grand , copper - domed structure in downtown Columbia , is a showplace for the state ’s long history of hellbent defiance .
The most prominent feature on the grounds is a monument to fallen Confederate soldiers , whose virtues “ plead for just judgment of the cause in which they perished . ”
Beside it , atop a thirty - foot pole , waves the Rebel flag , the object of fierce national debate a decade ago , when it flew above the capitol dome , and no less conspicuous now , in its new location .
Among the nearby statuary stands a life - size likeness of Benjamin R. ( Pitchfork Ben ) Tillman , the four - term United States senator who led the movement that disenfranchised black voters in 1895 and instituted Jim Crow .
Inside the building , cast - iron staircases rise to an elegant lobby , and portraits honor the men who shaped the state ’s querulous history , including John C. Calhoun , who contrived the rationale — nullification — for Southern secession , and Strom Thurmond , who led the South out of the Democratic Party .
The lobby opens at either end to the state ’s two legislative chambers , which , in March , ratified an amendment to the state constitution that bans not only gay marriage but gay civil unions .
That month , the state house of representatives also passed a bill requiring any woman considering abortion to reflect upon an ultrasound image of the fetus .
It was here that Rudolph Giuliani , New York ’s thrice - married , anti-gun , pro-gay , pro-choice former mayor , found himself one morning in April , in what appeared to be a critical moment in his young campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination .
The previous day , during a campaign stop in Florida , he was asked by CNN ’s Dana Bash if he supported the public funding of abortions .
Giuliani seemed flustered by the question and finally answered , “ If that ’s the status of the law , I would , yes . ”
Even before Giuliani began his run for the Presidency , the consensus , sounded in news columns , blogs , and political journals , was that he could not survive scrutiny of his political heterodoxy and his personal imperfections by the Republican Party ’s conservative base .
Now , as Giuliani made his way into the capitol , his candidate smile firmly fixed , he was met by reporters .
“ Mayor , you talk about being a straight shooter , ” one said .
“ Is this position you have on abortion something that ’s going to shoot a hole in a key Republican plank ? ”
Giuliani said he was comfortable with the fact that some voters would never agree with him , a point he chose to illustrate by telling a story about New York .
When he was a novice political candidate , he said , the late Louis Lefkowitz , the longest - serving attorney general in New York history , had taught him the basics of retail campaigning on the streets of the city .
“ I ’m walking along the street , shaking hands , ” Giuliani recounted , “ and this guy started questioning me about some position or other , and he was opposed to me on this position .
And I spent twenty minutes trying to convince him .
And at some point Louie put his arm around me , and he said ” — here Giuliani ’s voice assumed a gravelly , mock - Lower East Side timbre — “
‘ Hey , kid , you ’re not gonna get this guy ’s vote . ’ ” Giuliani chuckled at his story .
The consensus seemed validated — this was a man wholly out of place in the Republican South .
“ He ’s toast , ” the Clemson University political scientist Dave Woodard told the Associated Press that day .
When Giuliani left Columbia , he travelled to Charleston , where a group of prosperous - looking potential donors and political insiders were waiting to see him .
A closed - door meeting , in a private room at a restaurant called Magnolia ’s , was scheduled for 1 P.M.
But at that moment Giuliani ’s caravan , including the candidate , in a black S.U.V. , and his security team and campaign staff , was creeping through traffic in the busy Market Center of the old city , several blocks away .
It was a warm , bright day , and the streets were jammed .
Giuliani asked his driver to stop .
He got out and started walking toward the restaurant .
He was immediately mobbed .
“ Give her a run for her money , Mayor ! ” one woman screamed , feeling no need to mention Hillary Clinton by name .
A tourist carriage rolled by , and the driver shouted , “ Hey , Mayor !
I ’ve got three votes for you right here ! ”
Giuliani — wearing his signature dark suit , white dress shirt , and tie — signed autographs , posed for pictures , and even knelt on the sidewalk to be photographed with a dog .
“ That ’s our next President , right there , ” said Chris Workman , a Myrtle Beach firefighter and former McCain supporter , who had chatted with Giuliani with a dip of snuff bulging from his lip .
At Magnolia ’s , Giuliani ’s advance people tried to fill time .
Barry Wynn , his South Carolina campaign chairman , talked up his candidate ’s chances , solicited donations , and took questions from the waiting group seated before him .
Someone asked what effect the Christian right would have on Giuliani ’s prospects .
“ Good question , ” Wynn replied .
He lives in the Greenville - Spartanburg area , the home of Bob Jones University .
In South Carolina , another way of saying Christian right is “ Greenville Republicans , ” the group credited with John McCain ’s undoing in his 2000 run against George W. Bush .
Wynn ’s uncle was Lester Maddox , the axe - handle - wielding Atlanta segregationist who became governor of Georgia .
Wynn himself is a former state Party chairman .
“ I ’ve already talked to a lot of people I consider very hard - core social conservatives , part of the religious right , who are supporting Rudy Giuliani , ” Wynn said .
“ I think this idea that someone just blows a whistle and all of a sudden people go heading off in one direction — it does n’t happen that way .
It ’s a little bit of a myth that ’s created by the press . ”
Giuliani finally arrived , and after a few remarks he asked for questions from the gathering .
When the subject of public funding of abortion came up , Giuliani did not invoke Louis Lefkowitz .
He said he knew that many people would disagree with his position on abortion and other social issues .
“ But what I ask them to do if they disagree is to take a look at my whole record and see if , in the context of my whole record , I still would n’t be the best person to lead the country right now , given the threat we have from terrorism . ”
Here he paused and added , “ And , I think , given the threat we have from Democrats . ”
The audience laughed .
Giuliani went on , “ Which is not the same thing . ”
The audience laughed again .
“ The Democrats will lead us to more socialism - type solutions to our problems . ”
Among those smiling appreciatively at Giuliani ’s remarks was retired Rear Admiral William L. Schachte , seated several rows back .
Schachte gained notoriety in 2004 as a key figure in the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against John Kerry .
Schachte had been Kerry ’s commanding officer in Vietnam and , in August , 2004 , declared that he was on Kerry ’s boat the night Kerry saw combat action that brought him his first Purple Heart .
Schachte asserted that Kerry had not encountered enemy fire that night .
( Kerry and two of the men who served with him have said that Schachte was n’t on the boat . )
Schachte , a native of Charleston , is a Catholic who describes himself as “ a devout Christian . ”
He has contributed twenty - three hundred dollars to Giuliani , the maximum amount allowed for an individual donor .
I asked him what attracted him to Giuliani ’s candidacy .
“ I was in New York before Rudy , after Rudy , and during Rudy , ” he said .
“ And that was the tale of the tape . ”
Schachte said that he had been lastingly impressed by Giuliani ’s governance of the city in the face of a political and media culture that was pointedly unsympathetic .
He especially admired the way that Giuliani stood up to hostile reporters at his daily press conferences .
“ He ’s tough , ” Schachte said .
Giuliani filed papers to form a Presidential exploratory committee last November 10th , three days after the voter rebuke of Republicans that narrowly placed both houses of Congress under Democratic control .
The election seemed a warrant for a candidacy such as Giuliani ’s , with its promise of reaching beyond the Republican base ; but that promise also contained Giuliani ’s greatest peril .
He could not be nominated without the base , which holds media - certified moderates like McCain and Senator Chuck Hagel , of Nebraska , in contempt .
McCain had been admired in Washington for his ability to find consensus with Democrats , but that was his undoing with the talk - radio wing of the Republican Party .
Giuliani ’s challenge was to convince Republicans that his social positions should not be held against him any more than the color of his eyes — he was from New York , he could n’t help it .
Giuliani had to demonstrate that he was one of them , and that their enemies were his enemies , too .
The base was willing to be convinced .
Giuliani has led the Republican field in the national polls from the start , partly because of his September 11th celebrity but also because of his September 10th celebrity .
The common refrain among New Yorkers is that although Giuliani showed leadership on the day of the terrorist attacks , in the preceding months he had been a spent and isolated lame duck , his viability sapped by churlishness and the spectacle of his unattractive personal dramas .
But to many in the heartland Giuliani was heroic for what he did in New York before September 11th : his policy prescriptions and , mostly , his taming of the city ’s liberal political culture — his famous crackdown on squeegee - men panhandlers , his workfare program , his attacks on controversial museum exhibits ( “ The idea of . . . so - called works of art in which people are throwing elephant dung at a picture of the Virgin Mary is sick ! ” ) , and the like .
Speaking before the Alabama legislature this spring , he received a standing ovation , and Governor Bob Riley told him , “ One of these days , you have to tell me how you really cleaned up New York . ”
To conservatives , pre-Giuliani New York was a study in failed liberalism , a city that had surrendered to moral and physical decay , crime , racial hucksterism , and ruinous economic pathologies .
Perhaps the most common words that Giuliani heard when he travelled around the country this spring were epithets aimed at his city ( “ a crime - infested cesspool , ” one Southern politician declared ) , offered without fear of giving offense .
Giuliani cheerfully agreed .
Giuliani ’s Presidential candidacy made its début in early March , at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference , in Washington .
The event is a gathering of feverish ideologues , eager for a battle cry , such as that provided by the speaker preceding Giuliani , Wayne LaPierre , of the National Rifle Association , who urged the audience to throw “ a new Boston Tea Party . ”
When George Will introduced Giuliani , he described him as a Margaret Thatcher conservative and someone “ for whom pugnacity is a political philosophy . ”
The audience greeted Giuliani enthusiastically , but what happened next was puzzling .
Giuliani addressed the crowd like a man who had n’t expected to be called on — or , worse , like a man who felt that he ’d done his part by showing up .
He paid homage to Ronald Reagan , then spoke disjointedly about his record in New York , the war on terror , and “ the second most important thing that I ’m worried about ” — education .
It was thin stuff for this crowd , as Will later groused .
“ Rudy Giuliani came in and informally meandered a bit , ” he said on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
“ And a lot of the energy seeped out of the room . ”
Over the next several weeks , Giuliani campaigned as though he had n’t yet made the distinction between celebrity and candidacy .
After leaving office , in 2002 , he started a consulting firm , Giuliani Partners , and embarked on a series of highly lucrative lecture tours , commanding the transportation ( Gulfstream IV ) , the accommodation ( a two - bedroom suite , plus four rooms for his entourage ) , and the remuneration ( up to a hundred thousand dollars per appearance ) accorded only to the highest tier .
Now he seemed bemused by questions that he should have easily anticipated , and his answers made him seem glib , or uninformed .
When , on a campaign trip to Florida , he was asked whether he supported the controversial 2005 intervention in the Terri Schiavo case by the President and Congress ( then controlled by Republicans ) , Giuliani could n’t quite say .
“ I believe I did , ” he responded .
“ I do n’t , I — it ’s a while ago and I think I said that I thought every effort should be made to keep her alive .
I do n’t know that I supported the whole thing to the very end , but I am not sure now . ”
This Rudy Giuliani , with his new wealth , his new wife , and his new , natural haircut ( replacing the familiar comb- over ) , seemed plainly unready for the mission he had undertaken .
At the first Republican debate , held in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library , in California , with Nancy Reagan in the audience , the ten Republican candidates were asked whether it would be “ a good day for Americans ” when Roe v. Wade was overturned .
All the respondents answered that it would , except Giuliani , who said , “ It would be O.K . ”
He said that it would “ be O.K. also if a strict - constructionist judge viewed it as precedent . ”
It was a disastrous performance , and failed to placate critics on the right who had been voicing their disappointment in the candidate for several weeks .
“ There is an embarrassing ad - hoc - ness , a bush - leagueness to this , ” the columnist and former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan remarked in the Wall Street Journal .
“ It ’s as if he has n’t thought it through , as if he ’s just deciding everything each day .
But by the time you ’re running for president you should have decided . ”
Those most dismayed were Giuliani ’s advocates in the press , who knew that he was failing to make his case to conservatives .
In a remarkable put - down , John Podhoretz , a conservative New York Post columnist who had touted Giuliani as the one Presidential candidate who could stop Hillary Clinton , addressed him in an “ open letter ’’ that questioned his competence .
He wrote that “ something strange ” was going on , and warned , “ If you keep winging it this way , you ’re going to fly off a cliff . ”
Giuliani ’s supporters longed for the old Rudy , who could marshal the facts , vanquish his foes , and then , for good measure , berate the “ jerks . ”
That was a moderate the movement could love .
****
Over the years , Giuliani has often spoken of his childhood in Brooklyn , giving special place to a story about the discordance of growing up a Yankees fan in the shadow of Ebbets Field .
His father , Harold , a Yankees partisan from East Harlem , once dressed young Rudy in Yankee pinstripes and sent him out to play in the Dodger - mad streets of Brooklyn .
Too young to have any say in the matter , Rudy was set upon by the neighborhood toughs , Dodger fans all .
A gang of boys seized him , placed a noose around his neck , and threatened to lynch him .
( His grandmother intervened . )
In one recounting , to John Tierney , of the Times , a dozen years ago , Giuliani said that the incident was his proudest moment , because he refused to renounce his team .
“ I kept telling them : ‘ I am a Yankee fan .
I am a Yankee fan .
I ’m gonna stay a Yankee fan , ’ ” he recounted .
“ To me it was like being a martyr : I ’m not gonna give up my religion .
You ’re not gonna change me . ”
Giuliani has said that the experience reveals much about his character : he is , by his account , the stalwart , the lone defender of the cause , even unto martyrdom .
At the time that Giuliani spoke with Tierney , he was midway through his first term as mayor , having already achieved a lot , and having already earned the headline “ THE HOLY TERROR . ”
Whatever lesson Harold Giuliani meant to impart to his son , he certainly provided him with a motif for the narrative of his public life .
Harold Giuliani died , of prostate cancer , in 1981 , but he continued to assert a commanding presence in his son ’s life .
Both he and his wife , Helen , were children of Italians who came to America in the great migration wave of the early twentieth century .
Rudolph William Louis Giuliani , born in 1944 , was brought up within a tight family circle filled with uncles who wore the uniforms of the police and fire departments .
Rudy idolized his father , a thick , bespectacled former boxer who managed a tavern on Kingston Avenue , in Flatbush .
In his eyes , Harold was a model of strength and courage , uneducated but gifted with a native wisdom .
Even now , Giuliani routinely quotes his father about the value of work or the nature of courage , or recites how his father ’s words helped him through the crisis of September 11th .
Harold wanted his son to be tough , but he also insisted that he be honest , and he harped on the issue so relentlessly — never cheat another man , never steal , never try to bend the law — that Rudy sometimes thought he was overdoing it .
He sensed , rightly , that there was some hidden part of his father ’s life that might explain it .
Harold had dropped out of school at fifteen , worked briefly as a plumber ’s helper , and hung out on the streets , where his violent temper earned him the reputation of a brawler .
Harold was arrested for burglary and sentenced to probation by the Children ’s Court , and in 1934 , at the height of the Depression , he and an accomplice set upon a Borden ’s milkman as he was making a morning collection call , robbing him , at gunpoint , of $ 128.82 .
The accomplice escaped , but Harold was captured at the scene .
He was convicted of third - degree burglary and entered Sing Sing Prison , as inmate No. 89183 .
Harold Giuliani was paroled after serving nearly sixteen months , and he remained a parolee for the first two years of his marriage .
His conviction disqualified him for the draft , and he went to work with his brother - in - law Leo D’Avanzo , who had just bought the tavern on Kingston Avenue .
D’Avanzo was a hoodlum with Mob connections , and his establishment was a front for various rackets .
Harold , who tended bar , doubled as his enforcer .
But , as Rudy reached school age , Harold began to consider making a break from Brooklyn and his criminal associations there .
It was the early nineteen - fifties , an era when families by the thousand availed themselves of Robert Moses ’s vast complex of bridges , tunnels , and wide new highways to escape to the suburbs of Long Island and Westchester .
In 1951 , when Rudy was seven , Harold moved the family to the Long Island town of Garden City South , settling in a neighborhood of neat new houses , near a new Catholic grade school that had been built to accommodate the city exodus .
Rudy returned to Brooklyn in high school as a scholarship day student at Bishop Loughlin Memorial High , commuting daily on the Long Island Rail Road .
Giant Risk
Some things just have to be done because they are cool .
In World War 2 , there was the Battle of Britain Ops room at Uxbridge .
Note the map .

To run a real war you need :
A map large enough to cover a large table
Models to represents the troops .
Sticks to shove the pieces around .
A large quantity of whisky or brandy for the generals to sip
optionally - big fat cigars
Giant Risk
Equipment required
A table , the larger the better .
In this cast 4 ' 6 " by 3 ' .
A piece of fabric large enough to cover the table .
Three hours to paint a map of the world on it split into the traditional risk countries .
A piece of perspex large enough to cover the table to protect the board , and give a smooth surface for pushing the troops around .
Six hundred small plastic army pieces .
Spray on undercoat , six different acrylic colours for the top coat and around six hours to paint all the pieces .
Two croupiers sticks configured to push and pull troops .
( thanks to Matt and Zoe for finding these )
The game risk for the cards
A roast duck to eat before you start , three bottles of wine , one bottle of strange wheat beer , a large selection of different whiskies and some crazy luminous bacardi stuff .
Six hours with Zoe , Matt , Susan and me to wage war .
Vangelis ' soundtrack to 1492 because it 's great invading music .
The size difference between this and traditional Risk .
War
The game begins , Pete ( blue ) , Susan ( purple ) , Matt ( green ) and Zoe ( red ) .
Australia falls to Pete( blue ) in the first round .
The state of play after each player has had a turn , Susan ( purple ) has taken and held North and South America on her first go !
Matt ( green ) decides that attempting to hold Asia as a first continent is a losing strategy and commits his troops to conquering Australia , which he succeeds at .
After a shock defeat across the atlantic from Susan ( purple ) , Zoe retakes North Africa in a no nonsense fashion .
The africans invade Afghanistan from the Middle East only to discover the defending troops were expecting trouble from Europe .
In a shock feat of Naval engineering the North Africans boat a small army across the Atlantic and completely fail to conquer Brazil .
After having lost some of the fringes of America to the blue democrats , the crazy gun-toting purple necks exercise their right to the second amendment .
Four hours in , it 's looking like a fight between Matt ( green ) and Susan ( purple ) .
Some goes later Matt goes for broke and mounts a huge invasion of Africa ...
... handily eradicating all of Zoe 's red troops , he uses his remaining forces to finish off Pete 's blue ones .
This nets him a total of ten cards in his hand .
Susan mounts a peace keeping force across the atlantic to quell the African uprising ...
... but due to severe lack of knowledge about world geography outside America ends up conquering Australia instead .
Matt ( green ) , does a triple cash in for a bonus 30 troops , added to his twenty anyway and runs out of pieces , choosing to borrow Zoe's .
Deploying everything into Scandanvia he looks at Iceland .
Institutionalised racism immediately develops in his army and operation ' Get behind the Darkies ' ensues .
The view from Iceland .
Where are they going to stand ?
A quick trip through the whole of North America , South America , Africa and South - east Asia later , and the fourth conquest of Australia begins , to win the game .
If you can draw , you might end up with the much more beautiful and much larger version of Giant Risk done here .
Someone has to buy them both the croupier sticks and a dustpan and brush for the dead pieces though .
