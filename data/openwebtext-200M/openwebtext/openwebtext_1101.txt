The prices we will be able to charge for on demand PPV for the great majority of TV programmes are likely to be much lower than the level at which PPV has been tried in the past .
Traditionally , PPV has been used mostly for premium events at relatively high price points .
This pricing strategy is unlikely to be successful for the vast majority of on demand programming :
i . The take - up rates for non-event PPV at price levels of £ 1.00 or above are small ;
ii .
In the broadband environment we will be competing in an international marketplace against material provided free to view , so price barriers must be low .
21 . However , prices do not have to be more than a few pence / programme to make a significant contribution to programme economics .
As Figure 6 shows ( below ) , average revenue / viewer hour for the commercial terrestrial channels is only around 10 p .
Even programmes with the audiences most attractive to advertisers generate only a maximum of around 20p .
The Chief Executive of FremantleMedia , Tony Cohen , has received new support from one of ITV's Strategy Directors , Carolyn Fairbairn , with regards to charging consumers micropayments of around 5 p to view individual TV shows online ( e.g. viaVideo on Demand [ VoD ] service ) .
However the micropayment idea itself is nothing new and was raised way back in March 2009 by FremantleMedia 's submission to Lord Carter 's Digital Britain report .
Today 's latest comments claim that people would be willing to pay anything from 5 p right up to £ 2 for individual shows , although FremantleMedia 's actual research hints at a top price of £ 1.
FremantleMedia 's original submission suggested that , when mixed in with advertising , a price point of just 5 p per programme could be enough to compensate for any medium term reductions in advertising revenue .
It also found that up to 49 % would be willing to pay that amount to view drama or entertainment shows .
By comparison the £ 2 figure received support from only 6 % , £ 1 got up to 25 % , 50 p got up to 38 % , 20 p got up to 43 % and 10 p received approval by 46 % .
Presently most on demand viewing is available at no charge and offered as an extra service , albeit somewhat license fee funded in the case of the BBC's iPlayer service .
This does rather raise the question of whether anybody would want to watch a show online via a micropayment system and yet still be forced to pay the license fee at the same time .
Some broadband ISP users are also charged for what they consume , thus using the Internet to watch all your TV could quickly become an expensive endeavour .. at least until bandwidth charges get cheaper .
If u r texting / online lots , u may need > insurance .
Active contributors to blogs or social - networking sites like MySpace , Facebook or Twitter value the freedom of expression those channels provide .
But many users could benefit from a word of warning :
Do n't set yourself up for a lawsuit .
Loose lips used to sink ships well before the age of computers , but now the potential for damage is so much greater .
" These types of exposures are n't new , but social media has created new venues , " said Peter Spicer , a personal - risk specialist at the Chubb Group of Insurance Cos .
In the past , he noted , a person with a gripe would write a damning letter to a newspaper editor , who might edit out the hazardous material or ignore the message altogether .
But today , anyone can post anything at any time about anyone - and some of that stuff could come back to bite the sender .
" ( Messages ) now become part of the permanent record of the Internet and can be viewed instantly by billions of people around the world , " Spicer noted .
Hence the wisdom of checking your insurance policy to see if you have protection - and adding coverage if you need more .
Internet defamation lawsuits are a rising peril as more people go online .
" The number ( of cases ) is going up each year and will continue to increase , " said Sandra Baron , executive director of the Media Law Resource Center in New York .
In one high - profile case filed in March , Dawn Simorangkir charged musician Courtney Love with libel , invasion of privacy and more after Love posted unflattering comments about the fashion designer in the wake of a business deal that soured .
Eric Robinson , an attorney at the Media Law Resource Center , analyzed 256 recent cases against bloggers who posted contentious material , including some using MySpace , Facebook and Twitter .
His research revealed :
� Common complaints involve allegations of criminal or inappropriate behavior as well as gripes against people , businesses or other entities .
Other reasons for filing lawsuits include posting of private information or false profiles about someone else .
� Businesses bring many of the lawsuits .
So do public officials , judges and educators .
� Libel , or defamation in written form , is a common blog lawsuit issue .
So are copyright infringement , harassment / stalking , invasion of privacy and trademark issues .
� While many lawsuits get dismissed or withdrawn , some have resulted in restraining orders , the removal of contentious material , settlements and , in a few cases , damages .
" Thus far , plaintiffs do not have a strong record of success , " wrote Robinson in the report .
Even so , the time , stress and cost of defending a suit should give bloggers reason for pause .
Insurance can help fund legal defenses and pay monetary awards or settlements .
But not all types of insurance do the trick .
Standard homeowners policies do n't provide coverage for libel or its spoken equivalent , slander , Spicer said .
For that , you typically need to add coverage with an endorsement or rider .
You also can get this coverage , along with higher dollar amounts of protection generally , with an umbrella policy .
The added cost can be as little as a few more dollars a month , depending on the amount of coverage .
People who run revenue - generating blog sites might need enhanced defamation protection with a commercial policy , which also typically covers invasion of privacy , plagiarism and copyright / trademark breaches .
These policies also are more costly .
Besides Chubb , other insurers offering business protection include Argo Insurance , First Media and One Beacon Insurance .
Many carriers that offer homeowners insurance also sell riders or umbrella policies .
" Bloggers often start out as hobbyists but sometimes wind up making a living from it , " Spicer said .
" If you make money from a blog , you might not have adequate protection under a homeowners or umbrella policy . "
While insurance is helpful and might be imperative , the first line of defense is common sense .
" If you do n't know something is factual and you 're speaking about an entity or individual , even if you 're repeating it , then do n't say it , " Spicer said .
People posting anonymous comments also should be careful , Baron said , because the plaintiff in a lawsuit could ask the court to subpoena records revealing the person 's identity .
She recommends insurance and suggests bloggers spend some time learning the basics about libel , privacy , copyrights and trademarks .
" Many of the people who post online have a sense that the Internet is a law - free zone , more of a conversation , " she said .
But as the rising number of lawsuits attests , conversations can get expensive .

An annex to my writing elsewhere .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration proposed on Monday to raise nearly $ 60 billion by closing loopholes including those related to the estate tax , and also revived a bid to cap deductions wealthy individuals can claim .
Funds raised from the estate tax and other changes would go to beef up a healthcare reserve fund , a $ 634 billion pot of money President Barack Obama wants to use to revamp the healthcare system and expand insurance to tens of millions of Americans who lack it .
The proposals “ take on what we believe are a series of unjustifiable loopholes , unjustifiable tax breaks that we simply can not afford , ” said a senior administration official , who could not be identified under the ground rules of a briefing for reporters .
The White House wants to raise $ 24 billion over 10 years by tightening rules for the estate tax , a levy on the portion of inheritance that exceeds an amount excluded by law .
Currently , the first $ 3.5 million of an individual ’s inheritance and $ 7 million of a couple ’s inheritance are exempted .
The Obama administration would change how assets are valued .
Lawmakers are likely to tackle the estate tax issue this year to avoid confusing changes over the next few years .
The tax - cut package enacted under President George W. Bush provides for the estate tax to be repealed for fiscal year 2010 -- October 1 , 2009 to September 30 , 2010 .
If Congress fails to act , estate taxes in fiscal 2011 would revert back to levels that existed before Bush took office .
The exemption would fall to $ 1 million and the top rate would move back to 55 percent from the current top rate of 45 percent .
Republicans , who over the last several years unsuccessfully sought a permanent repeal of estate taxes , are likely to push the Democratic - controlled Congress to accept a higher exemption level and a lower rate , proposals strongly supported by small - business owners and farmers .
The administration official said the proposal would impact less than three - tenths of one percent of all estates .
The proposals need to go through Congress , where their fate is far from clear , and will face fierce lobbying by the business community .
HIGH POWERED OPPOSITION EXPECTED
The Obama administration also revived a proposal to cap itemized deductions at no more than 28 percent of income for taxpayers in the top two tax brackets .
Officials recalculated the revenue that would raise , about $ 267 billion , down from an earlier $ 320 billion forecast .
The official acknowledged opposition among lawmakers but said Congress is going to need to find money from somewhere for its ambitious agenda and to impose fiscal discipline .
The official said they expect “ high powered opposition ” to many of the ideas , most notably those boosting international tax enforcement .
Among the tax changes included in the $ 60 billion sought to raise money for the health care fund is one that would deny deduction of punitive damages paid by companies , and another that would repeal preferential tax treatment for commodities dealers and day traders .
Several proposals long opposed by the business community are in the package , including one that tightens a limitation on deducting interest and the punitive damage deduction change .
“ We ’re seeing a lot more detail on the U.S. international tax proposal , ” said Caroline Harris , tax attorney for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which was still dissecting the report on Monday .
“ We ’re seeing a lot more in terms of information reporting , and I noticed they snuck in denying a deduction for punitive damages , ” Harris said .
She calls the changes attacks on “ legitimate things in the ( tax ) code . ”
Another proposal would limit credits the paper industry can claim for a long - held practice using a fuel derived from the processing of paper and pulp .
The details follow a general description of changes the administration unveiled last week , said to raise $ 210 billion over a decade , to tighten rules related to overseas investments .
“ They have now sort of rounded up everything by the kitchen sink in terms of revenue raisers , ” said Clint Stretch , managing principal of tax policy at Deloitte Tax in Washington .
Stretch said the breadth of the proposals may gird the stance of those who want the entire tax system reviewed , instead of taking a piecemeal approach .
An earlier Democratic effort to make similar changes more palatable included trimming the top corporate marginal tax rate , now high among developed nations at 35 percent .

ABOARD THE CCGS LOUIS S. ST - LAURENT–Without a microscope , most plankton are easy to miss .
And when the tiny marine creatures do come into focus , they are n't much to look at .
Until you peer closer , and listen to what they have to say .
Way down near the bottom of the oceans ' food chain , animals known as zooplankton drift on the currents , feeding on each other , eating still lower life forms such as bacteria and viruses , or in most cases , grazing on microscopic plant life , called phytoplankton .
As tiny , and as hard to love , as plankton are , scientists studying them say that if global warming makes things go bad for these organisms , the pain will run all the way up the food chain to humans .
" So in one way , the plankton are a type of canary in a coal mine , " says John Nelson , a Department of Fisheries and Oceans scientist examining plankton at the Institute of Ocean Sciences in Sidney , B.C. " They will be affected by , and respond to , environmental change and we can detect this by studying them . "
At first glance , zooplankton seem more likely to model for horror movie special effects than a " Save the World " poster .
The Arrow worm , known as the tiger of the zooplankton , is shaped like a torpedo .
Its minuscule head has a halo of spines that the creature uses to swallow its prey whole .
Copepods , usually less than 8 millimetres long , are parasites with long antenna and a pair of leg - like limbs that the animal uses to push its hard - shelled body through the water in quick , jerking bursts of speed .
Fish larvae love to eat them .
Other species of zooplankton look like microscopic shrimps , or jellyfish with sticky tentacles to trap food and cram it into their mouths .
Some glow green – bright green – when bothered .
Kelly Young , 28 , is a seagoing technician collecting millions of plankton in sample jars for study later in Nelson 's lab , as CCGS Louis S. St - Laurent , pride of Canada 's icebreaker fleet , steams through the Northwest Passage .
She has a soft spot for plankton .
" They 're actually very pretty to look at , " she said , after filling more jars with mushy sludges of sea life that looked like frozen margaritas .
Young is on a team of six Canadian scientists and students aboard the ship they affectionately call The Louis , which set sail for the Arctic 's Northwest Passage from St. John's , Nfld. , on July 20 .
Twice each day , in the morning and evening , The Louis 's crew slows the 5,300 - tonne ship to a stop in the ocean so the scientists can go to work on the rolling deck .
Young runs a piece of equipment called bongo nets because they look like two pairs of drums lashed together .
Little propellers mounted at the top measure the flow of water through long , fine - meshed conical nets .
They dance in the frigid wind like Japanese kites when the equipment is winched over the side of the ship to be lowered 100 metres into the ocean .
The nets are quickly hauled back in , at 1 metre per second , so that fish and most other sea animals bigger than plankton escape .
Young then washes her catch into small buckets , called cod ends , on each end of the four nets .
She bottles some of the concentrated samples in ethanol to preserve the plankton for DNA analysis .
Others end up in formalin , a kind of embalming fluid , so different species of zooplankton can be catalogued , and the number in each group counted .
She kept one of her captives alive long enough to explain the attraction of animals few people ever see , let alone care about .
The pteropod , or " winged snail , " was shaped like a manatee , but was as small and delicate as a fly fishing lure , an opaque organism with an orange tail , beating its appendages like wings against the swirling currents in a gently tilted sample jar .
So far , scientists have n't seen any plankton species go extinct , Nelson said from Barrow , Alaska , after a separate , two - week research voyage .
But they are closely watching Pacific Ocean plankton found in the Arctic to see if they begin reproducing as sea temperatures rise .
" If a Pacific species was established in the Arctic , this would really be news , " he says .
" But we have not detected this yet .
What could happen in this scenario is that , if the invader out - competes the native species , this could lead to fundamental changes in ecosystem function . "
For instance , a smaller , invading species of plankton might replace a larger one , denying fish that used to eat the bigger plankton a key source of food , Nelson says .
Another instrument scientists use aboard the icebreaker is known as a rosette , from the circle of 24 tubes that capture water samples .
They are analyzed for their salt content , various chemicals and nutrients , including oxygen content , all to assess the effects of global warming on the northern oceans .
The Arctic is one of the most unforgiving places to learn about Earth and the state of her health .
It is also a very expensive place for scientists to work , so it has long been neglected by field researchers .
As concern builds over rising temperatures , the once ice - bound Northwest Passage is opening up to scientists eager to get a better look at what is happening to a region thought to be most vulnerable to early damage from climate change .
Vast areas of the Arctic are still scientific black holes , where researchers have yet to gather hard data , says Jane Eert , science coordinator of the Three Oceans Project , a federal study of Canada 's Arctic , Atlantic and Pacific oceans .
For years , scientists trying to figure out what is happening to Arctic ice have relied on measurements recorded by pings from U.S. navy nuclear submarines cruising stealthily under the ice cap from Alaska to the North Pole , during the Cold War , says Eert , 49 .
When the Soviet Union collapsed , and relations between Washington and Moscow warmed , the U.S. military was less worried about potential enemies knowing where its subs had been and declassified the ice data .
It seemed to show the ice was thinning dramatically .
" Nobody really quite noticed the submarines were running across the outside edges of the Canadian archipelago , " the islands scattered across Canada 's Far North , " where for all we know , the ice was getting thicker , " Eert says .

" The ice does n't stay constantly thick over the whole area .
It moves around .
So if you take measurements only in one spot , and make global conclusions from that , you might be going wrong . "
A physical oceanographer , Eert leads the scientific team aboard The Louis .
It 's her 10th voyage on the ship since 1999 .
Between 10 and 15 per cent of the Arctic Ocean is what Eert calls a data hole .
It will take years ' more research to fill it in with solid information , she adds .
After years of reports that vast areas of Arctic ice are melting as the seawater below , and air above , warm up , scientists have discovered that dramatic changes in the past three years are the result of shifting winds , perhaps caused by climate change .
Enormous amounts of ice have " been exported from the Arctic , " driven by winds that are shifting as the climate changes , which pushed the ice into ocean currents that delivered it to the North Atlantic , Eert says .
" The multi - year ice in the polar pack did n't melt in the Arctic Ocean , '' she says .
" It moved out and what 's left in the Arctic is thinner than it was . "
That does n't mean some Arctic ice is n't disappearing altogether , just that the process is not as simple as some reports suggest , Eert says .
Old ice that has shifted south from Greenland may have a counter - effect on the climate , which is just one of the many pieces of a very complex jigsaw puzzle that scientists are trying to piece together as they attempt to predict the effects of global warming .
" The guys who are running the long - term climate models have a tough problem , " Eert says .
" They 're looking at really long time scales , and as result they can't look at a lot of details for each year .
" In order to get the results before you die , you have to fudge some things .
And what they fudge is the small - scale stuff .
But it turns out that probably the small - scale stuff is important and fudging it gives you wrong answers . "
Ordinary people may help answer some of the Arctic scientists ' most vexing questions .
Eert 's team brought along 200 new beer bottles , donated by Sleeman and Molson , which they are tossing overboard in the Davis Strait , Baffin Bay and other parts of the Arctic .
Inside each sealed beer bottle is a printed message asking anyone who finds it to contact the research team .
Most have extra messages written by schoolchildren , with their own appeals for help for a project that 's a cheap way to map ocean currents .
Up on the ship 's bridge , Andre Pelland uses binoculars and his long experience to read icebergs birthed in Greenland , pack ice that the ship breaks through in the Arctic , and other ice conditions .
Pelland works aboard The Louis for the Canadian Ice Service , a federal agency that uses observations from radar satellites that can see through clouds , along with reports from monitors in aircraft and on ships , to produce detailed reports .
The shipping industry relies on them to steer vessels clear of icebergs and other hazards .
Pelland , 49 , is The Louis 's Ice Man .
He started out as a weather observer in Resolute Bay 25 years ago , when he filed reports by a clunky Teletype machine .
Now he uses a digital tablet to log the ice , and files updates to headquarters by satellite Internet link .
The latest maps show above - normal concentrations of ice across a huge region in western Hudson Bay and James Bay , while some areas farther north have less ice than usual .
Deciding what that all means is above Pelland 's pay grade .
But he knows this for sure : the frozen North that captivates him is far too precious to lose .
" It 's the last frontier , " he says wistfully , the ship 's rumbling diesel engines propelling her steadily north .
Hugo Chávez , the Venezuelan president , has accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinians , saying the offensive in Gaza early this year was unprovoked .
" The question is not whether the Israelis want to exterminate the Palestinians .
They 're doing it openly , " he was quoted as saying in an interview with the French newspaper , Le Figaro .
" What was it , if not genocide ? ...
The Israelis were looking for an excuse to exterminate the Palestinians . "
His comments came after a tour of Middle Eastern and Arab countries .
Israel has maintained that the three - week Gaza assault was a response to rockets fired from Gaza by militant groups .
However , several human rights groups have said that both Israel and Palestinian militant groups , notably Hamas , breached international law and should be investigated for possible war crimes .
A key UN report on the conflict , led by the respected South African judge Richard Goldstone , is due to be published within weeks .
New casualty figures for the Gaza offensive , compiled after months of research by an Israeli human rights group , show 1,387 Palestinians died , of whom more than half were not taking part in hostilities .
The research from B'Tselem , the Israeli human rights organisation , challenges figures produced by the Israeli military , which argued that far fewer Palestinian civilians died .
B'Tselem said that its field researchers in Gaza interviewed witnesses and relatives of the dead , cross-checked information with Palestinian and international rights groups and with Israeli military statements .
" B'Tselem did everything within its capability to verify the data , " the group said .
It had asked to see an Israeli military list of fatalities but was refused .
Israeli authorities also refused to allow Israeli and West Bank staff from B'Tselem to enter Gaza for the work .
The research found that 773 of those Palestinians killed were not taking part in hostilities ; among them were 320 children under the age of 18 .
Field workers from the group visited the homes of the dead children , checking photographs , death certificates and other documents to establish the toll .
Another 330 of the dead were involved in the fighting and 248 were police officers killed at their police stations , most in a wave of air strikes on the first day of the conflict .
On the Israeli side , three civilians were killed by Palestinian militant rocket fire and 10 soldiers died , four of whom were killed accidentally by their own troops .
The Israeli military has released its own casualty figures for Palestinian deaths , saying 295 civilians were killed out of a total of 1,166 deaths , but has refused to publish its list of fatalities .
The military said it believed that the B'Tselem report was " not based on facts or on accurate statistics " .
Although the military defended its conduct in the war , it has emerged that officers have started taking witness testimony from some Palestinians whose relatives were killed and injured .
On Monday , Israeli military officers questioned Khaled Abed Rabbo , who saw two of his daughters shot dead by Israeli troops during the war .
A third daughter was severely injured .
The troops then demolished the family 's house , in Izbet Abed Rabbo , one of the worst damaged villages in Gaza .
ROME ( Reuters ) - Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , after months of dismissing accusations of cavorting with teenagers and prostitutes , on Wednesday acknowledged he was “ no saint ” but vowed to govern until the end of his mandate .
In his first public remarks since newspapers posted audio recordings of intimate conversations purportedly between him and an escort , a defiant Berlusconi sought to write off the scandal with one of his trademark quips .
“ There are tons of good - looking girls and entrepreneurs out there , ” he said at the opening ceremony for a new motorway building site .
“ I am not a saint , you ’ve all understood that .
I hope those at La Repubblica also understand it , ” he said , referring to the left - leaning daily which has led demands that he clear up aspects of his personal life .
Speaking of new public works to be inaugurated in 2013 -- when his mandate ends -- he said : “ We will all still be around , because how could Italians do without us ?. ”
The websites of La Repubblica and the weekly magazine L’Espresso have posted recordings of conversations they said were between Berlusconi and Patrizia D’Addario , an escort who says she and other women were paid to attend parties at Berlusconi ’s residence in Rome .
While Berlusconi ’s comments offered no specific admission , they did appear to be a change of tack in dealing with the scandal , particularly after newspapers around the world reprinted the transcripts in full or in part .
On Monday , his lawyer Niccolo Ghedini branded the tapes “ totally unlikely and the product of the imagination ” and warned that it was illegal to post or publish them .

POPULARITY SLIPS BELOW 50 PERCENT
Although Berlusconi has tried to make light of the controversy surrounding his private life , the possible political ramifications have been lurking in the background .
An opinion poll published on Tuesday showed his approval rating falling below 50 percent for the first time since he won a landslide election victory last year .
The poll showed that Berlusconi had lost four percentage points since May , when his wife filed for divorce , setting off a chain of disclosures about his private life .
The 72 - year old conservative prime minister , who often boasts of his sexual prowess , has not denied that D’Addario went to his home , but has said that he did not know she was an escort and that he has never paid for sex .
D’Addario , 42 , says she made the recordings during a night she spent with the prime minister on November 4 , 2008 -- the date of U.S. President Barack Obama ’s historic election victory -- and during various telephone conversations .
She has handed the recordings to magistrates investigating a businessman , Giampaolo Tarantini , on suspicion of providing paid escorts to curry political favors for an enterprise in the southern city of Bari , from where D’Addario also hails .
In one of the conversations , re-published by all mainstream newspapers , a man purported to be Berlusconi tells D’Addario they should both take showers and whoever finished first should wait in “ the big bed , ” said to be a gift from Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
In another conversation said to be between Berlusconi and D’Addario the next day , he expresses surprise when D’Addario says she lost her voice , “ because we did n’t scream . ”
Other recordings involve conversations between D’Addario and Tarantini , with her saying she had expected to receive money but did not , and that Berlusconi had promised to help her solve a problem with a real estate deal .
Berlusconi has accused L’Espresso and La Repubblica -- part of the same publishing group -- of waging a subversive gossip campaign to oust him and has urged business leaders not to advertise in the group ’s publications .
The news group ’s lawyers filed a suit against him on Wednesday , alleging defamation , abuse of power and market abuse .
Seven million people could be criminalised under government plans to crack down on internet piracy , to be included in this autumn 's Queen 's Speech .
The illicit downloading of music and films on the internet , a practice engaged in by one in 12 of the population , could lead to severe restrictions on internet access and a fine of up to £ 50,000 .
Lord Mandelson , the Business Secretary , is said to be persuaded by the argument for tough laws to curb illegal file - sharing after an intensive lobbying campaign by influential people in the music and film industry .
But Tom Watson , the former minister for digital engagement , today criticises the proposed crackdown as extreme and calls for a more measured approach that would target those who uploaded illegal content , rather than the millions who downloaded the files .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
His intervention comes in the week after the Pirate Party , which won a European parliamentary seat in Sweden in June on a platform of legalising internet file - sharing , announced it would fight the next general election in Britain .
The new Pirate Party UK was reported to be recruiting as many as 100 people every hour since its launch last week .
Among its supporters was Stephen Fry , who applauded the new party on Twitter .
Yesterday the organisers said they had 259 fully paid - up members , although hundreds more had shown an interest in joining .
When the Digital Britain report was published in June , the Government appeared to row back from a hardline stance on illegal downloading .
But a consultation document on the latest plans , which could be tagged on to a Bill in the next Queen 's Speech , makes it clear that ministers favour tough sanctions .
Whitehall sources said that Lord Mandelson has been persuaded by the need to take action to prevent copyright being breached .
But Mr Watson , writing below , says : " Not only do the sanctions ultimately risk criminalising a large proportion of UK citizens , but they also attach an unbearable regulatory burden on an emerging technology that has the power to transform society , with no guarantees at the end that our artists and our culture will get any richer .
" Working on the safe assumptions that ( a ) people like downloading music from the internet , and ( b ) most people would prefer not to break the law , we should aim to map a way forward for businesses to take financial advantage of the digital market . "
Under the proposed laws , Ofcom , the industry regulator , would be given powers to require internet service providers to collect information on those who downloaded pirate material .
The data would be anonymous , but serious repeat infringers would be tracked down through their computer ID numbers .
Individuals would be hit by restricted internet access – from slowing down broadband to blocking access altogether – and could face fines of up to £ 50,000 .
The Department for Business consultation document admits that getting internet service providers to track down repeat offenders " is new and will be contentious " .
Nevertheless , the crackdown has the backing of leading figures in the music , film and publishing industries .
The singer Lily Allen has said : " If what the consumer wants is good music , then they are going to have to start paying for it .
There are people really struggling to make their way ; they 're getting dropped much quicker , not being given the opportunity to make second albums .
The only people responsible are those who are downloading music illegally , because there is no money going towards the bands any more . "
But those on the other side of the argument say that file - sharing – sometimes termed " p2 p " or " peer to peer " – is merely widening access to a piece of music or film and does not equate to theft .
Thom Yorke , the lead singer of Radiohead , has in the past given implicit support for internet piracy .
He told an interviewer : " A lot of the time , the reason that people pirate is they want access to good music and they do n't get it because the radio is so shit . "
Andrew Robinson , the leader of the Pirate Party UK , said yesterday that the new laws would be a gross intrusion into civil liberties , and would penalise people in the same household as those who had broken the law .
Mr Robinson , 40 , a graphic designer and part - time musician , is planning to stand in his home constituency of Worcester , where the Labour MP Michael Foster is defending a majority of 3,144 .
He said : " This is about proving to the major parties that there are so many votes to be had in adopting policies like ours .
The pro-copyright lobby is very powerful . "
The Pirate Party UK was officially recognised as a political party by the Electoral Commission last month .
It is not linked to the Pirate Bay internet " torrent " site but is sympathetic to its cause .
Pirate Bay does not host illegal content but provides links to files of music and videos held on individuals ' computers .

Eight Singapore fans of Japanese game Slayers entered into a suicide pact so that they could become " Slayers " themselves and kill demons in World War III .
The " pact " lasted two suicides , before the rest of the kids realized they were being f*cking stupid and backed out of the plan once they saw two friends leap to their deaths from a tall building .
The pact was started by a 16 - year - old , self - proclaimed Taoist medium called Ku Witaya , who convinced his brother and six other kids to join him in his quest to become a " Slayer . "
He had led them to believe the world was coming to an end and that they had to sacrifice themselves for the greater good .
The power he had over them was seemingly broken when he and his friend Sia Chan Hong were the first to make this " sacrifice , " jumping from a ninth floor window .
Hong survived the fall , but died in hospital three hours later .
Slayers is quite an old set of games , based on a series of light novels that revolve around a demon called the Lord of Nightmares that will be reborn if the world is destroyed .
Singapore is not exactly known for its liberal and understanding approach to videogames , so we 'll see if the game connection has any repurcussions .
Seriously though , these are the stupidest kids I 've ever heard about .
[ Update : Somebody from Singapore contacted us and said that the suicide was not about games and that if we did not remove this article , he would " contact the relevant government agencies . "
Seriously , he threatened us with government intervention .

The news is totally wrong and is disrespectful to the dead .
As a Singaporean , I cannot help but to ask the admins to delete this post .
The 8 boys were not influenced by any games , they were influenced by religious beliefs .

It 's unsurprising that Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus has been called out in the past for abusing their animals , but it 's another thing to see it all on tape .
PETA went undercover this year and captured Ringling workers on video beating and whipping elephants .
The organization announced their findings today at a press conference ( NY1 has footage ) , calling upon Madison Square Garden to ban the circus , or at least the use of animals in their show .
This summer expects to finally see a verdict in a lawsuit filed against Ringling , which centers around the circus 's use of steel - barbed bullhooks , electric prods , and shackles on the elephants .
PETA 's new footage also shows abuse to the circus 's tigers .
They say workers struck animals on the head , face , ears , legs , and other parts of their bodies with bullhooks and other abusive handling tools .
" The unit 's animal superintendant and head elephant trainer were among those who used bullhooks — sharp , fireplace pokerlike devices — to hook and yank elephants by their sensitive skin . "
Their skin , by the way , is as sensitive as human's .
While this is all on tape , Ringling has thus far not commented on the footage and merely called PETA " an extremist animal rights group . "
Perhaps they need some prodding by a bullhook to get them talking .
It used to be that the worst grade you could receive in school was an F , and that was bad enough .
But B.C.'s Simon Fraser
University is taking punishment to a whole new level , introducing a grade of FD -- meaning failure with dishonesty -- the worst possible grade a student can receive .
Dr. Rob Gordon , director of criminology at SFU and acting chair of the senate committee on academic integrity , says the new grading is intended to curtail cheating using the internet .
" What used to be a lot of cheating in libraries has changed quite significantly , " he told ctvbc.ca .
" We now have to be concerned about cheating during exams with high - tech devices and the inappropriate use of internet sources and downloading , including online companies offering services to students that promote academic dishonesty . "
University department chairs can impose the FD grade if they feel the incident warrants a severe penalty , or if the student has landed themselves in academic hot water in the past .
" They only use this grade in particularly egregious cases of dishonestly or in cases when they 've committed acts of dishonesty several times and have n't learned from their lesson , " Gordon said .
The mark , which has yet to be used in its introductory semester , will stay on the student 's transcripts for two years after graduation .
" It 's more than a fail , it 's a failure with a particular reason that is publicly announced that may well be seen by potential employers . "
Some students say it 's unfair to carry that stigma into the working world .
" Two years loss of your life that is a bit too far , " Olid Amid said .
But although some consider the new grading heavy handed , others say the punishment is just in a time where internet cheating is increasing at Canadian post - secondary institutions .
" A student would seriously need to re-evaluate their intentions at university and what they are hoping to get out of it , " University of Alberta student Patrice Strate said .
" It makes it a lot easier for those of us who do n't cheat to get good grades and to not worry about the people who are cheating , " student John Aubrey said .
The University of Alberta uses a similar system where cheaters are given an F8 or F9 grade , which is reduced to an F after three years .
" In our case we give the students a chance to redeem themselves , " Dean of Students Frank Robinson said .
" [ In ] three years they can graduate and have a clean record and get on with life . "
Video : Software can learn sign language by watching TV
It ’s not only humans that can learn from watching television .
Software developed in the UK has worked out the basics of sign language by absorbing TV shows that are both subtitled and signed .
While almost all shows are broadcast with subtitles , some are also accompanied with sign language because it is easier for many deaf people to follow .
Shows with both text and signing are a bit like a Rosetta Stone – a carving that provided the breakthrough in decoding Egyptian hieroglyphics from an adjacent translation in classical Greek .
So Patrick Buehler and Andrew Zisserman at the University of Oxford , along with Mark Everingham at the University of Leeds set out to see if software that can already interpret the typed word could learn British Sign Language from video footage .

Sign of the times
They first designed an algorithm to recognise the gestures made by the signer .
The software uses the arms to work out the rough location of the fast - moving hands , and identifies flesh - coloured pixels in those areas to reveal precise hand shapes .
Once the team were confident the computer could identify different signs in this way , they exposed it to around 10 hours of TV footage that was both signed and subtitled .
They tasked the software with learning the signs for a mixture of 210 nouns and adjectives that appeared multiple times during the footage .
The program did so by analysing the signs that accompanied each of those words whenever it appeared in the subtitles .
Where it was not obvious which part of a signing sequence relates to the given keyword , the system compared multiple occurrences of a word to pinpoint the correct sign .
Starting without any knowledge of the signs for those 210 words , the software correctly learnt 136 of them , or 65 per cent , says Everingham .
“ Some words have different signs depending on the context – for example , cutting a tree has a different sign to cutting a rose . ” he says , so this is a high success rate given the complexity of the task .
Signing avatars
Helen Cooper and Richard Bowden at the University of Surrey , UK , have used the same software in a different way to teach their own computer sign language .
“ Our approach achieves higher accuracy levels with less data , ” Bowden says .
To get such good results , Cooper and he get the software to scan all the signs in a video sequence and identify those that appear frequently and so likely represent common words .
The meaning of each of those signs is then determined by referring to the subtitles .
“ That approach is very scalable – it can run quickly on large amounts of data , ” says Everingham .
But he thinks that it leaves the software less able to distinguish between terms than using his team ’s more word - specific method .
Both approaches , though , could be more than just academic demonstrations of the power of software .
They could be used to create a way to automatically animate digital avatars that could fluently sign alongside any TV programme .
Previous attempts to do this resulted in avatars that appear clunky to people fluent in sign language , says Everingham .
Everingham and colleagues , and Cooper and Bowden , presented their work at the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition ( CVPR 2009 ) in Miami Beach , Florida , last week .
Close to a Million Guns Bought By Honest Americans In July 2009
Background Checks On Firearm Sales Up 8.4 % In July .
Americans buy 966,162 + guns in July 2009
Washington , DC –-( AmmoLand.com ) - Data released by the FBI 's National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) reported 966,162 checks in July 2009 , an 8.4 percent increase from the 891,224 reported in July 2008 .
This latest jump in background checks follows the release of the Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Collection Report by the Department of the Treasury just two weeks ago .
The report noted that firearm and ammunition manufacturers paid more than $ 109.8 million in the first calendar quarter of 2009 , up 43 percent over the same period in 2008 .

, after being sworn in as a Supreme Court justice in 1990
-- David Souter
of retiring Justice Souter 's response to Chief Justice John Roberts ' reading of a letter to Souter from his eight current colleagues as well as his longtime former colleague , retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor -- and the justice 's parting words
-- Dana Milbank 's Washington Post account
Washington Pos
Because of Souter 's quiet ways ( he uttered all of 200 words in his farewell yesterday ) , it 's easy to forget how different the country would be today if this unmarried recluse from the North had n't decamped long ago to join the court 's liberal wing .
Had he remained the conservative that President George H.W.
Bush thought he was getting when he nominated Souter in 1990 , there 's every possibility that abortion would be illegal in the United States today , that the Ten Commandments would be displayed throughout schools and courthouses , and that the law of the land on any number of issues -- guns , terrorism , race -- would be different .
Before yesterday 's session began , William Suter , the clerk of the Supreme Court , stood in the chamber in his tails and vest , giving a talk to a group of visitors .
" Politics is over here , " Suter said , holding up one fist .
" Law is over here , " he said , holding his other fist apart .
Would that it were so .
Everybody who has heard of Bush v. Gore knows that the justices have at times been as political as their counterparts across the street in the Capitol .
But Souter refused to play his assigned partisan role in the court 's battles -- and he defied the conservatives one final time yesterday .
As the five other Reagan and Bush appointees formed a majority to say that New Haven , Conn. , discriminated against white firefighters , Souter joined the two Clinton appointees and John Paul Stevens in a dissent accusing the majority of a " confounding " opinion that " misconceives one of our nation 's principal civil rights laws . "
The nine senators voting against Souter included Ted Kennedy and John Kerry from Souter 's neighboring state of Massachusetts .
These senators , along with seven others , painted Souter as a right - winger in the mold of Robert Bork .
They based their claim on Souter 's friendships with many conservative politicians in New Hampshire .
Their allegations failed to influence the other 90 senators .
The press called him the " stealth justice " and reported that his professional record provoked little real controversy and provided very little " paper trail . "
President Bush saw this lack of a paper trail as a positive for Souter , because one of President Reagan 's nominees , Bork , had recently been rejected by the Senate partially because of the availability of his extensive written opinions on issues .
Bush claimed that he did not know Souter 's stances on abortion , affirmative action , or other issues .
The National Organization for Women opposed Souter 's nomination and held a rally outside the hearings to oppose his selection .
The then - president of NOW , Molly Yard , testified that Souter would " end ... freedom for women in this country . "
Souter was also opposed by the NAACP , which urged its 500,000 members to write letters to their senators asking for Souter 's defeat .
Despite this opposition , Souter won an easy confirmation compared to those of later Republican appointees .
Souter spoke of his admiration for the conservative Justice John Marshall Harlan II of the Warren court , as well as for liberal Justice William Brennan of the same court , during his confirmation hearings .
The Wall Street Journal described the events leading up to the appointment of the " liberal jurist " in a 2000 editorial , saying Rudman in his " Yankee Republican liberalism " took " pride in recounting how he sold Mr. Souter to gullible White House chief of staff John Sununu as a confirmable conservative .
Then they both sold the judge to President Bush , who wanted above all else to avoid a confirmation battle . "
Rudman wrote in his memoir that he had " suspected all along " that Souter would not " overturn activist liberal precedents . "
Sununu later said that he had " a lot of disappointment " about Souter 's positions on the court and would have preferred him to be more similar to Justice Antonin Scalia .
#
In hist piece Milbank went on to write :
It 's been a busy day , and a contention - filled one , and so it 's been left till now to say good - bye to a real American hero .
A hero of mine anyway .
A man who came almost literally out of nowhere .
Had anyone besides New Hampshire home - state colleague then - Sen .
Warren Rudman heard of Souter when Rudman recommended him to President George H.W. Bush to replace one of the great justices in the Court 's history , retiring 84 - year - old William J. Brennan ?
( The two NH pols went back a ways .
In 1971 then - state Attorney General Rudman had picked Souter , an assistant AG , to be deputy attorney general . )
Naturally we all assumed the worst .
Wikipedia reminds us : Well , I 've learned a lot about Senator Rudman that I did n't know at the time .
It was a great , history - making recommendation he made , and for 19 years we 've been beyond fortunate to have this quiet , unassuming man serving on our highest court .
It 's generally reported that he became increasingly unhappy with the poinsonous partisan divide in Washington , which of course has become pretty hard to escape on the Supreme Court , and it's hard not to honor his feeling that he's had enough , just as it's hard not to honor his wish not to cling to his seat , but to retire still in relative good health to go back home to enjoy his retirement years .
Boy , will he be missed .

ULAN BATOR , Mongolia – Nomin wanted to go to college .
Three years ago , unable to afford tuition in the Mongolian capital , the native of remote Zavkhan province spotted an ad in a newspaper advertising a scholarship to study in Korea — no tuition , no living costs .
All that was required was a high school diploma and a passport .
She handed over her documents to a Mongolian couple supposedly working for the university , and within weeks Nomin was on an airplane bound for Seoul with two other young women .
“ When we arrived the couple told us it ’s not a good time to enter university .
They told us we had to work in a nightclub until the semester starts , ” says Nomin ( not her real name ) , now 25 , in a near whisper during an interview in an Ulan Bator parking lot .
“ Everybody was speaking Korean .
We were wondering what was going on . ”
The girls were taken to Jeju Island , locked in a small apartment , beaten and forced to prostitute themselves in a local hostess bar .
Three months later , with the help of a Mongolian businessman she met at the club , Nomin escaped through a bathroom window and made her way to Seoul and eventually back to Mongolia .
Her family still does n’t know what really happened to her .
Between 3,000 and 5,000 Mongolians are trafficked every year , according to NGO estimates ; the vast majority are women and children recruited by deceit to work in the sex industry .
They are lured by promises of lucrative jobs in nightclubs and massage parlors only to find themselves trapped in a system of modern slavery .
Their passports are confiscated and they are locked in “ debt bondage , ” in which traffickers demand exorbitant repayment for travel and other costs .
Some , like Nomin , manage to escape .
Most , lacking money , travel documents and assistance of any kind , stay for several years .
Many are beaten , forced to take drugs , raped and sold repeatedly .
They work in the bars of Beijing , the saunas of Macau , and the brothels of Erlian , a Gobi desert boomtown on the China - Mongolia border .
“ Trafficking is growing very fast , ” says Amgalan Erdenechuluun , a project officer at the Human Security Policy Studies Center , an NGO in Ulan Bator .
The young women “ want to believe that there ’s something better out there .
But when they reach the destination country they find themselves trapped in a nightmare .
They ’re just slaves . ”
According to the U.S. State Department ’s 2009 Trafficking in Persons Report , released in June , Mongolian trafficking victims have been found in a growing number of countries as far reaching as Germany , Israel , the United Arab Emirates and more .
And an increasing cohort of Mongolian women are entering into arranged marriages with foreigners – mostly South Koreans – but end up in situations of involuntary servitude .
Traffickers prey on the desire for a better life .
Some are friends and relatives of the victims , who are generally uneducated and desperate for a way out of poverty .
Targets are often prostitutes who are misled about pay and working conditions ; others are recruited by advertisements in newspapers or on late night TV .
In one recent case , 19 women were trafficked to China on the promise of jobs as flight attendants .
“ These girls are poor .
They see other girls wearing nice clothes , going to school .
They want that too , ” says Anya Manga , coordinator with the Children and Young People ’s Protection and Development NGO , which raises awareness about trafficking with at - risk youth .
“ They want to go abroad .
They think they can get more money there .
So they look for people who can take them there .
That ’s when people take advantage of them . ”
Repatriated women suffer physically and emotionally ; many are forced to seek medical treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and depression .
They are often shunned by their family and society .
With no work experience and few options , many return to prostitution or become traffickers themselves .
This is trafficking ’s vicious circle .
The Mongolia Gender Equality Center , an Ulan Bator NGO , provides shelter , counselling and a path to vocational training for repatriated trafficking victims .
According to Ganbayasgakh Geleg , the GEC ’s head , the group helped about 25 victims from 2003 to 2007 ; since then , it ’s worked with more than 115 .
“ The girls are traumatized .
They are very stressed , ” she says .
“ There ’s risk of becoming a trafficker .
Risk of being trafficked again .
Suicide . ”
Other than the GEC , trafficking victims have few options when they return home .
The Mongolian government still does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking , the State Department report says .
There remains no stand - alone anti-trafficking law , and although the government cooperates with NGOs , it does n’t provide adequate assistance to victims .
Poverty and unemployment , meanwhile , remain rampant .
That leaves trafficking victims like Nomin vulnerable .
Since returning to Mongolia from her Korean nightmare , she worked briefly on a pig farm and has now returned to Ulan Bator to look for employment .
She remains without a job , but was offered one — at a Korean hostess bar .
For now , she ’s staying with relatives in a poor neighborhood .
“ In the future I hope to enter university and after graduation I can find a normal job , ” she says .
“ But I do n’t know .
It ’s difficult to find a normal job . ”

For the Conservative Party , hoping to rediscover the way back to Downing Street , reform of Britain 's state - funded education system is an open goal .
The ball is inside the six - yard box ; all David Cameron needs to do is smash it in the net .
He will not have a better opportunity to win over traditional Labour voters than by showing them how he can help their children escape from schools for losers .
If he lacks the will to admit that grammar schools did more for working - class children than a thousand free school meals , he should at least promise to reintroduce with unambiguous rigour the standards , discipline and ambition that grammars delivered for people like me .

...." never once did I have a Medicare bureaucrat tell me what I could n't do for a patient , but all the time we have bureaucrats from the insurance companies calling up and saying we 're not going to cover this , we 're not going to pay for that , we 're denying coverage for that .
The system we have now is broken .
We need to fix it . "
Dr. Howard Dean , former Democratic Presidential Candidate and former DNC Chairman
The most intrusive system to life - saving medical care is already occurring .
Doctors daily have to contend with the regulation on their medical practice by the Health Insurance Industry that decides what treatment is acceptable for payment .
So while former Republican VP candidate Sarah
Palin
has called President
Obama's
health plan " evil " because it may lead to " death panels " that decide who gets to live and die .
Unfortunately , we already have these death panels and they are insurance company executives that decide who will get to live and die based upon what they will pay for .
The absurdity of the rationale in which it is all right for a person to live or die based upon whether they have good health insurance , but it is n't all right for all people to have access to health care because the government might be involved is a type of American madness .
Americans have been conditioned for so many years to see the government as the enemy but never to question their own slavery to the
Financial
and Corporate interests that run America .
The real enemy is the not - so - invisible hand of Financial and Corporate power that not only calls the shots on who gets to live and die , but also gets to call the shots on how well Americans live and the way in which they will live .
The money system that has corrupted the American psyche to its very core views any form of care and help for others as a threat to the welfare of America .
This allows for the fear mongering of near lunatics like Sarah
Palin
and the unbelievable willingness of many Americans to accept the insanity .
We presently have a system in which a hundred million Americans either have no insurance or are under- insured and that system determines who lives and dies daily .
On top of that , we have a health care system in which insurance company bureaucrats routinely make life and death decisions that deny coverage and Americans think this is freedom .
Until Americans start moving beyond the propaganda of their corporate masters , they will continue to be enslaved to a system that will not tolerate humane treatment of people .
Americans must move beyond the indoctrinated Corporate madness by " trusted " lunatics , like
Palin
, and into sanity .
Their very lives depend on it .
There is a wide array of maps that is being offered by Google in that you wo n’t need to look any further .
In addition to the turn - by - turn directions it offers multiple view options with detailed route information as well as live traffic updates and everything else you would expect in a navigation App .
Google maps does really offer almost everything that you need .
Incase you want to use the google map offline then you will need to download the area map that you greatly desire in advance .
Incase you do that then you will not get those traffic updates in advance as they require more connection .
Google maps have the ability to download multiple areas to your phone and in order to use Google maps one needs to use google maps in Wi – Fi mode only incase you have a spotty connection .
Many apps utilize the google maps API for their GPS and location needs as well .
So technically you may be using google maps all the time indirectly without realizing it .
Delivery apps use google maps API .
Fuck book apps , dating and hookup apps all rely on this to connect people based on location .
Using google maps offline
Google maps also allow one to save your map on your external SD card .
It comes in handy whenever you are not driving as it offers walking , cycling and public transport to your destinations .
Data served explorers have more options to use Google maps than before due to the release of Google Maps
Go which is basically a lighter version of the original map that allows one to conserve resources on your device .
Even if it is offered for your smartphone one can still get it .
Waze
Waze is another popular application that features offline support .
The popularity of Waze grew so rapidly that Google had to buy it .
However , the two maps have been kept separately by big dogs at mountain view with some of the features starting to be passed on between the two services .
Waze does offer built - in map downloading the same way google map does and you will still be able to get the job done without having internet connection .
All you need to do is open your Waze app and then press the search button that is located at the far bottom left corner of your screen .
Tap settings that is located on the top right - hand corner and then display and map .
Scroll down a little until you reach the data transfer and make sure that you download the traffic information .
Whenever you are searching for a destination always make sure that destination or route data are stored so that you can use it when offline .
Sygic GPS Navigation and Maps
Sygic is one of the most popular offline navigation apps on Android and for a good reason .
The app that is powered by Tom - Tom offers high - definition maps for most countries around the world and it is regularly updated to keep people up - to - date with the latest version of Android .
It is very free to download and has a seven - day trial however if you desire to keep using it then you will need to either pay for premium features and traffic updates or simply pay for the features .
Some of the features that you will find to be very useful include an offline navigation map , voice - activated GPS with route guidance , dynamic lane assistance , 3D mapping and imagery as well as the option to project your GPS navigation onto the windshield of your car .
CoPilot GPS
CoPilot GPS is an application that is meant just for drivers .
It has all the features that you need as a driver .
However , they are not for free .
The fortunate thing is they have a 7 - day trial period after which you will be required to pay for the premium services .
You also have the option of using offline mapping where you get turn - by - turn navigation for free but you will only get to view the 2D version of the map .
Premium users get to access 3D mapping where in the full version of the app , you get to access sheer variety of customizable route as well as very impressive alert options .
The very thing that most people find appealing with the map is the breadth of full street - level maps .
If you are traveling across countries then you will need to have a stand - alone map for each country .
It can be expensive however it is cheaper compared to buying a stand - alone sat - nav unit . …

The debate over the “ public option ” in health care has been dismaying in many ways .
Perhaps the most depressing aspect for progressives , however , has been the extent to which opponents of greater choice in health care have gained traction  in Congress , if not with the broader public  simply by repeating , over and over again , that the public option would be , horrors , a government program .
Washington , it seems , is still ruled by Reaganism  by an ideology that says government intervention is always bad , and leaving the private sector to its own devices is always good .
Call me naïve , but I actually hoped that the failure of Reaganism in practice would kill it .
It turns out , however , to be a zombie doctrine : even though it should be dead , it keeps on coming .
Let ’s talk for a moment about why the age of Reagan should be over .
First of all , even before the current crisis Reaganomics had failed to deliver what it promised .
Remember how lower taxes on high incomes and deregulation that unleashed the “ magic of the marketplace ” were supposed to lead to dramatically better outcomes for everyone ?
Well , it did n’t happen .
With continuing stories of the denial of legal rights , the abuse of women ( ad here and here ) , rise of radical Islam , and war crimes , many Americans are still unsure why we are sacrificing thousands of our citizens and billions in funding in Iraq .
Now , the U.S. supported government is moving to ban books that it considers unduly “ sectarian . ”
The Iraqi government believes that the way to reduce sectarian violence is to regulate what citizens can read — a long discredited approach of authoritarian regimes .
Particularly in today ’s world of Internet and electronic communications , it is doubtful that the move will curtail anything other than freedom .
Of course , we have been a poor role model in Iraq , here .

If it was n't already obvious that the right - wingers who organized the Tax Day Tea Parties vastly overstated their actual significance -- except as a harbinger of the slide towards right - wing populism -- then this past weekend should lay any doubts to rest .
Even before the holiday weekend , it was clear that the planned 2nd edition of the Tea Tantrums Parties was going to be somewhat less than energetic .
David Weigel at the Washington Independent observed that a lot of this had to do with mainstream support peeling away :
But the collaboration between the official Republican establishment and the Tea Parties has not lasted into June .
The RNC has no plans to get involved with any Tea Parties .
A spokesman for Rep. John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , who jaunted around northern California to attend several Tea Parties , said that his holiday plans were private but would probably not include Tea Parties .
Gingrich will not attend any of the Tea Parties , although he recorded video messages for events in Birmingham and Nashville “ at the request of the respective organizers , ” according to spokesman Dan Kotman .
Media coverage has also gotten a little bit more scarce .
Coverage on Fox News has largely been limited to interviews with Tea Party organizers on the network ’s morning shows .
While sources at Fox would not discuss their plans for covering the weekend events , they confirmed that no anchors would be attending and that the attendance and news value of the events looked to be lower than that of the April rallies .
Tea Party organizers are counting , instead , on local news coverage and on distributed reporting such as the conservative news site PajamasTV , which hosts an “ American Tea Party ” show and has asked readers to submit their own videos from their rallies .
Part of the dynamic of right - wing populism is that , as whatever mainstream backing it gathers initially peels away , its more radical elements rise to the fore .
And indeed , the Anti-Defamation League warned beforehand that extremists were likely to be making their presence felt at these gatherings :
White supremacists and neo -Nazi hate groups plan to take advantage of the anti-tax " Tea Parties " set to occur in more than 1,000 cities and localities over the July 4 holiday weekend to disseminate racist fliers and other materials and attempt to recruit others to their cause , according to the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) .
ADL 's Center on Extremism , which monitors extremist groups and provides information to law enforcement and the public , has released information on its
Web site describing the attempt by white supremacists to co-opt the anti-tax message of the events as a means to spread racism and anti-Semitism .
On Stormfront , the most popular white supremacist Internet forum , members have discussed becoming local organizers of the " Tea Parties " and finding ways to involve themselves in the events .
Many racists have voiced their intent to attend these rallies for the purpose of cultivating an " organized grassroots
White mass movement , " with some suggesting that they would do so without openly identifying themselves as racists .
If you watch the above video -- featuring clips culled from various Tea Parties around the nation , including ( in order of appearance ) Norwich , Conn . ; Broken Arrow , Oklahoma ; Cape Coral , Florida ; Raleigh , North Carolina ; and La Canada / Flintridge , California -- you can see it all : the lackluster crowds , combined with a toxic dose of truly wingnutty rhetoric .
The conspiracists were obviously out in force .
In Oklahoma , a man calling himself " July4Patriot " talked about his organization , the " Oath Keepers " -- a collection of freshly returned war veterans who are organizing to resist the impending New World Order .
As you can hear , among the things they fear is that the government intends to conduct house - to - house searches of private homes and begin rounding up citizens and putting them in concentration camps .
The only thing missing was the black helicopters ( though give him enough time , and that probably will turn up too ) .
Then there was the " Birther " speaker in Florida who assured everyone that the Constitution is based on Biblical law , and added that President Obama is n't a constitutionally legal president because he wo n't show his birth certificate .
Or the woman in California who warned that illegal immigrants were the real problem .
The conspiracist element was everywhere -- and so was the fizzling of energy .
There was no party in Seattle this time -- though a gathering in Olympia was reported to have gathered 1,500 .
As you can see from the tea parties ' organizing site for Washington , the sponsor of that " party " was an outfit calling itself " PatriotMarch "
-- and if you go there , you can quickly ascertain that this is an essentially Bircherite group of conspiracists too .
( Quick shower recommended afterward . )
It happened elsewhere as well .
In Duval County , Florida , there were signs comparing Obama to Hitler .
The next step in the devolution process of right - wing populists -- just as we saw with the Minutemen -- involves acting out by renegade violent and unstable actors .
That 's the really ugly part .
And as you can see , the Tea Parties are getting there , bit by bit .

Looks like the " Good War " in Afghanistan is morphing even more directly into the " Drug War " that the U.S. government has been waging all over the world -- and especially against its own people -- for almost 40 years now , with all the attendant aggrandizement of authoritarian powers and degradation of civil liberties and human rights .
As The Times reports , and Pentagon brass confirmed , the " continuity government " of the Obama Administration has drawn up yet another " hit list " of people to be arbitrarily assassinated : 50 " drug lords " allegedly associated with the Taliban .
No doubt the many drug lords associated with the American - installed Afghan government -- and those cooperating directly with the Western occupation -- are exempt from this dirty laundry list .
Of course , the runaway cultivation of opium in Afghanistan -- which is now flooding not only the West but also vast swathes of Central Asia with cheap heroin -- is a direct result of the American invasion in 2001 : an operation ostensibly designed to capture Osama bin Laden , who somehow curiously slipped away from the Americans ' curiously porous encirclement , never to be seen again ( except of course for a few curiously timed transmission that seemed , curiously enough , to be geared to the domestic political needs of America 's militarist factions ) .
Of course , before the invasion , the Taliban had largely -- if ruthlesssly -- eliminated the cultivation of opium in the areas under its control .
But the American military -- and its gung - ho CIA operatives ( " We 're killing people ! " as one CIAer exulted to the Boston Globe ) -- instead empowered the Northern Alliance : the Russian - backed conglomerate of warlords and druglords who were freely growing opium in their territories .
Now the Afghan insurgents -- themselves a loose conglomeration of factions given the conveniently misleading monolithic moniker of " the Taliban " -- have taken up the opium trade to help finance their operations as well .
Meanwhile , poor Afghans are dependent on the opium trade , which fetches prices far above anything else they can grow .
After all , their society and economy have been systematically destroyed by 30 years of savage war , kicked off not by the Soviet intervention in 1980 but by a terrorist campaign by religious extremists armed , funded and encouraged by the good Christian administration of Jimmy Carter , whose " national security " honcho , Zbigniew Brzezinski , wanted to draw the Soviets into " their own Vietnam " in support of their client regime in Kabul .
Now , as Jason Ditz – an indispensible chronicler of the Terror War in Central Asia – points out , the Americans are adopting the Soviets ' own failed strategy in Afghanistan : death - dealing military " surges " combined with wads of cash thrown blindly into the economic chaos caused by the military action .
But you can't " build " a state while you are simultaneously waging war inside it .
And you certainly can't build it by killing cucumber farmers , as U.S. forces did the other day .
Expect even more of this as the Pentagon gears up its " Drug War " weaponry to eliminate the rivals of its favored criminals – sorry , I mean to wipe out the scourge of Afghanistan 's Taliban drug lord devils .
If all of this seems grimly familiar , that 's because it is .
I 've been writing about the merging of the Terror War and the Drug War in Afghanistan since …
November 2001 , a few scant weeks after the Bush Administration sent the " carpet of bombs " they promised the Taliban – back in June 2001 ; yes , before " the whole world changed " on 9/11 – if they did n't play ball on the oil pipelines that Western consortiums were looking to lay across Afghanistan .
It was obvious even then where we were going , as I noted in the Moscow Times , in that long - ago November :
Among the isolated , out - of - step losers who dare open their mouths to mutter " doubts " about America 's military campaign in Afghanistan , you will sometimes hear the traitorous comment : " This war is just about oil . "
We take stern exception to such cynical tommyrot .
No one who has made a clear and dispassionate assessment of the situation in the region could possibly say the new Afghan war is " just about oil . "
It 's also about drugs .
For , although we must now hail the warlords of the Northern Alliance as noble defenders of civilization , the fact is that for some time they have also functioned as one of the world 's biggest drug - dealing operations .
Indeed , one of the main sticking points between the holy warriors of the alliance and their ideological brethren in the Taliban has been control of the profitable poppy , which by God 's grace grows so plentifully in a land otherwise bereft of natural resources .
( Always excepting the production of corpses . )
In the good old days , when the brethren were united against the Soviet devil , all shared equally in the drug - running trade , under the benevolent eye of that great lubricator of illicit commerce , the CIA .
When the Northern Alliance was driven from Kabul – having killed 50,000 of the city 's inhabitants during their civilized rule – the Taliban seized the lion 's share of Afghanistan 's opium production .
The noble warlords managed to hold on to several prize fields in the north , however , and together with avaricious Talibs , they helped fuel a worldwide rise in heroin traffic .
Earlier this year , the Bush administration bribed the Taliban to stop growing opium – a most effective use of baksheesh , according to the UN , which found that Afghan opium production dropped from 3,300 tons annually to less than 200 .
But the Northern Alliance leapt manfully into the breach , engineering a threefold rise in opium output on their territory this year .
When Square Enix first revealed a tech demo for Final Fantasy VII running on the PS3 , people got excited .
Rumors began flying around that a remake for Final Fantasy VII would be coming , but three years later , it still has n’t happened .
However , that could change .
Talking with VideoGamer , Final Fantasy XIII producer Yoshinori Kitase revealed that news of a Final Fantasy VII remake would “ perhaps ” come soon .
“ As for a VII remake , all I can advise right now is to play the PSN release that just came out for the time being .
Maybe , perhaps we ’ll have some news for you at a later time . ”
Will we be seeing some sort of news at Tokyo Game Show ?
“ Perhaps ” we will .
Stay tuned !

According to a Psychology Today hit piece written by psychologist John Gartner , people prone to thinking that powerful men might actually get together and plan to maintain and advance their power are borderline psychotics who are a danger to society .
In reality , hundreds of years of history has taught us that psychologists routinely aid authoritarian regimes in enforcing tyrannical and inhumane policies while helping them crush political opposition by defining suspicion of authorities as a mental illness .
As we highlighted in our article yesterday , psychologists in the Soviet Union were used to stifle free speech by classifying skepticism and political opposition to the state as a mental illness , which is precisely the implication littered throughout Gartner ’s crass hit piece .
In the former Soviet Union , psikhushkas — mental hospitals — were used by the state as prisons in order to isolate political prisoners , discredit their ideas , and break them physically and mentally .
The Soviet state began using mental hospitals to punish dissidents in 1939 under Stalin .
According to official Soviet psychiatry and the Moscow Serbsky Institute at the time , “ ideas about a struggle for truth and justice are formed by personalities with a paranoid structure . ”
Treatment for this special political schizophrenia included various forms of restraint , electric shocks , electromagnetic torture , radiation torture , lumbar punctures , various drugs — such as narcotics , tranquilizers , and insulin — and beatings .
Anne Applebaum , author of Gulag : A History , indicates that at least 365 sane people were treated for “ politically defined madness , ” although she surmises there were many more .
The profession of psychology blossoms under tyrannical regimes , as is explored in Ulfried Geuter ’s The Professionalization of Psychology in Nazi Germany .
Under Hitler ’s Third Reich , the relationship between the ruling Nazi thugs and psychologists was close and mutually beneficial .
People like Nazi psychologist Robert Ritter , Ph. D. ( pictured top ) were instrumental in persecuting minorities and enforcing eugenicist policies of genocide .
“ From Nazi Germany , South Africa , Russia and the former Yugoslavia , to Iraq today , psychiatry has been and / or remains a key player .
In fact , the marriage between authoritarian government and psychiatry is as old as psychiatry itself , ” writes Jan Eastgate , International President , Citizens Commission on Human Rights , “ In the 1800s , Germany ’s militaristic “ Iron Chancellor , ” Otto von Bismarck , utilized psychiatry to influence and control whole populations in order to fulfill his dreams of conquest through war . ”

In his book Dangerous Minds : Political Psychiatry in China Today and Its Origins in the Mao Era , praised as “ eloquent and convincing ” in a New York Times Review of Books piece , author Robert Munro exposes how psychiatrists and psychologists continue to be at the forefront of the brutal Communist Chinese system of ascribing mental illnesses to those who express even mildly negative political opinions towards the ruling Party .
The book reveals how , “ From the 1950s onward not only Chinese dissidents but people who submitted petitions to the authorities have been detained by the police , examined by psychiatrists , and found to be criminally insane — or , if found mentally “ normal , ” designated as criminals to be cast into the prison system . ”
An official Chinese police designation for those worthy of “ psychiatric custody ” cited by Munro lists people who write anti-government letters , make anti-government speeches or those who merely express opinions on important domestic and international affairs that could be considered anti-government .
But the use of psychologists in the pursuit of inhumane policies is not just resigned to tyrannical regimes of the first half of the 20th century .
Recent revelations surrounding the torture scandal highlight the role of psychologists in what the Physicians for Human Rights organization alleges amounted to “ unlawful human experimentation ” and torture on inmates at Guantánamo , Abu Ghraib , Bagram and other U.S. detention sites .
“ PHR says health professionals participated at every stage in the development , implementation and legal justification of what it calls the CIA ’s secret “ torture programme , ” reports the London Guardian .
Doctors and psychologists actively monitored CIA torture techniques and helped evaluate their effectiveness , a “ violation of core ethical values ” according to the American Medical Association and a flagrant abuse of the 1947 Nuremberg Code , which forbids experimentation on humans without their consent .
The CIA ’s close relationship with psychologists and psychiatrists in conducting illegal torture programs stretches back decades .
“ Historian Alfred W. McCoy has shed light in this area in his recent book A Question of Torture and in numerous articles and interviews , ” writes Stephen Soldz .
“ He documents the decades - long CIA effort to utilized psychological expertise to develop forms of torture that could break down the personality of detainees , rendering them , it was hoped , incapable of withholding desired information .
Many of these technique were utilized during the Vietnam conflict and in the various brutal U.S. - supported counterinsurgency campaigns in Latin American in the 1970s and 1980s . ”
While Psychology Today ’s John Gartner cites a single example of a “ conspiracy theorist ” who voiced support for Alex Jones entering Bohemian Grove armed with guns , and uses it to make the implication that “ conspiracy thinking ” is a major threat to society , documented history stretching back hundreds of years shows that psychologists , and particularly their tactic of classifying suspicion of authorities and “ conspiracy thinking ” as a mental illness , have played a key role in preserving the power of dictatorial elites and helping them to carry out inhumane practices while crushing free speech and legitimate political opposition .

There are some really great takes on South Carolina politics over at the Times , Room For Debate .
This one by Thomas Schaller is really rich on the history :
Thomas Jefferson removed condemnations of slavery from the Declaration of Independence to appease South Carolinian slaveholders .
State loyalists helped the British recapture the state in 1780 from the patriots .
By 1828 , state icon and Vice President John C. Calhoun was advocating state " nullification " of federal powers .
In 1860 , South Carolina became the first state to secede -- and even threatened to secede from the Confederacy because the other southern states refused to re-open the slave trade .
In 1856 , on the Senate floor Congressman Preston Brooks bloodied an abolitionist senator with a cane .
Well into the 20th century , South Carolina 's black citizens observed the Fourth of July mostly alone ; the vast majority of whites preferred instead to celebrate Confederate Memorial Day .
In 1920 , the state legislature rejected the women 's suffrage amendment , finally ratifying it a half century later .
Lots of meat in there ( like ratifying women 's suffrage in 1970 . )
But I am thinking about that Fourth of July point .
It reminds me of some of the research David Blight has done which argues that the first Memorial Day was actually celebrated by blacks in South Carolina .
One of the great tragedies of the past half century or so , is how patriotism has been coopted by people who claim the Confederate flag , while black leaders , from King to Obama , are dismissed as communists / socialists and now Hitlerite .
These are people whose heroes routinely flouted the federal government and assaulted black troops carrying the Union flag .
Remember how Jupiter just got totally rocked by a huge object , leaving a giant scar ?
The Hubble team interrupted their testing of the telescope to aim its sights on this very rare sight , and captured the clearest photo yet .

Hubble was at the time being tested and calibrated , but this kind of massive impact only comes around every few decades or so , and the Hubble team scrambled to aim one of their cameras at Jupiter 's new , massive scar .
The impact site is about the same as the diameter of Earth , though the object that caused it was likely only about 50 - 100 miles across .
The asteroid , or whatever it was , was travelling at somewhere between 31 and 62 miles per second when it smashed into the gas giant near its south pole .
The Hubble 's repairs will actually be delayed due to the need to photograph this event , and wo n't be back online until late summer . [ CNN ]

After laying off his staff , our columnist had time on his hands .
At first , he did n't use it wisely .

In my last column , I told the story of the humble origins of my company , Fog Creek Software .
My co-founder , Michael , and I envisioned the business as a high - end Web consulting shop , until the implosion of that industry forced us to change plans .
By the spring of 2001 , we had laid off the company 's two salaried programmers .
It was just the two of us , working in an old Manhattan brownstone we rented from my grandmother .
We had only two products , the flagship being a simple Web publishing program called CityDesk , which , of course , we thought was going to be as successful as the next Ford Model T , or Cinnabon at the very least .
Unfortunately , success proved elusive .
In May 2001 , we made a scant $ 6,463 from the licenses .
With only two products and with no pesky consulting clients , we had plenty of time on our hands .
We could have focused on writing code to make our software products better .
But instead of doing that , we wasted a lot of time trying to solve all the wrong problems .
One day , for example , Michael was browsing eBay when he found someone selling " THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE CD !!! " -- hundreds of dinky shareware programs for $ 2.49 , including , it appeared , CityDesk .
Software pirates !
Now this was a serious threat to our business .
We began to investigate , and we learned that there was a whole cottage industry of people on eBay trying to make a living by copying CD - ROMs on their home computers and selling them .
This practice blatantly violated the auction site 's rules .
We spent a few days tracking down the right person at eBay to complain to , and we registered Fog Creek with the site 's VeRO program , through which copyright owners can press a claim to have an illegal auction removed from the site .
THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE CD !!!
was booted from eBay , which left us feeling a great sense of victory over a few barely computer - literate eBay vendors -- most of whom seemed to live in Florida ( I 'm just saying ) -- who fell for a make - money - from - home scam .
Auctioning bootleg copies of software was a hopeless business , of course , as CD - ROMs were being displaced by software that you could download .
Trying to make money selling THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE CD !!!
on eBay was like trying to sell a pager to a person who uses an iPhone .
In a final irony , it turned out that the discs actually were n't bootleg copies of our CityDesk , a state - of - the - art Web publishing application that sold for $ 350 , but instead a truly ancient shareware utility with the same name that allowed ugly dot - matrix printers to print pages that were slightly less ugly .
So this was one example of how we wasted our time .
Another way we spun our wheels : putting together " strategic partnerships . "
In general , when someone contacted Fog Creek , we had a hard time figuring out whether the person was proposing a relationship in which money went from them to us or vice versa .
For example , one day , we got a call from a guy who worked at a site that catered to webmasters .
He offered to recommend CityDesk to the site 's users .
" We love CityDesk , " he told us .
Besides , the product the site had previously recommended had gone up in price , and the site did n't want to recommend it any longer .
" Wow ! " I said to myself .
" This could really make CityDesk take off ! "
Naturally , the recommending site wanted a commission on every copy of CityDesk it sold .
Fair enough .
So our friend Neil , taking advantage of the dot - com crash to be between jobs , came into the office and spent a few days negotiating with the site on our behalf .
In the meantime , Michael stopped what he was doing to develop the software to make this commission business work .
He decided to build an affiliate system , modeled on Amazon.com Associates .
The idea was that anybody with a webpage could create a link from his or her site to ours .
The link contained a special code so that when somebody clicked on that link and bought our software , we would know to pay the affiliate a commission .
It took a couple of months of programming to get the affiliate system to work right , but we figured it was worth the effort to close the deal .
We also thought we could incorporate affiliate marketing into our broader promotional scheme .
We imagined millions of websites around the world all promoting CityDesk to make those referral bucks .
As the talks progressed , we hired a lawyer and spent a week putting together a contract , which we submitted to the publisher .
But our would - be partner balked at this suggestion .
" They just want us to sign their standard contract , " Neil said .
Standard contract ?
OK , I 'll take a look .
The first line of the " standard contract " said , in all capital letters , INSERTION ORDER .
And somewhere in my head , a light switched on .
We had n't been talking to a potential strategic partner at all .
We had been talking to an ad - sales guy .
Here we thought we were negotiating an agreement to have a website promote our products in exchange for a commission when , in fact , the site was trying to sell us advertising .
Like I said , in the early days , we were young and naive and did n't always know which way the payments were supposed to flow .
After that , I decided that when I answered a cold call , I would ask directly , " Are you proposing a relationship in which you write checks to us or one in which we write checks to you ?
Because , you know , we took home $ 812 last month , so we wo n't be writing any big checks . "
We did n't do the deal with that website , but we did continue to plug away at our affiliate program .
More than 200 people signed up , and 40 of them actually sold software for us .
But the actual revenue was minuscule ; only three affiliates made more than $ 1,000 .
The rest of them sold one or two copies , and the whole program was an administrative nightmare .
Eventually , we shut it down .
The first three years of Fog Creek were like this .
We tried in vain to find the magical sales and marketing formula that would make our software successful .
We sent letters to existing customers ( on paper , with a stamp ! ) asking if they needed more licenses ; that cost us $ 300 and made $ 500 .
I added a feature to the trial version of CityDesk promising a 25 percent discount to a customer if he or she purchased a license within 72 hours , which required a whole coupon / discount infrastructure that took another couple of months to code up .
That had some effect , but it was by no means a home run .
We could n't afford advertising , but I was able to strike a deal with Programmer 's Paradise , a mail - order catalog of software programming tools .
I would write a one - page column to be printed in the catalog every month , in exchange for a half - page ad for our other product , FogBugz .
That sure saved us a lot of money on advertising -- and , I think , even sold an entire copy of FogBugz .
And finally , we tried something else :
We made our software better .
In late 2002 , we released FogBugz 3.0 , a vastly improved product at a higher price .
The launch was a huge turning point .
Our sales , which had been averaging $ 7,000 a month , shot up to more than $ 30,000 a month .
The effect of making software that had more and better features was dramatic compared with anything else we tried .
All along , we had thought we had a marketing problem .
In reality , what we had was a product problem .
Once we focused on improving the software itself , our business finally found success .
With higher sales , we could finally pay ourselves regularly .
We moved the business into a very nice loft in the Garment District .
And we could soon afford to hire employees again ; I relied on a rule of thumb that we could add another full - time employee each time we produced an additional $ 10,000 a month in revenue .
Through this experience , I learned an important lesson :
When in doubt , make your product more compelling .
All of Fog Creek 's affiliate marketing ideas , coupons , discounts , direct - mail pieces , catalog ads , and everything else we spent time on -- none of this was as good a use of our time as simply doing what we loved best anyway : creating useful software .
The wisdom of The Queen of the WASPs ( and Duchess of REAL America ) shines forth as she blames all of the insurance - organized Astroturfed near - riots at Democratic town halls on the Democrats :
We have entered uncharted territory in the fight over national health care .
There ’s a new tone in the debate , and it ’s ugly .
At the moment the Democrats are looking like something they have n’t looked like in years , and that is : desperate .
They must know at this point they should not have pushed a national health - care plan .
[…. ]
You know what would happen if he did this ( nixed health care legislation ) ?
His numbers would go up .
Even Congress ’s would .
Because they ’d look responsive , deliberative and even wise .
Discretion is the better part of valor .
Absent that , and let ’s assume that wo n’t happen , the health - care protesters have to make sure they do n’t get too hot , or get out of hand .
They have n’t so far , they ’ve been burly and full of debate , with plenty of booing .
This is democracy ’s great barbaric yawp .
But every day the meetings seem just a little angrier , and people who are afraid — who have been made afraid , and left to be afraid — can get swept up .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraqi militias are conducting a campaign of torture and murder against men suspected of homosexual activity , a leading rights group said on Monday , adding that government security forces may be involved .
New York - based Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) said the killings began earlier this year in the poor Sadr City district of Baghdad , once ruled by Shi’ite Muslim militias , and had since spread to many cities across Iraq .
“ The killers invade homes and pick people up in the street , witnesses and survivors said , interrogating them before murdering them to extract the names of other potential victims , ” the rights group said in a statement .
Homosexual conduct is prohibited almost everywhere in the Middle East , but conditions have become especially dangerous for gays and lesbians in Iraq since the rise of religious militias after U.S. - led forces toppled Saddam Hussein 6 - 1/ 2 years ago .
Shi’ite Muslim militias once held sway over many areas of Baghdad and Iraq ’s Shi’ite south , but a series of government crackdowns in the past two years has weakened their presence .
Sunni Islamist militants such as al Qaeda have also spread religious intolerance .
HRW said it had been told that in some attacks Iraqi security forces had “ colluded and joined in the killing . ”
“ Murder and torture are no way to enforce morality ...
These killings point to the continuing and lethal failure of Iraq ’s post - occupation authorities to establish the rule of law and protect their citizens , ” HRW researcher Rasha Moumneh said .
STIGMA , SECRECY
Iraq ’s Interior Ministry said accusations of the involvement of its forces in gay slayings must be accompanied by evidence .
It also said secrecy and stigma attached to homosexuality means that few come forward with complaints of abuse .
“ Unfortunately we do not get clear complaints on this issue .
They ( victims ’ relatives ) consider talking about the subject worse than the crime itself , this is the nature of our society , ” ministry spokesman Major General Abdul - Karim Khalaf said .
The silence means it is difficult to know how many people have been killed in homophobic attacks , but HRW said hundreds may have died .
There is no law against homosexuality in Iraq , but it can be punished under laws meant to protect public order and morality .
In March , the bodies of four gay men were found in Sadr City , each bearing a sign reading “ pervert ” in Arabic , police said .
Many gay Iraqi men have fled to other countries , such as Turkey , out of fear for their lives .
HRW released a report in Beirut on Monday on abuses related to sexual orientation and gender in Iraq .
Its statement carried testimony from victims , including one man who said his partner of 10 years was taken from his home at night in April by four men dressed in black and wearing masks .
“ He was found in the neighborhood the day after .
They had thrown his corpse in the garbage .
His genitals were cut off and a piece of his throat was ripped out , ” the man said .

Botnet is a jargon term for a collection of software robots , or bots , that run autonomously and automatically .
The term is often associated with malicious software but it can also refer to the network of computers using distributed computing software .
While the term " botnet " can be used to refer to any group of bots , such as IRC bots , this word is generally used to refer to a collection of compromised computers ( called Zombie computers ) running software , usually installed via drive - by downloads exploiting Web browser vulnerabilities , worms , Trojan horses , or backdoors , under a common command - and - control infrastructure .
A botnet 's originator ( aka " bot herder " or " bot master " ) can control the group remotely , usually through a means such as IRC , and usually for nefarious purposes .

Saqib Ali is a practicing Muslim who attended high school in Saudi Arabia .
It ’s very impressive that he was elected to the state legislature in Maryland in the first place .
Even more amazing than that is this :
Now the Democratic delegate has come out in support of gay marriage , a position he announced publicly in an op - ed piece he wrote for a local Maryland publication , The Gazette .
In fact , he wrote this :
My stance on this issue is n’t politically expedient .
I am the first Muslim in the legislature .
Homosexuality is strictly forbidden in Islam .
As such I have evinced much grief from my most conservative supporters .
But I recognize that I represent people of all faiths and no faith at all .
If I tried to enforce religion by law — as in a theocracy — I would be doing a disservice to my both constituents and to my religion .
So while he may personally oppose gay marriage — a stance I still find somewhat disturbing — he is putting his own beliefs aside and doing what is right for the people he represents .
That takes courage .
Now why ca n’t other anti-equal - marriage politicians say the same thing ?
Either they really believe gay marriage will ruin our society , in which case they ’re delusional , or they just do n’t want to lose votes ( and will deny rights to their constituents in the process ) , in which case they deserve to get the boot from elected office .
We need more politicians like Ali .

Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos is reported to have agreed a switch to Everton .
Swiss FA claim centre - half is poised for Gunners exit
Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos is reported to have agreed a switch to Everton .
The Swiss centre - half has slipped down the pecking order at Emirates Stadium in recent times , and spent the 2008/09 season on loan at AC Milan .
Despite the Gunners having offloaded Kolo Toure to Manchester City this summer , Arsene Wenger has moved to snap up Thomas Vermaelen from Ajax .
That has ensured that first - team opportunities will prove hard to come by for Senderos this season .
With only one year remaining on his current contract , the Swiss ace is therefore expected to be on his way before the transfer window slams shut .
A move to Goodison Park appears to be on the cards , with a deal believed to already be in place .
The Swiss Football Federation have claimed on their official website that the 24 - year - old has agreed a move to the Toffees .
They claim Senderos is keen on a switch to Merseyside as he eyes a place at next summer 's World Cup .
How big is your body ?
It ’s big as the whole universe or small like the nucleus of an atom , and everything in between .
~ Shinzen Young
Many of you who are regular readers of this blog ( and those who follow my tweets ) know by now that I ’m a big fan of Shinzen Young .
I just love his geeky and no non-sense approach to the dharma .
I consider Shinzen as my primary meditation teacher .
However , I have yet to sit with him on retreats or even meet him in person .
I just listen to his talks , watch his videos , ask him questions via email , read his instructions and apply it to my daily practice .
But even with my limited contact with Shinzen , I still feel a deep sense of kinship and intuitively recognize that he ’s the teacher for me .
So I ’ve decided to make it official that I become his student .
You see , it ’s not that hard to become a student of Shinzen .
No special ceremony .
No bowing or taking of refuge .
No waxing on or waxing off , or doing the yard work .
In short , there are no strings attached .
All one has to do is attend his retreats , whether home or on - site .
And that ’s what I did over the weekend .
I finally attended Shinzen ’s home practice program .
What follows is a first - hand account of my experience with Shinzen ’s innovative approach to doing a retreat .
What the heck is a home practice program ?
The home practice program is a phone - based retreat developed by Shinzen Young .
Here ’s a detailed description on BasicMindfulness.org —
Many people experience immediate positive effects from Mindfulness , but its real power to foster broad and deep psycho-spiritual transformation only becomes evident through ongoing practice .
The problem is that most people are not able to get away on a regular basis to do extended retreats .
Without regular retreats it is usually difficult to realize the exponential growth potential of the practice .
Family and work responsibilities , the expenses involved and the travel required prevent the vast majority of those ready to take on a regular practice from doing so .
To overcome these barriers I have developed a unique program of monthly phone - based “ mini retreats . ”
These retreats involve guided practice , self practice , group discussion and a chance for one - on - one private interviews with a teacher – just like onsite retreats do .
But these retreats are delivered via conference call to your home or anywhere you happen to be in the world .
They typically last four hours .
Here ’s how it works :
1 ) Go to http://basicmindfulness.org – pick a schedule and the type of program .
2) Pay the fee for your chosen program(s ) .
3 ) You ’ll receive the conference call numbers , access codes , and instructions a couple of days before the actual retreat .
4 ) On the day and specified time of the retreat just dial the numbers , follow the instructions and you ’re on your way to four hours of practice .
A retreat over the phone ?
You gotta be kidding me !
Yes , I know what you ’re thinking .
I had the same initial reaction the first time I heard Shinzen talked about his home practice program in one of his Buddhist Geeks interviews .
A phone - based retreat sounds very bland in comparison with an on -site retreat .
Without face to face contact we lose the subtle cues in communication .
And what about the technical issues that might come up ?
For example :
What if I do n’t have a land line phone .
Skype could work , but what if my internet connection drops off ?
Yes , I have a cell phone but my signal sucks , even at home .
And of course , 4 hours of talk time will drain my battery and my airtime minutes !
So these are some of my concerns with a phone - based retreat .
However , after talking with people who actually tried the program I heard nothing but positive feedback .
Some of my concerns were actually just that , knee - jerk concerns .
In actuality cell phone air time is not an issue because I have free nights and weekend minutes ( the phone - based retreats are scheduled on a weekend ) .
Another is that I could charge my cell phone in - between or during the conference call .
I also get a good signal at home .
So I decided to put my concerns to rest and try it out for myself .
Last weekend I signed up for two retreats– Deepening Focus In & Focus Out and Sharpening Focus on Flow — and I ’m glad I did .
The Phone - based retreat ( Press # to continue )
Over the weekend I told my wife that I ’m locking myself in the room for four hours .
I asked her to not disturb me unless it ’s an emergency .
She seemed happy about it because I wo n’t be bugging her and she could do whatever she wanted while I do my retreat thing .
I think she was also glad that I ’ll do the retreat at home rather than drive all the way to Seattle and stay there for the whole day .
In short , it ’s a win -win situation .
For this retreat I relied on my ever - dependable iPhone , with its earphone , so I could hear the instructions better hands - free .
Participants were instructed to dial - in 10 minutes before the start of the retreat for the introductions and pleasantries .
Upon joining the conference call I noticed that some people in the call are already regulars and they knew each other already .
Some had dialed - in from Europe .
During the greetings I even overheard Shinzen asking one of the participants about “ quantum computing . ”
Nice .
How many meditation teachers ask that kind of question before starting the retreat ? 🙂
After the introductions the retreat promptly started on schedule .
The basic structure of the retreat is like this :
1 ) 1 hour and 30 minutes guided meditation with Shinzen .
He guides the participants depending on the theme of the retreat .
He starts the guidance in the subjective space ( feel , image , talk ) and slowly moves on to the objective space ( touch , sight , sound ) .
2 ) 1 - hr break .
During this segment participants are instructed to practice on their own ( e.g. do walking meditation , do simple chores while applying the meditation technique , etc. ) .
Also , during this time , participants can dial Shinzen ’s direct number if they want to have a one on one conversation with him .
3 ) After the break , there is a 30 - minute Q&A with Shinzen .
During this part of the retreat participants are encouraged to share their experiences and ask Shinzen about specific concerns or questions regarding meditation techniques .
4 ) 1 hour guided meditation with Shinzen .
He guides the participants into ever deeper and broader application of the meditation technique .
I highly recommend to get to know Shinzen ’s lingo first before trying out the phone - based retreat .
You would have an optimal retreat experience if you ’re familiar with Shinzen ’s Five Ways before you jump into the home practice program .
Here ’s a video of Shinzen explaining the five aspects of the Five Ways .
In addition , all the reading and listening materials you need are available on the reading and audio section at Basic Mindfulness .
Once you do your homework , you ’ll appreciate the clarity of Shinzen ’s style of teaching .
Pros and Cons of the Home Practice Program
In general I found the home practice program to be very focused and extremely helpful in developing the meditation techniques taught by Shinzen .
I learned a lot in one weekend .
However , there are pros and cons to this kind of retreat .
Let ’s start with the cons :
– Lack of physical proximity with the teacher could result in loss of subtle cues in communication .
– Less social interaction with the participants .
– Less social pressure to conform .
For example , if a participant has no discipline then she could be easily deviate from the meditation session since no one would be watching her during the retreat .
– Technical issues might come up .
For example , I got disconnected once during the conference call .
I blame my carrier .
And now the pros :
– Anyone from anywhere ( e.g. home , library , bus , train , secluded park , etc. ) can join in .
At one time there were more than 60 people logged in from all over the U.S. and some from Europe .
– Conversations and Q&A are more focused due to less distractions from other participants .
– Less social pressure to conform .
For example , participants ( especially introverted types ) could feel more at ease in the comfort of their own home .
– Less distraction from other people , especially if your sangha is infested with jerks , cute guys / girls , or smelly hippies who gave up basic hygiene 🙂
– It ’s cheaper .
No need to pay separately for the retreat facility and dana for the teacher .
– More eco-friendly .
No need to drive to the retreat center hence less carbon footprint .
– And this is what I like best : Private communication with the teacher .
I really appreciate a direct contact with Shinzen Young .
He communicates well with his students via phone and / or email .
He responds promptly and patiently to theoretical as well as practical questions .
Bottom line
All in all , the pros of home practice program greatly outweighs the cons .
Shinzen calls the home practice program a “ mini retreat ” .
It ’s not meant as replacement for extended on - site retreats .
It ’s a supplement to on - site retreats , as well as an alternative for those who do n’t have the opportunity to do on - site retreats .
I ’m looking forward to my next phone - based retreat already .
Maybe in the near future when Second Life is more advanced and the internet has more bandwidth people will be able to do a more satisfying virtual retreats online .
In the meantime , the phone - based retreat gets the job done .
Give it a try .
I ’m confident that you ’ll agree with me that Shinzen Young ’s home practice program is an awesome dharma delivery system .
ADDENDUM : Soon after I posted my first - hand account of Shinzen ’s phone - based home practice program I saw this video on ShinzenInterviews channel .
It ’s an interview by Stephanie Nash with Shinzen about guided meditation on the phone .

Work in Alaska looks at life in a warmer , wetter world .
Lakes seep over the Arctic tundra Punchstock
In the largest experiment of its kind to date , ecologists have found that the wetter the Arctic tundra becomes , the more carbon dioxide it gives off .
If the tundra becomes increasingly warm and wet — which is anticipated as global temperatures rise — it might emit more carbon than expected , the work suggests .
" It 's a big deal , " says Walter Oechel , an ecologist at San Diego State University in California and principal investigator on the study .
" These are aspects that have n't been recognized before . "
His colleague Donatella Zona reported the findings in Albuquerque , New Mexico , on 3 August at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America .
The Arctic region locks up large amounts of carbon in its soil and permafrost , and researchers are working to tease out the complex relationships that might govern what happens to that carbon in a globally warmed world .
So Oechel 's team set out to deliberately manipulate the water table of a portion of the tundra .
The wetter it gets
Previous experiments to test the relationship between increasing water depth and carbon flux have all been on a much smaller scale , such as testing core soil samples in the laboratory or small field studies , says Zona .
For the latest work , the team chose as their test site a 1.2 - kilometre - long lake in the North Slope region of Alaska .
It lies about 10 kilometres away from the coastal town of Barrow and is part of a long - term ecological study region called the Barrow Environmental Observatory .
Using plastic dikes , the researchers divided the lake into three parts .
From the centre third they pumped water into the northern third , leaving the northern part extra soggy and the centre portion dry .
They left the southern part untouched , as a control .
Instrument towers , one above each portion , gathered data on the emission of trace gases such as methane and CO 2 .
The team thought that the higher water table would probably mean less CO 2 entering the air .
Rising water drowns both the vegetation and the ' aerobic ' microbes that rely on oxygen to decompose the plant matter , giving off CO 2 in the process .
So the greater the depth of water above the surface , the less oxygen and light penetrates to stimulate microbes in the soil beneath , hence presumably resulting in the release of less CO 2 .
But measurements from the partitioned lake showed the opposite : the northern , flooded portion of the lake gave off more CO 2 , becoming a carbon source , whereas the drained portion and the control portion remained as carbon sinks .
Apparently , Zona says , anaerobic microbes in the soil — those that do n't require oxygen but can still produce CO 2 — thrived under the drowned land .
This , she says , suggests that hydrological changes in the Arctic could have " unexpected results — huge amounts of carbon in the soil could be released to the atmosphere even under completely anaerobic conditions " .
Permafrost under the flooded lake also thawed to greater depths than that under the drained lake , Zona says .
ADVERTISEMENT
Jeffrey Welker , an ecologist at the University of Alaska in Anchorage , says that a deeper thaw means that older carbon — perhaps 1,000 years old rather than 100 years old — gets released from the soil .
" We 're beginning to see evidence that deeper , older carbon will be entering the atmosphere in the future , " he says .
The implications of that are still unclear .
At the moment , ecologists are monitoring changes in the Arctic as best as they can , trying to quantify differences from year to year .
Early data from the lake manipulation have also revealed trends in methane emissions — as they reported earlier this year in Global Biogeochemical Cycles1 .
In that paper , Zona and colleagues show that methane emissions at the lake were at a maximum when the water level was just covering the ground surface .
Together , such work underscores the complexity of interactions in the Arctic system and shows just how much researchers have left to understand .
For now , Zona and her colleagues are gathering another summer 's worth of data to see what they reveal about both CO 2 and methane fluxes .
" We think it 's interesting even if it 's a short - term trend , " she says .

'' Six months ago the concern was we would see unhealthily large declines in asset prices , but clearly that threat has passed , '' Dr Richards told a conference on housing affordability .
'' When the price of housing rises , higher - income households tend to benefit at the expense of lower - income households , '' he said .
'' As a nation , we are not really any richer when the price of housing rises . ''
A big contributor to the problem was massive population growth at a time of stagnation in house building .
While Australia 's population grew by 340,000 a year over the past five years ( a jump of 40 per cent over the preceding five years ) , the number of new houses being built fell more than 3 per cent - from 155,000 a year to 150,000 .
Dr Richards said one reason for the housing shortfall was the difficulty and cost of developing land - typical lots on city fringes cost more than $ 150,000 .
He said governments should do more to improve public transport and infrastructure to encourage development .
The conference also heard fresh claims that grants for first home buyers were exacerbating the affordability crisis .
Louis Christopher , head of property research firm SQM , said the grants had encouraged price inflation at the lower end of the market .

There is a bit of a debate going on right now about whether or not organic produce is better for your health than produce grown with pesticides and possibly contaminated .
While there are studies cited that support both sides of the debate in terms of nutritional value , the fact of the matter is that your health is likely to benefit from eating more fruits and vegetables .
Period .
( Bonus points for growing your own produce in a garden . )
If you are concerned about contamination , however , consider guidelines offered by the non-partisan , non-profit Environmental Working Group .
This group evaluated FDA and USDA pesticide tests and came up with recommendations for buying organic produce .
Commonly contaminated produce
The Environmental Working Group recommends that you watch out for produce that has high levels of contamination by pesticides .
If you are concerned about the harmful effects of pesticides on your body ( or your children ’s ) , consider spending a little extra time and money to procure organically grown versions of these fruits and vegetables :
Apples
Carrots
Celery
Cherries
Grapes ( imported )
Kale
Lettuce
Nectarines
Peaches
Pears
Sweet bell peppers
Strawberries
These are types of produce that either has thin skin , or has skin that might be eaten .
With pesticides more easily absorbed into the above fruits and vegetables , and the chances that even washing might not get rid of the contamination , it is possible that you are more vulnerable to these types of produce .
Try to get organic produce if possible
The next classification by the Environmental Working Group addresses economic realities .
While the first category brings the specter of common contamination , the produce in this group is not quite so high - risk .
Natural protections some of these fruits and vegetables have against pests ( requiring less need for pesticides ) , as well as the fact the skins are often thicker , means that there is a little less possible contamination .
However , if you can afford it , the Group recommends that you get these fruits and vegetables from organic sources :
Bananas
Cantaloupe
Cauliflower
Collard greens
Cranberries
Cucumbers
Grapefruit
Grapes ( domestic )
Green beans
Honeydew
Mushrooms
Oranges
Peppers
Plums
Raspberries
Summer squash
Tangerines
Winter squash
Least contaminated vegetables and fruits
For various reasons , there are some types of produce that have a low incidence of contamination by pesticides .
If you want to get these organically , great .
If you are concerned about your budget , or not convinced that organic is the way to go , you are least likely to run into pesticides if you choose the following kinds of produce :
Asparagus
Avocado
Broccoli
Cabbage
Eggplant
Kiwi
Mango
Onions
Papaya
Pineapple
Sweet corn
Sweet peas
Sweet potatoes
Tomatoes
Watermelon
Other benefits of organic produce
Beyond helping you avoid ingesting potentially harmful pesticides , there are some other benefits to organic produce .
Advocates point out that even if you are skeptical of the pesticide argument ( which holds the most water with many people ) , there are other reasons to consider a preference for organic produce .
First of all , there are arguments that organic produce has more nutrients due to maturing on the plant .
While some studies dispute the idea that organic gardening results in more nutrient - rich produce , there are those that insist that organically grown fruits and vegetables must naturally have more nutritional value .
This is because the nutritional peak is considered to be right at ripeness .
Many of today ’s large operations harvest early , before ripeness develops , meaning that the full nutritional potential is not reached .
Secondly , there is the idea that organic methods allow for more energy to be expended in the development nutrients .
Using fertilizer , the argument goes , stimulates faster growth than is natural , and that means that more of the plant ’s energy goes to growth , rather than to actual nutrients .
Finally , many advocates of organic produce point out that it is helpful to local farmers and businesses and less damaging to the environment .
Local producers can receive compensation for their goods , and support their families .
Additionally , if you buy local you wo n’t be contributing to demand from far off and contributing to the need for polluting trucks to transport the produce .
In the end , it depends on whether you believe these claims about organic food .
Most people are likely to consider buying organic produce in some cases , and mixing their non-organic purchases with their organic produce .
It ’s all about a matter of personal preference .
However , it is nice to have a little more information to help you make your decision .

For my father John Standish Fforde 1920 - 2000
Who never knew I was to be published but would have been most proud nonetheless — and not a little surprised .
Quotations
Now that Bernie Madoff is ensconced in federal prison , we 've all grown a bit tired of the story .
But things could get a little more interesting , as one of Madoff 's key minions - Frank DiPascali Jr. - is expected to be charged today and to plead guilty to , multiple criminal charges , including conspiracy , securities fraud , perjury and tax evasion .
It only takes two to conspire , so it is possible that DiPascali schemed only with Madoff .
But , unlike Madoff , DiPascali apparently has a plea deal with the government .
And it of course seems unlikely the government would make a deal with DiPascali without a trade of information .
With Bernie already locked up for life , information about the fraud is really only interesting to the extent he tells prosecutors who else knew about and helped orchestrate the Ponzi scheme .
There is no confirmation of what the cooperation deal entails , but speculation is rampant that DiPascali has agreed to do what Madoff would not - turn on his partners in fraud .
The hearing is scheduled for 3 PM today in front of U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan .
The list of expected charges , provided by the U.S. Attorney 's office , is here .
UPDATE : The Wall Street Journal reports that DiPascali , who has called himself " the director of options trading " of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC , told the court that the trasactions were all " fictitious " and that he " knew it was wrong at the time . "
The article indicates DiPascali said others , in addition to Madoff , were involved in the the scheme .
Each fraud and money - laundering charge carries as much as a 20 - year prison sentence .

" Silent " strokes , which are strokes that do n't result in any noticeable symptoms but cause brain damage , are common in people over 60 , and especially in those with high blood pressure , according to a study published in the July 28 , 2009 , print issue of Neurology® , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology .
" These strokes are not truly silent , because they have been linked to memory and thinking problems and are a possible cause of a type of dementia , " said study author Perminder Sachdev , MD , PhD , of the University of New South Wales in Sydney , Australia .
" High blood pressure is very treatable , so this may be a strong target for preventing vascular disease . "
The study involved 477 people age 60 to 64 who were followed for four years .
At the beginning of the study 7.8 percent of the participants had the silent lacunar infarctions , small areas of damage to the brain seen on MRI that never caused obvious symptoms .
They occur when blood flow is blocked in one of the arteries leading to areas deep within the brain , such as the putamen or the thalamus .
By the end of the study , an additional 1.6 percent of the participants had developed " silent " strokes .
People with high blood pressure were 60 percent more likely to have silent strokes than those with normal blood pressure .
Also , people with another type of small brain damage called white matter hyperintensities were nearly five times as likely to have silent strokes as those without the condition .
The study was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia .

A judge overturned a law that required women seeking an abortion to receive an ultrasound and a doctor ’s description of the fetus .
The judge , Vicki Robertson , said the law violated constitutional requirements that legislative measures deal only with one subject .
State Senator Todd Lamb , the law ’s principal author , said he would he would ask the attorney general to appeal the injunction and , if unsuccessful , would probably introduce a replacement measure next year .
“ Gates then turned to me and told me that I had no idea who I was ‘ messing ’ with and that I had not heard the last of it , ’’ the report said .
“ While I was led to believe that Gates was lawfully in the residence , I was quite surprised and confused with the behavior he exhibited toward me . ’’
The Cambridge police report describes a chaotic scene in which the police sergeant stood at Gates ’s door , demanded identification , and radioed for assistance from Harvard University police when Gates presented him with a Harvard ID .
A visibly upset Gates responded to the officer ’s assertion that he was responding to a report of a break - in with , “ Why , because I ’m a black man in America ? ’’
Said Bobo :
“ The whole interaction should have ended right there , but I guess that was n’t enough .
The officer felt he had n’t been deferred to sufficiently . ’’
Gates showed his Harvard identification and Massachusetts drivers license with his home address , Ogletree said , adding , “ Even after presentation of ID , the officer was still questioning his presence . ’’
Gates ’s lawyer and Harvard colleague , Charles Ogletree , said what angered his client was that the police officer stepped inside Gates ’s Ware Street house , uninvited , to demand identification and question him .
Neither Gates - who was named one of Time magazine ’s most influential Americans in 1997 and now directs the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research at Harvard - nor police would comment on the incident yesterday .
“ It ’s unbelievable , ’’ said Lawrence Bobo , a Harvard sociologist who visited Gates at the police station last Thursday and drove him home after Gates posted the $ 40 bail .
“ I felt as if I were in some kind of surreal moment , like ‘ The Twilight Zone . ’
I was mortified .
. . .
This is a humiliating thing and a pretty profound violation of the kind of trust we all take for granted . ’’
But the encounter is anything but over .
Some of Gates ’s outraged colleagues said the run-in proves that even in a liberal enclave like Harvard Square , even with someone of Gates ’s accomplishments , a black man is a suspect before he is a resident .
It ended when Gates , 58 , was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct in allegedly shouting at the officer ; he was eventually taken away in handcuffs .
The scene - two black men on the porch of a stately home on a tree - lined Cambridge street in the middle of the day - triggered events that were at turns dramatic and bizarre , a confrontation between one of the nation ’s foremost African - American scholars and a police sergeant responding to a call that someone was breaking into the house .
His front door refused to budge , which is why Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. , just home from a trip to China filming a PBS documentary , set his luggage down and beckoned his driver for help .
When the officer repeatedly told Gates he would speak with him outside , the normally mild - mannered professor shouted , “ Ya , I ’ll speak with your mama outside , ’’ according to the report .
Gates was arrested after “ exhibiting loud and tumultuous behavior ’’ toward the officer who questioned him , the report said .
Gates , who came to Harvard in 1991 , was “ shocked and dismayed by what happened to him , ’’ Ogletree said .
“ What we hope is the charges against Professor Gates will be dropped , because he certainly did n’t break the law while entering his own home , ’’ Ogletree said yesterday by phone .
He would not say whether he thinks racial bias played a role in Gates ’s arrest .
Harvard president Drew G. Faust said yesterday that she was “ obviously very concerned ’’ when she learned about the incident .
“ Professor Gates is not only a colleague but also a friend , ’’ she said in a statement .
“ He and I spoke directly , and I have asked him to keep me apprised . ’’
Harvard has grappled with the issue of racial bias in recent years , even appointing an independent commission last fall to look into how the university could create a more welcoming environment after some black students and faculty complained of unfair treatment by the university ’s predominantly white police force .
Faust said in the spring that she hopes to implement some of the report ’s recommendations by September , but it is unclear what they would be .
The arrest of such a prominent scholar under what some described as dubious circumstances shook the campus .
“ He and I both raised the question of if he had been a white professor , whether this kind of thing would have happened to him , that they arrested him without any corroborating evidence , ’’ said S. Allen Counter , a Harvard Medical School professor who spoke with Gates Friday .
“ I am deeply concerned about the way he was treated . ’’
Counter has faced a similar situation himself .
The neuroscience professor , who is black , was stopped by two Harvard police officers in 2004 after being mistaken for a robbery suspect as he crossed Harvard Yard .
“ This is very disturbing that this could happen to anyone , and not just to a person of such distinction , ’’ Counter said .
“ It brings up the question of whether black males are being targeted by Cambridge police for harassment . ’’
Police say they were simply responding to a call from a woman who suspected a crime was taking place .
When the front door would not open , even with the driver ’s help , Ogletree said Gates walked around to the back door , unlocked it , shut off the alarm system , and tried to open the door from the inside .
It still did not work , so he went back outside and , with the driver , pushed it in .
Gates immediately called Harvard ’s real estate office to report the broken door .
While he was on the phone , police Sergeant James Crowley arrived and asked Gates to step outside , said Ogletree .
Gates , indignant , refused , telling the officer that he lived there and that he works at Harvard .
When Crowley asked for proof , Gates initially refused , according to the police report .
But Ogletree said Gates cooperated fully , walking into his kitchen for his wallet .
The officer followed .
Gates “ did ask him some pointed questions , like : ‘ Is this happening because you ’re a white cop and I ’m a black man ?
Is this why this interaction is still taking place ? ’ ’’ Bobo said .
“ Who ’s not going to feel upset and insulted when a police officer wo n’t accept the fact that you ’re standing in your own living room ? ’’
Gates asked the officer several times for his name and badge number to file a complaint as the officer left the house .
The police report said that when Crowley walked out of the home , Gates followed and continued to accuse the officer of racism .
Crowley then handcuffed him .
Gates initially resisted , according to police , asserting that he was disabled and would fall without a cane .
The officer reentered the home to fetch a cane .
Gates was then taken in a police cruiser to department headquarters , where he remained for four hours , Ogletree said .
Gates is scheduled to be arraigned on Aug. 26 .

Today , with the announcement that Harvard University Press will publish 1,000 digitized books on Scribd , the academic world took one more step in its glacially slow march into the digital age .
Over ten years ago , when I first started my graduate work in the humanities , there was already much talk of the looming crisis in academic publishing .
Print runs for academic works written by even major scholars in a given discipline are pitifully small — 1,000 would be considered decent - sized .
The work of junior faculty , who are trying to publish to beef up a CV , means that the runs are smaller still . �
It 's very hard to make money on such small print runs , which result in books with sky - high cover prices and limited availability .
All of this has made it harder for scholars to publish and harder for non-specialists to justify the effort and expense of obtaining good , scholarly work .
In sum , the present situation benefits nobody — scholars , the public , or the financially strapped publishing houses .
But there 's a bit of a chicken - and - egg problem to moving scholarship online .
Scholarly publishers , which are central to the all - important vetting and peer review process , do n't do digital , and they look down on anything published in a digital format .
And that attitude pervades the academic community : scholars still pursue the peer - reviewed printed book as the ultimate CV trophy and turn their noses up a digital , giving the publishers little incentive to experiment with digital distribution . �
But , as HUP 's tiny little 1,000 - book foray into the world of digital possibly indicates , academic publishers may be forced into the arms of digital by the same rapidly changing circumstances that are pushing regular book publishers toward outlets like Scribd .
It 's widely known that Harvard 's endowment has imploded during the financial meltdown , and , like other universities with newly diminished financial prospects , the ( relatively ) cash - strapped school is making some very painful cost - cutting decisions .
I would n't be surprised if HUP were feeling serious pressure to improve numbers that are probably quite bad — indeed , I 'd be surprised if the publisher was not getting squeezed by the university .
My personal hope is that other cash - strapped publishing houses will bite the bullet , move their entire libraries to digital , and send their authors a complimentary , book - shaped box of tissues to cry into when they contemplate the loss of their name on a hardcover .
Even if publishers have to downsize , they could still fill the same crucial vetting function while profitably making scholarship available to anyone who can use Google .
If you want a glimpse at the future of scholarly communication , take a look around the econoblogosphere , which has analyzed the crisis in real - time using Scribd to distribute whitepapers , research reports , slide decks , articles , etc .
Two decades ago , it would 've taken a discipline many years to produce as much detailed and useful analysis of such a large , complex event as the finance and economics profession has produced in the last ten months . �
Good work has risen to the top nearly instantly ; witness the rise of Rortybomb , which went from obscure to regularly cited with a single plug by finance uberblogger Felix Salmon .
�Across the Curve , sprang from nowhere to become the place for following the action in the bond market when the credit crisis was at its peak .
Of course , I 'm not offering up the collective product of the econoblogosphere as " scholarship , " but rather as a model for what scholarly communication could look like in a few years , after the economics of print publishing have finally deteriorated to the point that the academy is forced to adapt .
A further step toward a police state
Obama seeks to institutionalize indefinite detention
5 August 2009
Press reports have revealed that the Obama administration is considering the creation of a prison and court complex on US soil to process and hold current and future terrorist suspects .
It would include a facility to indefinitely detain people held without trial or any other constitutionally mandated due process rights .
The reports underscore the profoundly antidemocratic agenda of the Obama administration , which is not only carrying on the Bush administration ’s sweeping and quasi- dictatorial assertions of executive authority , but is seeking to institutionalize them .
Administration officials have referred to the proposal as “ a courtroom within a detention facility ” that would be jointly operated by the departments of Defense , Homeland Security , and Justice .
It would combine civilian courts and military commissions , further eroding the principle of a constitutionally independent civilian judiciary .
It would mark a further assault on the bedrock democratic right of habeas corpus , i.e. , the right to challenge one ’s detention in a court of law .
The plan is being considered by a presidential task force , which is at the same time entertaining other possible measures to deal with the current Guantánamo prison population , numbered at 229 , as well as future prisoners seized in the “ war on terror . ”
The task force could make public some of its proposals this month .
In the context of the Obama administration ’s insistence that the president , as the commander in chief , has the prerogative to order the arrest and incarceration of “ terror suspects ” — US citizens included — the proposal for the maximum security prison and court complex is especially ominous .
While Obama has dropped formal use of the term “ enemy combatant , ” his administration has in all essentials carried on the Bush administration policy , as a federal judge pointed out in a recent ruling in the case of Abdul Rahim al Janko .
( See : “ A change in name only : Obama administration ends use of ‘ enemy combatant ’ designation ” ) .
Similarly , the administration defends the practice of rendition , in which alleged terrorists are abducted by US intelligence agents and transported for interrogation — and torture — to other countries .
And it opposes any investigation or prosecution of Bush administration officials who approved and oversaw the use of torture at Guantánamo , US military prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan , and secret CIA - run black sites around the world .
Within the proposed prison - court complex , detainees could be subjected to federal criminal trials , military commissions or indefinite detention without trial , administration sources say .
This third category would apply to prisoners the administration declares to be dangerous , but for whom incriminating evidence is scant or was gathered through torture .
Additionally , prisoners cleared of all terrorism - related charges , but who find no country willing to accept them , could also be jailed at the new facility .
The indifference of the US political establishment and the media to democratic rights is such that a plan for indefinite detention even of those declared by the government to be innocent raises barely a murmur of criticism , with the Washington Post offhandedly noting that “ a new stateside facility could include a lower - security unit ... for detainees who have been cleared for release . ”
Administration sources indicate that the Obama administration may seek some form of congressional approval should it move the plan forward , the transparent aim being to lend a democratic veneer to profoundly antidemocratic policies that would establish the framework for the suppression of political dissent and repression on a massive scale .
The proposal exposes the token and cynical nature of Obama ’s executive order to close Guantánamo , issued the week he entered office — to great media fanfare .
The action was driven by a desire to remove what had become an international symbol of American lawlessness and brutality , with negative consequences for the aims of US imperialism around the world .
Behind the effort to improve Washington ’s image , the antidemocratic substance remains .
The prison - court complex proposal is in line with a general assertion by the administration of sweeping and virtually unchecked executive powers .
Obama ’s Justice Department has made clear its determination to broaden the judicial interpretation of the “ state secrets ” privilege , on the basis of which the government has moved to shut down , in the name of national security , court challenges lodged by victims of the Bush administration ’s policies of rendition , torture and domestic spying .
Last month , Justice Department lawyers filed a friend - of - the - court brief in a Supreme Court case dealing with attorney - client privilege .
The last five pages of the brief were dedicated to a defense of the state secrets doctrine — even though it was not germane to the case at hand .
The brief aims to elicit a directive from the Supreme Court on state secrets to the effect that the privilege is rooted in the Constitution — the dubious position Obama has carried on from Bush — and that therefore government appeals of lower court rulings rejecting state secrets claims should be allowed to go directly to higher courts , rather than waiting for the case in question to first be resolved .
The Justice Department brief cites a decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upholding the dismissal of a lawsuit mounted by a German citizen , Khaled el - Masri , who charged that he had been abducted and tortured by the CIA .
A report by the Council of Europe confirmed Masri ’s claims .
But the case was dismissed on the basis of the Bush Justice Department ’s assertion of state secrets .
Attorney Jon B. Eisenberg called the Obama administration brief a recapitulation of “ the good old Bush - Cheney inherent presidential power theory . ”
Eisenberg represents a charity , Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation of Oregon , that claims it was the object of warrantless electronic surveillance during the Bush administration .
Obama administration lawyers invoked the state secrets privilege in a bid to prevent the charity ’s attorneys from viewing government evidence against their clients .
The implications of the state secrets claim are clear enough .
“ By giving the executive branch close to unilateral power to have lawsuits dismissed on national security grounds , the privilege can become a way to conceal government misconduct , ” writes New York Times legal correspondent Adam Liptak .
Here again , Obama ’s rhetoric about “ change ” stands exposed .
“ On the campaign trail and in more recent statements , President Obama has indicated that he wants to limit the use of the state secrets privilege , ” Liptak notes .
“ In courtrooms , however , there has been little evidence of a new approach . ”
If anything , Obama has intensified his predecessor ’s attack on democratic rights .
This is because , in the most fundamental sense , basic democratic principles are incompatible with the central policies of the American ruling class — the expansion of militarism and war abroad , and a further redistribution of wealth from the working class to the financial elite at home .
Obama ’s latest moves once again demonstrate the impossibility of defending basic liberties within the framework of the existing political and economic setup , and the need for an independent political movement of the working class to defend democratic rights .

The Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal set sail today for the first time following a £ 12 million refurbishment .
The 20,000 tonne warship sailed out of Portsmouth Naval Base to embark on two weeks of post - maintenance tests .
The ship will be undergoing marine and engineering trials in the navy 's training areas off the south west of England .
HMS Ark Royal takes to the seas in Portsmouth Harbour , following a £ 12 million refurbishment
Members of the crew are seen aboard HMS Ark Royal .
The 20,000 tonne warship sailed out of Portsmouth Naval Base to embark on two weeks of post - maintenance tests
A navy spokesman said that Ark Royal is now ' faster , leaner and greener ' following the revamp .
The upgrade work , carried out by BVT Surface Fleet , included painting the hull with new ' intersleek ' paint which enables it to cut through the seas more quickly .
This cuts fuel and emissions by 9 per cent and also increases the ship 's top speed by two knots to 30 knots .
Other work included new exhaust systems , an updated IT network and improvements to the sewage treatment plants , gearboxes , main engines and diesel generators .

Once the sea trials are complete , Ark Royal will resume its role as fleet flagship in the new year , taking over from its sister ship HMS Illustrious .
Commanding officer Captain John Clink said : ' The ship 's company is excited and proud to be taking Ark Royal back to sea to commence our preparations to become the Royal Navy 's strike carrier and the UK 's fleet flagship .
' I recognise that our seven months in Portsmouth has been hard work but it has ensured that we are ready to start our sea training and be able to practice our war - fighting skills .
' The ship is now faster , leaner and greener and looking forward to taking her place at the vanguard of the fleet . '
As she was : The Ark Royal at the Swan hunter shipyard after being launched by the Queen Mother in 1981
Five ships of the Royal Navy have been known as the HMS Ark Royal .
The first was built in 1587 on the order of Sir Walter Raleigh and was the flagship of the English fleet during the Spanish Armada campaign of 1588 .
The second was launched in 1914 and served in the Dardanelles Campaign and throughout World War I .
The third was launched in 1937 and participated in the search to find the German destroyer , Bismarck , which had been ravaging the British fleet in the Atlantic .
Sailing through a ferocious storm the Ark Royal tracked the Bismarck .
A dozen swordfish bombers took off from her deck and pounded shell after shell into the German battleship , sending her to the ocean floor .
It was a signal victory that resonated around the world .
Hitler , furious at the loss of the German fleet 's flagship , demanded that the Ark Royal be destroyed at whatever cost .
In her first two years of operation this Ark Royal survived countless attacks , and was considered one of the luckiest ships in the Navy .
But her air of invincibility was to prove wishful thinking .
Within one month of sinking the Bismarck , the Ark Royal too was destroyed while sailing off the coast of Gibraltar .
The present Ark Royal was built by Swan Hunters Ship Builders ' yard at Wallsend in December 1978 and launched by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother .
HMS Ark Royal was accepted into service on 1 July 1985 .
Some might ask , why play games on a graphing calculator with rudimentary graphics and no sound , when there are superior portable gaming options these days ?
That ’s like asking a mountain climber why he climbs Mt Everest when there are easier mountains to climb .
The climber will answer : because it is there .
Thus we program and play TI - 83 games because we can .
Some do it for the sheer rush of subverting a learning tool for gaming purposes , while others revel in the gloriousunion between serious math and utter frivolity .
The TI - 83 ( including the TI - 83 + and TI - 83 + SE ) is one of the most criminally overlooked gaming platforms in all of so - called games journalism , and its gaming powers are n’t just limited to the RPGs we ’re covering today .
For more TI resources , including basic tutorials and game downloads , head toticalc.org .
And for the record , this article ’s affiliation with Games Radar ’s so - called “ Week of Geek ” is tenuous at best , since the broad appeal of TI - 83 gaming is undeniable .
5 ) DRUG WARS
Download
While not truly among the top five TI - 83 RPGs of all time ( other serious RPGs like The Verdante Forest or Shadow of Narkemen are technically superior ) , Drug Wars must be included here simply because it ’s the quintessential TI - 83 experience that everyone who ’s anyone with a TI graphing calculator has played .
As the drug dealer protagonist , your goal is simply to buy and sell enough drugs to pay off your loan from the loan shark with some cool change to spare .
Drug Wars has spawned many variations and clones , including Dope Wars , Drug Lord , Hobo Wars , Whore Wars , Nerd Wars and so forth .

Wars for DS even features aversionof Drug Wars in the form of a persistent , interactive drug - based economy where the player must smuggle limited inventory while balancing a risk - to - reward ratio .
YOKOHAMA , Japan ( Reuters )  Nissan , Japan ’s third - largest automaker , took the wraps off its much - awaited electric car on Sunday , naming the hatchback the Leaf .
Nissan and its French partner , Renault , have been aggressive proponents of pure electric vehicles with no emissions , announcing plans to mass - market the clean but expensive cars globally in 2012 .
Nissan will begin selling the first Leaf cars in the United States , Japan and Europe toward the end of 2010 , adding two more models soon after .
It expects initial annual production capacity of 50,000 units , which will rise to 200,000 units when the car is introduced globally in 2012 .
Coordinating the car ’s introduction with the inauguration of Nissan ’s global headquarters in Yokohama , south of Tokyo , the chief executive , Carlos Ghosn , drove up to the stage in a sky - blue Leaf prototype .
Nissan is returning to the port city of Yokohama , where it was founded in 1933 , after being based in Tokyo ’s high - end Ginza shopping district for 41 years .
OK , so I had a bit of a debate with my girlfriend this weekend and I am trying to figure out 2 things :
1 . Do you pee in the shower ?
I most certainly do .
And I see nothing wrong with it ta - boot .
2 . Do you pee in the shower while your significant other is in there with you ?
This was my major mistake this weekend .
I decided to go the usual route and pee while in the shower , forgetting that this might upset my special someone who happened to be showering with me .
Long story short , I got thrown out of the bathroom and some yelling ensued .
I spoke to my buddy about it and he had done the same thing ( with the same results ) a few days before me .
A weather plasmoid in python
Ever since I heard about plasma I was eager to find ways to write my own plasmoid .
But for the development of binary plasmoids , it is necessary to compile at least a part of kde4 , at least this is what I understood from the prerequisite listed on the official tutorial .
This discouraged me a bit .
Moreover , I think that installation of the binary gadgets also requires to either package them properly according to the distribution you want to distribute for or you need to provide the sources that requires the users to build them .
This in my opinion is really a huge overhead for small applications like desktop gadgets / widgets .
Then I found that it is also possible to develop plasmoids with script languages like python , ruby and javascript .
Even though , I did n’t know PyQT4 or PyKDE4 libraries at all , I decided to write my first plasmoid in python .
This is an exremely simple plasmoid , the core of which was put together in a few hours on a rainy weekend .
I have to admit that being a java developer , my code is not pythonic enough .
It can be downloaded from : kde -look .
Here the source code : plasma_pyweather .
The layout is based on my conky setup described here .
I have tried to keep it as compact as possible including most of the provided information , if not all .
I do n’t want the weather information to cover most of the screen .
The initial version of the plasmoid was written using the QT4 widgets , but was looking ugly .
The weather information is fetched from google weather api .
The location and the unit are configurable .
The api provides forecast only for the next 3 days , so the number of forecast days were not made configurable .
Some how for google weather api the locale and so the unit is connected to the language , therefor I had to convert the units myself .
To keep the display compact I rounded the temperatures to integers .
I got to learn PyQT4 and PyKDE4 libraries while writing this .
Especially PyQT4 is a very powerful gui library for python .
It is fun programming with it .
I have used eclipse + pydev for developing .
In the beginning I did n’t have the auto - completion for PyQT4 as well as PyKDE4 in this environment , because they are not installed as pure python source code files .
I could fix this with following answer .
The other interesting things , I learned was to use the qt- designer tool for creating gui .
It is a nice WYSIWYG tool for designing complex guis .
The configuration form is designed using this tool .
The qt-designer creates a .ui file , which is an xml file .
The .ui file can be converted to the python source code using the pyuic4 tool in the following way .
pyuic4 -o configForm_ui.py ../ui/configForm.ui
I also learned to use the .qrc file for resources like images .
The .qrc file can be converted into python source code using pyrcc4 tool
pyrcc4 -o images_rc.py images.qrc
The qrc file is also an xml file which contains the references to the images used .
It can be created by just editing .
< RCC > < qresource prefix= " / images " > < file alias=" sunny.svgz " >../images/sunny.svgz</file > < file alias = " showers.svgz " >../images/showers.svgz</file > < file alias= " not-available.svgz " >../images/not-available.svgz</file > < file alias=" cloudy.svgz " >../images/cloudy.svgz</file > < file alias= " thunderstorms.svgz " >../images/thunderstorms.svgz</file> < file alias= " haze.svgz " >../images/haze.svgz</file > < file alias= " windy.svgz " >../images/windy.svgz</file > </ qresource > </ RCC >
I decided to write this weather plasmoid in python , because all the other weather plasmoids I found were binaries .
I have also tried to keep the data and presentation layer separate , I hope I succeeded in that .
In fact plasma framework provides a very good way of doing that in terms of data engines .
I would also like to use the data engines , may be with this or other plasmoid I may develop .
The svg images for weather conditions are taken from kde -look .
The credit goes to the original artist , painkiller10 .
I have considered only a number of weather conditions , so If you see a question mark image as the weather condition , let me know which condition it is , so I can update the code to consider it .
Please feel free to report any bugs or suggestions for improvement .
I am sure there is a big room of improvement from code point of view as well as functionality .
I am also open for changing the layout or changing the information displayed if someone comes with a better suggestion than the current one .
Some more screen shots :
During the 30 Days to a Better Man project , we ’ve been doing a lot exercises for our mind and character , but it ’s equally important to exercise our bodies .
A man ’s health is his most important asset .
If you suffer from chronic health problems , it can take a toll on your job , on your bank account , on your family , and on your psyche .
And being out of shape and unhealthy saps one ’s manly confidence and spirit .
Unfortunately , for the past few decades , the fitness level of men , particularly American men , has been going down hill .
With cars replacing walking as the primary mode of transportation and desk jobs replacing manual labor , men have become more and more sedentary .
There may have been a time when you were in pretty good shape .
Maybe it was in high school or college .
But since then , you ’ve gotten a job , a mortgage , a wife , and 2.5 kids .
But in your mind ’s eye , you still think you ’re the guy who could bench press 300 lbs and run the 40 yard dash in 4.5 seconds .
You might be a bit softer , but overall you feel good .
But the mind can play tricks on you .
Slowly through the years the body adjusts itself to a less active lifestyle .
The change happens so gradually , that you do n’t even notice it .
That is until you try to lift a big bag of dirt for your garden or play a pick - up game of basketball .
And you ’re hit with the realization that you ’re not the strapping lad you once were .
While humbling moments like the ones mentioned above can give you somewhat of an idea of your fitness level , an actual fitness test can do a better job because numbers do n’t lie .
So today we ’re going to give ourselves a gut check by taking a physical fitness test .
And not just any physical fitness test .
We ’re taking the U.S. Marine Corps Fitness Test .
How to Perform the Marine Corps Fitness Test
The Marine Corps Fitness tests consists of three exercises : pull - ups , crunches , and a 3.0 mile run .
The events are “ designed to test the strength and stamina of the upper body , midsection , and lower body , as well as the efficiency of the cardiovascular system .
” (( MCPFTBCP Sec. 2000 ( 1 ) ) )
All the exercises are to be performed in “ one single session , not to exceed two hours .
” ( ( MCPFTBCP Sec. 2100 ( 2 ) ) )
Since it ’s just you who ’s doing the test and not an entire squadron of Marines , it should take you about an hour .
Find yourself a pull - up bar .
If you do n’t have one , just go to a park and use the monkey bars .
They ’re perfect for pull - ups .
I also highly recommend investing in the Iron Gym Pull - Up Bar .
It ’s one of the best and most useful things I ever bought .
And you ’ll be able to use it at home once the fitness test is done to keep improving your strength .
To begin the test , grab the bar , both palms facing either forward or towards you .
I would do it palms facing towards you .
It ’s easier that way .
The correct starting position begins with your arms fully extended beneath the bar and your feet off the ground .
One rep consists of raising the body with the arms until the chin is above the bar and then lowering your body until your arms are fully extended .
The object of this test is to measure your performance from a dead hang position .
Thus , whipping , leg kicking , or leg kipping are not allowed and pull - ups using these assistance methods do not count .
You do n’t have a time limit to perform your pull - ups , but as soon as you let go , the test is over .
Abdominal Crunches
The ab crunch test has a two minute limit .
Perform as many crunches as you can in two minutes .
Cross your arms across your chest or rib cage with no gap existing between the arms and chest / rib cage .
Both arms must remain in constant contact with the chest / rib cage throughout the exercise .
A single repetition consists of raising your upper body from the starting position until both forearms or elbows simultaneously touch the thighs , and then returning to the starting position with the shoulder blades touching the ground .
Your butt must remain in constant contact with the ground .
You can have a buddy hold your legs or feet , at or below the knees .
If you do n’t have a buddy , place your feet under a couch or some other sturdy object .
3.0 Mile Run
Mark out a 3 mile course .
One way of doing this is to reset your car ’s trip odometer and drive a flat course in your neighborhood to mark out the 3 miles .
Another idea is to go to a high school or college track .
It ’s flat , clear of any obstacles , and it ’s measured out for you .
Four times around the track is one mile .
So for three miles , you ’ll have to run around it twelve times .
Time yourself with a stopwatch to see how fast you can run 3.0 miles .
Run as fast as you can .
Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test Scoring
Each Marine is given a numeric score based on his performance in each event .
Based on the total points of the three events , a Marine will be assigned to a physical fitness test class .
First class being the highest and third class being the lowest .

Minimum Fitness Requirements
The Department of the Navy has established minimum fitness requirements for all Marines depending on their age to ensure that they ’re ready for combat .
Most of us probably wo n’t see action in Afghanistan , but if you can meet the fitness requirements for these tests , you ’ll know that you have the physical condition to take on most of life ’s challenges .
The minimum requirements below would give a soldier enough points to meet a class three standard .
Age Pull - Ups Crunches 3 - Mile Run 17-26 3 50 28:00 27-39 3 45 29:00 40-45 3 45 30:00 > 46 + 3 40 33:00
After you establish your base , start working on improving through regular exercise .
Take the test again in a month to see how much you ’ve improved .
Try making it a goal to score a perfect 300 on the test .
Today ’s Task : Take the Marine Corps Fitness Test
Take an hour after work today and do the Marine Corps Fitness Test .
No matter what kind of shape you ’re in , it will help you know how fit you are , give you a benchmark to base future progression and regression on , and grant you either some motivation to improve or a sense of satisfaction that you ’re ready for action .
Tally up your score and share it with us in the Community !

READY COOKED FOOD .
A Great Convenience for House -
keepers .
It Is a known fact that many people
fail to properly digest the starchy part
of bread and other food .
Grape - Nuts
( a delightful breakfast food ) are made
of the grape - sugar which results from
preparing the starchy parts of the ce -
reals , in the same way artificially as
the body should do by natural pro-
cesses .
Therefore Grape - Nuts furnish
food all ready for immediate assimila -
tion into blood and tissue .
They are
made by the Postum Co. , at Battle
Creek , Mich. , and are ready prepared ,
require no cooking whatever and will

HOSTS PARADE TO CELEBRATE
REPAVING OF MARKET STREET
Wheelmen and Horsemen Unite on Common Cround in a Great Demon
stration Over the Success of the Long Continued Agitation
for the Betterment of the City 's Pavements .
THE cycling fraternity and the horse
men met on common ground last
night to give expression to their joy
that the city 's main artery of travel
has a modern pavement for at least a
portion of its broad surface .
The parade as a spectacular affair was a
failure , owing to the inability of the police
to handle the throng of people who cam ©
from far and near .
As a demonstration
showing the interest of the people at large
jn the important matter of good streets ,
it was a success far beyond the anticipa
tions of its promoters .
The efforts of the
Imen were seconded by the horse
men , represented by those who use horses
both for pleasure and for utility .
The
highest development in each class was
sh.iwn by Walter Morosco 's coach , drawn
; ht black horses , and by some of the
Lid draylng teams of sturdy Clydes
dales .
Mayor Phelan . as Chief Executive of
the city , held the place of honor at the
head of the procession .
He was accom
panied by Colonel W. P. Sullivan .
Charles L. Fatten was the gue=t of
honor on Walter Movosco 'S coach , which
was filled with the owner 's friends .

There is nothing so penetrating , nothing 90 invigorating , nothing that will relieve
weakness and pain so speedily and surely as Dr. Sanden 's Electric Belt

I would still qualify the tropics getting active by saying sorta active .
When I explain you will understand .
We do have 3 tropical cyclones …again sorta .
The oldest of the three is Ana which was down graded to tropical depression status after a hurricane hunter went out and had a tough time finding a closed circulation and found no evidence of tropical storm force winds .
The strongest winds were well north of the region suspected of being the center .
If you saw yesterday ’s satellite photo then you know that even then Ana looked pretty pitiful and now its even worse .
In the 5 pm discussion , the boys at the NHC talked about the potential of discontinuing advisories .
At 11 pm EDT the pressure was pegged at 1008 mb but , as I mentioned yesterday , it just does n’t have any upper level support to help it develop , partly because its moving so fast .
At a forward speed of 25 mph its tough to have time to allow an anticylone to develop aloft .
But , this is the reason that this guy will be monitored , even if they discontinue the advisories … which will probably happen when they get surface reports from some of the islands showing that the storm has no circulation to speak of .
The forecast track leaves open the possibility that this guy skirts just south of Dominica and sneaks south of Cuba before crossing the western end of the island into the Gulf of Mexico .
If it can maintain any sense of low level circulation as it makes that trek and its possible given its forward speed and the fact that western Cuba is relatively flat , then perhaps the environment may change and allow for upper level support to get going .
That would be unusual but not impossible .
So , for now , Ana looks pretty worthless but regardless of the classification , I suspect that it will still warrant a looksee in the days to come .
All of that is a big if because the National Hurricane Center shifted the official forecast track in such a way as to make Ana run over the heart of the islands , which would make it almost impossible for any further life expectancy .
The cyclone known as Bill will probably become Hurricane Bill in short order .
It behaved itself and moved slow enough to allow for upper level support to get established .
So , it ’s going to have lots of time to get wound up .
It may even jump up to about 110 - 120 mph .
But , in about 3 days , it will start to be influenced with a northerly component .
A frontal system will be coming across the US .
Should pass through Louisville on Thursday night .
As that front comes across the nation , the ridge that extends from the Atlantic into the Eastern US will break down which will allow the storm to start to turn .
As it turns and runs into some southwesterly winds aloft , then that may start to mess up its anticyclone aloft which will at least have the potential to cut off any strengthening .
If the southwesterly sheer is sufficient , it may even cause it to weaken a bit .
By the time we ’re at Friday , the frontal trof is sitting along the east coast of the US , effectively blocking any advance of Bill toward the US and keeping it out to sea .
At this time , Bill looks to be a headache for shipping and maybe for Bermuda .
It would seem that the only scenario to change this outlook would be if the ridge did n’t break down so fast and the front got held up , but there is no indication of that occuring .
Now , that leads us with Tropical Storm Claudette , which formed off the Florida Panhandle .
Its too close to land to really have a chance to develop rapidly .
Sunday afternoon the hurricane hunters found a central pressure of just 1008 mb but they did find surface winds gusting over 50 mph .
It seems to be a pretty broad center of circulation and again , the pressure is n’t too terribly low .
The probability of it becoming a hurricane was pegged at 2 % , but I doubt it will ever be anything more than it is on Sunday night .
It should be moving ashore somewhere around Destin or just east of Pensacola .
This will generally just be a rain maker .
At 10:06 EDT I found a station near Panama City with winds of 22 kts gusting to 41 kts .
That was the most impressive reading that I could find in the region .
Offshore , seas were 7.5 feet at their highest fairly close to the center with readings closer to shore of 3 - 4 feet .
Now , the center is shown on the official forecast track to be in Northern Mississippi by late Monday night .
The models though either are not aware of the feature and so they are not initiating well , or it rains itself out along the coast because neither the NAM or GFS are too enthused about rain potential inland .
However , it will be adding to atmospheric moisture at least and enhance rain chances in the Tennessee and Ohio River Valley for Monday through Thursday with the approach of the cold front and with a few shortwaves coming through the flow from the southwest ahead of the approaching trof .
Really , some of the models are getting pretty aggressive with rain in the upper Ohio Valley … maybe as far south as Louisville for late Thursday .

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ANA DISCUSSION NUMBER 20
NWS TPC / NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL022009
1100 PM AST SUN AUG 16 2009
RADAR IMAGERY FROM GUADELOUPE SUGGESTS THAT THE LOW - LEVEL CENTER OF
ANA HAS TURNED TOWARD THE WEST - NORTHWEST AND IS MOVING QUICKLY AT
AN INITIAL MOTION OF 285/23 .
ALTHOUGH SOME DEEP CONVECTION HAS
RECENTLY RE-DEVELOPED…IT IS ORIENTED LINEARLY ALONG A NORTH -SOUTH
AXIS AND APPEARS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF A TROPICAL WAVE .
THE CENTER
APPEARS REASONABLY WELL -DEFINED ON THE GUADELOUPE RADAR BUT THIS IS
LIKELY DEPICTING A MID -LEVEL CIRCULATION RATHER THAN ONE AT THE
SURFACE .
AT THIS TIME WE WOULD RATHER NOT STOP ADVISORIES WHILE
THE SYSTEM IS MOVING ACROSS THE LESSER ANTILLES .
HOWEVER IF
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM THOSE ISLANDS CONFIRM THE LACK OF A
CENTER…ADVISORIES
WILL BE TERMINATED EARLY MONDAY .
VERY FEW OF THE DYNAMICAL MODELS SHOW ANY RE - STRENGTHENING…AND
A
FEW SUCH AS THE GFS…HWRF …AND GFDL LOSE THE VORTEX AFTER ABOUT
36 HOURS .
THE TRACK GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT ANA SHOULD BE MOVING
OVER THE HIGH TERRAIN OF HISPANIOLA IN 24-36 HOURS…AND IT IS
DOUBTFUL THAT ITS CIRCULATION WILL MAKE IT ACROSS THAT ISLAND
INTACT .
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS ANA BECOMING A REMNANT LOW BY
36 HOURS AFTER IT BEGINS CROSSING LAND…BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT
COULD BECOME AN OPEN WAVE AT ANY TIME .
THE TRACK FORECAST IS
SHIFTED NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TOWARD THE SHALLOW LAYER BAM
TRACK AND IN LINE WITH THE GFS AND ECMWF SINCE IT IS ASSUMED THAT
THE REMNANT CIRCULATION WILL BE STEERED BY THE LOW - LEVEL FLOW .
TROPICAL STORM WATCHES WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL IT IS CLEAR THAT
ANA WILL NOT RE - STRENGTHEN OR UNTIL IT PASSES THE LEEWARD ISLANDS
LATER TONIGHT .

UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUBTROPICAL
RIDGING TO THE NORTH …BILL IS EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN A GENERAL
WEST - NORTHWEST HEADING FOR THE NEXT 48 - 72 HOURS .
WITH LITTLE
SPREAD IN THE CURRENT MODEL CYCLE THROUGH THIS TIME … THE OFFICIAL
TRACK DEVIATES LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY .
THEREAFTER …
MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A RATHER SUBSTANTIAL BREAK
IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE SHOULD DEVELOP ROUGHLY ALONG 60 W… WHICH
SHOULD RESULT IN A MORE NORTHWESTWARD COURSE .
MOST OF THE MODEL
SOLUTIONS HAVE SHIFTED FARTHER NORTH FROM THE PREVIOUS RUNS…AND
SO HAS THE MODEL CONSENSUS .
ONLY THE UKMET FAVORS A MORE
WEST - NORTHWESTWARD
PATH AND APPEARS AS THE LONE … SOUTHERN OUTLIER
AMONGST THE REMAINDER OF THE GLOBAL MODELS .
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS ADJUSTED NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ONE…ESPECIALLY BEYOND 96
HOURS …BASED ON THE LATEST GUIDANCE .
EVEN THOUGH ENVIRONMENTAL SHEAR IS QUITE LOW…BILL HAS BEEN
TRACKING OVER MARGINAL SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND WATERS ARE NOT
FORECAST TO WARM FURTHER UNTIL AFTER 24 HOURS .
INTERESTINGLY …THE
GFDL / HWRF SHOW A NEARLY FLAT INTENSIFICATION RATE FOR THE NEXT DAY
OR TWO…PERHAPS UNDERSCORING THE TEPID THERMODYNAMIC CONDITIONS .
IT
SHOULD BE NOTED …HOWEVER … THAT THE SHIPS RAPID INTENSITY INDEX
SHOWS A 41 % CHANCE OF A 30 KT INTENSITY INCREASE DURING THE NEXT 24
HOURS .
THEREAFTER …THE GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT LOW
SHEAR AND WARMING WATERS SHOULD PREVAIL FOR BILL…ALLOWING THE
CYCLONE TO EVOLVE INTO A MAJOR HURRICANE OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD .
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSEST TO THE SHIPS MODEL GUIDANCE …
WHICH PREDICTS A FAIRLY STEADY RATE OF DEVELOPMENT OVER THE NEXT
FEW DAYS .
TOWARD THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD …THE GLOBAL
MODELS HAVE BEEN HINTING AT INCREASING WESTERLY SHEAR AS BILL
OUTRUNS FAVORABLE ANTICYCLONIC
FLOW TO THE SOUTHEAST .
ACCORDINGLY …THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST SHOWS SLIGHT
WEAKENING NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD .

EASTERN SEMICIRCLE OF THE CIRCULATION …AND IT IS IN THESE
CONVECTIVE REGIONS WHERE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS ARE LIKELY
OCCURRING AT THE SURFACE .
WITH LANDFALL NOW IMMINENT …THE WINDOW
OF OPPORTUNITY FOR CLAUDETTE TO STRENGTHEN IS QUICKLY CLOSING .

First off , you are probably getting your health insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan , available to all Members of Congress and all federal employees .
It 's a great deal .
I know .
I 'm covered under my wife 's policy .
She 's a fed .
You have lots of insurance choice , and the rates are better than competitive , because hey , those insurance companies are more than willing to negotiate great rates for federal employees when they know that taxpayers subsidize most of the bill .
But wait , there 's more !
You get even MORE public options as a Member of Congress .
Better than any old standard gub -ment bureaucrat gets , that 's for sure .
On top of being able to enroll in FEHBP , you , as a Member of Congress , can visit the Senate Doctor or any U.S. military base and get care for a nominal fee .
I even seem to recall , from my time working on the Hill , that there is an ambulance specifically reserved for Members of Congress to rush them to Walter Reed should you need care .
Funny ... I do n't recall being able to do that myself , even as a lowly staffer .
And not to worry , Senator Coburn ... I note that you are 61 years of age , so in just a few years you 'll be getting full coverage on the public 's dime under this little program .
You might have heard of it .
Hell , you 've even given that program your full - throated endorsement at one point , saying :
Social Security and Medicare represent promises made and we must keep these commitments .
Then again , given that you are a pretty high - earner as a Senator , and the fact that you are and were a doctor , you 're probably not all that worried about public health care in your later years , given that you can afford a Cadillac plan .
Cut the crap , Senator .
Stop trying to be cute with America .
Damn right the public option is good enough for you , and it 's good enough for me , and the rest of America .
You and the rest of the Members of Congress have already proven it with the health care YOU get .
25 clues that Kim Jong - Il is nuttier than a fruitcake
We feel pretty confident saying that Kim Jong - Il is a friggin ’ lunatic , even though his father dubbed him “ the Dear Leader ” and “ a genius of 10,000 talents . ” .
Other than the fact that we are highly - trained psychologists , what gives us the right to say that ?
Well , just consider these 25 idiosyncrasies of the little nutcase :
Wears oversized , tinted Elvis Presley - style sunglasses .
Almost always wears a jumpsuit .
Almost always the same color .
Applauds whenever his army goosesteps past him .
Has been known to throw banquets that last for up to four days .
Once ordered his agents to kidnap South Korean director Shin Sang - Ok and actress wife Choi Eun - Hee to make propaganda films , including a revolutionary version of Godzilla .
Consumes more Hennessy VSOP congnac than anyone else in the world .
Reportedly spends more than $ 650,000 a year to import his favorite elixir .
Once downed 10 glasses of wine during a meeting with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung .
Reportedly owns more than 20,000 films .
Has personally selected a group of young women he calls the Pleasure Brigade to provide his “ home entertainment . ”
His fear of flying is so extreme that he travels to Russia and China on a private train .
Claims to be an expert horseman although no evidence exists to prove it .
Claims he has a photographic memory and superhuman powers of recall .
Claims he shot a remarkable 11 holes in one during his first 18 holes of golf .
Has been accused of masterminding the 1983 assassination attempt on the South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan .
Millions of North Koreans starved to death as a result of Kim ’s gross mismanagement of the rural economy .
Has only spoken nine words in public : “ Glory to the heroic soldiers of the people ’s army ! ”
Claims that when he was born , “ a double rainbow appeared over the mountain and a new star formed in the skies . ”
Once ordered five female disco dancers to strip , then ordered other North Korean officials to dance with them .
After being knocked unconscious in an equestrian accident , demanded that his administrative staff be injected with the same painkiller with which he was injected .
He did n’t want to become the only one addicted to it .
Wears elevator shoes .
Wears a puffy pompadour .
Claims to have written 1,500 books — almost one per day – during his university years .
Eclectic taste in movies : Loves “ The Godfather , ” James Bond , “ Friday the 13th , ” Daffy Duck , and Elizabeth Taylor .
Once said of himself , “ Small as a midget ’s turd , are n’t I ? ” Claims his election was so momentous that pear trees bloomed in autumn .
On the other hand , Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called him “ charming . ”
Ca n’t argue with that in depth analysis .

Could it be that George A Romero 's undying cycle of zombie movies is at last heading for the cemetery ?
Early reviews of the latest in the Dead series , which screened last night at the Venice film festival , suggest that its vital signs may well be in doubt .
Survival of the Dead is the fifth sequel to Romero 's 1968 classic Night of the Living Dead , the feature that defined the landscape of the modern zombie movie .
The latest instalment – a follow - up of sorts to 2007's Diary of the Dead and another self - financed production – is set on an island off America 's east coast .
The living dead are caught in the middle of a generations - old dispute between two families , who have opposing strategies for dealing with the zombie menace .
One shoots to kill , the other opts for containment in the hope of finding a cure .
Social satire has always been an integral part of Romero 's horror , from the consumerism targeted in Dawn of the Dead to the class divisions of Land of the Dead .
This time round , Romero admits that he did n't have a specific contemporary issue in mind .
" It 's much more about man 's underlying inability to forget enmity , forget their enemies , even long after they 've forgotten what started the conflict in the first place , " he told reporters in Venice .
" I think part of the problem is that nobody looks at both sides of any issue . "
So far the critical response at least has been two - sided .
Variety
called the film " woefully thin on ideas , originality ( beyond new zombie - offing methods ) or directorial flair [ with ] no serious undertow to counterpoint the eventually repetitive slaughter . "
The Hollywood Reporter , on the other hand , found it to be " a polished , fast - moving , entertaining picture … with savvy cultural points , clever wit and a nice twist on what might happen to the newly deceased " .
The website for PCB Productions ( sound and motion capture for various games and other projects ) has confirmed , if that ’s not a contradiction in terms , that SOCOM 4 is in development .
It seems that the studio are involved with the motion capture direction for the forthcoming game , which does n’t appear on any official Sony release lists .
Yet .
We ’re assuming that this will be Zipper Interactive ’s next project after MAG , with Slant Six currently working on the PSP ’s upcoming Fireteam Bravo 3 .

Representative Lloyd Doggett is one of our heroes .
He has never forgotten that he represents us , not corporate lobbyists .
He is extremely popular in his district , which includes progressive Austin , and my home in nearby heavily Democratic Bastrop County , so it was unexpected when angry shouting protesters appeared at his Austin office last Friday evening .
Staffers described their behavior as " thuggish " , and fearing for their safety closed the office early .
The next morning a a South Austin Randall 's grocery store , Representative Doggett was holding " office hours " , something he has done for the past 15 years .
Normally it is a time for constituents to meet with him about things like assistance with veteran 's benefits .
An angry mob of about 150 stormed the store , carrying signs that included one with Rep.
Doggett with devil horns , and a marble tombstone with his name on it .
Their shouting prevented conversations with constituents , including a father with his son , wearing a Boy Scout uniform , who had come to ask for Rep .
Doggett 's help getting the son into a military academy .
The New York Times reported that the Randall 's protest was coordinated by Heather Ligett , a local Republican activist , who in the past has coordinated with the Tea Party movement , and the state chapter of Americans for Prosperity .
As Rep . Doggett said later , the protesters did n't come to have a conversation ; they came to stifle discourse .
As he attempted to answer their questions , they drowned him out with chants of " Just Say No " , and even pursued him outside blocking his entrance to his car .
On the Austin Statesman 's blog , one of them bragged that they had " tarred and feathered him " .
At least one of the protesters , a woman who has been a contributor to the Republican party , attended both the Randall 's meeting and then drove to Bastrop to attend the Town Hall later that day , as reported by the Austin Statesman :
“ The folks there thought their voices were n’t being heard , ” said Kathy Acosta , a Bastrop resident who attended the meeting at Randalls and another one later that day in her hometown .
Concerned about a repetition of the intimidation at the Town Hall scheduled for that afternoon in Bastrop , Rep. Doggett 's staff called our Bastrop Democratic Party Chair for assistance .
Our County Chair first contacted the Bastrop police and requested security for the Town Hall .
Next she activated a phone tree , calling all the precinct chairs , who called their precinct members and recruited supporters to attend , instructing them to come to the Town Hall early , and to fill the front seats .
What was that about ?
- Stephanie Watson , videographer , Bastrop Community Access Television filming a ceremony disrupted by protesters at the Bastrop County Courthouse
Before the Town Hall at 5 PM , Rep . Doggett made a 4 PM appearance at the Bastrop County Courthouse , to announce a $ 200,000 appropriation to aid the Bastrop County Historical Society to convert the Main Street building into a new museum and visitor center .
Members of the Historical Society were surprised when protesters carrying signs about health care and other national issues disrupted the ceremony .
Davis McAuley describes what happened as Representative Doggett moved on to the Town Hall :
The scene became perhaps more intense when events moved to the Kerr Center , which was packed with Democrats and others –including an estimated half - dozen hecklers who apparently hoped to disrupt the gathering .
One Kerr Center official estimated the crowd at about 90 people packed into a building officially rated to hold only 80 .
And those friendly to the Congressman were better organized .
A number of them lined up shoulder to shoulder across the hall to block aisles and fill corners in an effort to separate the protesters from Doggett .
A contingent of city police , led by Assistant Chief Matt Wagner , was also on hand .
By the time Representative Doggett arrived at the Town Hall meeting escorted by three Bastrop policemen the auditorium was full , and two more policemen stood at the entrance .
The audience greeted Representative Doggett warmly with a standing ovation .
Representative Doggett made it clear that he did not want protesters kept out of the meeting .
Since the hall was already at capacity , when the group of a half - dozen protesters arrived , the County Chair could have denied them the right to come in , but instead said that were welcome to attend , but that they had to leave their signs outside .
Several of the protesters had a heated shouting match with the police over the signs , shouting about their First Ammendment rights , but were told pointedly by one of the officers that although there was a good rationale for excluding them based on the capacity of the building , that our County Chair was allowing them to come in .
Finally , they left their signs outside and entered , standing in the back , since there were no more seats .
Wagner said he feared the session could degenerate into physical confrontations and he asked one especially loud and persistent heckler to leave the assembly .
He was shown the door and advised to use it .
The " especially loud and persistent heckler " , was Bob Parmelee , who is active in the Bastrop Republican Party .
He began shouting as Representative Doggett made his opening remarks .
When he continued , he was taken outside by the police .
The shouting could be heard through the open doors at the back .
Eventually , Parmelee was allowed back inside , but continued to shout , and had to be taken out four times by the police .
Each time he was allowed back in .
At one point he tried to shove his way to the front of the room , but was blocked by two of the Democrats who stood in front of him .
The rest of the group of protesters was fairly quiet , and remained standing in the back , apparently less brave now that they were no longer part of a mob , as they had been in Austin .
Seen standing in this group was Art Kownslar , who in addition to being a Minuteman , is also Treasurer of the Bastrop County Republican Party .
He was the organizer of Bastrop 's July 4th Tea Party .
In his account of the Tea Party in the Bastrop Advertiser , " Bastrop 's Own Tea Party Brings Out Patriotic Group " , he wrote that " grassroots actions are an important opportunity for citizens to communicate their views . "
The irony of having organized a disruptive mob to deny others their right to be heard , seemed to be lost on him .
This was one Town Hall hecklers were not able to hijack to shut down discourse .
As McJoan pointed out today , it is so important for us to show up .
Health care reform is too important to allow mobs organized by the Republican party and funded by corporate lobbyists to stop Americans from hearing from their elected representatives and getting answers to their questions .
In Bastrop , thanks to quick work by our County Chair and Precinct Chairs , and a big turnout , the screamers were outnumbered 14 to 1 by our better organized supporters .
The protesters were admitted to the meetings , and were able to ask questions provided they behaved themselves .
The Bastrop police deserve high praise for a professional job of providing security .
I hope all of the officers who were there get a commendation .
As expected , Redbox is suing Warner Home Video over its demand for a 28 - day window before it makes available low - cost DVDs to the kiosks .
But what really warms my heart is the way Redbox President Mitch Lowe is using not just anti-trust law but also a PR offensive to fight back against the power , influence , and unlimited resources of the Hollywood studios and the cartel they ’ve formed .
( Hey , Hollywood guilds , you could learn a thing or two from these Redbox guys … )
Redbox has now set up savelowcostdvds.com to explain its populist message aimed at the 150 million consumers who shop where the Redbox kiosks are located , “ Do n’t Let a few movie studios prevent you from seeing the latest DVDs at an affordable price ” .
Here ’s the latest Redbox lawsuit :
Oakbrook Terrace , Ill . – Redbox Automated Retail , LLC , filed suit in Delaware Federal Court against Warner Home Video on Tuesday , August 18 , 2009 , to protect consumers ’ rights to access new release DVDs .
Redbox filed the action in response to new distribution terms imposed by Warner Home Video that would prohibit redbox from providing consumers access to Warner Home Video titles until at least 28 days after public release .
“ Warner Home Video ’s actions come at the expense of consumers , ” said Mitch Lowe , president , redbox .
“ Redbox remains committed to providing our customers the new release DVDs they want , where they want and at the low price they want .
Standing behind our commitment , redbox will continue to offer our consumers access to all major new releases including Warner Home Video at our more than 15,000 locations nationwide . ”
A number of studios also have shown support for redbox .
Last week , redbox signed a multi- year distribution agreement with Lionsgate .
A similar distribution agreement with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment ( SPHE ) was reached in July .
“ Redbox continues to forge winning relationships with a number of studios that increase studio exposure , ensure redbox customers receive access to more titles and support redbox ’s commitment to providing consumers timely , convenient and affordable access to new release DVDs , ” said Lowe .

1. Schwarz - Gelb hat die Wahl nicht gewonnen , die Große Koalition hat die Wahl verloren .
Die Parteien der Großen Koalition büßten gegenüber 2005 ein Viertel ihrer Wähler ein ( =25 Prozent ) .
Wurden CDU , CSU und SPD 2005 von 32,8 Millionen Bürgern gewählt , so sank diese Unterstützung 2009 auf 24,6 Millionen Wähler .
Derart abgestraft wurde selten eine Regierung !
2. Schwarz - Gelb ist nur eine Minderheitenregierung .
Während die Parteien der Großen Koalition 2005 noch 53 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten auf sich vereinten ( =32,8 Millionen ) , unterstützen lediglich 33,7 Prozent ( = 20,9 Millionen ) die schwarz - gelbe Koalition .
3. Schwarz - Gelb hat Stimmen verloren .
Während die FDP gegenüber der letzten Wahl 1,66 Millionen Wähler dazu gewann , verloren CDU und CSU zusammen fast 2 Millionen .
Macht unterm Strich für Schwarz - Gelb ein Minus von 311.166 Stimmen .
4. Der Abwärtstrend der Union ist stabil .
Zweitgrößter Verlierer hinter der SPD ist die CSU .
Sie verlor 664.099 Stimmen .
Das ist ein Minus von 19 Prozent (! ) gegenüber 2005 .
Auch die CDU hat nicht 0,5 Prozent verloren , wie es die Balken - Diagramme ausweisen .
Die CDU hat gegenüber der letzten Bundestagswahl mehr als 1,3 Millionen Stimmen verloren .
Das sind 10 Prozent ihrer Wähler .
CDU und CSU verzeichnen zusammen ein Minus von 11,9 Prozent .
5. Gewonnen haben in erster Linie FDP und Linke .
Beide Parteien konnten jeweils mehr als eine Million Wähler dazu gewinnen .
6. Die Grünen haben weniger Stimmen hinzugewonnen als die Piraten .
Das Plus der Grünen : 802.871 Stimmen .
Das Plus der Piraten : 845.904 .
Die Piraten konnten ihren Stimmenanteil seit der Europawahl ( 229.000 Stimmen ) fast vervierfachen .
7 . Und nun zum dicksten Hammer : der SPD .
Die SPD hat nicht etwa dramatische 11,2 Prozent verloren , wie es am Wahlabend verkündet wurde .
Die SPD hat gegenüber der letzten Bundestagswahl granatenhafte 38,3 Prozent (! ) ihrer Wähler verloren .
Das ist kein Desaster , das ist eine Katastrophe .
Und so war es wohl der größte Witz des Wahlabends , dass Steinmeier und Müntefering erklärten , sie wollten so weiter machen .
Weil sie sich nicht aus der Verantwortung stehlen wollen .
Nach diesem Ergebnis gibt es nur eine mögliche Form von Verantwortung : Rücktritt .

I ’ve developed in a few different environments , including multi-tier ones with middle tier Java app servers and stuff , but it always seemed pretty straightforward to serve something directly from disk .
And in the case of PHP , everything is served from disk .
There ’s no middleware to speak of , so you can throw a robots .
txt file in place and it “ just works ” .
With Django , it ’s slightly different because of two things :
Django should n’t be serving static content ( and therefore makes it a little inconvenient though not impossible to do so ) .
Django works kinda like an application server that expects to receive URLs , and expects there to be some configuration in place telling it how to deal with that URL .
If you have Django serving static content , you ’re wasting resources , so I ’m not covering that here .
My web host is webfaction , and they give you access to the configuration of your own Apache instance in addition to your Django installation ’s configuration ( in fact , I ’m just running an svn checkout of django - trunk ) , so this gives you a lot of flexibility in how you deal with static files like CSS , images , or a robots .
txt file .
To handle robots .
txt on my “ staging ” version of my site , I added the following lines to my apache httpd .
conf file :
LoadModule alias_module modules/mod_alias.so < Location " /robots.txt " >
SetHandler None </ Location > alias /robots.txt /home/myusername/webapps/mywsgiapp/htdocs/robots.txt
If you do n’t add mod_alias , you ’ll get an error saying that the keyword “ alias ” is a misspelling or is not supported by Apache .
I use “ < Location > ” here instead of “ < File > ” or “ < Directory > ” because I ’m applying the rule only to incoming requests for “ / robots. txt ” explicitly , and it is n’t likely that I ’ll have more than one way of reaching that file , since I ’m not aware of engines that look for robots .
txt in some other way .
< Directory > applies rules to an entire directory and its subdirectories , and < File > applies rules to a file on disk so the rules will apply even if there ’s more than one URL that maps to the file .
Sometimes it takes a casual phrase to really reveal the gap between a slice of our ruling class and the rest of us .
The Tory frontbencher Alan Duncan says that living on £ 64,000 a year – which puts him in the richest 4 per cent of the population – means a life on " rations " , and " no one who 's done anything " will want to live on it .
Boris Johnson says wages for a second job of £ 250,000 are " chicken feed " , even though they are more than what 99.99 per cent of us earn .
( He must have an army of gargantuan chickens ) .
David Cameron does n't even know how many houses he owns , and his heiress wife says a windfall of up to £ 250,000 from selling a property is " nothing life - changing " .
Yet out in the real Britain , the median wage is £ 23,000 a year .
Half earn more ; half earn less .
Underneath this figure , there 's another : the average personal debt is £ 29,500 .
As individuals , we owe more than we earn in a year .
This is a relatively recent development , and it happened for an underlying structural reason .

Since the early 1980s , average incomes have stagnated , even as the economy – and people 's expectations – have continued to grow .
How is this possible ?
Under Thatcher and ( alas ) her New Labour successors , for the first time since the 1920s , growth went almost entirely to those at the top .
People like Boris and former oilman Duncan saw their real incomes soar – and shoot off far beyond everyone else .
So to keep up , the middle class and the poor turned to credit .
They stayed with the rising tide by building a life - raft out of credit cards and personal loans .
But now the chickens we bought on Visa are – for many of us – coming home to roost .
There are 20,000 debt collectors in Britain chasing £ 20bn of overdue debt .
In this slump , one business is booming : private debt collection agencies .
They buy debts from banks at very low rates – as little as 6 p in the pound – and then chase them hard , often demanding immediate , full repayment from the unsuspecting debtor .
While Johnson and Duncan were whining that their super - incomes are a pittance , I was prying into this shadowy world , and finding people who really are left with something close to " rations . "
Nick Pearson , the director of the Debt Resolution Forum , says many debt collection firms are " out of control " .
Their job often involves chasing debtors who have been lost – and one way of tracking them down is a " fishing expedition " .
If Mike Jones from Edgware owes £ 2,000 and the creditor lost touch with him , they can write to every Mike Jones in Edgware demanding he pay up – and threaten he 'll get a credit blacklisting and be taken to court if he does n't .
This often ends with non-debtors being harassed and intimidated .
For example , Beryl Brazier , a 61 - year - old widow from Derbyshire , was amazed to be told by debt collectors she had to pay a £ 17,500 debt .
She explained she had never taken out any such loan , but they would n't leave her alone .
They said they would seize her house if she did n't pay .
Many people pay up just to stop the harassment : there is no legal aid to defend yourself with any more .
So , after three years of fear , she drowned herself in a lake .
When a genuine debtor is found , the agencies frequently exceed the rules in an attempt to shake money from people faster and harder than they can afford to pay it – sometimes needlessly leaving them homeless or on benefits .
For a recent edition of Channel 4's Dispatches programme , the journalist Tom Randall went undercover at Marlin Financial Services , one of the leading debt collection agencies in Britain .
It picks up debts from HSBC , Lloyds and others .
After it bought a fresh batch of debts from Yorkshire and Clydesdale Bank , he was instructed by his supervisors not to accept payment by instalment but to demand full payment within 14 days .
" Tell them ... you 're going bankrupt , " his supervisor announced .
Randall was also told he could point out that " others " had borrowed yet more money to pay off their debts .
It costs these firms man-hours to slowly regain a loan over years .
It is more cost - effective to reclaim it all in one lump sum , even if that means repossessing a house and putting a family out on the street .
We as tax - payers then have to step in and help them out , so this is yet another area where people are hurt and all of us pay out just so a few at the top can profit .
Later , Randall was told off for giving a two - week reprieve to a man whose baby had just died .
His supervisor said : " I would have said to him probably : ' I 'm really sorry for that but you 've not paid since October , what would your reasons for that be ? ' "
Then the supervisor shrugged and said : " Tough , mate . "
In his training , the person held up as the company 's top collector was a man called Mark .
They said he " uses stuff we perhaps would n't want to be used but he brings [ in ] the money ...
He is good . "
Mark seemed to have walked off the stage of a David Mamet play .
He said proudly : " The easiest way I can explain collections to you ...
It 's pantomime .
It 's all an act . "
He gave an illustration .
In front of Tom , he called up a woman in debt who was paying off £ 20 a month .
She explained that she and her husband had had to go on to disability allowance and were paying the most they could afford .
He threatened her with bailiffs , saying while she was on hold : " Twenty quid is shit , man ...
Scare her a bit . "
He said that if the firm did n't use threats : " We 're fucking ourselves and , if we fuck ourselves , the profits are going to go like that . "
He indicated down .
Later , Tom saw Marlin staff impersonating solicitors .
Marlin said it operated within the rules , it trained its staff to be respectful at all times and these were " exceptions " that had resulted in retraining .
If this out - of - control industry starts to crack the whip , then another out - of - control industry is sent in – the bailiffs .
They are free to charge huge " fees " for seizing your property , sending your debt spiralling even further .
The Citizens ' Advice Bureau gave me an example of how they routinely operate .
A man owed £ 12 to a catalogue that he failed to pay .
Bailiffs turned up at his home demanding £ 400 , saying the increased amount included their fees .
When he refused to pay such a huge amount , they seized the Motability scheme car he needed to get to hospital to have kidney dialysis three times a week and drove it away .
A National Debtline study found that 40 per cent of bailiffs lie about their powers of entry .
Half levied unfair fees , and a quarter even threatened the debtor with imprisonment .
Anthony Lewisohn , an 82 - year - old retired judge from Surrey , was amazed when bailiffs turned up on his doorstep demanding payment of more than £ 500 for a parking fine he had never heard about .
It turned out they had been sending letters to his old address – but still they forced him to pay .
Lewisohn calls them " thugs . "
The poorer you are , the easier it is to become trapped in this system .
If I need a new washing machine , I can go and buy one upfront from Curry 's for £ 337 .
If I have to take a loan from one of the " alternative credit agencies " for the poor , I pay 254 per cent APR .
The same washing machine ends up costing £ 1,137 .
The Government should be banning these practices , and guaranteeing reasonable credit for the poor .
Of course , debt is an essential part of our economy and people do have to pay their debts .
Those who have the cash but refuse to cough up need to be compelled .
But there are far better ways than this cruel and irrational system .
Judges should be empowered to study a debtor 's accounts and set a realistic amount to be deducted automatically each week from their wages or benefits .
The amount should – by law – be required to keep them and their children above the poverty line .
We will eventually regard our current system with the same shame we feel when we learn that Charles Dickens spent his childhood in a debtors ' prison .
Even the most egregious acts by debt collection agencies and bailiffs now pass unpunished .
In theory , the Office of Fair Trading regulates debt collection .
Last year , it found that 13 companies had breached the rules in serious ways – but it refused to publicly name them , and it has never fined these companies a penny .
Bailiffs are subject to even more toothless oversight .
The Government first said it would regulate them in 2003 – but now it says it will happen in 2012 .
This story tells us something dark about Britain today .
When the rights of rich people are threatened , the state swoops in fast : every day , there are arrests for counterfeiting designer clothes and pirating DVDs .
When the rights of the rest are threatened – in much more damaging ways – the state becomes sluggish and forgiving .
Yet still the wealthy moan that they are the ones being hard done by .
If you want to know what rations are like , Mr Duncan , try having a debt collection agency chasing you , and bailiffs thwacking at your door .

WASHINGTON --
An expert in anti-government militia groups warns of another domestic terrorism attack like the bombing in Oklahoma City 14 years ago .
Angry protesters are showing up at town hall meetings across the United States , some of them saying their country is unrecognizable as they rail against illegal immigrants .
Conservative websites , and even Fox News 's Glenn Beck , are drawing parallels between Barack Obama and Adolf Hitler , claiming the president 's political agenda amounts to a similar brand of murderous fascism .
It 's a summer of seething discontent in the United States , with a deeply polarized populace going head - to - head across an ideological divide that has found its boiling point in an unlikely issue -- public health - care insurance , something Canada and many other democracies around the world take for granted .
" None of this really has anything to do with health care , " Eric Boehlert , senior fellow at Media Matters for America , a progressive media watchdog , said Wednesday .
" If there was another stimulus package , we'd be seeing the same thing from the very same people .
This is just what happens to be on the table right now , but these are the teabag protesters , and they 're talking about tyranny , they 're talking about taxes , they 're talking about their dislike of Obama .
Health care is just a proxy . "
One Democratic politician recently went further .
" Some of the rhetoric that we 're hearing is eerily reminiscent of the kind of things that drove Tim McVeigh to bomb the federal building in Oklahoma , " Brian Baird , a congressman from Washington state , said last week after cancelling his own town halls due to what he described as the " lynch mob " mentality .
Baird was roundly attacked by the right for making the comment .
But a new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center says militia groups with axes to grind against the government are regrouping throughout the U.S. , fuelled in part by their distaste for Obama and his policies .
The civil rights organization says that among other theories , some of the militia members -- who are opposed to paying taxes and rail against any government involvement in their lives -- are convinced there 's a secret Mexican plan to reclaim the Southwest .
Bart McEntire , a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , told the law centre 's researchers that militia group growth is at a 10 - year high .
" All it 's lacking is a spark , " McEntire said in the report , adding he feared it was just a matter of time before another domestic terrorist attack happened .
Boehlert points the finger at right - wing news organizations for fuelling much of the populist rage .
" This does all tie back to the militia movement of the early 1990s , when Bill Clinton was elected , " he said .
But some believe much of the anger is truly about Obama 's race , with his liberal politics serving as a convenient excuse for those who resent his presidency .
" What some are calling class anger is actually anger about a black man in the White House , " Toni-Michelle Travis , a professor of African - American studies at George Mason University , said Wednesday .

A video clip of a man ( engineer Bruno Kammerl ) in a neoprene suit shooting down a waterslide , flying off a ramp , traveling an amazingly long distance , and landing smack in the middle of a tiny wading pool hit the Internet in August 2009 :
This clip not a visual recording of a real event , but rather a viral advertisement for Microsoft Germany accomplished through a combination of video editing techniques as explained at NewTeeVee.com :
It ’s a case of creative compositing , meaning that the clip we get to see is based on multiple elements that were combined together to create a final video .
A stuntman slides down the slide , secured by a rope .
Then there ’s a body flying through the air , which is animated .
And finally , the big splash .
“ He actually jumped from a wooden ramp into the pool , ” explained [ Maik ] Koenigs .
Of course , you do n’t get to see any of this in the final clip , thanks to careful editing that makes it look like a single take .
A clip from a portion of the shoot shows a stuntman going partway down the slide for the initial segment of the video :
Massachusetts voters approved a referendum in November that decriminalized small amounts of marijuana , but the change does not apply to federal property .
Sullivan , who lives in Washington but owns a home in Provincetown , was stopped by a park ranger for smoking marijuana on the beach shortly before 3:45 p.m .
When the ranger asked Sullivan if he had any other joints , the writer fished one out of his wallet and said , “ I thought small amounts of marijuana were legal to have in Massachusetts , ’’ according to court records .
Collings ’s ruling stems from an otherwise unremarkable event on the Cape Cod National Seashore on July 13 .
Sullivan , 46 , declined to comment in an e-mail .
A self - described libertarian conservative , Sullivan is well known for his idiosyncratic views .
Catholic and openly gay , he is a strong proponent of same - sex marriage and has denounced restrictions on medical marijuana in his Daily Dish blog on The Atlantic Online .
Brandy Donini - Melanson , a spokeswoman for the US attorney ’s office , said yesterday that Loucks had no comment on the matter .
Collings added with obvious irritation that he had no power to order prosecutors to pursue the case , and granted their motion to dismiss it .
The fact that he did , however , “ does not require the Court to believe that the end result is a just one , ’’ he wrote .
“ It is quite apparent that Mr. Sullivan is being treated differently from others who have been charged with the same crime in similar circumstances , ’’ Collings wrote in the 11 - page memorandum , adding that prosecutors ’ rationale for the dismissal was inadequate .
Three other defendants charged with the same offense had to appear before Collings the same day as Sullivan , the judge noted .
But Sullivan ’s case was the only one prosecutors did not pursue , out of concern that the $ 125 fine carried by the relatively minor offense could derail his US immigration application .
In a strongly worded memorandum issued Thursday , US Magistrate Judge Robert B. Collings said the decision by Acting US Attorney Michael K. Loucks to dismiss a federal misdemeanor possession charge against Sullivan flouted a “ cardinal principle of our legal system ’’ - that all persons stand equal before the law .
Andrew M. Sullivan , the British author , editor , and political commentator , is one of the best - known figures in the new - media elite , and his blog , The Daily Dish , is among the most popular on the Web .
But a federal judge says Sullivan did not deserve preferential treatment from prosecutors who dropped a marijuana possession charge after the journalist was recently caught smoking a joint on a federally owned beach on Cape Cod .
The ranger gave Sullivan a violation notice , which required him to either appear before Collings in US District Court in Hyannis on Sept. 2 or , in essence , pay a $ 125 fine .
But on Aug. 26 one of Loucks ’s prosecutors , James F. Lang , filed a two - sentence letter seeking to dismiss the ticket , saying only that “ further prosecution of the violation would not be in the interests of justice . ’’
Disturbed by the vague explanation , Collings held the Sept. 2 hearing and ordered the writer to appear , which he did .
When Collings asked Lang and Delahunt why Sullivan should be treated differently from other defendants charged with possessing marijuana on federal property , the lawyers explained that Sullivan was a British citizen applying for a certain immigration status and that the $ 125 penalty could imperil his application , according to Collings ’s ruling .
Regardless of whether prosecutors dismissed the violation , Collings replied , Sullivan would still have to tell immigration authorities that he had been charged with a drug crime if asked on an application .
But Lang and Delahunt said immigration lawyers had told them that it was the penalty that could hurt his prospects .
In his memorandum , Collings said he was not concerned about whether possession of small amounts of marijuana should be legal .
He also acknowledged that Loucks ’s office can decline to prosecute such offenses .
What vexed him , he wrote , was that Loucks ’s prosecutors routinely pursue such offenders but were making an exception for Sullivan .
If convictions of other people for the same offense jeopardized their immigration applications , he wrote , “ then why should Mr. Sullivan , who is in the same position , not have to deal with the same consequences ? ’’
Two veteran criminal defense lawyers who were not involved in the case said yesterday that they were not troubled by how prosecutors handled it .
Arnold R. Rosenfeld , the former head of the state public defender agency who teaches legal ethics at the Boston University School of Law and Northeastern School of Law , said a variety of factors might have caused Loucks to drop the case against Sullivan and not those against the other three defendants , including varying criminal histories .
Jeanne M. Kempthorne , a Salem defense lawyer and former longtime federal prosecutor , said it was “ perfectly legitimate ’ ’ for prosecutors to weigh the potential impact of Sullivan ’s case on his immigration status .
“ Am I offended by the notion that prosecutors take into account collateral circumstances ?
No , ’’ she said .
“ They should be doing that .
That ’s humane . ’’
Collings appeared to acknowledge in the first line of his memorandum that Sullivan ’s case might not strike some as a big deal , but he thought it was .
“ It sometimes happens , ’’ he wrote , “ that small cases raise issues of fundamental importance in our system of justice ; this case happens to be an example . ’’

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
Two missiles fired from a remotely piloted American aircraft struck a militant base on Tuesday in the South Waziristan tribal region , killing 16 militants , according to intelligence officials and residents reached by telephone .
A recent attack on the same village , Zangara , missed the leader of the Pakistani Taliban by hours , a Pakistani security official said soon after that missile strike .
The United States and Pakistan routinely withhold comment on suspected drone attacks .
The Pakistani military , which is locked in renewed battle with the Taliban , has been preparing a full - scale offensive in South Waziristan , where the leader of the Pakistani Taliban , Baitullah Mehsud , is based .
In the prelude to the offensive , drone attacks have appeared to try to home in on Mr. Mehsud and forces loyal to him .
Before that , the United States was sending drones mainly to attack foreign members of Al Qaeda or Taliban commanders who focused their attacks on neighboring Afghanistan .
Mr. Mehsud , however , has taken on the Pakistani government and is accused of masterminding a string of deadly suicide bombings in the country .

This guest post was written by Celestine , author of Personal Excellence .
Do you expect nothing but the best from yourself ?
Well , you are not alone .
As someone who ’s highly committed to personal excellence and growth , my motto in life is to ‘ be my best self and live my best life . ’
I strive to uphold this motto every single day .
In doing so , I have adopted ten simple principles which help me stay on track :
Follow Your Heart
Follow your passion .
Life ’s too short to spend it doing something you do n’t love .
When I made the decision to leave my brand management career last year , I faced varying levels of resistance from people all around me – my parents , friends , managers , colleagues , mentors , etc .
Some thought I went crazy .
Some thought I was undergoing a strange life - phase .
Some thought it was a waste to give up a Fortune 100 career with excellent prospects and a sizable paycheck .
And others thought I was just being rash and was n’t thinking things through .
If what you are doing now is not your passion ,
then you have nothing to lose .
The truth is , it was a decision two years in the making .
I had already discovered my passion before I graduated from college .
After two years of working , I had reached the point where every day I spent at my job was making me unhappy .
And I knew I could be doing something I really loved instead .
So I quit my job to pursue my passion , and I have n’t looked back since .
Today , I ’m happier than I ’ve ever been , pursuing my passion in full throttle – touching lives through my personal development blog , coaching people and speaking at related events .
The story does n’t end here either – I have huge plans in the future to transform even more lives and I can’t wait to make this a reality .
Now that I ’m in full control of me , there are no limits at all to what can be done !
So what ’s your passion ?
What are your goals and dreams ?
If you absolutely knew you could n’t fail , what would you do with your life ?
To aid your goal achievement process , check out my seven - part goal achievement series .
Prioritize and Focus
One of my core values is excellence , and I believe a key component of excellence is focus .
I ensure that everything I do has a single - minded focus – it starts off first with my purpose in life , laddering down to my life goals , then my long - term goals , my short - term goals , and finally down to my daily tasks .
One of the tools which helps keep me focused is my life handbook .
It ’s a life manual I created back in 2007 that contains my purpose , vision , goals , strategies , and specific plans to keep me on track .
It has served me tremendously over the years .
I ’m also a strong advocate of the 80 - 20 rule – where 20 % of the causes lead to 80 % of the effects .
Many outcomes in life are attributable to a few small actions , and once we get all those key actions right , we will gain phenomenal results .
Thus , I ’m always looking out for the most critical factors that require my attention .
Once I identify them , I put forth my best effort to conquer them .
As for the remaining factors , I either do them with lesser attention , delegate them out to others , or outsource the work .
So in summary , I make sure that the things I spend my time doing are the things that have the most impact .
Look on the Positive Side
Probably cliché , but true nonetheless , you must stay positive .
You can look at a half - filled glass from multiple perspectives .
If you are positive , you will cheer at how the glass is half - full .
If you are negative , you will sigh and resign at the half - empty portion of the glass .
If you are a realist , you will simply see the glass as a glass .
At the end of the day , what you are faced with is simply the way it is .
Everything else is your own perspective .
Focus on the negative side of the situation , and you will be mired in negativity .
Focus on the positive upside , and you will gain a positive outlook which will improve your experience and quality of life , giving you the momentum to move onward and upward .
Place Yourself in the Face of Uncertainty
Uncertainty is my compass towards growth .
Whenever I ’m faced with something that makes me feel uncomfortable or uncertain , it ’s an indicator that there are growth opportunities inside me .
In fact , the more uncertain I feel , the more it signifies the possibility for growth .
If I feel uncertain about a particular topic I ’m writing about , it means I need to learn more about this topic before I continue writing .
If I feel uncertain about a circumstance , it means I need to learn how to deal with it .
It has become a natural reaction for me to explore feelings of uncertainty inside of me as they arise , work on them , and then emerge with an increased level of self - awareness .
Are you putting yourself in the face of uncertainty ?
Or are you snuggled away in your comfort zone ?
Personal growth only occurs when you are faced with an unprecedented situation that forces you to expand your comfort boundaries .
Think and Reflect
Introspection is pretty much my staple hobby .
If there ’s anything I ’m grateful for , it ’s the ability to think freely .
Being able to think and reflect on our lives is a gift .
Whenever you reflect on your own thoughts and actions , you gain a greater sense of clarity about yourself and the world around you .
Think about the things that make you happy and the things that make you sad .
Why do these things make you feel the way they do ?
Think carefully when you answer these questions , and get comfortable with your answers .
Of course , this does n’t mean you should be thinking 24/ 7 .
Sometimes , detaching yourself from the reality and becoming an observer ( through meditation , another one of my favorite hobbies ) is needed as well .
Detach Yourself
There is nothing permanent in this world .
Money , material possessions , success , circumstances , and people – each of these enter and leave our lives continuously .
Thus , there is no reason to attach yourself to whatever you see .
This includes the outcome of different situations .
If there is something happy in your life , relish in it , enjoy it , but do n’t develop an unhealthy craving towards it .
If there is something unhappy in your life , experience the emotion and smile at it at the same time , knowing that nothing is permanent and that this situation will dissipate in time .
Many of life ’s disappointments and miseries come from attaching yourself to particular outcomes .
When you realize that nothing is permanent and all that you see will be gone soon , then feelings of unhappiness and fear tend to dissipate .
Concentrate on Actionable Steps
Do n’t waste your time on things that you cannot change .
I generally classify things you cannot change into 2 categories – ( 1 ) The past ( 2 ) Other people .
This means that you should focus on effecting the present , so you can shape the future and progress your wellbeing .
Harping on things that cannot be changed is just a waste of your time and energy .
If something happened in the past that upset you , focus on what can be done to alleviate the situation in the future .
If people are annoying you , focus on what you can act on to remove the annoyance .
There was a time at my previous job where I faced a difficult series of challenges .
I became somewhat jaded and fell into a self - victimizing mode .
After a short period of doing this , I just felt sick of it – the negativity , the inaction , everything .
That ’s when I realized that no matter what the circumstances are , or how tough they may appear , there are always actionable steps I can take to change the situation .
For whatever challenge you may be facing in life now , think in terms of actionable steps .
What can you do in this situation ?
How can you act to move yourself closer to where you want to be ?
Check Marc ’s excellent post 28 Ways to Slay the Delay to learn more about taking action .
Keep the Momentum Alive
Most people often spend copious amount of time thinking about things and planning things , but then defer the action stage perpetually .
They justify themselves into inaction , citing reasons such as wanting to avoid failure .
It ’s a total cop-out .
Here ’s another favorite quote of mine :
Even if you ’re on the right track , you ’ll get run over if you just sit there .
- Will Rogers .
It is by taking action and receiving feedback from this action that we expand our horizons .
By constantly acting and moving , you are automatically gaining more knowledge just by virtue of the response you are receiving from your interactions with the world around you .
Remember , information wo n’t walk up to you on its own .
You have to go get it .
Learn From the Best
Many of the things you want to know have already been experienced firsthand by others .
I have found that I can achieve so much more by studying what others have already done .
Then I can build upon the knowledge I gain from them .
In the process , I keep the best practices and remove everything else .
This does n’t mean that you stop experiencing new things for yourself .
It just means you are n’t reinventing the wheel a hundred times over .
It ’s a simple way to avoid making the mistakes others have already made .
This cuts down the learning curve by a whole lot and gives you much better results in a much shorter timeframe .
In summary :
Surround yourself with great people .
As Jim Rohn puts it , you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with .
Study the best practices of the people who are succeeding in subjects you would like to pursue .
Help Others
I used to be quite a selfish person , keeping everything , including my knowledge , for myself .
I had heard many talk about the benefits that come from contribution and giving , but I could never comprehend them until I gave it a try .
In the past year after I left my day job , I have dedicated myself to serving others and helping others live their best life .
It has been the most incredible and meaningful year of my life yet , and I just know there ’s so much more to come .
When you help others , you not only help them grow , but you also grow yourself .
Your generosity opens the floodgates to an abundance of love and resources that flow between everyone involved .
For example , I spend many hours every day working on my personal development blog and writing free articles for others .
While I receive no direct monetary benefit for what I write , the universe pays me back indirectly – in terms of media coverage from journalists who heard about my blog and my story , speaking engagements by organizations which heard about me through word of mouth , coaching sign - ups from people who want to enlist my help in achieving their dreams , love from readers who have benefited from my writings , and much more .
Of course , the motivation to give should come from an unadulterated desire to want to give and contribute , and not for the benefits that follow .
The joy of giving comes from giving itself ; the other perks are just a bonus .
Conclusion
Apply these ten principles into your life , and I promise you ’ll start seeing positive results .
Please stay in touch and let me know how they work out for you . 😉

Scientists have discovered seven new species of deep - sea worms in the Pacific .
The worms , members of a new genus , Swima , are up to about four inches long , eyeless and have paddlelike bristles that move rapidly , allowing them to swim forward or backward .
That ’s all very interesting , but what makes the worms truly spectacular are the little green glow sticks that are found on five of the species .
Attached to segments near the head , these tiny organs  more blobs than sticks , actually  can be released from the body , instantly producing a bright green bioluminescence that lasts for many seconds as the worms swim away .
The researchers refer to the worms colloquially as green bombers and say the phenomenon may help them distract potential predators .

Using remotely operated submersibles , Karen J. Osborn of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and colleagues from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and other organizations found the worms at depths of about 6,000 to 12,500 feet off Mexico , California and Oregon and near the Philippines .
Their report is published in the journal Science .
Investigator Laura W. Deland says she collects links to photographs of “ penguin poo depressurizing penguins ” ( the physics of which was honored with an Ig Nobel Prize in 2005 ) .

The specimen is now in the British Geological Survey collection Palaeontologists have drawn with ink extracted from a preserved fossilised squid uncovered during a dig in Trowbridge , Wiltshire .
The fossil , thought to be 150 million years old , was found when a rock was cracked open , revealing the one - inch - long black ink sac .
A picture of the creature and its Latin name was drawn using its ink .
Dr Phil Wilby of the British Geological Survey said it was an ancient creature similar to the modern - day squid .
" The structure is similar to ink from a modern squid so we can write with it , " he said .
' Medusa effect '
The find was made at a site which was first excavated in Victorian times where thousands of Jurassic fossils with preserved soft tissues were found .
Dr Wilby , who led the excavation , said : " We think that these creatures were swimming around during the Jurassic period and were turned to stone soon after death .
It 's called the Medusa effect . "
It is difficult to imagine how you can have something as soft and sloppy as an ink sac inside a rock that is 150 million years old
Dr Phil Wilby Experts believe one possibility is that thousands of the creatures congregated in the area to mate before being poisoned by algae in the water .
Remains of a different species of squid have also been found , suggesting the carcasses attracted predators to feed on them and they in turn also died .
Dr Wilby said : " They can be dissected as if they are living animals , you can see the muscle fibres and cells .
" It is difficult to imagine how you can have something as soft and sloppy as an ink sac fossilised in three dimension , still black , and inside a rock that is 150 million years old . "
The specimen is now in the British Geological Survey collection in Nottingham .
Part of the ink sac has been sent to Yale University in America for more in - depth chemical analysis .

When in Doubt , Blame Immigrants and ACORN : Media Conservatives Choose Scapegoats Over Substance
On Friday , state unemployment figures highlighted a weak job market .
The California numbers moved up again reaching a high for the recession registering an 11.6 percent unemployment rate .
This comes at a time when the state is in a $ 26.3 billion budget deficit .
Even though some are getting excited that a budget deal may be in reach , they forget that we still have a revenue problem .
What does that mean ?
We ’ll be back in this same spot a few months down the road .
Much of these structural problems have to do with how California collects revenues from personal income taxes and other volatile sources of income .
Another reason why this will be a prolonged recession for the state is our heavy reliance on real estate .
I happened to catch one of those house - flipping shows this weekend and what I saw simply reaffirms that California still has pockets of denial .
A home was bought in a better area of Southern California and the buyers added every tiny detail including a Jacuzzi , stainless steal appliances , hardwood floors , and of course the granite countertops .
The home needed work but was in a so - called prime area .
The home sat on the market as you would suspect but eventually , someone paid a price that simply did not justify the home and location .
From purchase , rehab , to sale it took nearly one year .
The realtors gave out price ranges from $ 500,000 to $ 910,000 .
The asking price was over $ 1 million .
It sold for that price .
This simply reaffirms what I have been observing and what the data is telling us .
The middle to upper range of the market is finding fewer and fewer suckers .
The Alt - A and option ARM tsunami will hit these areas like a ton of bricks come late 2009 and into 2010 .
Some of these areas include Culver City , Palms , and Pasadena .
But I know the main question many want answered is “ when will we really see a true bottom for the California housing market ? ”
For that answer , I decided to compile an intricate graph looking at tiered housing prices for the Los Angeles area and statewide unemployment :
* Click for sharper image
We should spend some time looking at this chart carefully since it may hold the future of where we are heading .
First , in the late 1980s to early 1990s Southern California had a housing bubble .
Shocking , I know .
The peak was reached in June of 1990 looking at the Case - Shiller data .
The unemployment rate hit a trough in January of 1990 at 5.1 percent .
This is one of your more typical patterns of housing declines .
First , you see unemployment creeping up which burst the housing bubble .
Housing prices did not reach a trough until March of 1996 nearly six years later .
Unemployment peaked in October of 1992 at 9.9 percent .
Even as the employment situation improved , housing prices still continued their downward movement .
That in many respects was a normal boom and bust cycle .
It is easy to understand .
Yet there is no semblance of logic for what occurred after the 1996 trough .
Southern California housing prices increased non -stop until reaching a peak in September of 2006 .
A decade of massive appreciation .
Even the sharp spike in unemployment during the 2001 recession and tech bust did very little to stop the Southern California housing bubble .
If you take the 73.07 trough figure reached in 1996 and look at the 273.94 peak figure from September of 2006 housing prices for the region nearly quadrupled !
This is pure insanity .
This is seeing a $ 100,000 home selling for $ 400,000 ten years later .
Or a $ 200,000 home selling for $ 800,000 a decade later .
California was home to some of the most toxic mortgage producers including IndyMac and Countrywide Financial .
These lending institutions not only employed Californians but also allowed them to play into the housing bubble .
California turned itself into a snake eating its own tail .
When housing was booming , so was the state and those working in the real estate industry .
Now that housing is imploding so is the state .
The two now share a similar fate .
If we glance at the chart again , you ’ll notice that from peak unemployment in 1992 to the trough in housing prices in 1996 there was nearly a 4 year lag .
Assuming this pattern , we still do not have the peak unemployment figure since we keep moving up .
So assume we hit peak unemployment in 2009 ( best - case scenario ) then is the housing bottom really in 2013 ?
Most estimates show us reaching peak unemployment in 2010 .
I would argue that this bubble is much larger than the late 1980s bubble so we will probably have a much deeper impact .
And make no mistake , every tier of the market will be hit .
It is also the case that we did not have a significant number of Alt - A and option ARM loans back then .
It is an interesting note that the highest tier includes homes over $ 433,383 while the average Alt - A loan is $ 420,000 + .
Want to take a wild guess what is going to happen to that highest tier ?
It may be hard to detect what was exactly happening to our current market but the action is unmistakable .
First , let us zoom into the trough of the 1990s to see what occurred in various tiers :
This is where you see the real action taking place .
What you ’ll notice is this .
The overall market hit a trough in 1996 .
At this overall bottom , the high end of the market had the strongest percent fall according to the Case - Shiller data .
This would of course make logical sense since the high range of the market has a tiny number of buyers and in a tough economy , sellers will have to lower prices to move inventory .
Keep in mind this is market behavior at a true bottom .
When the recovery starts , you can see that the high range led the way , followed by the mid tier , and finally the low range .
At a certain inflexion point , all three ranges cross .
With the Alt - A and option ARM tsunami around the corner you can practically see this pattern playing out again .
There is very little doubt that this will happen .
Let us now zoom in and view our current situation :
The current situation is inverted .
That is , the low range is at the bottom , the overall market is next followed by the mid to high range which still have to catch up .
And the more troubling fact is the trend for all is still lower .
We have n’t reached the bottom yet and unemployment is still spiking .
When you look at this data and look at history , we are still very far away from a bottom here in Southern California .
Combine this with the Alt - A and option ARM loans that were made in mass during the boom and you have a recipe for a second phase of this housing bubble .
Maybe I was too optimistic saying 2011 was going to be the year we reached a housing bottom .

I invited Alexis Ohanian , the company ’s co-founder , to come to Mixergy and talk about how he did it .
It took Reddit ‘s founders less than 2 years to launch the company , make it into a top social news site and sell it to Conde Nast Publications , owner of Wired .
Alexis Ohanian is the co-founder of Reddit , a leading social news site .
He ’s also the founder of breadpig , an “ uncorporation ” that creates and sells geeky things for fun and no profit .
The mascot is a pig with bread wings .
Excerpts : The Reddit story
Andrew : True or False ?
You saw that Digg was doing well and said , “ let ’s jump on that bandwagon ? ”
Alexis : False .
That is false .
This is a good chance for me to dispel any rumors .
We were living in a veil of ignorance for the first month or so at Reddit .
We were working our asses off , my co-founder Steve Huffman and I , building a site that we got online , and then two weeks into the site being online we found out that there was this other site called Digg , that had venture funding and it had been out for quite some time .
And , yeah , then the comparisons inevitably started coming .
How ’d you meet investor Paul Graham , founder of Y Combinator ?
He was giving this talk during our spring break and we were the only kids in Virginia going North to Boston ( where we actually saw snow ) to spend a few hours listening to Paul Graham read an essay .
But afterward , Steve got his book signed , and I told him it would totally be worth the price of buying him a drink if he ’d sit down with us and just hear us out , because we came up from Virginia with this startup idea .
What was the idea you pitched to Y Combinator ?
We approached Y Combinator , sort of seed stage venture company that invested in us , with an idea that would transform the way you order food , specifically using a cell phone to do so .
They did n’t really like the idea .
They liked us , but they hated the idea .
So , they said , “ You guys should come back with a better idea , and maybe we ’ll take you in to the program . ”
We came back , we sat down with Paul Graham , Y Combinator ’s founder , and we talked , trying to come up with ideas .
And one of the issues that Steve and I had , and then I think , to some extent Paul had , was that there was no great way to filter all the best stuff on the web .
And the site we actually looked to during those first few weeks was Delicious.com / Popular .
Now , if you have n’t been to Delicious.com / Popular , check it out .
I think you can see aesthetically , a lot of the early motivation for Reddit .
Your investor did n’t like your first idea , why did n’t you argue ?
Because Steve came in with a tremendous amount of respect for Paul .
I really only knew him from a couple of his essays , but Steve was really a student of his work .
I think there was a great appeal to the Y Combinator format .
And I think we were willing to admit the fact that we were stupid and ignorant .
The idea for Reddit came from Paul Graham ?
Yeah , I mean , it was in that conversation with Paul where we developed this idea for creating a way to find out what ’s new online .
All the actual mechanics of how that would work , basically happened in the next few weeks , while Steve and I were in a crap apartment , in Bedford , Massachusetts , playing a lot of Warcraft .
How did you go from idea to product ?
The first three months were really intense at Y Combinator .
The first month in particular , we went from this very vague idea to an actual site that went on live about three weeks later .
It was really just me and Steve sitting in this apartment , in the middle of nowhere , Massachusetts .
We would only go outside for Pizza and then we would go to Azeroth in World of Warcraft at night to give us some distraction and that was it .
And , it was just a lot of — a lot of doodling in our journals , a lot of chatting across the table from one another and just work .
Andrew ’s note :
Here are some early designs that Alexis talked about in the interview .
Full program includes
– The real motivation for starting reddit .
– Why they sold Reddit .
( It was n’t just about valuation . )
– How Reddit considered doing a video show after seeing Diggnation .
And why they quickly rejected the idea .
– How the reputation of their investor , Paul Graham , helped get the first members of reddit ’s community .
– What life is like after the sale .
– Discussion of the controversy surrounding subreddits .

BinTube Review : A look into the streaming usenet provider with its own unique newsreader
The Battlefield franchise has long been a jewel in EA 's PC gaming crown , but these days the company is more interested in selling you a store than a product , and the new Battlefield titles give us hints about the new priorities for games : cheaper , if not free , with an emphasis on quick action and easy - to - understand rules .
Fans of the series may be taken aback by the console launch of Battlefield 1943 , and gamers looking for more meat in their titles may find it hard to cough up $ 15 for the thin experience .
Battlefield 1943 is quick and easy , but is that a good thing ?
The graphics of Battlefield 1943 are wholly impressive for a downloadable title , with buildings , trees , and structures that have a welcome ability to be blown away .
It 's simply not safe to crouch behind structures to take your shot anymore .
The $ 15 game , available now for PS3 and the Xbox 360 ( with a PC release coming in September ) , features three maps that are taken from the original Battlefield 1942 , and one game mode ( Conquest ) .
Each side has three analogous character classes , and each one features two weapons .
You can't tweak your loadout , and every weapon features unlimited ammo , so do n't worry about thinking too much before you 're dumped into battle .
In fact , respawn times are remarkably fast ; you wo n't find yourself out of the fray for long .
The pace is a bit too frantic , making it hard to coordinate play with your friends .
One neat addition is the use of squads : you can create a squad with three of your friends , share a voice channel , and see each other on the map .
You can even spawn together , giving you a nice advantage in battle .
The game supports up to 24 players per game , but a few well - oiled squads can be much more effective than unorganized players running about or camping as they wait for planes .
The vehicles are likewise cut to the bone .
There are planes .
There are tanks .
There are jeeps .
Planes take some practice and a steady hand to fly well , but a talented pilot can be a huge asset .
Jeeps can get you around very quickly in the thick of battle , but tanks seem to make you more of a target than an asset in firefights .
This is all assuming you can get into the game .
Our review code came with with the caveat that more servers will be added frequently , so we were told to keep plugging away if we could n't get into the game .
Considering our inability to properly review Battlefield Heroes for the same reason , it 's worth wondering how long it will take for EA and DICE to launch a game that ... well , works .
Battlefield 1943 seems like a remake of the original title for the attention deficit set , but still provides a significant number of thrills and a gentle learning curve .
The problem is that such a simplified version of the game may bore players in short order ; there just is n't much meat to dig into once you 've played each map a few times .
Another map , with a new game mode , will be added when each version records 45 million kills online , but after that we should expect frequent for - pay level ( and maybe even character ) packs for the game .
This is EA , so your $ 15 just opens the door ; exploring the house is going to cost you .
A little local controversy involving the Church of Scientology and its critics could lead to curbs on the right to anonymity of anyone using the web .
The argument is currently raging in Australia , following the launch last November by the Australian Human Rights Commission ( HREOC ) of a report entitled Freedom of Religion and Belief in the 21st Century .
The theory behind this report was that it would provide a good base from which Australia could take stock of its progress in these areas over the last decade , as well as coming up with proposals to move forward .
While the impetus behind this project would appear to be mostly positive , it was always likely that calls for individual religious groups to submit proposals around protection of faiths and their own view of religious freedom could have unintended consequences .
One such consequence arrived in the shape of submission no 1931 , from the Church of Scientology , protesting strongly at attacks on their faith by protest group Anonymous , and running an online campaign from a site called Whyweprotest .
According to the Church of Scientology , these attacks have reached the point where some members have been physically threatened , and slanderous attacks have been made online : however , the police have found it difficult to intervene , simply because of the anonymous nature of the attacks .
The organisation claims that since January 2008 , they have been subjected to a continuing campaign of violence and abuse from a hate group calling themselves ‘ Anonymous ’ .
It adds : " In the last 13 months they have also ( ie as well as their internet based assaults ) committed acts of harassment and criminal offences ' in real life ' against the Church , its members and Church property . "
As evidence , it cites " bomb threats , arson threats and committed acts of vandalism against Scientology churches " .
In response , the protest group claim that it needs anonymity to protect members ' lives and livelihood .
It states : " Due to Scientology 's Fair Game policy , we put ourselves at risk socially , politically , and financially when we speak out against this dangerous cult .
" This is a cult that has a well earned reputation for harassing critics and openly critical ex-scientologists at their homes and workplaces .
Taking measures to protect your privacy and anonymity when confronted by an aggressively litigious cult is a matter of common sense . "
Whatever the rights and wrongs of the actions taken , it is the Church ’s response to the HREOC that could end up having the most far - reaching consequences .
They are looking for the law to be tightened to make it illegal to incite hatred against religious groups : and they are also looking for government to strip away anonymity from anyone behind such activity online .
While this argument is focused on the high emotions aroused by supporters and detractors of the CoS , it comes at a time when the law is increasingly suspicious of online anonymity .
Back in June , the Times overturned a court order designed to protect the anonymity of a police blogger .
More recently , Google found itself on the receiving end of a lawsuit requiring it to cough up the identity of an anonymous blogger who had made adverse comments about model Liskula Cohen .
The tide does seem to be moving inexorably against online anonymity – and this submission from the CoS may well be a sign of further things to come in Australia . ®
The Legislature and then 60 percent of the state 's electorate would have to OK the state constitutional amendment , which would almost certainly face its own federal constitutional hurdles ( the state does n't have much say - so in federal tax penalties ) .
Nearly 4 million Floridians are uninsured presently , and an effort last year by Gov. Charlie Crist and the Legislature called " Cover Florida " to try and make more no - frills coverage plans available without placing mandates on businesses or insurers has so far failed to make a dent in that number .
• 850 residents of Florida are losing health insurance every day , and 14,000 Americans nationwide lose insurance daily .
• The average family premium in Florida costs $ 1,400 more because our system fails to cover everyone -- and $ 1,100 more nationally .
• Our broken health insurance system will cost the Florida economy as much as $ 19 billion this year in productivity losses due to the uninsured -- and up to $ 248 billion nationally .
• In Florida there has been a 15 percent increase in the uninsured rate since 2007 .
• 3,920,000 are uninsured today in Florida .
• In Florida the combined market share of the top two insurers is 45 percent , limiting employers ’ and families ’ health insurance options as well as the care they receive .
• The average family premium will rise from $ 12,763 to $ 21,779 by 2019 in Florida without health care reform .
• In Florida , without health care reform , 556,070 will have lost coverage from January 2008 to December 2010 .
• In Florida , 1,854,000 people would gain coverage as a result of the House health care reform bill by 2013 , and 2,982,000 would gain coverage by 2019 .
• A typical Florida family will pay $ 21,779 for health coverage in 2019 without health care reform .
The extremists from the Marco Rubio faction of the Florida GOP have the perfect solution to health care reform : they 've proposed a constitutional amendment banning federal health care .
Think Progress broke the bizarre story last night .
Two of the worst right - wing fanatics in the state legislature , Senator Carey Baker ( Eustis ) and Representative Scott Plakon ( Longwood ) , filed HJR 37 , a whacked - out proposal that somehow forgot to mention that President Obama was born in Mombassa , Jakarta and Mexico , but that does seek to prevent planned Federal health care reform legislation from affecting Floridians .
Baker , who 's an underdog in the GOP primary for State Agriculture Commissioner against Adam " Howdy Doody " Putnam is a leader of the Florida secessionists and a self - styled tea - bagger .
The bill calls on all Floridians to provide for their own health care " to preserve the freedom of all residents of the state . "
Baker receives health care benefits under the US Veteran ’s Administration , funded by federal tax dollars , and participates in Florida 's health insurance plan whose premiums are subsidized by state taxpayer funds .
He 's widely considered to be an off - the - wall crackpot , a product of too much Hate Talk Radio .
Even the very conservativecould n't resist gently poking fun at the two delusional wingnuts .
Paranoid and looking for some free publicity , the two of them are calling health care reform an " unprecedented power - grab by President Obama and Congress " which is " clearly not in the best interests of the citizens of Florida .
” The battle perfectly demonstrates the narrow and twisted conservative mentality that fights for the status quo and for wealthy elites and has , historically been on the wrong side of every important battle in American history .
Conservatives like Baker , Plakon and Rubio opposed the Declaration of Independence , the American Revolution , the Bill of Rights , " universal " suffrage for white males , extending suffrage to women and to the poor and to minorities ; conservatives opposed ending slavery , opposed public education , opposed food safety and consumer protection , opposed the abolition of child labor , opposed the 8 hour workday , opposed the national park system , opposed the minimum wage , opposed the right of workers to form unions , opposed cleaning up our air , our water , and toxic dump sites , opposed rural electrification , Social Security , Civil Rights , Medicare and Medicaid .
They opposed -- in general -- PROGRESS -- and they 're still dancing to the same stale tunes .
The Ceter For American Progress took a look at the health care situation in Florida that Baker and Plakon are trying to use to further their disgraceful political careers .
The numbers show a great need for the kind of health care reform President Obama is proposing :

Gründe , keine CDs zu kaufen Peter Mühlbauer
Anwälte mahnen den Wiederverkauf legal erworbener Tonträger im Internet ab
Wer eine in einem Geschäft erworbene CD bei einem Online - Verkaufsportal wie eBay oder Hood .
de einstellt , rechnet im Regelfall nicht damit , dass er abgemahnt wird .
Immerhin hat er das Produkt ja selbst ganz regulär gekauft - und den Handel mit gebrauchten Tonträgern konnte die Musikindustrie trotz mehrerer Vorstöße bisher nicht grundsätzlich unterbinden .
Trotzdem mahnen immer mehr Rechteinhaber private Anbieter von CDs , Bildern und Fanartikeln ab , von denen sie behaupten , dass sie nicht oder nicht ausreichend lizenziert seien .
Bei den genauen Gründen , warum etwas in der Vergangenheit legal erworbene nun nicht mehr verkauft werden darf , werden die Kanzleien selten spezifisch .
Teilweise sollen urheberrechtliche Frist - und Vorschriftsänderungen dafür verantwortlich sein , teilweise eine mangelnde " urheberrechtliche Erschöpfung " für außerhalb der EU hergestellte " Werkstücke " .
Häufig handelt es sich auch um Aufnahmen , über die sich Rechteinhaber streiten .
Besonders betroffen sind Tonträger und andere Waren mit der Aufschrift The Sweet ( bei denen mit markenrechtlichen Ansprüchen argumentiert wird ) , CDs und Bilder von Michael Jackson ( die eine Münchner Kanzlei im Auftrag des Sony - Konzerns abmahnt ) und Produkte von und mit " Bushido " .
Ein ehemaliger Iron - Maiden - Fan aus Esslingen hat nun angekündigt , sich " in Zukunft von allen CDs und DVDs fern zu halten " .
Sollte eine in Berlin und Hamburg ansässige Kanzlei , von der er wegen des Verkaufs einer ( nach eigenen Angaben vor 15 Jahren legal in einem Elektromarkt erstandenen ) CD abgemahnt wurde , auf ihren finanziellen Forderungen beharren , werde er ihr alle in seinem Besitz befindlichen Iron - Maiden - CDs und - Videos schicken und " nie wieder Geld für Musik ausgeben . "
Das auf den 13 .
August 2009 datierte Abmahnschreiben , in dem der 20 .
August als Frist für die Abgabe der Unterlassungserklärung genannt ist , trug einen Poststempel vom 17 .
August und kam am 18 .
bei ihm an .
Die Kanzlei erklärte dies auf seine Anfrage hin mit " unglücklichen Zufällen im Postlauf " .
Kritik übt der Esslinger auch daran , dass das Anwaltsbüro die darin verlangten 100 Euro nicht als nach § 97a Absatz 2 des Urheberrechtsgesetzes ( UrhG ) geltende gesetzliche Obergrenze für " einfach gelagerte Fälle mit einer nur unerheblichen Rechtsverletzung " darstellte , sondern als besondere Kulanz .
Der abmahnende
Anwalt erklärt dies damit , dass die im letzten Herbst eingeführte Vorschrift für Fälle mit internationalem Bezug nicht anwendbar sei , weil es sich dadurch nicht um einen " einfach gelagerten Fall " im Sinne der genannten Vorschrift handele .
Ein solch internationaler Bezug liege wiederum deshalb vor , weil die Iron Maiden Holdings Limited in England inkorporiert sei .
Der auf Abmahnrecht spezialisierte Rechtsanwalt Dr. Alexander
Wachs zweifelte gegenüber Telepolis die Haltbarkeit dieser Begründung allerdings insofern an , als sich seiner Kenntnis nach weder in der Rechtsprechung noch in der Gesetzesbegründung Anhaltspunkte dafür finden lassen .
Zudem würden ausländische Firmen mit solch einer Auslegung besser gestellt als deutsche .
Auch der Münsteraner Juraprofessor und Urheberrechtsexperte Thomas Hoeren verwarf die Argumentation der abmahnenden Kanzlei mit der " Kontrollüberlegung " , dass im Musikgeschäft ja alle wichtigen Rechteinhaber im Ausland säßen .
Zur Untermauerung des behaupteten Streitwerts von mindestens 10.000 Euro , aus dem sich nach dem Rechtsanwaltsvergütungsgesetz eine Gebühr in Höhe von 751,80 ergeben würde , hatte die abmahnende Kanzlei anfangs einen Beschluss des Landgerichts Hamburg vom 9 .
August 2007 genannt .
Erst nach einen Hinweis des Abgemahnten , dass diese Entscheidung aus einem Filesharingprozess nicht einschlägig sein könne , weil über Tauschbörsen Dateien beliebig oft kopiert werden können , räumte man ein , der genannte Beschluss sei " in der Tat nicht der richtige gewesen " und verwies auf eine einstweilige Verfügung des Landgerichts Hamburg , vor welcher allerdings keine Unterlassungserklärung abgegeben worden war .
Der Abgemahnte vermutet deshalb , dass der dort festgesetzte Streitwert möglicherweise nur deshalb so hoch angesetzt wurde , weil das Gericht davon ausging , dass der Beklagte vorhat , größere Stückzahlen des bemängelten Tonträgers anzubieten .
Für den von der Kanzlei behaupteten Rechtsanspruch auf Herausgabe der CD verlangte der Esslinger die Nennung einer exakten Rechtsgrundlage , bekam aber lediglich die Antwort , dass ein Anspruch " aufgrund Gesetzes " bestehe .
Gegenüber Telepolis nannte die Kanzlei schließlich den § 98 Abs. 3 UrhG , der einen - allerdings " angemessen vergüteten " - Überlassungsanspruch gegen " zur rechtswidrigen Verbreitung bestimmte Vervielfältigungsstücke " gewährt .
Für den abgemahnten Heavy - Metal - Hörer zeigte der Anwalt wenig Verständnis .
Er habe , so seine Auskunft , früher selber auf Plattenbörsen " Bootlegs " gekauft und wisse deshalb , dass Fans häufig bewusst nicht lizenzierte Tonträger anböten .
Von einer Statusänderung früher legal verkaufter Tonträger könne man dadurch erfahren , dass man bei großen Online - Anbietern nachsehe , ob die Werke dort weiterhin angeboten würden .
Wer jedes Risiko ausschließen wolle , der dürfe allerdings keine gebrauchten CDs verkaufen , sondern müsse sie behalten oder vernichten .
Umwelt - und ressourcenschonender das Risiko unbeabsichtiger Rechtsverletzungen begrenzen könnte eine Bagatelle - Regelung , wie sie vor ein paar Jahren debattiert wurde .
Damals war es neben Politikern von Union und FDP vor allem die kulturpolitische Sprecherin der Linksfraktion , Lukrezia Jochimsen , die sich vehement gegen eine solche Schutzregel für Verbraucher aussprach , weil sie den " Respekt " vor dem " Geistigen Eigentum " schwächen würde .

As we have all now read , yet another recorded interview with culture warrior Daniel Hannan has surfaced and caused much controversy .
What I ’m interested in is the defence of Daniel Hannan over this emanating from the right .
Their claim is that Hannan ’s lionising of Powell is benign , because he never associated himself with Powell ’s views about immigration specifically , and is in any case personally a ‘ libertarian ’ on borders .
Guido Fawkes leads the charge , writing :
Guido spoke to Dan to ask him when he gave the interview – about “ a month or so ” ago was his answer – before the NHS kerfuffle cemented Dan in the affections of Labour ’s spin operation .
He said it was n’t the first time he said that , that he was n’t going to deny his view in the future and that on immigration he was on the record as taking the Friedmanite free market liberal view rather than the restrictive Powellite stance .
Is this correct though ?
Well , not if Hannan actually believes what he co-wrote with Douglas Carswell in The Plan : Twelve Months to Renew Britain .
Because The Plan certainly does not endorse a libertarian open borders policy .
Let ’s take a look , starting with the book ’s opening paragraph :
The British state is failing .
It ca n’t deliver even the most basic services competently .
We have the highest prisoner population in Europe , and one of the highest crime rates .
Our pupils compare dismally with similarly aged pupils in other countries and previous generations .
Our healthcare system is more likely to kill its charges than any other in the developed world .
Our roads are choked , our railways crumbling , our airports unbearable .
Our borders are , to all intents and purposes , wide open . ( p. 7 )
Wait : so , libertarians are enthusiasts for open borders .
But Hannan thinks that Britain is ‘ failing ’ because of open borders .
Hmm .
On to the next page :
Meanwhile , more than 200,000 Britons emigrate every year ; more than 300,000 foreigners settle in their place , many of them illicitly .
For the state cannot even discharge its elementary function : to secure the national territory .
( p. 8 )
It does n’t sounds like Hannan is very keen on a libertarian approach to immigration after all , does it ?
Later on , Hannan and Carswell endorse immigration quotas ( p. 43 ) , and advocate the extended use of national referendums , partly on grounds that , if the Swiss experience is anything to go by , the public , when asked , are likely to reject ‘ generous immigration rules ’ ( p. 159 ) .
And let ’s not omit to mention that the dynamic duo also oppose humanitarian intervention to save people from genocide , out of concern that some of the people rescued might later want to settle in Britain .
They write :
Like the doctrine of universal human rights on which it is based , humanitarian intervention is a doctrine with superficial appeal but which is unfortunately wide open to abuse .
Interdependence was shown to be a grim reality when intervention over Kosovo in 1999 caused huge numbers of Albanian asylum seekers to arrive in this country .
( pp. 72-3 ) .
So is Daniel Hannan a libertarian on borders ?
Nope .

A new breed of climate sceptic is becoming more common .
This new breed is not sceptical of the science , but of the policy response .
The latest example is a new report by a group of leading academics :
How to get climate policy back on course .
It questions the approach to climate change action within the United Nations negotiations .
Rather than the current approach that emphasises targets for emissions reductions , the report advocates support for low - carbon and energy - efficient technologies ( PDF ) .
The frustration of the report 's authors is understandable .
The negotiations since the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 1994 have been painfully slow .
For too long some industrialised economies – particularly the US – were either lukewarm or hostile to the negotiating process .
The emissions reductions targets announced for 2020 by leading developed countries such as the US and Japan are not sufficient – this is despite Japan 's commitment to exclusively domestic action .
Furthermore , long promised finance and technological assistance for developing countries has yet to materialise .
However , we should n't take this frustration too far and make an idealised climate change policy the enemy of the good .
As the authors of the report emphasise , there is considerable economic , political and psychological capital invested in the current policy approach .
This means that the negotiations in Copenhagen are the only game in town .
But none of the measures advocated in the report will add up unless they are implemented within an overall limit on emissions .
Caps on emissions are required as part of what Anthony Giddens has recently called the " ensuring State " .
We need to know that the actions of individuals , businesses and communities are sufficient to limit emissions in line with climate science .
Caps on emissions are more effective where they are implemented alongside policies to price carbon emissions .
The EU emissions trading scheme does this , and there are provisions in the US climate change bill for a similar scheme .
There is huge room for improvement in the EU , for example , by tightening caps and reducing the number of get out clauses for industries with large lobbying budgets .
But again this is no excuse to dismiss the whole idea .
Pricing carbon is necessary ( though not sufficient ) to move economies towards a more low - carbon pathway .
The report 's authors recognise the value of pricing carbon to some extent .
They advocate a " low ring - fenced carbon tax " to fund low - carbon technologies .
But a low tax is unlikely to make any real difference .
Furthermore , their emphasis on funding for low - carbon technologies and energy efficiency is only a partial solution – and sets up a false dichotomy between emissions caps and support for technology and efficiency .
It echoes the view of President Bush who rejected the Kyoto treaty .
Having done so , he used his 2007 State of the Union address to offer the alternative view that " the way forward is through technology " .
Simply supporting cleaner , low - carbon technologies is not enough and is naive .
Experience shows that pushing technologies with funding is just one part of a complex picture .
There also needs to be a market for these technologies so that businesses and individuals adopt them .
Markets for low - carbon technologies need to be created through a combination of carbon prices and regulations .
Without them , a lot of good technology investment will go to waste .
The emphasis on energy efficiency in the report is welcome , but not thought through .
Almost all assessments of climate mitigation pathways conclude that energy efficiency should be done first because it saves us money .
However , making energy production and use more efficient is not as easy as it seems , and can have unintended consequences .
The " rebound effect " happens because the savings are used for other energy - consuming activities .
This seldom makes energy efficiency a waste of time , but emissions caps are needed to limit such rebounds .
Caps on emissions are therefore a vital component of a successful deal at Copenhagen .
Without this and action on other crucial issues such as finance and technology , leading developing countries will not sign up – and will refuse to make commitments of their own .
There are some positive signs .
Good progress is being made in bilateral talks between the US and China about the conditions under which China could be brought into a new deal .
Gordon Brown 's recent proposals on finance and technology have been widely welcomed in the developing world .
We should support these initiatives while being critical when progress is too slow or lacks ambition .
Rejecting emissions caps in favour of an exclusive emphasis on cleaner technologies is simplistic and will not work .

Spirituality --
It 's Not For Wusses
More than 20 years ago , I felt moved to explore Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism , which involves among other things , chanting prayers twice a day and repeating the mantra nam myoho renge kyo .
It started when my former wife and I called a friend one afternoon and heard this mysterious chanting in the background .
When we inquired about it , the friend invited us to a meeting the next week .
The wife and I both attended and met an interesting group of practitioners , participated in the chanting and talked afterwards .
I felt a great sense of peace from the chanting and I was hooked .
The wife , not so much .
But that was okay , Different strokes .
I returned the next week and after chanting , the group sat and around and talked , led by a guy named Bob .
I do n't remember a whole lot of the discussion , but I remember Bob saying that once you started with the practice , something in your life would shift pretty quickly .
It might be " bad , " it might be " good , " but something would change .
i nodded as if I knew , then went home .
Within the week , the wife asked me for a divorce .
Now , I 'm not going to lie and say that this was totally out of the blue .
We had been working through our issues for some time .
But divorce ?
Now ?
Really ?
Literally , my first was reaction was , " Damn , Bob was right . "
Then I promptly settled into the illusion of pain , separation , self - doubt , hatred , devastation , fear for my son's well - being and all the other pleasant things we typically associate with divorce .
To my credit , I continued the daily rituals , attended meetings , even joined the local temple , as all about me my life seemed to be falling apart .
Thankfully , the request for divorce was not the only major shift in my life .
I distinctly recall waking up one morning , about three months later , feeling a profound peace .
I knew at that moment that I would survive the divorce and I would be happy again .
I attribute that , too , to my diligent practice of nam myoho renge ko .
All this came flooding back as I read Robert Scheinfeld 's new book , " Busting Loose From the Business Game . "
He goes on at length to explain that Busting Loose is not an overnight process , and that we can expect some serious changes .
In other words , the journey of spiritual transformation is not for wusses .
It 's funny the beliefs that we 've created around spirituality .
Some critics view it as something that they do n't have time for , a disembodied practice , designed for self - absorbed , navel - gazing vegan hippies and lost , mindless souls too weak to confront " reality " on its own terms .
Spirituality is a cheap and easy escape to la la land .
Do n't let the door hit you in the aura on the way out .
In truth , many of us spiritual travelers began with an equally inaccurate view of the journey .
We plunge in believing that learning this practice or this spiritual formula will help us " transcend " our earthly problems in a single bound .
If only I do this , life will get " better . "
Do n't forget to tape that new affirmation to the bathroom mirror .
Those of us who have played the spirituality game know better now .
It 's like walking into a biker bar at 1 a.m .
Start something and the shit is going to hit the fan .
Going deep into transformation requires courage and faith that few of us ever call upon .
So when certain other aspects cast a jaundiced eye at you , or sneeringly inquire , " still Busting Loose , are you ? " , just remember , you 're on the spiritual equivalent of the running of the bulls at Pamplona .
Run like hell and do n't look back .
You may get gored on the way , but it 's going to be okay .
By the way , check back in Sunday for my review of " Busting Loose From the Business Game . "

Induction stoves may be making their way into restaurant kitchens , but for home cooks they 're still a mystery .
Fortunately , Wired product editor ( and food geek ) Mark McClusky volunteered to enlighten us :
It took me nearly an entire evening in the the kitchen at Alinea before I realized what was weird about it .
Sure , there 's the stunning intensity of the chefs as they prepare Grant Achatz ' intricate dishes , and the nearly - operating room level of cleanliness .
But that 's not what struck me one night at the end of service .
What struck me is that I did n't know where the stove was .
Advertisement
You see , in most restaurant kitchens — like most home kitchens — the stove is the focal point of the room , the place that all the action revolves around .
If you 're running the sauté station in most big restaurants , you 're the man , the line cook who 's banging out the most food in the hottest , most extreme environment .
You 're the alpha cook .
Advertisement
Not so at Alinea .
Of course there 's a stove , but it 's much smaller than you 'd expect for a kitchen that puts out a couple of thousand plates a night , just four burners and a flat top .
Instead , the chefs at Alinea do the vast majority of their cooking using induction burners , portable ones from CookTek .
Induction is just plain cool .
Instead of using a flame like gas , or radiant heat like standard electric burners , induction burners use a magnetic field .
The field creates heat through the property outlined in Joule 's first law — you do remember your thermodynamics , right ?— in which current passing through conductive material generates heat .
So what ?
Well , a couple of things .
First , induction is super - efficient .
Induction burners convert about 85 % of the energy you pour into them into heat , compared to about 70 % for electric burners and 40 % for gas .
That means you 'll spend less to cook on induction .
Advertisement
And since the burner itself does n't create heat , it stays cool to the touch — take the pan off , and you can put your palm on it .
That also means that they do n't throw off ambient heat like gas or electric , so the kitchen stays much cooler .
Then , there 's the responsiveness of induction .
Like gas , when you turn it off , there 's no residual heat from the burner , just the pan .
Plus , there 's the flexibility of portable burners like Alinea uses .
Frying something smelly ?
Got an outdoor power outlet ?
Set up a portable burner , and you can keep the stink out of your house .
Want to keep soup warm at a party ?
Throw a burner on the buffet , and you 're good to go .
Advertisement
The one thing to keep in mind is that your pans do have to be magnetic .
That might be a pain in the ass , especially if you 're hip deep in anodized aluminum pots .
But the good news is that some of the cheapest ( and most fun to use ) cookware around — cast iron — works amazingly on induction burners , as will all your fancy pots as long as they 've got some stainless steel kicking around in them .
If in doubt , grab a magnet from your fridge door to check .
As far as specific models to check out , Circulon makes a nice burner , and Spanish appliance giant Fagor has one .
For the best combo of power and price , check out the Max Burton 6000 , which puts out 1800 watts for just $ 125 retail .

That 's how to cook like they do at the best restaurant in America .
Or , really , it 's how to cook with the same methods .
The talent is up to you .

Putting What Little We Actually Know About Chrome OS Into Context
It has seemed obvious for some time that Google would someday release a PC OS .
I became convinced after they released Android : if they ’re creating and giving away a free OS for phones , why not PCs , too ?
But I expected that Google ’s eventual PC OS was going to be an expanded meant - for - a - bigger - screen version of Android — sort of the inverse of what Apple did for the iPhone .
Apple took a PC OS and whittled it down to a fundamental core , then built new handheld - specific UI libraries and APIs on top .
The hypothetical PC version of Android I ’m imagining would have entailed1 taking the core of the mobile Android OS and creating new meant - for - a- PC libraries and APIs on top .
So it ’s not weird that Chrome was announced .
But what is weird is how it was announced .
And , despite the title of the weblog post in which the announcement was made — “ Introducing the Google Chrome OS ” — nothing has actually been introduced .
There are n’t even any screenshots , let alone a demo or any specific technical information .
With an expected ship date of “ the second half of 2010 ” , it ’s a textbook example of vaporware .
I do n’t get the timing .
Why announce it now , when it clearly is n’t close to ready ?
Why not at I/O , Google ’s developer conference six weeks ago ?
Or why not wait until it ’s ready to release to developers ?
I like facts , demos , and best of all , shipping products .
I do n’t like vague promises .
Web Apps as Native Apps
It ’s certainly interesting and ambitious to state that the entire application platform will consist of web apps .
If anyone was going to build such an OS , it ’d be Google .
Much of the initial commentary regarding Chrome OS has been wholly positive , but one common note of skepticism has been with regard to the “ web apps are the only apps ” aspect , with the frequent point of comparison being to the 1.0 release of the iPhone OS .
E.g. , Nick Mediati at PC World :
Both users and app developers are still hungry for so - called “ native ” applications — that is , software designed for a particular operating system .
A prime example ?
The iPhone .
At the 2007 Worldwide Developers Conference , Apple discussed a “ pretty sweet ” way of developing apps for the iPhone : Web apps .
While the Apple executives onstage spoke of the potential and power of Web apps , many developers and users groaned .
They did n’t just want Web apps , they wanted real apps — apps that could take full advantage of the technology the iPhone offered .
( As an aside , in the 2007 WWDC keynote , Steve Jobs did n’t describe writing web apps as a “ pretty sweet ” solution for developers who wanted to write software for the iPhone ; he described it as a “ very sweet solution ” .
I described it as a “ shit sandwich ” . )
Mediati was right that not just developers but users wanted native third party apps for the iPhone .
The difference from what Google is promising with Chrome , however , is that web apps will be the native apps on the system .
Presumably all of the default applications from Google itself will themselves be the Google web apps we already know .
It ’s an eating - your - own - dog - food issue .
What irked about Apple ’s endorsement of iPhone - optimized web apps as a “ really sweet solution ” was that , of course , none of the iPhone ’s built - in apps were web apps .
They were all written in Objective - C with Cocoa Touch .
Apple ’s own iPhone apps set a high bar for user experience — a height that could not ( and still can ’t ) be reached with web apps running in MobileSafari .
Chrome OS sounds a lot more like Palm ’s WebOS than it does the iPhone .
Palm is n’t just telling third - party developers to write apps using HTML , CSS , and JavaScript , they ’re doing it themselves with the WebOS ’s built - in apps .
In fact , considering how web - app centric Google is and always has been , Palm ’s WebOS is fundamentally more Google -y than Android , a platform where native apps are written in Java .
One thing to note regarding WebOS , too , is that while a WebOS app is written with HTML , CSS , and JavaScript and runs within a WebKit frame , it can do more than a regular “ web app ” running in a browser .
The runtime exposes additional JavaScript APIs specific to the WebOS environment .
Regular web apps — ones you “ run ” by telling a regular web browser to load via a URL — ca n’t do things like access the hardware camera or post one of those cool WebOS system - wide notifications at the bottom of the screen .
Or , taking the flip side , you could n’t just take a WebOS app and run it in a web browser on any other platform .
There ’s a big potential difference between “ web apps ” and “ apps written using web technologies ” .
If you ’re a programmer , I ’m sure you understand that ; if you ’re not , I worry that it sounds like semantic hair - splitting .
The best example I can think of are Mac OS X Dashboard widgets : they too are written using HTML , CSS , and JavaScipt , but they do n’t work anywhere other than Mac OS X .
I presume that there will be similar Chrome OS - specific APIs for web apps optimized to run on Chrome .
But who knows ?
From the description in the announcement , it sounds like Chrome OS “ apps ” really could just be web pages .
Will it support things like importing photos and videos from a camera ?
Again , I presume so .
But then what gets stored locally and what gets stored remotely , on Google - managed servers in the quote - unquote “ cloud ” ?
Something would have to be stored locally , because uploading video ( and even just full - size photos ) over the Internet can be slow and expensive .
The Driver Issue
Microsoft has to deal with a veritable mountain of device drivers because Windows has to run on every “ Windows PC ” .
But Microsoft made this problem for themselves .
It is Microsoft that decided Windows would run everywhere on everything .
No one says Chrome OS is going to run on all , or even most PCs .
I would n’t be surprised if it ’s only supported for use on new PCs that are specifically certified to work with it .
Hence the hardware partner list in the otherwise almost information - less “ Chrome OS FAQ ” Google posted tonight .
Chrome Will Not Be a ‘ Linux Distribution ’
Renai LeMay ’s “ No Thanks Google , We ’ve Got Ubuntu ” captures another common reaction to Chrome :
In this context , Google ’s decision to create its own Linux distribution and splinter the Linux community decisively once again can only be seen as foolhardy and self - obsessive .
Instead of treading its own path , Google should have sought to leverage the stellar work already carried out by Mark Shuttleworth and his band of merry coders and tied its horse to the Ubuntu cart .
“ Linux ” means different things to different people .
At a precise technical level , Linux is not an operating system .
It is a kernel that can serve as the core for an operating system .
What most people mean by “ Linux ” , though , is an operating system built around the Linux kernel .
For use as a desktop PC operating system , all the various “ Linux distributions ” are basically the same thing : variations of Gnome or KDE sitting atop the ancient X Window System .
Ubuntu is almost certainly the pinnacle of these distributions , but they ’re all conceptually the same thing , and the only significant difference is the choice between Gnome and KDE , and even there you ’re just choosing between two different environments that are conceptually modeled after Microsoft Windows .
The entire X Windows / Gnome / KDE “ desktop Linux ” racket has never caught any traction with real people .
Almost no one wanted it , wants it , or will want it .
My theory on this is rather simple .
Early versions of Gnome and KDE were pretty much just clones of the Microsoft Windows UI .
They ’ve diverged since then , and I ’d say Ubuntu ’s default Gnome desktop is in most ways better from a design and usability standpoint than Windows Vista .
But it ’s still fundamentally a clone of Windows — menu bars within the window , minimize / maximize / close buttons at the top right of the window , the ugly single - character underlines in menu and button names .
At a glance it looks like Windows with a different theme .
The idea being that if you want Windows users to switch to Gnome or KDE , you ’ve got to make it feel familiar .
But that ’s not how you get people to switch to a new product .
People wo n’t switch to something that ’s just a little bit better than what they ’re used to .
People switch when they see something that is way better , holy shit better , wow , this is like ten times better .

So I think Gnome and KDE are stuck with a problem similar to the uncanny valley .
By establishing a conceptual framework that mimicks Windows , they can never really be that much different than Windows , and if they ’re not that much different , they can never be that much better .
If you want to make something a lot better , you ’ve got to make something a lot different .
Whatever Chrome OS turns out to be , it is n’t going to be that kind of “ Linux ” .
They ’re using the Linux kernel , yes , but they ’re building something new and original on top of that .
Linux is to Chrome OS what BSD is to Apple ’s iPhone OS — which is to say something that users will never see , smell , or notice .
Everything from TiVo to Palm ’s WebOS uses Linux as the kernel for its operating system — using the commodity underlying operating system ( in the comp - sci sense of the term ) and ignoring the commodity user interface systems .
Here ’s the telling line from Google ’s announcement :
The software architecture is simple — Google Chrome running within a new windowing system on top of a Linux kernel .
From a user - level perspective , Chrome is n’t going to look , act , or work anything like Windows .
And that ’s why Google has a chance to make something that might actually prove popular in a way that Ubuntu has n’t .
An Odd Name
I ’m sure what I ’m about to suggest is anathema to Google employees , but in addition to the sky high vapor - to - bits ratio , there ’s another aspect of the Chrome OS announcement that reminds me of Microsoft : the name .
In the same way that Microsoft has used “ Windows ” to describe very different things — both a computer operating system and an online suite of web apps —
Google is now using “ Chrome ” to describe two very different things .
A web browser is very different from an OS , even if the OS only runs the browser .
Google themselves recently conducted a survey that suggests that most regular people do not understand at all what a “ web browser ” is .
If regular people are confused about what a browser is , it ’s a good bet they ’re even more confused about what an “ OS ” is .
Calling them both “ Chrome ” is n’t going to help clarify the matter .
Install Chrome the browser on your PC and if you do n’t like it , you can delete it and you ’re right back where you were .
Install Chrome the OS on your PC and if you do n’t like it , you can delete it and you have a blank hard drive .
I ’m not predicting that people will mistakenly install one when they meant to install the other ; I ’m just saying that significantly different things should have significantly different names .
Client - Services , Not Client - Server
There have been numerous client - server systems throughout the history of the computer industry .
Some popular ; some not .
The basic idea behind all of them is that you have many cheap client machines that users actually sit in front of , connected to a few expensive server machines that do most of the actual computing .
The complexity is almost entirely on the server side , managed , presumably , by professional experts .
A single client machine , unconnected to the network , is pretty much useless .
Chrome OS is in many ways a return to that model .
Web apps largely consist of server - side code , with a relatively thin layer of JavaScript that runs on the client .
Data , too , mostly resides on the network , not the client machine .
But there ’s a big difference .
The Chrome OS model is n’t about thin clients connecting to a server .
It ’s about thin clients connecting to many and any servers .
One of the few sure things about Chrome OS is that it ’s going to work well with Google ’s own web apps , but the web is open , and Google is a strong proponent of open web standards .
Everyone will have the opportunity to write web apps that run just as well in Chrome OS as Google ’s own .
At an abstract level , there is much appeal to this concept .
With all of your data and all of the software you use online , you have nothing to back up .
Nothing to migrate when you buy a new computer — just log in from a different Chrome OS machine and there ’s all your stuff .
But at a practical level , how well will this actually work ?
Is it feasible to use Chrome OS as your sole computer ?
If not , how big is the market for “ secondary ” computers , especially as ( a ) more and more people buy laptops to serve as their primary machines , and ( b ) more and more people buy iPhones and Pres and Android - based mobile phones ?
I say : not very big .
In short , will Chrome OS pass the dog food test : is it something Google ’s own engineers will want to use ?
I ’m skeptical about the prospects of any new system or product that is n’t intended for use by the people creating it .
Gmail , for example , is the best web mail system because it was designed to be used not just by “ typical ” users but by expert users , including the engineers at Google who made it .
The iPhone is simple enough to appeal to almost anyone , but guess which phone the people who created it use ?
Make something intended not for your own use , but for use by dummies , and you ’ll usually wind up creating something dumb .
The future of computing probably is in the direction of thin clients connecting to network services for storage and software , but my hunch is that Chrome OS is too thin .

Comments and suggestions to : , who is really Bob Fisher .
© 2005 Robert Fisher
I knock on the locked door of the nondescript one - story building not far from downtown , willing away my anxiety .
" Can I help you ? "
A security guard peers from behind the door , eyeing me suspiciously .
He 's an older guy , probably somebody 's grandpa , but he gives me a look that says he does n't have a problem tangling with a whippersnapper like me .
" I have an appointment , " I stammer .
I have Xeroxed medical records and $ 200 in cash to prove it .
At that , the security guard is all smiles .
" Come on in , " he offers , opening the door wide and beckoning me into one of Denver 's most successful medical marijuana dispensaries .
I 'm here to become a state - certified medical marijuana patient .
If I succeed , I 'll have access to one of the fastest - growing — and unusual — businesses around .
Colorado voters legalized marijuana for medicinal use in 2000 with the passage of Amendment 20 , but until recently , the state 's medical marijuana community was small and fairly inconspicuous .
As of January , 5,000 people had applied to the state registry , and there were less than two dozen dispensaries selling pot .
But that 's changed , thanks to the Obama administration 's move in March to end most dispensary raids , as well as a Colorado Board of Health decision in July that did nothing to limit the number of patients that medical marijuana dispensaries can have .
As of June 30 , the Colorado medical marijuana registry had swelled to more than 10,000 applicants , with the state receiving more than 400 new applications each day .
To meet that demand , at least seventy Colorado dispensaries have opened , forty in the metro area alone .
Many of these are operated by what insiders are calling a " second wave " of ganjapreneurs — savvy , experienced businesspeople and professionals .
Some honed their chops running ventures that have nothing to do with marijuana ; others are opportunists from the heady California dispensary scene who see a new market ripe for investment .
In the meantime , legal consultants , insurance companies and real - estate brokers are carving out their own niche , building industry - wide infrastructure for a form of commerce that never before existed .
Whether any of it is truly legal — and whether any of it will last — is anybody 's guess , because marijuana , after all , is still illegal under federal law .
And although Amendment 20 allows people in Colorado to use pot for medical reasons , the law says nothing about dispensaries or whether buying and selling marijuana at them is legal .
( " Growth Industry , " February 5 . )
" I saw it coming , " says Colorado Attorney General John Suthers about the growth of the dispensary industry , of which he disapproves .
" Even when we looked at the amendment in 2000 , it was very purposely designed , in my opinion , by the advocates so it was so broad you could drive a truck through it . "
Cities and towns are n't waiting for Suthers and his colleagues to sort the laws out .
To deal with the reality of a business model that is n't going away , one municipality after another is looking into their zoning or planning codes , and some have passed dispensary - specific rules , like where they can be located and what type of signage is allowed .
I 'm not waiting , either .
Past the security guard , I can see a brightly lit , professional - looking operation .
People shuttle paperwork to and fro , chatting and laughing .
It 's a far cry from a drug - dealing operation — though a familiar smell lingers in the air .
No time for second thoughts : I 'm already late for my appointment .
I step inside , ready to get medicated .
For Craig Mardick , it 's a great day for a grand opening .
The windows of his new business , Golden Alternative Care , are freshly polished , and a spread of complimentary fruit , veggies and dip greets customers just inside the door .
Mardick 's landlord and insurance agent stop by to congratulate him and his employees .
His mom pops in , too , with a freshly framed art poster to hang on the wall .
Mardick has just launched Golden 's first marijuana dispensary , and behind a discreet curtain , a glass display case offers marijuana strains with names like Bubble Berry , AK - 47 and Pot of Gold , plus an assortment of cannabis - infused edibles .
" I have never seen an economic model like this , " he says of his new undertaking .
" It 's unheard of .
Economists do n't know how to forecast the industry . "
A former medical technician and environmental scientist by trade , Mardick had been laid off from a couple of jobs in the past few years when he got the idea to open a dispensary .
A medical marijuana patient himself — he 's been diagnosed with a large hiatal hernia , a serious gastrointestinal ailment — he'd been using his botany background to grow medicine for a half - dozen patients .
In February of this year , the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment , which oversees the state medical marijuana registry , revealed that it was considering limiting marijuana caregivers to providing for a maximum of five patients — a move that would have put dispensaries out of business , since they need more than five customers to survive .
But at a heavily attended hearing on July 20 , the Colorado Board of Health , the advisory board for CDPHE , voted against the proposed limitation .
The decision was seen as a tacit endorsement of the dispensary model , and state registrar Ron Hyman says the state has received 6,000 medical marijuana patient applications since then .
Mardick wanted in on the action .
He figured that if twenty people purchased a quarter - ounce of medicine from him each week , he'd net nearly $ 6,500 a month .
So with an investment of $ 15,000 — some of which he got from his father , because banks are reluctant to offer loans for such enterprises — he went into business .
He began by calling the Golden police chief , who told him that while he did n't believe in marijuana use , he 'd support the dispensary as long as it stayed within Colorado law .
Mardick also talked with the city zoning department , which , after a week of deliberation — the staff had never considered a marijuana operation before — decided that Golden Alternative Care would be allowed to open in the city 's central business zone .
It took time to find an amenable landlord ; many property owners refused to work with what they called a " drug dealer . "
Mardick had to get a sales tax number , obtain a federal Employer Identification Number and register his company with the secretary of state as a limited - liability company .
While he currently grows much of his medicine himself , he contracts with three Colorado growers who can each provide him within 24 hours with a quarter - to a half - pound of weed — just in case business booms .
And boom it might , considering the success of Mardick 's predecessors .
In June , for example , Bob Carleton took a break from dabbling in mergers and acquisitions as the co-founder of Denver - based international strategic consulting firm Vector Group , to open Herbal Connections at 2209 West 32nd Avenue .
Now he has upwards of 600 customers and some competition :
At least two other dispensaries have opened in the neighborhood .
Because every aspect of the business , by law , has to stay within Colorado 's boundaries , the dispensary industry is essentially a statewide financial Petri dish — one that Carleton believes could grow to exorbitant dimensions .
" You have this soon - to - be - half - billion - dollar industry with no infrastructure , and those do n't exist , " he says .
While the open nature of the industry is enticing , it also poses challenges .
For instance , how do you get a loan for a copier or obtain a company credit card when national banks fear violating federal law if they work with dispensaries ?
How do you create dosage levels and quality standards for , say , a THC - infused trail bar when there are no health or medical regulations ?
How can dispensary owners work together without being guilty of racketeering as defined under the federal RICO act ?
It reminds Carleton of other places he 's worked that had big regulatory gaps — places like Macedonia , Russia and Azerbaijan .
" I spent a lot of time working in developing countries , " says Carleton .
" It made it more intriguing thinking there is something like this in the United States . "
It 's intriguing to a lot of people .
Scott Durrah and Wanda James , the couple behind Eight Rivers restaurant in LoDo , are teaming up with Noah Westby , owner of DaGabi Cucina and Sole Coffee Roasters in Boulder , to open a Denver dispensary called the Apothecary of Colorado .
" The decriminalization of pot makes sense to us as a civil - rights issue , a medical issue and a legal issue , " says James .
" That 's why we 're looking into opening a dispensary .
I think medical marijuana is the first step , and I think legalization or decriminalization could be the next step . "
The trio is aiming for an up - market , professional atmosphere .
" We are very proud of what has been done with the marijuana movement and the people who are involved , and we just want to create that second piece , " says James .
" It 's the second generation of dispensaries , and we really want the 45 - year - old professional to feel comfortable coming in . "
They plan to model their business after Harborside Health Center , an Oakland , California , operation that , with its natural - wood decor , electronic checkout counters and on - site Buddha garden , is the Neiman Marcus of dispensaries .
They wo n't be the only ones taking that approach ; Harborside itself is coming to town .
On a recent afternoon , a well - dressed Californian named Don Dunkan stops by a vacant storefront downtown near the busy intersection of 22nd and Lawrence streets .
" It 's an empty canvas , " he says of the 2,200 - square - foot space — one that will be transformed into a swanky new breed of dispensary that will go by the name Local Product .
Dunkan is a partner in Harborside Management Consultants , an offshoot of Harborside Health Center that 's branded itself the " A - Team of medical cannabis . "
The consulting group plans to help others launch Harborside - quality dispensaries around the country .
Of the thirteen states besides California that allow medical marijuana use , the first place they decided to do so was in Colorado .
" We have been looking at Colorado for several years now , watching the scene , " says Dunkan .
" I would say right now in the state of Colorado , there is a vacuum that needs to be filled .
It 's an exciting place to be . "
Amendment 20 authorized people with cancer , glaucoma , HIV , AIDS , muscle spasms , severe nausea and other serious medical conditions to use marijuana .
To get on Colorado 's confidential medical marijuana registry and obtain a certified medical marijuana card , a patient needs a doctor 's recommendation for the program .
But the state health department has highlighted a suspicious trend :
More and more young men are getting authorized by doctors to be on the state marijuana registry , the vast majority suffering from the vague ailment of " severe pain . "
The implication , it seems , is that lots of stoners are finding a way to smoke pot legally .
It turns out I 'm one of those young men with severe pain .
I 've been seeing a chiropractor for much of the past year for muscle spasms in my back , and I can say without a doubt that I 'm not pretending to spend nights writhing in pain or walking around like Quasimodo just to score some reefer .
On the other hand , I 'm a much less appropriate candidate than someone battling cancer or suffering from muscular dystrophy .
But that 's not for me to decide .
That 's why I start calling around to find out about scoring a medical marijuana card .
I begin with the marijuana - focused doctor referral services .
These operations have sprung up on the premise that many patients ' primary caregivers are reluctant to consider pot as medicine .
My first call is to the relatively long - established THC Foundation , a three - year - old Wheat Ridge operation that 's part of a multi- state non-profit chain .
My medical condition could warrant medical marijuana , says a THC Foundation representative — though she adds that they 're not about to provide me one with just my records from the chiropractor .
" A chiropractor is not technically an M.D. , " she says .
" We really need something from your physician . "
So I ring up the THC Foundation 's main competition : CannaMed in Denver .
I 'm a bit surprised to find out the place is still operating .
A week earlier , FBI agents had raided the operation — not because of the pot , but because they suspected it was associated with an $ 80 million nationwide fraud scheme .
The feds did confiscate CannaMed 's patient records , but attorney Charlie Crosse says no one at CannaMed was arrested or charged with crimes .
" I am informed by the FBI that CannaMed is not a part of its case , " he says .
It turns out CannaMed was quickly up and running again .
" Sure , we take chiropractic records , " the CannaMed representative tells me on the phone .
It 'll set me back $ 200 for the CannaMed doctor 's visit , plus a $ 90 registration fee to the state , he says — or he can offer me a special deal for $ 50 .
" $ 50 ? " I ask , incredulous .
The catch is that I have to let CannaMed choose my caregiver , the person who can grow up to six marijuana plants on my behalf , for one year .
And during that time , I can't grow medicine myself .
" Can I switch my caregiver before then ? " I ask .
" If you pay us $ 290 , " he replies .
I 'd heard about this process .
Amendment 20 allows each medical marijuana patient to possess up to two ounces of marijuana or six marijuana plants at a time .
Since these patients can alternatively assign these " pot rights " to a designated caregiver , the patients themselves have become a sort of key commodity in the blossoming industry .
Dispensaries and marijuana growers are trying to become the designated caregivers for as many patients as possible so they can increase the number of plants they 're allowed to grow .
Some dispensaries are offering incentives to those who will sign over their caregivership .
CannaMed , I 'd been told , was offering this $ 50 " low - income " option because marijuana cultivators are sponsoring these patients in exchange for obtaining their pot rights — though there 's little guarantee that these growers were acting in a true caregiver role for these patients .
CannaMed referred all questions to its lawyer , Crosse , who says he does n't get into operational issues .
" I do n't understand about the two price structures , and I am not informed , so I can't comment on that issue , " he says .
As attractive as CannaMed 's price tag sounds , I decide it 's not worth signing away my pot rights .
So instead I turn to the back pages of Westword , which has become a major marketing venue for medical marijuana businesses .
Many dispensaries listed there advertise on - site doctors , though it 's a risky move .
Amendment 20 instituted a referral - based state registry so that doctors would n't be prescribing or helping patients obtain marijuana , since that practice could put them at risk of losing the Drug Enforcement Administration - issued license that lets them prescribe narcotics .
" It is my belief that having a doctor in a medical marijuana dispensary is too close to helping a patient get marijuana , " says Brian Vicente , executive director of the drug- policy reform organization Sensible Colorado , who consults with several dispensaries .
" I think they are at risk of losing their license . "
Putting legal questions about these in - house doctors aside , I choose the operation with the biggest ad .
The person who answers the phone explains that the dispensary works with a couple different doctors .
Some wo n't take chiropractic records , although the one who comes in on Wednesdays does — for a $ 110 fee , plus $ 90 to the state .
I make an appointment for the following Wednesday .
Kevin , a marijuana cultivator , is proud of his $ 10,000 indoor state - of - the - art weed - growing operation , what with its hydro - organic flood tables attached to automated pumping systems and high - pressure sodium lights and perfectly calibrated carbon dioxide regulators .
Just do n't expect him to show it to you .
His growhouse , somewhere in southern Colorado , is protected by a security guard and movement sensors in the driveway ; cameras beam footage to an off - site server .
Since he 's moving his operation — something he does every six months or so — he 's not inclined to give a tour .
Kevin , who did n't want to use his last name , may be amenable to visitors at that time , but only if they wear a blindfold and a pillowcase over their heads on the way there .
" I try not to be too paranoid , but truth of the matter is , under federal law it is not a hundred percent legal , " says Kevin .
The risk is worth it , however , since Kevin 's services have been in high demand lately .
With the number of marijuana patients swelling , the need for medicine has outpaced the supply .
Some dispensaries have instituted limits on how much medicine its customers can buy so they can ration their stock .
Kevin is a caregiver for about twenty patients , which allows him to cultivate up to 120 plants on their behalf — though he 's careful never to cultivate more than 99 at a time — the amount that would trigger a five - year mandatory minimum drug sentence if federal authorities ever come knocking .
Kevin gives each of his patients an ounce of free medicine a month ; he sells the rest , roughly a pound a month , to half a dozen dispensaries in Denver and Colorado Springs for $ 250 an ounce .
The dispensaries typically turn it around for nearly double that , he says .
Prices for marijuana vary widely , depending on the quality , the grower and the dispensary .
As an example , however , a patient could typically buy a quarter ounce for $ 100 to $ 150 ( on the high side ) .
There are around 28 grams in an ounce , so if a person put half a gram in each joint and smoked one joint per day , that pot would last for two to three weeks .
At that rate , a month 's worth of medicine would cost $ 200 to $ 300 .
The industry has also spurred a wide range of pot-related support services and products .
Lakewood commercial insurance agent Edward Leonard , for instance , helped a Boulder dispensary obtain a policy last October , and has since become the go - to guy for dispensary insurance , having worked with 23 operations .
" There are lots of insurance agents in Denver that would like to have this business , " says Leonard , since he's one of the few who 's been able to find an insurance company ( which he would n't reveal ) willing to write a policy that covers general liability and personal property at a dispensary , plus limited coverage for product for sale .
Then there 's Naresh Chandranatha , whose website , MMJLine , and call - in phone number , catalogues the ever - increasing number of Colorado dispensaries .
" We are essentially a 411 for dispensaries , " says Chandranatha , who gets a few hundred calls a day for information .
Dispensaries are listed for free , but some pay for advertising .
Those who want to grow their own meds might want to seek out the expertise of " Hans , " a legendary marijuana cultivator known for helping develop the " sea of green " mass - production technique .
Hans recently relocated to Colorado from Tucson , and he 's teaching growing classes at a downtown dispensary , the Peace in Medicine Center .
Hans recently shot footage in town for his popular " Cooking with Marijuana " DVD series — quite fitting , since he filmed the first movies here a decade ago .
" The atmosphere in Denver ten years ago when we made the videos was such that we had to hide the house we were working in , we all wore masks , and we swore the cameramen to secrecy , " he says .
" Now we did it in an open , public forum at Owsley 's Golden Road .
We smoked right on stage , and the patients who were there with their cards were able to share in the food . "
In Crestone , two businessmen just opened the High Valley Healing Center , the state 's first medical cannabis retreat , and in Longmont , Mitchell Shenassa has been singing the praises of the Incredibowl .
" We are putting people on the moon , and pipes have n't changed in 300 years , " he explains .
" For soccer moms and business executives who were smoking joints in high school , we wanted to step it up to the next level . "
Shenassa and his business partners spent the past three years developing three - dimensional models and working with engineers they located through Craigslist ads .
The result was the Apollo 11 of weed pipes — featuring a polycarbonate expansion chamber and a smoke - injection nozzle — which now retails primarily at Colorado dispensaries for $ 200 , or half that for registered patients .
" The dispensaries are a new market , " Shenassa says .
Waiting in the dispensary for my appointment with the on - site physician is every bit as tedious and mind - numbing as a trip to a run -of - the - mill doctor 's office .
As soon as I 'm inside the dispensary , the security guard shows me to a waiting room where a table is stocked with clipboards full of forms to fill out .
Through a doorway , customers lounge on a cushy leather couch , watching the History Channel on a flat - screen TV while waiting for their turn to enter the pharmacy room in the back .
While the dispensary features a pool table , free fruit and munchies , complimentary chair massages and even a bar where people can ingest their medicine of choice by inhaling it through a vaporizer , all that 's off limits to me until I get certified .
To help speed up that process , well - dressed workers scurry all around me , Xeroxing driver 's licenses , collecting appointment fees , pointing out the on - site ATM , writing out $ 90 money orders to be sent to the state health department along with each application .
Between the chaos and the fact that my back is acting up , I 'm starting to feel like I could really use a hit .
I 'm not the only one waiting for the doctor .
One guy , who looks to be in his twenties , inquires about whether the physician can authorize him for more than two ounces of pot at a time , so he can keep enough product on hand to cook edibles with it .
An elderly woman sitting next to me nervously tells a staff member , " My family has been pushing me to do this for a while . "
She says she has n't touched the stuff in forty years .
A young man who looks to be her grandson watches over her shoulder .
My paperwork filled out , I 'm finally called to see the doctor .
I 'm led into a small office where an older man in shorts and a short - sleeved button - down shirt sits behind a desk .
The desk is empty save for a takeout menu for Cheba Hut , a restaurant franchise specializing in " toasted " ( wink , wink ) subs .
He immediately gets down to business .
" I know why you are here , but why are you here ? " he asks , and it takes me a moment to realize he wants to see my medical records .
I hand over my chiropractor 's notes and mumble nervously about my symptoms .
I feel like I 'm back in high school , taking a major test — one I might be cheating on .
The doctor reads over my records , then clears his throat .
" There 's only one problem , " he says .
My spirit drops ; it sounds like I 'm about to fail .
" I do n't know what to write down for your diagnosis , " he continues , gesturing to my state registry application .
I realize he can't find the chiropractor 's diagnosis on my medical records .
I point to the top of a page where my chief complaints are listed as muscle spasms and tortacollis , a painful neck and back condition .
" Oh , " he says , satisfied .
" I did n't look up that high .
" Tortacollis is n't bad , " he says .
" That 's serious . "
But it would be better , he adds , if I got some additional diagnoses , maybe have some X - rays done .
No rush , he adds .
Just think about it for next year , when you come in for a renewal .
And with a flash of his pen , he recommends me as a medical marijuana patient .
" Okay , " he says , concluding our five - minute appointment .
" You 're all set . "
Englewood 's city council faced an unusual conundrum at its August 17 meeting .
Two dispensaries had recently opened in the city , and more were on the way .
The news was a bit overwhelming to elected officials , who were considering an emergency ordinance that night that would impose a six - month moratorium on all new dispensaries .
" I need to get a better handle on why these things are coming along so fast , " councilmember Wayne Oakley told the room .
Rob Corry , a Denver - based legal consultant for several dispensaries , spoke up at the hearing to argue that the moratorium would be a mistake .
" It would be a bad idea for the City of Englewood to remove itself from this growing — no pun intended — industry in Colorado , " he said .
" The City of Englewood would be walking away from hundreds of thousands of dollars , potentially millions of dollars , in potential revenue . "
It was n't enough to appease the concerns of Englewood 's city council , however , which passed the moratorium .
Corry told councilmembers that , going forward , if they needed help developing regulations , he'd be happy to offer his services free of charge .
Englewood is not alone in its confusion .
Dozens of dispensaries have opened in the past months in places like Wheat Ridge , Federal Heights , Lakewood , Littleton and Highlands Ranch .
And while Aurora and Greenwood Village have laws preventing them from issuing business licenses to operations that violate federal law , other cities and towns have discovered that they have no rules about dispensaries whatsoever .
In the past month , Durango , Steamboat Springs , Craig , Basalt , Dillon , Breckenridge , Silverthorne , Frisco and Northglenn have all instituted temporary moratoriums on new dispensaries until they develop guidelines for them .
Some municipalities , like Aspen , have decided that dispensaries should be treated like pharmacies when it comes to zoning issues , while others see them as nuisance businesses like strip clubs that should be a certain distance from schools and public parks .
Denver and Boulder are n't currently considering any dispensary - specific policies .
Commerce City recently revised its city code to include rules for dispensaries ( it prohibits public advertisement and outdoor use of medical marijuana ) , but other communities are reluctant to follow suit , because there 's little legal precedent for anything other than requiring that they have a business license and pay sales tax .
To figure out how Wheat Ridge should proceed , city staff there borrowed recommendations from " Medical Education and Dispensary Safety , " a guide prepared by Colorado Springs - based Cannabis Therapeutics , one of the oldest and largest dispensaries around .
But city officials in Englewood and elsewhere might be wise to take Corry up on the offer of free advice .
He and two other Colorado lawyers — Brian Vicente at Sensible Colorado and Warren Edson , co-author of Amendment 20 — know more about the dispensary industry here than anybody , since they 've built it from the ground up .
Nearly every dispensary seems to keep at least one of these three legal gatekeepers on retainer , and they constantly rely on their opinions , not to mention their Rolodexes of marijuana - friendly landlords , realtors and doctors .
" Everything you do , you contact your attorney and you develop a procedure that you think is the best argument in court , " says Jill Leigh , co-owner of a dispensary called Boulder County Caregivers .
" You have three attorneys who essentially developed dispensary policy in the state . "
The legal trio did n't have a choice , says Vicente ; no one else was going to do it .
" The three of us have been guiding people to act in a proper and legal manner , " says Vicente .
" Warren , Rob and myself attend a handful of conferences a year and learn how to effectively mold this industry .
It 's fleshing out the law in favor of patient providers . "
The key for dispensaries and vendors , says Vicente , is to develop a web of patients and caregivers .
When a new dispensary opens , for example , its owner or employees have to be designated caregivers for enough patients to legally warrant all the pot they have at the operation .
These caregivers will have to take on more patients as business grows , and they need additional product .
If the dispensary contracts with outside growers to provide them with marijuana , some of its customers will likely have to designate these growers as their caregivers so the crops abide by state law .
Since there are no rules about dispensaries , however — in Amendment 20 or anywhere else — many patients have n't limited themselves to shopping only at the dispensary associated with their designated caregiver .
And many enterprises are operating under the premise that as soon as a patient walks in their door , that dispensary becomes his or her de facto primary caregiver for the duration of the visit .
That means that any patient can buy marijuana there without changing his or her designated caregiver .
Several questions remain about these arrangements .
Can caregivers really sell leftover pot they do n't provide to their patients to other caregivers and to other caregivers ' patients ?
Is it really permissible for patients to frequent any dispensary in town ?
What is legal and what is n't may eventually come down to a court battle , and that 's where the dispensary model could be tested .
" They 're juggling medical marijuana cards and ounces , " says Scott Carr , Colorado manager of the THC Foundation .
" If you are not the caregiver , you are not protected if you take money for the cannabis .
Everyone seems to be excited by the California model , but nobody seems to read the law . "
Ted Tow , executive director for the Colorado District Attorneys ' Council , agrees that dispensaries do n't hold up to legal scrutiny .
" Medical marijuana is legal , but nothing says by definition that dispensaries are , " he says .
" We did n't define them in the amendment .
We define everything else in the constitution .
If you pull out the blue - book description they put out about Amendment 20 , it specifically said it will not legalize the distribution of marijuana .
And that 's what dispensaries do . "
So far , law - enforcement agencies have largely left the dispensaries alone — possibly because Amendment 20 suggests that the authorities would have to continue cultivating any marijuana they seized from dispensaries or grow facilities until they obtained a conviction in court .
But this could change .
Attorney General Suthers suggests that the state Board of Medical Examiners should look into parts of the medical marijuana industry ; he adds that he may have his own office do so , too .
" We knew we would have these dispensaries and have thousands more patients than medicine would dictate .
You would have a lot of people claiming chronic pain without much specificity .
And the roles of medical marijuana would be pretty large . "
Dispensary owners and their legal advisors say they'd like to work with state officials to clear up vagaries in the law and develop reasonable regulations , but they say they do n't have much confidence that state officials are willing to work with them .
" There is a history of the state engaging in underhanded tactics in an attempt to destroy and weaken the medical marijuana law , " says Vicente .
As an example , he points to the fact that the health department first instituted the five - patient rule at a closed meeting in 2004 , a fact that led Chief Denver District Judge Larry Naves to suspend that limit in 2007 because it lacked public input .
Then , at the Board of Health hearing to consider re-instating that limit this past July , health officials said the average medical marijuana patient age had recently plummeted from 42 to 24 , insinuating that patients were abusing the system .
A week later , however , the health department noted there 'd been a numerical error and the actual average patient age was 41 .
Leigh at Boulder County Caregivers is playing it safe by requiring her customers to designate someone associated with the dispensary as their caregiver and refusing to host doctor referral services on site .
While her business is still growing by leaps and bounds — she 's planning to open two additional locations in the Boulder area — she does n't like having to second - guess every business decision she makes .
" I would like to see some legislation that clarifies the law , but I do n't see that happening , " she says .
" Now anything officials do to change it will end up in court .
If law enforcement and district attorneys do n't deal with it , we are going to stay in this gray area forever . "
A day after I become a state - certified medical marijuana patient , I discover my perfect cure .
It 's dispensed by the Candy Girls .
Eventually the state will send me an official medical marijuana ID , but in the meantime , a copy of my signed doctor recommendation works the same way .
So , after my appointment with the physician , I 'm offered a no-pressure visit to the pharmacy room , even though I did n't make anyone at the dispensary my designated caregiver .
But looking at the spread of glass jars filled with green , lumpy buds with names like Afwreck , Mendocino Madness and Green Crack , I pass .
The stuff seems too traditional , too much like old - fashioned dope smoking .
Now that I 'm official , I want something special .
I find what I 'm looking for the next day in a tidy , sunlit kitchen .
Here , three women are hard at work : rolling maraschino cherries in fondant and dipping them in Ghirardelli dark chocolate , slicing up cookie pans of coconut crunch bars into bit - sized hunks , assembling confectionary boxes jam - packed with professional - looking sweets .
All of it is made with cannabis - infused oils or butters .
The women , wearing matching aprons and pot-leaf bracelets , are Jennifer Hawkins , Jennifer Smith and Katie ( last name withheld ) , but they usually go by their company name , the Candy Girls .
For a while , they operated under the title Growers for God , since they believe the Tree of Life was a cannabis plant , but their customers kept calling them the Candy Girls , and the name stuck .
The undertaking began less than a year ago , when the women began making cannabis - infused candies for medical marijuana patients they knew who could n't afford to buy their own .
Soon dispensaries started seeking out their repertoire of chocolate truffles , lemon pies and mini-cheesecakes .
" People who will never , ever smoke pot will eat it , " says Hawkins .
" It 's a whole additional market of people . "
The candies go for about $ 4 each .
Now they bake up about 800 goodies a week for eight Colorado dispensaries , including a customer who drives in from Grand Junction and a Chinese restaurant in Colorado Springs that sells their medicated chocolate - dipped cherries .
They obtain raw cannabis from outside growers and make sure they 're covered under state law by having some of the customers at each of the dispensaries they contract with designate one of the Candy Girls as their caregiver .
To keep these relationships personal , the Candy Girls hold meet - and - greets with their patients , as recommended by their lawyer , Edson .
It was n't always like this , says Hawkins .
Diagnosed with a seizure disorder , she was one of the first hundred Coloradans to get a medical marijuana card .
To get it , she had to go to twenty different doctors before one was willing to help her .
And she visited some dispensaries so shady that she was glad she 'd brought her husband along .
Now , not only is their medicine of choice gaining acceptability , but it 's helping them support their families .
" From my position , we were all in a really difficult spot in life , " says Hawkins , who'd been laid off from her previous job .
" This became an opportunity , and everything has fallen into place . "
When the Candy Girls hear I 'm a new patient , they offer me a sample box of their signature specialties : chocolates , brownies and trail bars , several of which feature stickers that say " For medicinal use only . "
Enjoy it , they tell me , with one note of warning :
No matter how good they might taste , it 's best to sample one at a time .
I 've never been so excited to take my medicine .

President Obama on Monday extended by six months a task force charged with determining how terrorism suspects should be interrogated , held in custody or handed over to other countries , putting in jeopardy his promise to close the military detention facility at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , by January .
The move came on the same day the president pushed back the release of a congressionally mandated report on the nation ’s economic conditions , and the White House began to extend a self - imposed deadline for overhauling the nation ’s health care system .
Pushing back the deadline on how to handle 229 Gitmo detainees , among them five suspects in the Sept. 11 attacks , including accused mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , illustrates just how complicated it is to solve the campaign issue that Mr. Obama this month called “ one of the biggest challenges of my administration . ”
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , was blunt in his criticism over the delay .

“ Bipartisan majorities of both houses and the American people oppose closing Guantanamo without a plan , and several important questions remain unanswered .
But it became increasingly clear over time that the administration announced its intent to close the facility before it actually had a plan , ” he said .
Six months after Mr. Obama signed the closure order , fewer than 20 of about 245 inmates have been transferred out of the U.S. military base in Cuba .
The White House put a positive spin on the delay , although none of the “ senior administration officials ” who briefed reporters Monday night agreed to be named .
“ The goal in six months is to move through the considerations , file by file , of each of the detainees at Guantanamo , move them to disposition and close the facility , ” one official said .
The officials used that word “ goal ” several times , seeming to redefine the firm timetable set by the president to close the facility by Jan. 22 .
“ Well , that is our goal ; that ’s what we ’re working towards , is meeting the date set forth , ” one official said .
Senior officials said the administration is no closer to determining what to do with detainees that cannot be charged or released .
“ There , there may be a category of detainees who for a number of reasons ca n’t be prosecuted , but whom we believe that violate the laws of war and pose a threat to the United States .
And decisions with respect to any individual detainee with respect to that kind of longer - term detention [ have ] not been made at this point , ” one official said .
The Department of Justice sought to differentiate the review of detainees from the review of detainee policy .
“ The Detention Policy Task Force and the Special Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies are distinct from the interagency Guantanamo Review Task Force , ” Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd wrote in a press release , although he grew testy explaining exactly how detainee evaluation can proceed without having in place a detention policy .
A Department of Defense official , though , said the three task forces are not at all connected and are working on separate tracks .
But the official acknowledged that even so , “ the delay does n’t bode well . ”
Military lawyers at Guantanamo are prepared to go to trial with at least 66 terrorism suspects now held in extrajudicial detention on the U.S.
Navy base , but Mr. Obama ’s executive order two days after taking office has tied their hands , suspending all proceedings pending a detainee review that nearly seven months later is half - finished .
Proceedings last week for the five Sept. 11 suspects were mired in legalistic wrangling .
Still , the senior administration officials who briefed reporters pushed the blame back toward former President George W. Bush .
“ The status quo , incidentally , is not acceptable .
Seven years , three prosecutions , endless litigation — that ’s not what — that ’s not the swift and certain justice that [ Mr. Obama is ] interested in making sure that we have . ”
The detention facility was established after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States , and has drawn international criticism for holding prisoners indefinitely , many without charge .
Mr. Bush , like Mr. Obama , expressed his desire to close the facility , but both presidents have struggled with “ high - value detainees ” who can be neither charged nor released .
While the task force developing a new policy on terrorism detainees missed its Tuesday deadline for offering a full list of recommendations , it did issue an interim report that provided an overview of the options , including prosecution in U.S. civilian courts and by military commission or the transfer of suspects to other countries .
Congress , meanwhile , is mulling a set of new guidelines for military commissions , which has delayed court proceedings at Guantanamo .
Sen . John McCain , Arizona Republican , said the United States should move forward with the tribunals , but he also urges the closure of Guantanamo .
But none of the detainees will move to the United States : Congress has approved legislation that prevents them from being released in the U.S. through Sept. 30 , the end of the fiscal year .
In May , Congress demanded a detailed plan on closing Guantanamo before lawmakers would grant him the necessary funds to do it , and denied an Obama request for $ 80 million to do so .
Late Monday , with only a select group of reporters invited , the White House deployed senior administration officials to sell the new delay .
“ We are over halfway through reviewing the detainees that are at Guantanamo , ” an official said .
That still leaves more than 100 detainees .
More than 50 suspects have been cleared for transfer to other countries .
A senior administration official has said the Justice Department is considering prosecuting about 30 others in federal courts , and another 30 or so could face trial by military commissions .
A final group will be held indefinitely without charge , subject to occasional judicial review , the administration has said .

A stoat that was stuck the front grille of a BMW Z4 for a 30 - mile journey .
A motorist spotted it in the road in Colsterworth , Lincs .
He feared he had run it over but found it the next day peeping out of the front grille of the car

It was n’t until the end of our few days ’ drive together through the extraterrestrial landscape of northern Colorado that this distant cousin of mine started talking about aliens .
He was a bit older than my parents , and a Vietnam vet .
Along the way he had shown me the remains of an old family farm , the high Rocky Mountain passes , and the endless shrub brush ranches on the other side .
Then , back in the library of his home outside Denver , he showed me Zecharia Sitchin ’s The 12th Planet .
That summer , waiting for college classes to start again , I read Sitchin for myself and almost converted .
His beliefs could have consumed me entirely if the books were n’t dressed in such pulp sci- fi packaging .
A few footnotes , a respectable cover , or a university press publishers , and I might have been done in for good .
The idea goes like this :
If you read the Hebrew Bible closely alongside other ancient texts , it becomes clear that the gods they discuss are not really supernatural beings , but are instead extraterrestrials with advanced technology .
This means , of course , accepting that the Hebrew shem can be translated as “ rocket ship ” instead of “ name . ”
Or that the desolation laid on Sodom and Gomorrah was the work of an atom bomb .
These beings came to Earth , the thinking goes , genetically altered monkeys to create the human race , and revealed the secrets of civilization .
They built giant pyramids and ziggurats as way - stations for their interplanetary activities .
Like Olympians , they fought amongst themselves using humans as their proxies .
And , of course , they promised to return .
Whether you thought gods were fantasies of the foolish or transcendent truth , Sitchin turns your world upside down .
Compared to those views , his is clean and simple , free from metaphysics and murky psychology .
It assumes only things perfectly understandable to 20th - century folks — rockets , genetics , nukes , and UFOs — that are more suggestive of science than religion .
The ancients were n’t , after all , living amidst delusion or special grace .
They wrote down what they saw , but only today can we piece together what really happened .
The ancient astronaut idea has been appearing again in recent acts of fiction , reminding me of my summer with Sitchin .
This year ’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ( warning : plot spoiler ) ends with a flying saucer blasting off from the remains of a buried South American city .
Its crystal skull , too , is an ancient astronaut favorite .
Hints of the idea also appear in the current Battlestar Galactica remake , as in the original .
And a “ space god ” becomes a running joke in Bill Maher ’s film Religulous .
The 12th Planet was published in 1976 , but by then the way had already been made ready for it .
Jason Colavito , a skeptic who writes about the theory , has recently demonstrated the link between Sitchin and H.P. Lovecraft , a fantasist who wrote stories about a malevolent alien presence in ancient times .
Working between the world wars , Lovecraft got the idea from Charles Fort , a collector of things unexplained who dropped hints that “ we ’re property ” of beings from above , as well as from the buried continents and ancient sages promoted by Helena Blavatsky ’s Theosophical Society .
Himself a dour doubter , Lovecraft did n’t believe a word of it .
But among his admirers were a pair of Frenchmen , Louis Pawles and Jacques Bergier , who published his stories in their magazine , Planète .
In 1960 they wrote The Morning of the Magicians , a book that presents ancient astronauts as a real hypothesis :
The idea had gone from science fiction to something resembling science , and the line between the two stayed blurry .
Ancient astronauts exploded into the public eye in 1968 with Erich von Däniken ’s Chariots of the Gods .
Rod Serling , of Twilight Zone and Planet of the Apes fame , narrated a popular adaptation for American TV .
Von Däniken ’s method was the whirlwind archaeological tour : Stonehenge , the Nazca Lines of Peru , the Egyptian Pyramids , Easter Island ’s impossible heads , and so forth .
Noticing their similarities and their astronomical alignments he asks again and again , suggestively , “ Coincidence ? ”
Though mostly ignored by academic scientists and historians , von Däniken made ancient astronauts a transatlantic phenomenon .
Simultaneously , the idea was making its way into cult classics like the original Star Trek series and 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
The same year that Sitchin came on the scene , Robert Temple published The Sirius Mystery , exposing remarkable astronomical knowledge among the primitive Dogon tribe in Mali .
From the Dogon , he learns that the alien gods were amphibious creatures , the mermaids and mermen found in mythology the world over .
In a later edition , Temple reports that this research attracted the attention of the CIA and the KGB .
By then , the UFO frenzy that was born with the Cold War was already mature .
Roswell , Area 51 , and men in black had fixed their place in public consciousness .
The government wanted to be sure that if aliens were out there , we knew about them before the Russians did .
UFOs became stock characters in fiction , conspiracy theories , and New Age religion .
At the same time , another Frenchman , Claude Vorilhon , was calling himself Raël and starting a religious movement based on what he claimed alien visitors had told him .
The 12th Planet became woven into the Raëlian dogma , which took special pleasure in reinterpreting the Bible .
Like humanity ’s otherworldly makers , the Raëlians tinker with genetic engineering and have been vocal advocates of human cloning .
Ancient astronauts , the reality behind humanity ’s religious fantasies , became a religion of its own .
Some Christian observers preach that Raël ’s alien friends , and UFOs in general , are demonic operatives .
Provocatively , the Raëlian symbol shows a swastika inside a six - pointed star .
Ancient astronauts also took hold in imaginations less radical than the Raëlians ’ .
Whereas 19th - century spiritualists would channel Indian chiefs or African shamans , the metaphysically - minded began meeting pyramid - building aliens .
Lita Albuquerque , an artist who has created earthworks installations at the Giza pyramids and at the Earth ’s poles , speaks of our extraterrestrial origins as an inward quest rather than a task for archaeologists .
“ We are made of star stuff , ” she says .
“ I think it is embedded in our cells as a memory . ”
In a meditation workshop she once attended , Albuquerque was amazed to discover that fully 80 percent of participants saw visions of alien visitors and pyramids .
From Sitchin to von Däniken to Raël , people came to the ancient astronaut idea by independent paths .
But when they did , they entered a subculture .
No one figure could be held responsible .
For a time , at least , it was thoroughly in the air .
Since the 1970s , however , ancient astronauts have been relegated to the science fiction and spiritualism from whence they came .
The few remaining systematic attempts to argue for them only rehash talking points from that fertile decade .
“ The biggest reason for the decline of the ancient astronaut theory , ” thinks Jason Colavito , “ was the boring sameness of it . ”
Today ancient astronauts have the marks of a fad whose 15 minutes have come and gone .
Meanwhile , traditional religions have been marching back onto the world stage .
This “ desecularization of the world , ” as sociologists call it , brought about a new Religious Right in the United States and militant Islamists from London to Indonesia .
Explicitly religious perspectives became more and more welcome in postmodern academia , not to mention on the campaign trail .
Ancient astronauts thrived on the period of secularization that followed World War II .
Science and technology seemed to be eroding old beliefs , opening the door for new ones .
Mainline liberal churches were taking less and less of the Bible literally in order to make room for modernity — aliens become most plausible when gods fail to be .
Perhaps the earliest ancient astronaut tale was Edison ’s Conquest of Mars , penned by Garrett P. Serviss in 1898 as a sequel to H.G. Wells ’
War of the Worlds .
In tribute to Thomas Edison ’s Yankee ( and “ Aryan ” ) ingenuity , it exchanges Wellsian ambivalence for unabashed technology - worship .
Likewise , the Raëlians have made it their mission to emulate the technologies that aliens used to create humanity .
“ Everything , ” wrote Erich von Däniken , “ is only a question of technology . ”
Just as ancient astronauts replaced religion with technology , nuclear war replaced final judgment .
Nearly every major work on ancient astronauts is preoccupied with the apocalypse .
Since prophecies for the return of gods really mean the return of aliens , they warn us ( or reassure us ) , to be on the lookout .
Doris Lessing ’s Canopus in Argos novels tell of extraterrestrials manipulating human history from start to finish , and along the way they accidentally start World War III .
Zecharia Sitchin , in his recent End of Days , repeats the cryptic mantra : “ The First Things shall be the Last Things . ”
The alien meddling which created human civilization , that is , will soon come back to end it .
In the ’70s , talking about the end of the world could come quite naturally .
The Cold War was already a quarter century - long habit .
For any big idea to be worth its weight , it had to offer a way out of technological mass - murder .
Aliens were one , to be sure .
Concurrently , conservative Christianity offered others .
1970 saw the publication of Hal Lindsey ’s The Late Great Planet Earth , which brought biblical prophecy to bear on the Cold War .
Like Chariots of the Gods , it became a movie in 1979 , narrated by Orson Welles .
The decade also saw the zenith of Henry Morris ’s “ scientific creationism ” which , like ancient astronauts , called into question the science establishment ’s assumptions about human origins and destiny .
Back then , ancient astronauts were a force to contend with in the struggle for public attention .
Chariots of the Gods sold four million copies from 1968 to 1976 , to say nothing of those who saw the film and television versions .
Now , aside from its lingering subculture , the idea lives on only as a recyclable Hollywood plot device , a staple of the UFO mythology .
In contrast , Christian apocalypticism has shown its muscle with Tim LaHaye ’s popular Left Behind franchise , which updates Hal Lindsey for the 21st century .
Left Behind is fiction , but its end - times scenario is meant to be real .
And creationism , though it continues to be knocked down by the courts , has the hearts and minds of almost half of Americans , including a vice - presidential candidate .
Given today ’s geopolitics , this should come as no surprise .
The clash of civilizations — or rather , religions — has replaced the nuclear arms race .
Theology has become tangible again , and technology feels tamer .
People blow themselves up in gods ’ names and turn their decrees into legislation .
Gods are real enough not to need explaining away .
Meanwhile , old fears go forgotten .
Though hundreds of ICBMs remain just as locked and loaded as ever , the worst we seem capable of imagining is a terrorist ’s dirty bomb or a few specks of anthrax .
Maybe Tel Aviv and Tehran will be blown off the map , or even New York .
But the real end of the world — back to caveman - status at best , I mean — has drifted from public paranoia as quietly as a weather balloon .
Even global warming does n’t hold a candle to fiery clouds of death .
Fears of technological apocalypse have lost their urgency , and so have ancient astronauts .

Earlier today , IGN and its parent company were issued a cease and desist order from Harmony Gold , the co-copyright owner of the television series Robotech .
The letter claims that the use of certain trademarked figures from the Robotech / Macross universe are prohibited as a result of a prior settlement that dates back to 1996 .
While MechWarrior is n't part of the Robotech / Macross universe , the similarities between vehicles has been enough to cause legal issues and raise questions .
Apparently , some of those trademarked figures appear in the trailer used by Pirahna Games in its announcement of the MechWarrior reboot earlier this year , and a request has been made for that trailer to be pulled from IGN .
This development could put the future of MechWarrior in jeopardy .
A trademark dispute could derail the game 's development .
On the flip side , it could also simply result in specific characters , logos , or other trademarked material from being included in the final product .
IGN contacted Smith and Tinker , the company that currently holds the license to the MechWarrior franchise for word on this situation .
A spokesman for the company responded to our inquiry , stating , " We have no comment on the situation at this time . "
Smith and Tinker , along with Piranha Games , announced the reboot of the Mechwarrior franchise exclusively with IGN in July .
A former assistant principal at a Valley school has been moonlighting as an escort , two sources have told 12 News .
Annette Gray O'Leary , who served as an assistant principal at Kyrene Del Cielo Elementary School until June , is also believed to be Taya Taylor , an escort who advertises her services on her website , according to 12 News� sources .
Taya Taylor 's website advertises 0 per hour for a �girlfriend experience .�
According to court documents , O'Leary is the ex-wife of former Boston Red Sox left fielder Troy O'Leary .
The couple has two children , one with special needs .
Last year , Annette O'Leary went to court to request additional child support .
Kyrene del Cielo parents question why an educator would turn to the escort business .
" How could this not be found out before she got a job ?
It seems like there should have been some research , " asked Stacy Ambert .
Her two sons go to Kyrene Del Cielo .
She was shocked to hear of the allegations .
" If there 's a job on the side that 's fine , but if it 's something that compromises character , especially when the school is promoting how much character is important and character counts , then that 's an issue , " Ambert said .
Gray stepped down from her position at the end of the school year .
School staff said they had been told only that O'Leary had resigned .
A Kyrene District Spokesperson says she knew nothing about the allegations .
" I would n't personally have information about that , but certainly allegations do occur at various times , " said Kelly Alexander , a spokesperson for the Kyrene Elementary School District .
The superintendent issued this statement : " We hold our employees to the highest moral and ethical standards fully understanding the trust the community has placed in us for educating their children .
Any employee accused of violating district policies is dealt with in an aggressive , consistent and fair manner . "
Attempts to contact Ms. O'Leary were unsuccessful .
BANGKOK ( Reuters ) - Developing countries will need to spend as much as $ 100 billion annually for the next 40 years to adapt to more extreme and severe weather changes , according to a World Bank study issued on Wednesday .
The report said poorer countries would need to invest in large - scale infrastructure projects to cope with floods , drought , heatwaves and more frequent and intense rainfall if the Earth ’s temperature rose by 2 degrees Celsius by 2050 .
“ Faced with the prospect of huge additional infrastructure costs , as well as drought , disease and dramatic reductions in agricultural productivity , developing countries need to be prepared for the potential consequences of unchecked climate change , ” said Katherine Sierra , World Bank vice president for sustainable development .
Previous estimates of adaptation costs by other groups ranged from $ 9 billion to $ 104 billion , but the World Bank said the latest projection of costs are the most in - depth analysis to date of the impact of climate change .
The report gave a costs range of $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion based on two different scenarios , the first a drier world that would require less investment than wetter conditions , which would need measures such as building sea walls or deeper drainage canals .
HARDEST HIT
East Asia and the Pacific , home to some of the world ’s fastest - growing economies , would be the hardest hit financially , accounting for at least a quarter of total costs , mostly due to increased urbanization , especially in coastal areas , said Warren Evans , director of the Bank ’s environment department .
According to the study , the cost of adapting to a warmer world is on the same scale as the amount of aid developing countries currently receive .
Aid agencies say it is essential that aid money is not cut to fund climate change initiatives .
“ Any financing that comes in must be additional money , ” Oxfam ’s senior climate policy advisor , Antonio Hill , told Reuters .
“ If it ’s not , then it ’s just robbing Peter to pay Paul . ”
Conservation group WWF voiced concern that the World Bank ’s estimate was based on the assumption that the world would work together to restrict the temperature rise to two degrees .
“ The commitments from developed countries in the present negotiations do n’t come anywhere near this level of ambition , ” WWF said in a statement , referring to global climate change talks taking place in Bangkok .
“ This underlines the need for much stronger commitments on the table from developed countries , both in terms of emissions reductions and in terms of financing for climate action in developing countries . ” ( Editing by Martin Petty and Alex Richardson )
This Summer in HTML 5 – Episode 33
I hope you enjoyed your summer .
My oldest son started kindergarten today .
Let 's talk about HTML 5 .
When last we checked , HTML 5 was humming along towards Last Call in October .
Much has been made of this date ; I wo n't bore you with the details , except to say that HTML 5 is very close to entering the next phase of its existence .
Regular readers of this blog already know that parts of HTML 5 are already shipping in major browsers .
The recently - released Firefox 3.5 supports < audio > and < video > , offline web applications , the drag - and - drop API , and the < canvas > text API .
( Technically Firefox 3.0 supported the < canvas > text API too , properly cordoned off in its own vendor - specific functions because the API was not finalized at the time .
You can paper over the differences fairly easily . )
So what new and exciting stuff has been added to HTML 5 this summer ?
Microdata
At the table in the kitchen , there were three bowls of porridge .
Goldilocks was hungry .
She tasted the porridge from the first bowl .
" This porridge is too hot ! " she exclaimed .
So , she tasted the porridge from the second bowl .
" This porridge is too cold , " she said .
So , she tasted the last bowl of porridge .
" Ahhh , this porridge is just right , " she said happily and she ate it all up .

r3074 introduces the concept of microdata .
Microdata is designed to allow authors to include additional semantics in their pages for which there is no appropriate HTML element or attribute .
For example , HTML is not expressive enough to mark up a contact in an address book ( complete with individual fields for name , street address , email , and phone number ) or an event on a calendar ( complete with start date , end date , and location ) .
Instead of creating new elements and attributes for every possible vocabulary , you can use the microdata attributes to enhance existing elements .
There are a number of other technologies with goals similar to microdata , including microformats and RDFa .
As Ian Hickson explained in the message " Annotating structured data that HTML has no semantics for " that introduced microdata , microformats are fine for specific formats but are not flexible enough to be parseable by a generic parser , while RDFa relies on CURIEs and XML namespaces in a way that would require changes to HTML parsing algorithms to work interoperably between text / html and application / xhtml+xml .
( Forgive me if I did n't explain that very well .
There was a lot of yelling and very little explaining once it became clear that RDFa was not going to be included in HTML 5 , so I probably missed some of the nuances . )
Work is ongoing to create an RDFa - in - HTML specification .
ARIA
ARIA stands for " Accessible Rich Internet Applications . "
It is an emerging standard for making web applications more accessible to people using assistive technologies ( including , but not limited to , blind people who browse the web with the help of screenreaders ) .
The basic technique is for authors to define " roles " and " states " on individual elements to indicate what sort of control the element represents .
For example , HTML has no " treeview " control , but JavaScript libraries like Dojo let you include a treeview in your web - based application with a combination of generic HTML elements , a few images , and a whole lotta JavaScript .
ARIA gives you a way to say that the " treeview " HTML element ( which is probably just a < div > ) is acting as a treeview ( that 's its " role " ) .
Each item in the treeview can be in the " expanded " or " collapsed " state , and the state changes as the user interacts with the control .
Major browsers , including Microsoft Internet Explorer ( 8 ) and Firefox ( 2+ ) will notice the custom role on the element and announce to assistive technologies that this < div > element is acting as a treeview .
( In fact , Dojo already supports these roles and states , due to work funded by IBM . )
r3657 adds the section Annotations for assistive technology products to HTML 5 .
There are still a number of unanswered questions about how the custom semantics defined by ARIA interact with the native semantics defined by HTML 5 .
Everything Old is New Again
As regular readers of this blog already know , HTML 5 goes to great lengths to specify existing browser behavior , even to the point of " willfully violating " other specifications .
Vast stretches of the HTML 5 specification are devoted to elements , attributes , and scripting features that nobody likes but everyone is required to support .
To that end , r3502 defines the < listing > , < plaintext > , < acronym > , < xmp > , and < dir > elements ; r3133 and r3141 define the < marquee > element ; r3155 , r3403 , r3409 , and r3410 define document.all .
Other important changes include the location . reload ( ) method ( r3220 ) , the textarea .
textLength property ( r3177 ) , a new rollback ( ) method for synchronous SQL transactions r3210 ) , and the ability to upload multiple files at a time from a web form ( r3544 and r3545 ) .
Features Removed
" The food here is terrible ! " " I know , and such small portions ! " ( variously attributed )
Everyone complains that HTML 5 is too big , but nobody has any reasonable solution for making it smaller .
( Splitting it into multiple specifications to make it " smaller " is like cutting a pie into slices to give it fewer calories . )
However , based on implementor feedback , HTML 5 has shed a few pounds features this summer .
To wit :
r3555 removes the < datagrid > element and its associated APIs .
Originally envisioned as a two - dimensional editable " spreadsheet - lite , " it was never implemented in any browser .

r3342 removes any mention of what an optimal video codec would look like .
Contrary to popular belief , this revision does not remove the < video > element itself ; the < video > element is alive and well and implemented in Safari , Firefox , Google Chrome , and an experimental build of Opera .
However , it is true that there is no single video codec that is supported out - of - the - box by all browsers .
Firefox and Opera only support Ogg Theora , Google Chrome supports H.264 and Theora , and Safari supports whatever QuickTime supports ( which does n't include Ogg Theora unless you install a third - party plugin ) .

When web servers send you HTML , they are supposed to label it as such with the HTTP Content - Type header .
Each content type ( an HTML page , a JPEG image , an MPEG - 4 video ) has its own " MIME type . "
MIME types must be registered with the IANA .
r3552 adds the registration information for text / html , application / xhtml+xml , text / event - stream , text / cache - manifest , and application / microdata +json .
r3582 adds the registration information for text / ping .
Standards frequently include references to other standards .
References can be " normative " or " informative . "
To quote RFC 3967 ( a standard about creating standards ) , " a normative reference specifies a document that must be read to fully understand or implement the subject matter in the new [ standard ] , or whose contents are effectively part of the new [ standard ] , as its omission would leave the new [ standard ] incompletely specified .
An informative reference is not normative ; rather , it provides only additional background information . " r3580 adds a list of references to HTML 5 .

The talks are seen as a chance to shift relations between the two states US President Barack Obama has praised Russian PM Vladimir Putin at talks outside Moscow , saying there was an excellent chance to improve ties .
Mr Obama 's meeting with the man widely regarded as the most powerful in Russia is taking place on the second day of the American leader 's visit to Moscow .
Mr Obama praised Mr Putin for his " extraordinary work " as president and PM as the pair met for the first time .
Mr Putin said Mr Obama 's own role would be key in improving relations .
Afghan deal
The breakfast meeting was held at Mr Putin 's dacha outside the capital .
ANALYSIS Richard Galpin , Moscow
In unusually blunt comments last week , Mr Obama described Mr Putin as a man with a cold war mentality who still had one foot in the past .
It provoked the usual sharp response from Mr Putin 's office .
The fact that Mr Obama is meeting the prime minister - ostensibly to discuss economic issues - is a reflection of the power Mr Putin still holds .
Many believe he remains the most powerful politician in the country , making the vast majority of all the important decisions .
So if the US president really wants to ensure the relationship between Washington and Moscow is on the mend , he needs to include Mr Putin in his charm offensive .
The two men exchanged pleasantries before their talks , during which Mr Obama himself demonstrated the confusion over Mr Putin 's position in the Russian power structure .
" I am aware of not only the extraordinary work that you 've done on behalf of the Russian people in your previous role as prime minis- , uh , as president , but in your current role as prime minister . "
Mr Putin was made prime minister in 1999 under President Boris Yeltsin , before being elected president the following year .
After serving the maximum two terms , he reverted to prime minister in 2008 - though many suspect he still takes the key decisions .
Mr Putin told Mr Obama : " We link hopes for development of our relationship with your name . "
Last week , Mr Obama said he thought the former Russian president turned prime minister had " one foot in the old ways of doing business and one foot in the new " .
Mr Obama is later due to deliver a major speech on democracy , the global economy and the US - Russian relationship .
On Monday , after meeting Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , he signed eight separate agreements with Russia .
They included a pact to negotiate a new arms control treaty to replace the 1991 Start I pact which expires in December .

In pictures
A new agreement could see the two countries reducing their nuclear warheads by up to a third , to below 1,700 each within seven years of the treaty 's signing .
Separately , Russia also agreed to allow the US military to fly troops and weapons across its territory into Afghanistan , allowing it to avoid using supply routes through Pakistan that are attacked by militants .
However , on the contentious issue of US plans to base parts of a missile defence shield in Eastern Europe , the presidents merely said they had agreed to a joint study into ballistic missile threats and the creation of a data exchange centre .

* Judge grants permanent injunction in favor of i4i
* Bars Microsoft from selling 2003 , 2007 Word versions
* Microsoft says will appeal ( Adds detailed definition of XML )
BANGALORE , Aug 12 ( Reuters ) - A U.S. federal court 's ruling in a patent infringement case could threaten sales of Microsoft Corp 's MSFT .
O popular word processing application .
A Texas district court on Tuesday ruled in favor of Canadian software firm i4i Ltd and filed an injunction preventing Microsoft from selling the 2003 and 2007 versions of Word .
The patent relates to the use of XML , or extensible markup language , which is used to make documents such as corporate earnings reports and news articles machine - readable and easily publishable on multiple platforms .
Apart from Microsoft ’s Word , XML is used by other word processing applications such as OpenOffice .
The court also ruled that Microsoft would have to pay more than $ 290 million in damages to i4i , which makes software for manipulating documents , for infringing the patent .
Microsoft , which is involved in a number of legal battles over patents , said it plans to appeal the verdict .
“ If they ( Microsoft ) decide to appeal , we will certainly follow it carefully and we will continue down the path to ensure that the judgement is upheld , ” said i4i Chairman Loudon Owen .
Toronto - based i4i had claimed in a 2007 suit that Microsoft knowingly infringed one of its patents in its Word application and its Vista operating system .
“ The verdict stops Microsoft from selling Word 2003 or Word 2007 with our technology in it within 60 days .
So they have to either remove our technology or stop selling it , ” i4 i ’s Owen said .
The final judgment from the U.S. District Court followed a jury verdict issued in favor of i4i on May 20 . [ ID:nN20530462 ] .
“ We believe the evidence clearly demonstrated that we do not infringe and that the i4i patent is invalid , ” Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz said .
The case is i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc vs Microsoft Corp , U.S. District Court , Eastern District of Texas , Tyler Division , No. 6:07CV113 .

THE NHS is the closest thing the English have to a national religion , Nigel Lawson , a former Tory chancellor , once observed .
Seldom has that tart comment seemed more apposite than in recent days , as both Gordon Brown and David Cameron leapt to the defence of the NHS following vitriolic criticism in America of Britain 's “ Orwellian ” health service .
Some of the charges against it are absurd , but does the tax - financed NHS deserve such worship this side of the Atlantic ?
Comparing the performance of health systems is tricky .
For one thing , people may attach different values to crucial features such as coverage , choice , equity and the quality of clinical care .
For another , people 's health reflects influences like lifestyles that have little to do with medical care .
Cost must also be taken into account .
The World Health Organisation attempted an evaluation in 2000 , in which Britain came 18th out of 191 countries and America 37th , but the methods used to compile the ranking were heavily criticised and it has not repeated the exercise .
On the most basic metric of life expectancy at birth , Britain ( 79.1 years ) outscores America ( 77.8 ) .
Longevity is admittedly a crude and indirect indicator of population health .
Yet a similar story emerged from a study in 2006 that used direct measures to compare the health of middle - aged people : the Americans were sicker than the English .
Another line of inquiry is to investigate how health systems perform in tackling conditions that are treatable , comparing death - rates for such illnesses among the under - 75s .
Britain does not emerge well from one such ranking , compiled by Ellen Nolte and Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine .
Their study , published in early 2008 , placed Britain 16th among 19 advanced countries ( France came first ) .
But America came last .
On the other hand , Britain scores worse than America in five - year survival rates for cancer .
High - tech diagnostic equipment is less abundant : in 2007 there were , for example , 25.9 MRI scanners per million Americans compared with 8.2 in Britain .
Expensive new drugs generally become widely available sooner in America than in Britain .
One reason is that in Britain they are subject to a cost - benefit assessment .
Although this approach has been demonised in America it merely makes explicit the rationing in any medical system through the decisions of insurers and funders .
And then there 's the question of overall cost .
Even after a huge expansion of the NHS budget over the past decade , spending on health care in Britain amounted to 8.4 % of GDP in 2007 compared with 16 % in America , according to the OECD .
Public spending on health care per person is actually higher in America ( through Medicare , Medicaid and other government programmes ) .
Both health systems have their virtues and their faults .
At its best , America offers extraordinarily good clinical care , but too many people lack insurance cover or fret about losing it .
The NHS provides health care to all at a much lower total cost , but patients have less clout .
Both countries are crying out for reforms to bring about better and cheaper care .

Sam Ettaro of Republic Media invited me to visit Lancaster , PA , in the middle of rural Amish country and speak at an event he organized there to stop the camera surveillance program there .
I was glad to have a chance to give a speech on the 4th Amendment .
Although many privacy advocates today believe this issue to be a muddied one , courtesy of the Supreme Court , if you read the Constitution it is crystal clear .
However , since I had never been to Lancaster recently , I had no idea how widespread the camera system was .
This story has national implications as the city is a prototype site for possible roll - out to other towns and cities across the USA .
Lancaster is a small town of about 50,000 people .
They have the country 's oldest farmer 's market , and many of the buildings are pretty , historic colonial buildings .
As I drove through town , sure enough the cameras were looming above each intersection .
The march began at a baseball field with four cameras overlooking it , and proceeded through a residential area to Lancaster 's downtown with more homes , public buildings and many businesses .
Personally , I felt pretty creeped out and found myself scanning the skies for the next camera .
Can you imagine strangers with the ability to track your every move throughout a city ?
There is a total of 165 cameras spanning the city right now , costing over $ 3 million to build .
These cameras are pretty high - tech .
They swivel towards motion and zoom in , and are all networked .
Apparently there is masking technology so they are not able to zoom into private homes and businesses .
Ettaro and the Lancaster citizens there led by Renee Baumgartner related to me that Bosch began its relationship with the city by giving it free test cameras for use , but is now deriving revenue from the taxpayer , as well as the controversial private company , the Lancaster Community Safety Coalition , which monitors the video feed .
You can read more about them here in “ He 's Safety Czar , Not Big Brother . ”
An unelected ' Safety Czar , ' that is .
Ettaro and Baumgartner claim the this issue is like an onion , the more layers peeled the deeper down the rabbit hole the issue goes .
Besides the controversial evidence surrounded Bosch and the city related in this video , they also related their new findings that PENNDOT is continuing work on biometric REAL ID in Pennsylvania .
Apparently , they have all the contracts and proof and are in the middle of posting them for the public .
I look forward to reviewing these documents .
Below is the speech I gave .
My thoughts on the whole experience is that the cameras are clearly a violation of the Fourth Amendment and are therefore illegal .
However , I do believe that the local people there can give up their rights to privacy if they so choose , but I believe this to be a situation where even one resident or business owner on a street refuses to surrender their rights , the camera should not monitor the entire area .
From the LCSC website and from talking with the citizens present , it appears Lancaster instituted this program with no public vote and very little debate .
Public notification consisted of 15,000 postcards mailed after the camera system was already setup .
Judging from the car honking , cheering from the neighborhood 's windows , and a few chats I had with store owners , those being watched do not want these cameras .
In my opinion , the cameras MAY serve to deter it from the monitored areas , but likely will just displace the crime .
I have not seen reliable crime statistics from either the city of Lancaster or elsewhere to comment , but apparently there was a murder right in front of a camera several weeks ago .
Perhaps what citizens in the area need to do is not shuffle the responsibility for their safety to this really Orwellian all - seeing eye , but to take action themselves .
During our march , two officers on horseback and a few officers on bikes kept tabs on us .
It was somewhat ironic that the taxpayer was paying these officers to watch us peacefully protest the “ public safety ” system of cameras instead of having them patrol the areas .
Start of the speech :
“ I would like to start off by saying thanks to Sam for his invitation to speak .
The last 4 years of my life were spent in Shanghai , China as an expatriate engineer working in semiconductors .
In March I returned to my home in the Lehigh Valley to run for United States Congress because liberty is under attack .
I am running as an unaffiliated private citizen because 1 ) I hold the Republican and Democratic Parties accountable for the damage to our liberties and 2 ) my only real chance of winning and spreading the message is to appeal directly to all the people in my area , regardless of which party they are from .
Now before moving to China I will be quite honest with you and say I was completely politically apathetic .
So what happened to me while I was over there ?
[ Paraphrasing this paragraph as I did n't write up this part of the speech . ]
[ Shanghai is a city of 20 million people , but there are very few churches .
After arriving in China , I could n't speak the language very well , and wanted to attend a Christian service in english .
I found a place and during my first service ( and all of the following ones , the pastor stated that anyone who did not have a foreign passport ( the locals ) had to leave .
By doing this , the Chinese government tried their best to isolate the foreigners from the locals , whose service was in the mornings .
After several weeks , I noticed that directly above the two main entrances was a black bubble with a security camera .
Thereafter , I used to joke that if I ever wanted to know how many services I missed , I would have to ask the Chinese government .
However , having those cameras there started getting me thinking about my privacy – and how thankful I was to not have my churchgoing tracked in the United States .
Now , in China there are cameras in a lot of the public spaces in Shanghai , and the major intersections , but nothing like here in Lancaster !
The degree of monitoring here is far worse ! ]
Now in China 's case , the same reason is given by the government for the cameras as here in Lancaster – it's for “ public security ” – but it is no secret to the Chinese people that their government does not want them to form organized groups to cause economic or political unrest .
And the situation there is far better than from 1950 - 1980 .
Under Mao Tse - Tung , the Communists built a totalitarian state where everyone spied on everyone else .
Those who did not conform were forced to say public confessions for the smallest of violations and even for thought crimes .
Many were sent to work camps to die , and the family unit was all but destroyed .
Before the invention of surveillance cameras , in communist East Germany , about 1 in 100 people either volunteered or were compelled by their government to become an informer for the dreaded secret police , the Stasi .
They spied on their families , friends , customers , neighbors .
People were whisked away in the middle of the night to be taken to prison .
If we look at Stalin 's Soviet Union and its GULAG system , the evil KGB acted in the same manner .
Same in Pinochet 's Chile , the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia , etc .
As a matter of fact when many think of the evil of totalitarianism , secret spy networks is usually what comes to mind .
Yet with the misuse of modern technology provided by Bosch and other companies , what once took tens of thousands of informants can now be achieved by a few companies in cooperation with the government .
This surveillance is very un-American and let me explain why .
But first , it may be true that many do not feel scared by the encroachment of the police state .
Many probably view these cameras as mere nuisances because they have been tricked into believing that Big Brother is necessary and helpful for the public safety , and because many still enjoy a high level of material comfort .
But look where this government has led us !
The government 's actions are responsible for the current unemployment , a national debt now growing by trillions of dollars ever year , price inflation by the money - printing of the Federal Reserve , and the underpayments and imminent bankruptcy of our society 's safety nets – Social Security and Medicare – in the coming decade .
Now what makes our society different ?
Our natural rights to privacy from warrantless search and seizure is protected by the 4th Amendment of the US Constitution , which is still the supreme law of our land .
Let me read it to you :
“ The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . ”
Let me break that down a bit for you – what this means is that each person is protected against “ unreasonable searches ” unless there are “ warrants ” issued by a court for “ probable cause ” that specifically state what is to be search and seized .
Our constitution requires the government to have a warrant when it wishes to look into the private affairs of individuals .
The public must always be extremely wary when granting the government spying power over our private homes , places of business , churches or when we meet with friends or groups .
If I make an assumption that politicians from the city of Lancaster are saints – I mean everyone knows politicians are saints these days and would never use public funds for private jets , cheating on their wives , or embezzlement , right ?
–
Even if we make this assumption that they are saints and truly only concerned about the public safety , what is to prevent future politicians or employees of the private spy company from spying on opponents or using the system for personal gain ?
Or doctoring the video feed to portray a false crime ?
If we are to remain a free society we must defend our rights against any governmental attempt to undermine our individual rights or bypass the Constitution .
The possibility of uncovering personal wrongdoings never serves as justification for the government to spy on our every move .
And camera surveillance is only the start of the Police State !
Let me quickly list a few violations of our health , financial , and personal privacy .
These are all facts and can be checked at my website TowneForCongress.com tomorrow and I suggest you do so .
Never take anyone 's words for granted .
With the passing of the USA PATRIOT Act after 9/11 , any financial transaction over $ 10,000 is reported to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network , a sub - branch of the Treasury Department , as possible criminal or terrorist activity .
[ see Section 5331 of HR 3162 – auth . ]
Section 6050 of HR 3221 , passed in 2008 , authorizes the IRS to view every single credit card transaction made by every single individual in the United States without a warrant or informing the individual .
In 2008 , Republican President George Bush signed into law HR 6304 .
Title 8 , Section 801 of this bill gave private companies legal immunity to commit warrantless wiretapping on any phone or email communication from any American citizen .
As a result , everyone is a criminal suspect without probable cause or warrant issued by a court of law .
In February 2009 , Democrat President Barack Obama signed into law HR 1 , otherwise known as the Obama Stimulus Plan .
Sub Title A Section 3001 commits the federal government to keeping full electronic medical record of each individual by 2014 where it may be accessed from any government computer terminal of many federal departments , even including the FDIC which insures bank deposits .
Do you want your private health history information on a bad heart , psychological records , medication records viewable to any government bureaucrat ?
This is a massive violation of patient privacy !
[ Apparently this costs $ 20 billion per the Wall Street Journal and the Houston Chronicle .
– auth . ]
What we need these days is more government transparency , and revoke the violations of privacy I have mentioned above !
It should be obvious to each and every person here today that only a vigilant populace can demand this of their government .
These cameras must come down and one day they WILL be taken down .
It is only a question of which tools to use .
We here today peacefully request the government to do this with wrenches and screwdrivers .
But make no mistake , one day these cameras WILL be taken down .
If today 's generation of adults do not undertake the burden of taking these cameras down , I am confident that one day , perhaps far in the future , the children who grew up under these all - seeing eyes will tire of them .
And you know what tool they will use ?
Possibly guns if they still have them , or the sledgehammer .
And I wo n't blame them one bit .
As Thomas Paine once said , “ If there must be trouble , let it be in my day , that my child may have peace . ”

You need look no further than Mickey Mouse in the US , or Elvis in the UK , to understand how copyright , for better or worst , affects the marketplace .
But while Disney resorted to legal means to get more life out Mickey , those that oversee the Eiffel Tower came up with something far more clever .
The Eiffel Tower ’s likeness had long since been part of the public domain , when in 2003 , it was abruptly repossessed by the city of Paris .
That ’s the year that the SNTE , the company charged with maintaining the tower , adorned it with a distinctive lighting display , copyrighted the design , and in one feel swoop , reclaimed the nighttime image and likeness of the most popular monument on earth .
In short : they changed the actual likeness of the tower , and then copyrighted that .
As a result , it ’s no longer legal to publish current photographs of the Eiffel Tower at night without permission .
Technically , this applies even to amateurs .
When I spoke to the Director of Documentation for SNTE , Stéphane Dieu , via phone last week , he assured me that SNTE was n’t interested in prohibiting the publication of amateur photography on personal Web sites .
“ It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image , so that it is n’t used in ways we do n’t approve , ” said Mr. Dieu .
So while publishing nighttime photos of the Eiffel Tower may now be illegal , it is n’t all bad news for tourists ; SNTE profits go back to the city of Paris , making it , hopefully , and even nicer place to visit .
Switzerland has expanded its border at Italy 's expense because of melting glaciers in the high Alps .
The Swiss government today approved shifting the border up to 150 metres into Italian territory in some areas .
The changes were made after the Swiss Federal Office of Topography found that the watershed , which determined the border in 1942 , had moved because of melting glaciers and snow fields .
Topographer Daniel Gutknecht says Switzerland has become " a little bit " larger but added " we wo n't be correcting the atlas " .
The Italian embassy in Bern said the change had been approved by Rome .
Comic Relief German Campaign Gets Much - Needed Dose of Humor
Germany 's election campaign is being livened up by satirical pledges to rebuild the Berlin Wall , send pensioners to the east , provide free cosmetic surgery for everyone and install a rabbit as the national symbol .
Humor is urgently needed at this time of political torpor , comedians say .
The Pacific Northwest Key Council is dedicated to the creation and publication of field keys to the fungi of the Pacific Northwest .
It was initiated in 1974 by Kit Scates of Post Falls , Idaho , and developed with the support and supervision of Dr. Joseph Ammirati and the late Dr. Daniel Stuntz , both of the University of Washington .
The geographic area covered is southern British Columbia , Washington , Oregon , Idaho , and western Montana .
The Key Council develops , refines , and field tests keys to selected species and genera of mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest .
The mushroom characteristics in the keys are based on macroscopic features that can be seen by the naked eye or hand lens .
All keys are subject to peer review and editing before publication .
Key Council membership , which is by invitation , includes both professional mycologists and amateurs .
The identities of the mother of Baby P and her boyfriend , both of whom tortured and killed the 17 - month - old child , can finally be revealed today , more than two years after the toddler died .
Tracey Connelly , 28 , and Steven Barker , 33 , abused the child , who can now be known by his full name , Peter Connelly , over a period of eight months , causing him 60 separate injuries including a broken back and ribs .
He suffered all of these injuries despite the fact that he was on the child protection register at Haringey council .
He was found dead in his cot in Haringey , north London in August 2007 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The pair were convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child at the Old Bailey last November .
Jason Owen , 37 , was convicted of the same offence .
His identity has never been protected by legal restrictions , but he has always been referred to only as the pair 's lodger .
It can now be revealed that he is Barker 's older brother , and that Barker and Owen were charged with grievous bodily harm after an assault on their grandmother in 1995 .
She died of pneumonia in 1996 but the charge was dropped due to a lack of evidence .
They were never pursued for a more serious charge because there was no medical evidence to link the assault to her death .
Despite Connelly and Barker 's names and pictures appearing on the internet almost a year ago , a High Court order has prevented the press from identifying them .
That order expired at midnight last night .
It was made partly because of the need for their names to be kept secret to ensure they received a fair trial for a subsequent offence .
In April , Barker went on trial accused of the rape of a two - year - old girl .
Connelly was alongside him in the dock accused of child cruelty after it was alleged that she witnessed the rape but did nothing to stop it .
Barker was found guilty of rape and Connelly was acquitted .
But their second Old Bailey trial only went ahead after some extraordinary lengths had been taken to ensure that the jury would not be aware of their role in Peter Connelly 's death .
The judge imposed a complete reporting ban – forbidding the media to even refer to the existence of the second trial until its completion – and , in a legal first , agreed that they should be tried under false names – Barker becoming Steven Young and Connelly Tracey Wilson .
The ban on reporting their real names , pictures and addresses was , without exception , adhered to by all newspapers and broadcast media outlets .
But many websites openly flouted the law .
Since the day they were convicted last year , pictures and details of Connelly and Barker have been readily accessible on the internet .
At the beginning of the rape trial the prosecution barrister , Bernard Richmond QC , attempted to have the case thrown out , saying that the social networking site Facebook had made the prospect of a fair trial impossible .
He listed a number of Facebook " groups " that named Barker or Connelly and said they had close to one million members – meaning that there was a high risk that potential jurors would recognise the defendants .
At the end of that trial the reporting restrictions were eased slightly so that the case could be reported .
But the High Court order remained in place until last night .
There are still some details of the cases that will never be able to be revealed to the public .
Connelly , Barker and Owen were all sentenced in May this year .
Connelly was was given an indeterminate prison sentence and told she would be eligible for parole in just over three years .
Barker was jailed for 12 years for his part in Peter Connelly 's death and given a life sentence , to run concurrently , for the separate offence of raping a two - year - old girl .
He was told he must serve a minimum of 10 years and will be eligible for parole after eight .
Jason Owen was given an indeterminate sentence with a minimum of three years and could be out in two if he satisfies the parole board he is no longer a danger to the public .
Despite the relatively low minimum tariffs handed out it is unlikely that either Connelly or Barker will make parole at the first attempt .
And because of the life sentence given to Barker and the indeterminate sentences given to Connelly and Owen , it is possible that all three could spend the rest of their lives behind bars .
Grünen -Mitgründer wird Pirat Peter Muehlbauer
Für Herbert Rusche sind die Grundrechtsschützer heute das , was die Öko - Partei in den 1970er und 1980er Jahren war
Herbert Rusche , einer der Gründer der Grünen , gab gestern seinen bereits am Montag erfolgten Eintritt in die Piratenpartei bekannt .
Der geborene Pfälzer zog 1985 im Rotationsverfahren in den Bundestag ein und war dort der erste bekennend schwule Abgeordnete .
Vor acht Jahren trat der Buddhist wegen des von Joseph Fischer mit vorbereiteten Krieges gegen Jugoslawien bei den Grünen aus , die unter seiner Amtszeit als Landesgeschäftsführer aus dem Stand mit 8,6 Prozent der Wählerstimmen in den Hessischen Landtag eingezogen waren .
Seine damals gesammelten Erfahrungen begrüßte das Bundesvorstands - Mitglied Nicole Hornung als " unschätzbar wertvoll " .
Rusche habe " schon einmal dazu beigetragen , eine Gruppierung engagierter junger Menschen in Richtung einer regierungsfähigen Partei zu entwickeln , und wird uns [...] bei der Arbeit im politischen Alltag deshalb sehr helfen können . "
Der Siebenundfünfzigjährige selbst meinte , dass die Grundrechtsschützer heute das seien , was die Öko - Partei in den 1970er und 1980er Jahren war .
Die etablierten Parteien würden " völlig verkennen " , wie groß mittlerweile die Zahl der Menschen ist , für die Themen wie der Schutz der Privatsphäre " von höchster Bedeutung sind " .
" Im Netz " , so der Blogger , hätten " Bekanntheit und die Sympathie für die Piratenpartei in den letzten Wochen und Monaten sehr stark zugenommen . "
Als " nächsten Schritt " schlägt er deshalb vor " dass die Verwandten und Freunde , welche weniger mit der Technik der neuen Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten vertraut sind , mit Anrufen , Postkarten , Gesprächen bei einer Tasse Kaffee oder beim abendlichen Bier informiert werden . "
A concerted effort to start unprecedented talks between Taliban and British and American envoys was outlined yesterday in a significant change in tactics designed to bring about a breakthrough in the attritional , eight - year conflict in Afghanistan .
Senior ministers and commanders on the ground believe they have created the right conditions to open up a dialogue with " second - tier " local leaders now the Taliban have been forced back in a swath of Helmand province .
They are hoping that Britain 's continuing military presence in Helmand , strengthened by the arrival of thousands of US troops , will encourage Taliban commanders to end the insurgency .
There is even talk in London and Washington of a military " exit strategy " .
Speaking at the end of the five - week Operation Panther 's Claw in which hundreds of British troops were reported to have cleared insurgents from a vital region of Helmand province , Lieutenant - General Simon Mayall , deputy chief of defence staff , said : " It gives the Taliban ' second tier ' room to reconnect with the government and this is absolutely at the heart of this operation . "
The second tier of the insurgency are regarded as crucial because they control large numbers of Taliban fighters in Pashtun - dominated southern Afghanistan .
The first tier of Taliban commanders – hardliners around Mullah Omar – could not be expected to start talks in the foreseeable future .
The third tier – footsoldiers with no strong commitments – are not regarded as influential or significant players .
The change in tactics was revealed as the Ministry of Defence announced that two more British soldiers were killed in southern Afghanistan .
One , from the Light Dragoons , was on patrol in Operation Panther 's Claw ; the other , a soldier from the Royal Artillery , was killed on foot patrol in Sangin .
Ten soldiers have died in Operation Panther 's Claw .
Mayall is responsible for formulating operational policy in Afghanistan and his remarks gave added weight to interventions by senior ministers yesterday .
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , and Douglas Alexander , the international development secretary , yesterday held out the prospect of reconciliation between the Afghan government and Taliban fighters prepared to renounce violence .
For more than a year , British intelligence officers have been instigating contacts with Taliban commanders and their entourage .
But their task has been very delicate given the sensitivities of the Karzai administration in Kabul .
The situation has been complicated further by the influx of hardline and ideologically motivated fighters joining the Taliban and other insurgent groups from across the Pakistani border .
But the fact that senior ministers and military commanders seized on the apparent success of Operation Panther 's Claw to highlight the possibility of talks with the Taliban reflects their concern about the lack of progress so far in Nato 's counter - insurgency .
Significantly , and as if to counter public aversion to talks with the Taliban , ministers and military commanders alike compared the current campaign in southern Afghanistan to anti-terrorist operations in Northern Ireland .
A ComRes poll in today 's Independent suggests most people now believe British troops should be pulled out of Afghanistan .
Most of those who responded ( 58 % ) said the Taliban could not be defeated militarily , and 52 % of those surveyed said troops should be withdrawn immediately .
This compares with a Guardian / ICM poll earlier this month which showed that 42 % of those surveyed wanted troops to be withdrawn immediately .
America 's priorities in Afghanistan will be spelled out in a briefing paper drawn up by General Stanley McChrystal , the new US commander in the country , due to be handed to Barack Obama tomorrow .
He will emphasise the need for speeding up the training of Afghan troops , according to defence sources .
He is also expected to ask for more troops from Nato allies .
British military commanders are drawing up contingency plans to increase the number of British forces to more than 10,000 from the current 9,000 .
Asked whether he needed more troops , Brigadier Tim Radford , commander of British troops in Helmand , replied : " I have enough forces to do what I set out to do in Panther 's Claw . "
The number of British troops that might be deployed in future was " out of my hands " , he said .
But he added that as the number of Afghan army recruits increased , the number of Nato forces required to train them also increased .
Miliband 's call for talks with more moderate Taliban elements was echoed later by Gordon Brown , who said : " Our strategy has always been to complement the military action that we 've got to take to clear the Taliban , to threaten al - Qaida in its bases – while at the same time we put in more money to build the Afghan forces , the troops , the police . "
People think workplace bullying is about blue - collar workers .
But surveys show office bullying Is common too .
Underlining the office bullying problem a 2002 report by Australia ’s APESMA professional women ’s network says one - third of survey respondents have been bullied at work .
In 2000 , Australia ’s Office of the Employee Ombudsman says it received more than 500 complaints a year on workplace bullying related issues and that number is increasing each year .
In its January 1999 Australian Jobs Index Survey , Morgan and Banks reported 10.4 % of employers believe bullying is increasing at work .
According to England ’s The Daily Telegraph , an online poll of 10,000 people found that 92 per cent believe they are the victims of workplace taunts and intimidation , with 56 per cent believing it is a serious problem in their office , shop or factory .
International research and anecdotal evidence from Australia and New Zealand suggests the worst industries for bullying are education , healthcare , social services and voluntary work .
The Morgan and Banks survey identified tourism as a problem industry .
There ’s also evidence bullying is more widespread in the government than in private industry , though this may reflect the willingness of government workers to report bullying .
Until recently there was n’t much formal awareness of bullying as a problem .
To some extent the increasing number of reported cases reflects the fact that employees are only just becoming used to being able to report bullying .
Outsourcing and cost- cutting can trigger bullying
White - collar unions say outsourced operations and understaffed workplaces are ideal breeding grounds for middle management bullies .
There ’s evidence bosses , who are themselves under undue pressure , turn into workplace bullies as a misguided coping strategy .
Bullying takes a number of forms .
At one end of the spectrum are malicious rumours , over critical work evaluation and physical or verbal isolation .
At the more extreme end there are direct verbal threats and physical violence .
Deaths as a result of workplace bullying are thankfully rare , but they do happen .
Bullying has been a feature of the workplace for most of human history .
No doubt when the senior public works managers of Ancient Egypt floated down the Nile on their annual off - site management brainstorming session some bright spark figured whipping might incentivise pyramid - building .
Office bullying kills productivity
Today ’s more enlightened managers recognise a happy workforce is productive and bullying has a direct negative impact on productivity .
There are estimates of the potential costs of workplace bullying , but ultimately it ’s impossible to measure the economic cost .
Other facts about workplace bullying .
Most research says that men and women face bullying in roughly equal numbers and that both men and women bully others in roughly equal numbers .
Women are more likely to report a bullying incident – men are less willing to admit to being intimidated .
Same sex bullying is far more common that intra-sex bullying .
Victims can lose self - esteem and blame themselves for the problem .
About one victim in 100 either attempts or succeeds to commit suicide .
90 % of calls to Britain ’s workplace bullying hotline came from white - collar workers – only 5 % involved manual workers .
About 10 % of all reported cases result in legal action – this proportion is increasing .
Two - thirds of the members of Unison ( the UK civil service union ) say they have witnessed workplace bullying .
Most bullied people report damage to their health
The overwhelming majority of bullies are repeat offenders .
In most cases more senior managers say they are aware that the bullying took place .
Bullying is responsible for around one resignation in four .

NBC 's Chuck Todd -- who , remember , is billed as a reporter covering the White House , not a pundit expressing opinions -- was on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Tuesday discussing reports that Eric Holder is likely to appoint a prosecutor to investigate Bush torture crimes .
Needless to say , everyone agreed without question that investigations were a ridiculous distraction from what really matters and would be terribly unfair .
This , along with Mika Brzezinski and Pat Buchanan , is what Todd argued after he was asked about the Holder story and the Cheney / CIA story ( video is below ) :
Todd : Look , let 's take all of these stories in one big thing : really , the only important thing -- the most important thing -- the President has to focus on is getting the public 's trust on the economy , and pushing health care .
Cheney , the CIA , and in some respects Sotomayor are cable catnip --
Brzezinski : Yep .
Todd :
It 's news catnip - but they 're sort of clouding the two most important issues the President 's got to get his arms around this week : winning back trust of the middle on the economy and pushing health care through .
Brzezinski : I would completely agree with you , yet the questions are being raised by news organizations like the New York Times .
Pat Buchanan , chime in , because as I 've been reporting [ sic ] , and I 'll say it for Chuck 's benefit here : speaking to a former senior intelligence official yesterday on the phone for quite some time , saying that this program that Cheney was apparently blocking the CIA from giving Congressional intelligence officials information on , was not even a program -- it was not operational -- it was not even at the stage where you would tell Congress about it or talk to high - level administration officials about it .
Is this much ado about nothing to get the attention off what needs to be done ?
Buchanan :
Well it 's exactly what Chuck said , it 's a massive distraction . . . .
Let me ask Chuck this : it seems to me you got a real problem for the administration if you go forward at Holder 's level --
Todd : Right .
Buchanan : and they appoint a Special Counsel , the first thing the CIA guys do is say is : yeah , we did it ; we waterboarded them ; and here 's the authorization from these lawyers who said we could do it --- the lawyers come in and say we were asked for our opinion and Cheney was the guy who asked us , and the President told us to go ahead and do it .
Are n't you right into the White House of the Bush administration as soon as you appoint that independent counsel ?
Todd :
And I think that 's why , in the President 's gut , he does n't want to do this .
They 've made that clear they do n't want to do this .
I think that 's what you see a lot of the West Wing -- they do n't want to get into this because of what you 're saying .
Ultimately , a lawyer gets paid to not tell you what the law is -- but to interpret the law , to tell you how far you can push things until you cross a line that a judge will say is illegal .
That 's what lawyers get paid to do : they get paid to interpret the law , and interpret the law in a way that allows you to stretch things .
You are on a slippery slope - this is a very dangerous aspect to go after , because these CIA guys will say , as you said Pat , we got the letter from these lawyers in the Bush Justice Department that said we can do this .
You can't suddenly change the law retroactively because there 's another interpretation of this .
I 'm sure there are a legal minds that will fight and say I do n't know what I 'm talking about here , but it seems to me that 's a legal and a political slippery slope .
This is about as typical a discussion as it gets among media stars as to why investigations are so very , very wrong and unfair and unwise .
Still , this discussion in particular vividly highlights several important points worth noting about the role of the establishment media .
WE ALL KNOW how passionate the Italians are about their racing heros .
So it may come as little surprise to find out that Valentino Rossi 's home town of Tavullia is preparing for the Grand Prix of San Marino at Misano circuit in their own unique way .
Life - size cardboard cut-outs of the eight - time motorcycle world champion adorn street corners , balconies and shop windows all around the sleepy Italian village .
It seems wherever you go in Rossi 's home town the eyes of The Doctor are never far away .
Do n't you just love their enthusiasm ?
Somehow , we can't see the folk of Sheffield doing the same for James Toseland !
My Thoughts
Leave a Comment and Tell Us If and What Bottled Water You Drink ?
( OrganicJar ) Bottled water makers make millions off people who believe their products are purer than tap water , but consumers do not realize that they are less regulated than plain old tap water , according to a U.S. Congressional report released on Wednesday .
In 2008 , Americans drank 8.6 billion gallons of bottled water , double the amount of a decade ago , with more than half saying they drink it because it is safer and healthier than tap water .
I ’d love to know why people think this ?
The report from the General Accountability Office found that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has little power to regulate the safety of bottled water .
Just 2 of 188 bottle companies surveyed by the environmental working group ( EWG ) provided information about the water ’s source and manner of treatment , as well as quality test reports : Ozarka Drinking Water and Penta Ultra - Purified Water .
All the other companies refused to disclose this information , and not even our government knows .
" Neither the public nor federal regulators know nearly enough about where bottled water comes from and what safeguards are in place to ensure its safety " said Representative Bart Stupak .
In addition , suppliers of tap water are required to notify customers within 24 hours about contaminants that exceed federal levels ; this does not apply to bottled water .
Nor must bottled water companies test water with certified laboratories , a requirement for tap water suppliers .
I think this is absolutely scary !
We read all the time about companies who take advantage of the ‘ rules and laws ’ that are in place … but with bottled water , there seems to be no rules , so you can only imagine what these corporations are doing , or where they ’re getting the water .
It was just last year that the EWG found ten popular U.S. bottled water brands contained mixtures of 38 different pollutants , including bacteria , fertilizer , Tylenol and industrial chemicals .
Just think of this …the environmental group EWG asked 188 bottled water companies to just disclose where they get their water , and how its treated … only 2 of the 188 did this .
The only reason they would n’t , is because their hiding something .
I recommend you just stop buying bottled water , and try using a refillable container .
My favorite is Klean Kantean !

As my high school physics teacher once explained to me , energy comes in all sorts of different forms : heat , light , motion , electricity , and even the “ potential ” energy in chemical bonds and bowling balls perched on top of a downward sloping ramp .
And yet , somehow , all of those different forms of energy were really all the same thing .
Energy is energy , no matter what form it takes .
To prove the point , she explained , it ’s quite easy to turn one form of energy into another .
Car engines convert fuel into forward motion and heat ; plants convert light into food ; solar panels convert light into electricity ; and the human body turns , say , Snickers bars into heat , motion , and work .
With me so far ?
Good .
So let ’s do a thought experiment .
Picture , for a second , a big ol ’ SUV — say , a Lincoln Navigator — speeding along at over 70 miles per hour .
It ’s got a lot of “ kinetic ” energy ( the energy of motion ) .
Now , picture that SUV slamming head on into a brick wall .
( Do n’t worry , it ’s being driven by crash test dummies . )
That ’s a big , nasty crash , right ?
Now , imagine that you could somehow capture all of the kinetic energy released in that collision , and convert it into a more familiar form : Snickers bars .
( Yeah , it ’s a little weird , but energy is energy .
Or , if you prefer , you could measure the kinetic energy of the crash , convert that measurement into nutritional calories — the measure of food energy — and see how many Snickers bars you get . )
So in terms of energy equivalence , how many Snickers bars are there in a car crash ?
The answer is surprising …
Find this article interesting ?
Please consider making a gift to support our work .
I ’ve asked dozens of people this question over the last few months , and nobody ’s guess has been remotely close .
Typically , people guess in the thousands , or even millions , of Snickers bars .
But the answer is much smaller : one .
A devastating car crash only represents as much energy as a single Snickers bar : 280 nutritional calories .
It hardly seems possible that one candy bar can pack so much punch .
But remember , it takes only about a cup of gasoline to accelerate an SUV from standstill to highway speed .
And most of the energy in that cup of gas is simply wasted — dissipated as engine heat or friction , rather than harnessed into forward motion .
Given that , it ’s not too hard to believe that there ’s just a single Snickers bar worth of kinetic energy in a speeding SUV .
Still , our gut tells us that that ’s absurd , and that a car crash has to have much , much more energy than a Snickers bar .
The lesson here ?
When it comes to energy , our common sense is just plain dumb .
We do OK with other parts of everyday reality : if someone asked us to guess how much time it ’ll take to get to the store , or how much a car weighs , or how tall a house is , we ’ll probably be pretty close .
But ask us about energy , and we can be wrong by many orders of magnitude .
And that ’s a real problem , since it makes it very difficult for us to set priorities around , say , energy efficiency .
You might get way more bang - for - the buck sealing up leaks in windows and doors than from installing solar panels ; but you ca n’t know that just by listening to your common sense .
Sometimes , you need someone knowledgeable to help you figure out the best , most cost efficient energy investments .
Seems like a good green jobs opportunity to me …
Oh , and just FYI — Here are some other Snickers bar energy conversions ( in round numbers ) :
* A hot bath : 10 - 20 Snickers bars
* A leisurely 10 - mile bike ride : 1 Snickers bars
* A leisurely 10 - mile drive : 56 Snickers bars .
* A stick of dynamite : 2 Snickers bars .
You can play around with this yourself : try this calorie counter for everyday activities , and this converter to turn various forms of energy into nutritional calories .
And the one lesson I ’ve learned from playing around with this :
It does n’t take much energy to produce light or motion , but heat is an energy hog !
That ’s why incandescent bulbs are so inefficient — most of the energy from electricity is turned into heat , rather than light .

Many of my friends are stuck doing jobs they hate .
I can think of only a handful doing something they actually like , while the majority took the first semi decent job available after college in order to pay of debt and get their foot on the property ladder .
And even then , the majority are still in the red and renting with friends rather than settling into their own abode .

The competition for high paying , interesting jobs is extremely fierce , and in the modern economy , virtually impossible to get .
But not , according to the NY Times , if you can pay for it .
Companies are springing up that guarantee graduates non paying placements in top companies for a hefty fee , walling off entrance to the best jobs for the super rich .
The new breed of elite will have not only gone to the best universities , but paid for the privilege of getting their job .

What does this mean ?
In basic terms , the idea of a meritocratic society is now dead .
The American Dream - the idea that anyone can make it , can no longer be true .
It is simply too expensive to obtain .
This has long been studied by social scienctists who have measured social mobility in western democracies .
It turns out , the more capitalistic the country , the least likely you are to improve your economic status .
In the United States and Britain , your families wealth is the best indication of how well you will do , not your inherent talent or desire to work .
You have a far better chance of improving your economic well being in Social Democracies ( like Sweden and Denmark ) , despite the fact that free market doctrine states that capitalist economies work best .
So , if you find yourself unhappy with your current situation , depressed at your inability to get a better job and unable to move up the property ladder , do n't worry .
It 's not your fault .
You 're not supposed to .

There are a couple of strokes of genius in District 9 that renew one ’s hopes for the future of genre film .
One is casting Sharlto Copley , who ’s not a trained actor , as protagonist Wikus van der Merwe , a dweeby South African bureaucrat who has greatness thrust upon him and does n’t know what to do with it .
Copley plays him so unheroically that he could head the cast of a South African version of The Office right now , no questions asked .
In interviews , Copley says he ’s dealt with so many dweeby South African bureaucrats that , when his friend , novice director Neill Blomkamp , asked him to play Wikus in the short film Alive in Joburg , he felt he was up to the job .
And with producer Peter Jackson ’s blessing he stayed on for the feature .
This casting is so effective because we do n’t know how to take Wikus as our protagonist in a sci- fi action film .
In a cruelly accurate satire of office - dweeb life , sure , but not in a sci - fi action film .
I was n’t even certain he was our protagonist for a long time , and kept expecting him to be sidelined in the course of the plot developments .
Copley plays him that way , as a weedy guy born to be sidelined who is befuddled to find himself at the center of the action once the going gets dangerous and consequential .
This is terrific , creating all sorts of tension and uncertainty about what ’s going to happen next .
How long has it been since a genre film did this ?
I ca n’t remember , that ’s how long .
Which leads us to the second stroke of genius , keeping the film set in Johannesburg .
For most of the world this is a nicely undocumented setting , commercial film - wise , so again we do n’t know exactly what to expect .
We ’re on alert for apartheid ugliness , of course , and expect that the aliens will fill in allegorically for the oppressed black population .
They do , but in a nicely complex way , becoming the bottom of the totem pole of oppression with every human across the races despising them and wanting them gone .
One plot twist involves Nigerian gangsters exploiting the aliens ’ addiction to cat food .
There are lots of great odd details filling the early scenes , suggesting we ’re not getting all the cultural references , that make for exciting film - watching .
Wikus ’ thick Afrikaaner accent is enough to put us on alert , our minds racing to get everything , which is exactly what the experience of a film should be .
This whole dominant practice of making slow films for dummies is inexcusable .
The film ’s backstory , provided in fake - documentary talking - heads style , is that an alien mothership mysteriously appeared above Johannesburg in the 1980s .
That led not to an attack on us , War of the Worlds - style , but to an aggressive takeover of the ship by South Africans .
Sickly aliens onboard got herded into a temporary refugee camp that evolved over the years into a crime - ridden shantytown .
The film ’s action starts with the new government mandate to clear out the shantytown and herd aliens into a modernized camp run by the sinister Multi-National United corporation ( MNU ) .
Wikus has been chosen as the corporate representative to go notify the aliens of their evictions .
His formidable CEO father - in - law got him the job .
These are some excellent sequences , as Wikus goes from one battered shack door to the next trying to get aliens , derogatorily known as “ prawns , ” to sign their own eviction notices .
He ’s backed by nasty military muscle , and completely clueless about what ’s likely to happen in such a volatile situation .
He keeps turning to the camera to joke with the cameramen about the squalid aspects of “ prawn ” life , as the aliens mill around angrily and the tension ratchets up notch by notch .
Nice !
What happens to Wikus there is not expected .
Thank you , screenwriters Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell .
This is not to say the whole movie works .
It loses steam halfway through , taking on a familiar narrative shape , and the last sequences are fairly straightforward action - chase - rescue - fights .
The ending is terrible , a sticky - sweet final two minutes that ’s like something out of Wall - E. ( Curse you , Blomkamp and Tatchell , if that was your doing ! )
All the more sentimental or heroic scenes are iffy because the creative team seems uncomfortable with them .
Their insight and inventiveness disappears as soon as they have to portray goodness , and they revert to sadly played - out conventions .
For example , the lead alien Christopher Johnson ( Jason Cope + CGI ) is set apart from the other bipedal crustacean - looking aliens and denoted as “ good ” by having him wear a vest and tattered pants .
Reminds me of The Simpsons Movie , in which Homer protests the butchery of a pig in a top hat , yelling , “ You ca n’t kill him if he ’s wearing people clothes ! ”
Christopher Johnson is also saddled with a small alien - son with ET - like blue eyes .
Many painful moments of adorability ensue .
Still , the film has enough fast , lively , shocking material early on to make it worthy of the advance buzz and favorable press .
Though not everybody ’s on board .
Daniel Engber of Slate argues that the film ’s no good because it trots out that moldy sci- fi cliché , portraying corporations as the enemy , which we ’ve already seen done in Blade Runner and Aliens and old warhorses like that .
Why oh why , bright bulb Daniel Engber asks , are sci - fi films so tiresomely fixated on evil corporate overlords running our dystopian future ?
What could be behind this strange fixation ?
What could it be ?
What cooooouuuuld it beeeeeeeeee ?
Probably some obscure Freudian thing .
WASHINGTON --
A recent analysis of the 2007 financial markets of 48 countries has revealed that the world 's finances are in the hands of just a few mutual funds , banks , and corporations .
This is the first clear picture of the global concentration of financial power , and point out the worldwide financial system 's vulnerability as it stood on the brink of the current economic crisis .
A pair of physicists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich did a physics - based analysis of the world economy as it looked in early 2007 .
Stefano Battiston and James Glattfelder extracted the information from the tangled yarn that links 24,877 stocks and 106,141 shareholding entities in 48 countries , revealing what they called the " backbone " of each country 's financial market .
These backbones represented the owners of 80 percent of a country 's market capital , yet consisted of remarkably few shareholders .
" You start off with these huge national networks that are really big , quite dense , " Glattfelder said .
“ From that you 're able to ... unveil the important structure in this original big network .
You then realize most of the network is n't at all important . "
The most pared - down backbones exist in Anglo - Saxon countries , including the U.S. , Australia , and the U.K .
Paradoxically ; these same countries are considered by economists to have the most widely - held stocks in the world , with ownership of companies tending to be spread out among many investors .
But while each American company may link to many owners , Glattfelder and Battiston 's analysis found that the owners varied little from stock to stock , meaning that comparatively few hands are holding the reins of the entire market .
“ If you would look at this locally , it 's always distributed , ” Glattfelder said .
“ If you then look at who is at the end of these links , you find that it 's the same guys , [ which ] is not something you 'd expect from the local view . ”
Matthew Jackson , an economist from Stanford University in Calif .
who studies social and economic networks , said that Glattfelder and Battiston 's approach could be used to answer more pointed questions about corporate control and how companies interact .
" It 's clear , looking at financial contagion and recent crises , that understanding interrelations between companies and holdings is very important in the future , ” he said .
" Certainly people have some understanding of how large some of these financial institutions in the world are , there 's some feeling of how intertwined they are , but there 's a big difference between having an impression and actually having ... more explicit numbers to put behind it . "
Based on their analysis , Glattfelder and Battiston identified the ten investment entities who are “ big fish ” in the most countries .
The biggest fish was the Capital Group Companies , with major stakes in 36 of the 48 countries studied .
In identifying these major players , the physicists accounted for secondary ownership -- owning stock in companies who then owned stock in another company -- in an attempt to quantify the potential control a given agent might have in a market .
The results raise questions of where and when a company could choose to exert this influence , but Glattfelder and Battiston are reluctant to speculate .
" In this kind of science , complex systems , you 're not aiming at making predictions [ like ] ... where the tennis ball will be at given place in given time , " Battiston said .
“ What you 're trying to estimate is … the potential influence that [ an investor ] has . "
Glattfelder added that the internationalism of these powerful companies makes it difficult to gauge their economic influence .
" [ With ] new company structures which are so big and spanning the globe , it 's hard to see what they 're up to and what they 're doing , ” he said .
Large , sparse networks dominated by a few major companies could also be more vulnerable , he said .
" In network speak , if those nodes fail , that has a big effect on the network . "
The results will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Physical Review E .

Here ’s my piece from the Fin on Thursday
The global financial crisis that began early in 2008 has put many of the seemingly unstoppable processes of globalization into reverse .
The volume of international trade has fallen sharply , and that of international financial transactions even more so .
The banks and financial markets that seemed to define the global economy have retreated into the arms of national governments .
There is one striking exception to this pattern of retrenchment .
According to the TeleGeography Global Internet Geography Research Service , international Internet traffic has grown at an annual rate of 74 percent in 2009 , well above the 55 percent growth measured in 2008 .
In part this is a matter of momentum .
The huge growth in capacity that was already committed before the crisis ensured that growth could continue .
Although new investment in fibre optic capacity has slowed as a result of the crisis , the system has proved capable of absorbing massively greater traffic .
But there are more fundamental forces at work here .
Although the Internet and its main manifestation , the World Wide Web depend on physical communications networks and commercial service providers , they are not , in the end , about cables and modems .
The Web is a set of protocols and social institutions for the expression and exchange of ideas of all kinds , whether expressed as text , audiovisual material or software .
Ideas are public goods .
They can be shared without losing value , and they cannot easily be restricted .
The Web is a prime example of a global good , one which benefits people everywhere in the world and depends for its value on contributions made all over the world .
The fact that the spectacular expansion of Internet activity has continued , and even accelerated through the financial crisis shows that the global exchange of information does not depend , in any important way , on the global financial sector .
Most Internet innovations have been developed on a non -profit basis , and even for - profit companies like Google maintain strong independence from the short term demands of financial markets .
On the other hand , the productivity of the real economy , and therefore the financial sector depends hugely on innovations that have arisen from the growth of the Internet .
The first - generation innovations of the Web in the 1990s universally adopted by business and governments .
Now they are shifting to ‘ Web 2.0 ’ technologies , including wikis , blogs and web - centric applications .
There has , then , been a huge shift in the location of innovation .
Many of the innovations that have driven productivity growth over the past two decades depend on public goods mostly produced outside the market and government sectors .
When we compare the huge social and monetary cost of the global financial crisis with the huge and continuing benefits of the global exchange of information , almost all of it given away free of charge , a striking paradox emerges .
With a handful of exceptions the innovators who gave us the Internet received little or nothing in the way of financial reward .
Leading figures like Tim Berners - Lee , the initiator of the World Wide Web have become famous , but not , at least by the standards of the global financial sector , wealthy as result .
And the thousands of contributors whose efforts turned these innovative ideas into reality have received little more than a warm glow of satisfaction .
Meanwhile , the innovators who gave us such boons as the CDO - squared , the option - ARM mortgage and the stapled security have walked away , collectively , with billions in salaries , bonuses and share options , leaving the rest of us to clean up the mess they created when the whole edifice of collapsed so spectacularly a year ago .
??
Even during the dotcom boom , when financial markets were eager to finance Internet - based innovation , their efforts were spectacularly misdirected .
Billions were hurled at ludicrous ventures like the on - line sale of pet food .
Meanwhile , the innovations that were to produce the Web 2.0 wave , such as the first blogs and wikis , were being developed without any significant input of credit or venture capital .
This contrast raises questions about the way we organise our economic system , the way we regulate financial markets , and the incomes derived from those markets .
If monetary returns are weakly , or even negatively , correlated with the value of social production , there ’s no reason to expect financial markets to do a good job in allocating resources to supporting innovation .
? As a result , it seems unlikely , that the massive incomes generated in the financial sector to reward financial innovation are beneficial to anyone except , of course , the recipients .
This week the world ’s eyes were on the extraordinary photograph of former President Bill Clinton seated next to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il — an official picture taken at the end of talks that led to the freeing of two imprisoned American journalists .
Mine , I confess , were elsewhere , continually diverted to the photo ’s dramatic backdrop , an enormous mural of crashing seas and fluttering birds rendered in lurid greens and brilliant whites .
On the one hand , a run -of - the - mill seascape , the kind of visual elevator music one ...

Excerpt :
' Gay rights advocates are pushing hard on the Obama administration to allow gays to serve openly in the U.S. armed forces .
Enter the law of unintended consequences .
Allowing gays to serve openly will ultimately mean that should military conscription i.e. the draft be reinstated , gays would be marched off to boot camp along with their straight counterparts - but what about women ?
We have abolished many of the policies that once excluded women from combat positions yet still do n’t require them register for Selective Service .
Women get to fly fighters and command warships but only if they want to ; how can that be considered equal treatment in the 21st century ?
...
Much has changed since this decision in Rostker v. Goldberg was handed down in 1981 .
As I ’ve noted earlier , women are serving in a wide variety of combat and combat - support roles that were unavailable to them nearly thirty years ago .
Section 451(e ) of the Military Selective Service
Act states , “ The Congress further declares that adequate provision for national security requires maximum effort in the fields of scientific research and development , and the fullest possible utilization of the Nation 's technological , scientific , and other critical manpower resources . ”
As of June 6 , 2009 the Department of Defense reports that 121 women have been killed in action and another 624 wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Given the extraordinarily valuable contributions of women to our national security , it is hard to imagine how any reasonable person could argue against their inclusion in the draft .
...
Although we are fighting in two wars , we are not in a state of national emergency that would require a draft .
Machiavelli said it best , " It is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm against the tempest . "
Waiting until a crisis requiring the draft occurs is irresponsible and inexcusable .
Recent congressional griping about “ emergency ” economic legislation being pushed through without time for a proper debate is proof positive that now is the time to settle this issue .
It is the time for America to answer one simple question , “ How can we have equal opportunity without equal responsibility ” ?
I 'm sure that is one question Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) and Gov. Sarah Palin ( R - AK ) can both agree on . '
General Mills and Kellogg ’s want to sell sugary processed foods like Froot Loops and Lucky Charms to your kids .
This is n’t anything new .
But under the guise of the new “ Smart Choices ” Program , large food corporations want to proudly label sugary , highly processed foods as good nutritional food options .
The program was recently created by a conglomerate of conglomerates , including ConAgra Foods , Kellogg ’s , Kraft Foods , Pepsico , Tyson Foods , and Unilever .
The participating companies list all their products that “ meet a comprehensive set of nutrition criteria based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and other sources of nutrition science and authoritative dietary guidance ” .
You can review the Smart Choices website for yourself .
While there are some admirable ideas in the program , such as honest , transparent labeling and encouraging healthy eating options , one has to question the wisdom of any program that is able to recommend Foot Loops , Lucky Charms , and Frosted Flakes as healthy eating options .
And Wheat Thins , Teddy Grahams , and Fudgsicles are probably not the healthiest snacking / dessert ideas out there , but according to the “ Smart Choices ” program they are .
In an age when the obesity problem in America has reached epic proportions , making smart food choices is a key to a healthy living .
But with childhood obesity , early onset diabetes , and the myriad other health problems caused by over - consumption of highly processed and sugar laden foods , labeling the aforementioned products as “ Smart Choices ” is at the very least misleading and irresponsible , and representative of greenwashing at its worst .
Organizations like Food Democracy Now ! have railed against the Smart Choices Program and have started a letter writing campaign to end this misleading labeling practice .

New version of
Footprints in the Sand Imagine you and the Lord Jesus walking down the road together .
For much of the way , the Lord 's footprints go along steadily , consistently , rarely varying the pace .
But your prints are a disorganized stream of zigzags , starts , stops , turnarounds , circles , departures and returns .
For much of the way it seems to go like this .
But gradually , your footprints come more in line with the Lord 's , soon paralleling His consistently .
You and Jesus are walking as true friends .
This seems perfect , but then an interesting thing happens : your footprints that once etched the sand next to the Master 's are now walking precisely in His steps .
Inside
His larger footprints is the small ' sand print ' , safely enclosed .
You and Jesus are becoming one .
This goes on for many miles .
But gradually you notice another change .
The footprint inside the larger footprint seems to grow larger .
Eventually it disappears altogether .
There is only one set of footprints .
They have become one .
Again , this goes on for a long time .
But then something awful happens .
The second set of footprints is back .
And this time it seems even worse .
Zigzags all over the place .
Stops .
Starts .
Deep gashes in the sand .
A veritable mess of prints .
You 're amazed and shocked .
But this is the end of your dream .
Now you speak .
" Lord , I understand the first scene with the zigzags and fits and starts and so on .
I was a new Christian , just learning .
But
You walked on through the storm and helped me learn to walk with you . "
" That is correct . "
" Yes , and when the smaller footprints were inside of Yours , I was actually learning to walk in Your steps .
I followed You very closely . "
" Very good .
You have understood everything so far . "
" Then the smaller footprints grew and eventually filled in with Yours .
I suppose that I was actually growing so much that I was becoming like you in every way . "
" Precisely . "
" But this is my question .
Lord ..
Was there a regression or something ?
The footprints went back to two , and this time it was worse than the first . "
The Lord smiles , then laughs .
" You did n't know ? "
He says .
" That was when we danced . "

Previously HD audio have been kept away from the cellular networks , but today Orange launched HD voice for mobiles in Moldova .
It ’s the worlds first HD voice over the 3G and one of the biggest breakthroughs in mobile technology in years .
For those who do n’t know about Moldova , it ’s a landlocked country in Eastern Europe , located between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north , east and south .
Orange has upgraded the voice sound quality on its network to support the WB - AMR codex .
This is the second step in Orange ’s high - definition ( HD ) voice strategy , following on from the launch of a high - definition voice service for VoIP calls in 2006 .
Over 500,000
Live phone devices have already been sold in France and the range will be extended to other Orange countries over the coming months .
The first mobile handset integrating high - definition voice capability that will be launched by Orange Moldova is the Nokia 6720 c .
Background noise and distortion is also faded out to provide clearer voice conversations creating a feeling of proximity between both parties .
This technology will bring a revolution in the cellular industry as now most of the customers would want their handsets to be HD voice enabled and by now only Nokia 6720c has this function .
Many of the customers would now prefer to switch their networks to Orange or have to be patient and wait for this technology to reach at their service provider ’s door .
Nokia 6720c has all the functions of a smart phone .
It has 2.2 inches screen TFT 16 M colors .
It has a symbian operating system S60 rel 3.2 .
It has infrared , Bluetooth , WLAN integrated GPS besides it has a 5 MP camera with a nice picture quality .
Battery talk time is up to 8 hours and 30 mins .
High definition voice is clearly the future standard for mobile communications .
Orange plans to rapidly extend the range of HD voice - compatible mobile handsets across Europe .
The Group plans to introduce HD voice services to the UK and Belgium markets by the end of 2010 and believes that these handsets will represent the majority of the 3G handsets sold within five years .

( CNN ) --
A man died after his car plunged 600 feet off the edge of the Grand Canyon 's South Rim , authorities said Tuesday .
About 5 million people visit the Grand Canyon in Arizona each year .
The Arizona park 's regional communications center received several reports of a car driving off the edge about 6 a.m. Monday , according to a written statement .
" Upon arriving at the scene , investigators found tire tracks leading to the edge behind the Thunderbird Lodge and received reports of a single occupant in a blue passenger car driving over the edge , " the statement said .
Rescue personnel descended on ropes and found the vehicle about 600 feet into the canyon .
The man 's body was recovered shortly afterward , the statement said .
The incident occurred near the El Tovar hotel in a village on the canyon 's South Rim , park spokeswoman Shannan Marcak said .
Authorities have not ruled the death a suicide , she said .
" It has not been ruled anything at this time . "
The statement said the National Park Service is investigating .
Typically , Marcak said , such investigations take at least a few days .
The man has not been identified , she said .
Marcak said that within the past five years , she knows of only one other time a car was driven off the edge of the canyon .
The Monday statement said plans were being made to retrieve the vehicle and the body .
The Grand Canyon , a world famous landmark , receives close to 5 million visitors yearly , according to the National Park Service Web site .

It is legally permissible for police to zap a suspect with a Taser to obtain a DNA sample , as long as it ’s not done “ maliciously , or to an excessive extent , or with resulting injury , ” a county judge has ruled in the first case of its kind in New York State , and possibly the nation .
[ efoods ]
Niagara County Judge Sara Sheldon Sperrazza decided that the DNA sample obtained Sept. 29 from Ryan S. Smith of Niagara Falls — which ties him to a shooting and a gas station robbery — is legally valid and can be used at his trial .
Smith was handcuffed and sitting on the floor of Niagara Falls Police Headquarters when he was zapped with the 50,000 - volt electronic stun gun after he insisted he would not give a DNA sample .
He already had given a sample , a swab of the inside of his cheek , without protest the previous month .
But police sent it to the wrong lab , where it was opened and spoiled .
Prosecutors who had obtained a court order for the first sample went back to Sperrazza , who signed another order without consulting the defense .

Well , it 's about damned time :
Liberal lawmakers who oppose a deal House leaders cut with centrist Blue Dog Democrats have gathered signatures from 57 lawmakers who say they wo n't vote for the plan .
“ This agreement will result in the public , both as insurance purchasers and taxpayers , paying ever higher rates to insurance companies , ” the letter says .
“ We simply can not vote for such a proposal . ”
If Republicans oppose the healthcare bill on the floor en masse , 57 Democrats voting “ no ” would defeat the bill .
The agreement between four Blue Dogs and House leaders cut $ 100 billion off of the price tag of the bill .
Under the proposal , reimbursement rates in the government - run “ public plan ” would not be linked to Medicare .
It would also reduce subsidies to make a government - run “ public plan ” more affordable .
Liberals say those changes undermine the public plan by making it too expensive for people to join .
The signers are mostly members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , the Congressional Black Caucus , the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Asian - Pacific Islander Caucus .
The other day @shuckins mentioned that
I 'm finding the MX Revolution quite awesome except that I really miss my scroll wheel click button .
This was an issue that I had when I started using this mouse as well .
The key feature of the mouse being that a middle click will switch the scroll wheel from smooth movement to discrete ( chunky ? ) movement and back again .
This is actually very cool to use once you 've gotten accustomed to having the option of scrolling down a page with fine control of speed / distance and then click once to then flick back up to the top of a page .
What I did to make my life easier with this mouse was setup the thumb scroll wheel to act as my middle click that I was accustomed to having .
I accomplished this via the btnx - config program as available from the btnx website .
Once I found out how easy it was to get the middle click from the thumb wheel I decided to make the thumb up / down also have some functionality .
If you use firefox and / or gnome terminal I find the most useful thing to map was thumb up to shift pageup and thumb down to shift pagedown .
With these set this way I can switch tabs on both firefox and gnome - terminal w/o moving back to the keyboard .
The other neat thing I found ( when I actually noticed ) was that this mapping holds even when using synergy to control two ( or more ) machines .
The mouse works great , and I have n't in recent memory ever like a mouse as much as I have this one .
Couple the nice manufacturing with the ease of button configuration provided by the great programmers of btnx and I think its the perfect mouse for a programmer .
Especially one who does n't like to have to constantly switch between using the mouse and keyboard .
All the cool kids are getting one .
So , last week , I got a prescription for medicinal marijuana ; not because I smoke very much , but because as a California citizen I can .
Smoking pot might still be a federal offense , but I am unemployed with nothing better to do , so , I made the responsible decision to spend my modest savings on a license for drugs .
It was maybe the weirdest whim I ever had .
A friend of mine referred me to a place where he had gotten his license , so I figured I would check it out .
The adventure began with me tentatively approaching the ominous looking club door at the back of the building .
There were no signs , so it seemed like a good place to start .
Next to the door there was a giant guard ( who bared a striking resemblance to Danny McBride ) sitting on a motorcycle , smoking a cigarette and looking overly menacing .
He obviously knew what I was there for .
Instead of telling me where to go he just stared for a good 30 seconds before pointing in the direction of another entrance at the front of the building .
He was guarding the actual dispensary ; I needed to visit the wizard before being allowed into the Emerald City .
When I entered the front lobby ( and by lobby I mean an plain white room ) many people were already waiting to see the doctor .
People from all walks of life had gathered in this small space - from businessmen to housewives to punk skater kids .
Despite our common bond of loving the MJ , no one wanted to make eye contact .
So I awkwardly made my way to the front desk ( and by front desk , I mean a table and chair ) and somewhat shamefully grabbed my new client paperwork .
The questionnaire was ridiculous ; it listed every possible ailment and asked if I “ suffered from any of them . ”
Let ’s see…
Headaches ?
Check .
Back aches ?
Check .
Accident - prone ?
Check .
It is unclear what kind of doctor he specifically was .
For all I know “ doctor ” could have just been a nickname that he prints on letterhead .
Despite the number of people waiting , my name was called within 10 minutes .
Whatever type of medicine it is that he officially practiced , this “ doctor ” certainly ran an efficient operation .
I entered his office ( and by office I mean converted broom closet ) and noticed that the walls were covered with hand written Bible verses and childlike sketches of Jesus .
A chair pivoted around and I was greeted without words by a small , wise looking Filipino man .
He actually looked a lot like Yoda .
He proceeded to ask me questions about my headaches , my anxiety , and my clumsiness .
He suggested that I might benefit from a specific strain of Sativa as he filled out some paperwork .
I was shocked .
That was it !
No BS , no problems .
It was now legal for me to buy pot in the State of California .
So , after paying a nominal fee of 60 dollars for the professional consultation , I marched straight back to the other intimidating door ( Danny McBride and I were good old buddies now ) entered the Emerald City , bought my first legal bag of marijuana .
The club was completely different than the front office .
It was dimly lit , candles were burning and the walls were covered with random shelves containing bobble head cat sculptures .
Bob Marley was playing , and everyone wore a smile .
Within the clubs confines , even Fake Danny McBride seemed like a happier person .
The club had a smoking lounge for “ chill medicating , ” so I rolled a celebratory joint and shared it with McBride while we discussed our gratitude for life and autonomy .
I was feeling quite good about my decision .
Then I got a call from a private number .
It was a lady from an internship I had applied for ; she needed me to complete a background check and a drug test by Friday .
Fuck .
Rachel Maddow on the GOP 's latest conspiracy theory .
Republicans are trying to rally their base by painting health care reform as a way to advance assisted suicide and to literally kill old people .
It would be bad enough if this were only coming from fringe groups or right wing web sites , but as Rachel notes , it 's coming straight from these politicians ' mouths .
The Republicans continue to prove that Bill Maher was right about them with this kind of talk .

At least one thing is clear to the City Weekly ; that each side is convinced that the other is ill informed .
So the City Weekly devised a little quiz that might shed some light – if not on the veracity of competing healthcare claims – then at least on the political savvy of those making them .
Presented a blank map of the Middle East and surrounding area - one with county names removed – those attending the town hall were asked to point out Iraq , a country where we have waged war for over six years .
The idea was that those who consider themselves to be well informed on the state of America today should at least be able to identify a place where we have shed blood in a conflict that has lasted longer than our involvement in World War II .
The Omaha City Weekly tested 40 attendees each among those who identified themselves as either firmly for or against the proposed HR 3200 .
Those polled were evenly split between gender and age groups .
Results are further broken down by race …
Oh , whom am I trying to kid ?
With an estimated 1,200 people in attendance , the City Weekly , try as we might , could not find a single African American who was against HR 3200 .
A full 75 % , 30 of 40 pro-reform attendees , could identify Iraq in its rather eye - catching , dead center position on the map .
Only 52.5 % , 21 of 40 anti-reformers could do so .
Granted , this was a thoroughly unscientific poll with a tiny sample size .
It would perhaps be unfair to infer that those who ca n’t find Iraq on a map may be equally uniformed on other issues - like the much touted “ death panels , ” a meme whose vileness is surpassed only by its insipid cruelty .
So forget the numbers .
More telling was the startling reactions I got while conducting the test .
Pro-reform people , even those geographically challenged few who laughed out loud at the futility of the task before them , portrayed a uniformly agreeable front .
Most gave a knowing , touch_ - like nod and smile .
I received no negative comments , none at all , from that group .
The same could not be said of the other camp .
Far from it .
One gentleman practically knocked the clipboard out of my hand in jabbing - angrily and correctly – at the country that ( John Kerry was right ) represented the wrong war at the wrong time in the wrong place .
Many sneered .
Most at least glowered .
Four accused the test itself of being somehow biased .
About half way through the polling I mistakenly blurted out “ yes ” when I meant to say “ no ” after a Tea Partier asked if they had answered correctly in this little game of “ where ’s Waldo ? ”
“ So much for your gotcha politics , ” the woman with more tattoos than teeth snarled .
“ And you want to say that we are all so stupid ! ”
Think about that for a moment .
She knew that hers was what could only be described as a wild guess .
She knew that she did n’t know the location of Iraq .
And yet when told that her answer was correct she became smugly defiant , sending me away shaking my head at such blatant disingenuousness .
Accustomed to being lied to by her own party and by the right wing noise machine , she apparently did n’t think twice about lying to the media – and to herself .
And then it hit me .
I must always answer “ yes , ” even when an answer was incorrect .
Not a single pro-reform person gave me a “ so there ” - style response , but five on the other side gleefully did , including four who had answered incorrectly .
Perhaps saddest of all was the Viet Nam vet who spat , “ Why the hell should I care where Iraq is ? ”
Why indeed .
If you are a programmer or have messed around on a Mac for a while , chances are you might have heard of this wonderful little language known as AppleScript .
So what is AppleScript ?
AppleScript is a scripting language that was created by Apple , and made to make the daily processes of the end user go through quicker and easier .
Think of all the small daily repetitive tasks you perform on a daily basis .
Could any of these be cut back or automated ?
This is exactly what AppleScript aims to do .
Today we will have a look at 11 awesome AppleScripts that can help you speed up your daily tasks , as well as review how to create your own !
1. The DesignerGeeks Free List
Coming in first on our list of excellent AppleScripts is the wide array of free scripts available at DesignerGeek .
Just take a look at the list and functions of some of these scripts !
With features and scripts ranging from backups , iCal , Fonts , Drop box alerts , Growl and Wiki apps , the list just goes on and on !
If you 're looking for some quality free AppleScripts , look no further .
2. Convert an Image
How many times have you gone through the following process ?
Download an image(s ) , find the image , open up PhotoShop , wait , select the image and open it , and then finally save the image as a different type of file by converting it .
I know I have done it more times than I could count and this is exactly the scenario where AppleScript is meant to help .
Download the script above , and all you need to do is drag the images you wish to convert , select the new file type you wish , and you 're done !
3. NetNewsWire to FriendFeed
FriendFeed has really blown up in the past year or so , with more and more end users taking advantage of its services and capabilities .
This AppleScript aims to bring NetNewsWire and FriendFeed together , which will end up saving you some time in the long run .
To quote the script author :
This applescript allows you to post an article to FriendFeed from NetNewsWire .
This script based in large part on the " blog selection " script that comes with NetNewsWire .
The script is completely free and is available to download via GitHub .
4. Rampage !
Another big time saver here .
Imagine you need to know every detail and all of the information about a certain image .
You could locate the photo , open up PhotoShop , open the image , find the settings to view all the details etc .
Or , you could just download the rampage script for free , select the image and be done with it .
Rampage will tell you everything you wanted ( and did n't want ) to know about the current image you have selected .
5. Doug 's iTunes Scripts
Here is a resource of scripts that will be extremely useful to any iTunes user or music fan .
Good ol '
Doug has setup a page with , at the time of writing , 454 AppleScripts that deal with making iTunes work for you .
Some of the scripts range from organizing songs in advanced fashions , to joining certain tracks together with a few clicks of your mouse .
Later on we will look at a particularly great script from Doug 's website .
6. iCal Duplicate Script
iCal is a wonderful Mac software program that functions as a day planner / calendar / event organizer etc .
It can really help you to keep track of daily ( or monthly ) tasks and what you need to get done on any given day .
It is , however , not without it 's flaws .
If you use iCal frequently , you might have noticed it is somewhat easy to accidentally add or create duplicate / multiple entries .
These can really start to clog up your calendar .
By downloading and installing the iCal duplicate script , you can clean up your calendar in about three seconds !
7. iTunes Library Manager
Earlier , I stated we would have a look at another one of Doug 's excellent iTunes script and the time has come to do so ( oh joy ! ) .
If you are anything like me , you have a lot of iTunes music and libraries setup .
The iTunes Library Manager allows you to maintain multiple libraries , all with different customizable settings .
Features you ask ?
The author answers :
Additionally , because each library is saved and loaded with its associated preferences , you can create many different configurations for different uses .
For instance , you can assign each library its own designated iTunes Music folder , and keep a directory of audio files on your computer and another distinct directory of audio files on another volume , network drive or external drive ; different libraries can have different Sharing , Burning or Importing settings , too .
8. iTunes Music Alarm Clock
This script is a must have for myself and many others .
If you happen to be more of a night owl rather than a morning bird , you may have just found your answer to those getting ups for those horribly early mornings .
The iTunes music alarm clock allows you to set all of your preferences for when and how long the alarm should go off .
You choose the tracks or albums , the libraries , whatever you want really .
Better to wake up to some of your favorite music than a horribly annoying buzzing sound !
9. TinyURL AppleScript
Website owners and bloggers will probably find this script most helpful .
With the popularity of services like Twitter came the need for short and simple URL's , and services like TinyURL .
Problem is , if you need to create a bunch of different URLs , it can be sort of a mind numbing process of copying and pasting , and navigating to certain sites .
The TinyURL AppleScript takes the current url of the page in Safari , and adds it to your clipboard for easy pasting .
Sweet and simple .
Developing Your Own !
So far we have looked at pre made AppleScripts to help you speed up your daily tasks and procedures .
That is all fine and dandy if you can find the script you are looking for , but what if you can 't ?
What if you need a script specialized to your exact needs ?
Well , you could hire a programmer to do it for you , or you could look at the resources below and build it yourself !
It 's not too difficult , I promise !

Magnetism makes the world go around , or at least for us hyper - connected types who would suffer brain damage if our data disappeared .
But , in spite of the world 's reliance on magnetic storage , advances in the technology have been rather uneven .
For instance , storage density has scaled quite nicely , and , along with it , the sensitivity of the read / write head .
The odd men out in the line are the read and write speeds , which are still quite slow — even ignoring seek times that have n't changed in the last eon .
There is a fundamental reason for this : magnetic storage relies on flipping the orientation of the spins in a magnetic material , and this is subject to the limits of the materials .
However , researchers have demonstrated that they can exploit a different type of magnetic material to speed up the write speed , even though the change in magnetic orientation takes the same amount of time .
Normally , when we think of magnetic materials , we think of ferromagnetism .
A ferromagnet is made from atoms that each have an unpaired electron .
This turns each atom into a tiny magnet and , when these are all lined up , we get a larger magnet .
Most hard drive technology is based on flipping the orientation of these sorts of magnets .
One applies a magnetic field to the magnet , which starts the electron spins rotating and precessing about the field .
The speed of precession , and hence the time it takes to flip the magnet , is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field : larger fields cause spins to precess faster .
So , one might imagine that applying a sufficiently large field would allow you to decrease write times indefinitely .
Unfortunately , at this point , the real world reaches out and slaps you in the face .
It turns out that if the field is too large , the entire magnetic order of the material is momentarily destroyed and the final orientation of the magnet is randomized .
Bummer .
Coming to the rescue is antiferromagnetism .
In this case , the material consists of two groups of atoms .
The atoms within a group have the same alignment , but the two groups have a different alignment .
Furthermore , these atoms are interleaved with each other , like a chess board , so the magnetism that 's observed is the summation of the two .
Often , the two groups align opposite each other , so the bulk magnetism is generally pretty small .
The flipping behavior of these materials is very different than that of ferromagnetism because the two groups are influenced by each other .
Essentially , if you set one group of atoms in motion , that will set the other group in motion , which , in turn — let me interrupt this before it becomes too recursive .
The upshot is that antiferromagnets behave as if they had inertia , meaning that after you turn the external magnetic field off , the spins keep oscillating and may still flip .
To explore this behavior , the researchers blasted antiferromagnets with intense pulses of light — light has both electric and magnetic fields , but we are only interested in the magnetic fields — providing a magnetic field pulse just 100 femtoseconds long .
After the pulse was gone , a second , weaker laser pulse was shone on the sample .
The orientation of the electric field of this second pulse is rotated by the antiferromagnet , and the amount of rotation depends on the orientation of the two groups of atoms in the sample .
The dynamics of the material could be observed by varying the time between the magnetic pulse and the measuring pulse .
In doing so , the researchers observed that the magnetic flip takes a few picoseconds , but the magnet continues to oscillate around the new orientation for about 100 picoseconds as it settles down .
This is something that is never observed in ferromagnets and could only occur if the spins had some sort of inertia and needed time to settle down .
So , this does n't make the write process faster , since the oscillations go on for a bit .
But the magnetic field only needs to be applied for the first 100 femtoseconds , after which it can move on , meaning that write speeds could be considerably faster .
Sounds good , right ?
Well , not so fast .
Antiferromagnetic materials are quite delicate and most of them lose their antiferromagnetism at high temperatures — and we 're talking a physicist 's definition of high .
For instance , the material used in this research had to be kept at a temperature of around 50 K .
I do n't know if a room temperature antiferromagnetic material with the right properties exists at present , but until it does , this will not end up in a hard drive near you .
Nature Physics , 2009 , DOI : 10.1038/nphys1369
[ The following post appears simultaneously as a guest post on TorrentFreak today ]
Seven weeks ago , the Canadian government launched the first national copyright consultation since 2001 .
The consultation , which has featured town hall meetings , by - invitation - only roundtables , an online discussion forum , and an open submission process , has attracted considerable interest with over 4,000 submissions to date .
While the overwhelming majority of those submissions have called for balanced reforms that would strengthen fair dealing , create a liability safe harbour for intermediaries , and link any new anti-circumvention rules to actual copyright infringement , there is reason for concern .
There are only six days left in the consultation and the thousands that have spoken out for fair copyright – the students , teachers , Internet users , software programmers , privacy advocates , librarians , and a growing number of creators – now find themselves under attack from two sides .
On one side stand well - known copyright lobby groups such as the Canadian Recording Industry Association , the Canadian Motion Pictures Distributors Association , and the Entertainment Software Alliance .
These groups largely represent foreign interests and have consistently called on the Canadian government to adopt the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright
Act as its legislative model .
They invariably claim that Canada should be embarrassed by the current state of copyright law and propose solutions that involve a combination of DMCA - style anti-circumvention rules , a three - strikes and you ’re out system that could see users cut off from the Internet , and a rejection of any new flexibilities within fair dealing .
To support those positions , the groups turned out en masse for a public town hall meeting in Toronto late last month , resulting in multiple interventions from record label executives ( four from Warner Music alone ) .
Packing the room ensured that there was virtually nothing heard from education and consumer groups , many of whom could not even attend the town hall since all the tickets were scooped up in less than five days .
Standing on the other side are copyright creator groups such as Access Copyright and the American Federation of Musicians .
Access Copyright opened the consultation by ominously warning its members that “ users outnumber us ” and claiming that the debate is dominated by people do not believe that authors should get fair compensation for digital and other reproductions of their work ( so far five out of 4038 submissions have called for the elimination of copyright ) .
Meanwhile , the American Federation of Musicians circulated an email to creator groups calling a leaflet distributed by an opposition Member of Parliament “ disgusting ” since it supported stronger fair dealing .
These groups are pushing for an expanded levy system and have been quick to criticize users that do n’t agree or offer up alternatives .
Faced with these vocal lobbying efforts , Canadians have just a few days left to ensure that their voices are heard .
The town halls and roundtables are now over .
The best way to speak out is through the online submission process that takes only a few minutes to complete .
Authors such as Cory Doctorow and David Collier - Brown , technology companies such as Tucows , and groups such as Project Gutenberg Canada and the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations have all already done so [ the Documentary Organization of Canada has provided advice to its members on how they can participate ]
Now is the time for Canadians concerned with copyright to add their voices .
Websites such as SpeakOutOnCopyright.ca , CCER.ca , Vancouver Fair Copyright , and Digitalagenda.ca provide tools to learn more about the issues and process submissions .
If you already know what you want to say , simply send an email to info@copyrightconsultation.gc.ca .
Once you have spoken out , tell your friends , send the submission to your local Member of Parliament , and raise awareness that the consultation deadline is Sunday , September 13th .
Many Canadians felt anger and frustration when the government introduced DMCA - style legislation in 2008 .
The next six days provide a great opportunity to do more than just complain .
They offer the chance to help influence the next copyright bill .
Do n’t wait – speak out on copyright today .

Joseph Tainter , a Professor in the Department of Environment and Society at Utah State University , and author of the seminal work " The Collapse of Complex Societies " , recently gave a speech on complexity and resource use at the 94th Annual Meeting of Ecological Society of America in New Mexico : ( Conference theme : Human Macroecology : Understanding Human - Environment Interactions Across Scales ) .
The speech , ' Human Resource Use : Timing and Implications for Sustainability ' , based on a forthcoming paper , is reprinted below with the authors permission .
(* NOTE : Dr. Tainter uses the word ' complexity ' many times in the below speech , without defining it .
I asked him for a definition of the term and he pointed me to his 2006 paper , " Social Complexity and Sustainability " , that gives the following definition , from the field of Anthropology . )
" Complexity is more challenging to define singularly .
As it has become a popular topic in recent years , competing definitions of complexity have made it difficult to clarify the concept .
The nuances of these different conceptions are not helpful in understanding the relationship of social complexity to sustainability ; those interested may consult the growing literature on this topic .
To understand sustainability , it is useful to conceptualize complexity in human social systems as differentiation in both structure and behavior , and / or degree of organization or constraint ( Tainter , 1988 , 2000 b ; Allen et al. , 2003 ; see also Allen et al. , 1999 ) .
Social systems vary in complexity as they diversify or contract in structure and behavior , and / or as they increase or decrease in organizational constraints on behavior . "

Human Resource Use : Timing and Implications for Sustainability
Joseph A. Tainter
Department of Environment and Society , Utah State University , Logan , Utah 84322 , U.S.A .
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Few questions of history have been more enduring than how today ’s complex societies evolved from the foraging bands of our ancestors .
While this might seem of academic interest , it has important implications for anticipating our future .
Our understanding of sustainability depends to a surprising degree on our understanding of the human past .
My purposes today are to show that the conventional understandings of cultural evolution are untenable , as are assumptions about sustainability that follow from them , and to present a different approach to assessing our future .
Cultural complexity is deeply embedded in our contemporary self image .
Colloquially it is known by the more common term “ civilization , ” which we believe our ancestors achieved through the phenomenon called “ progress . ”
The concepts of civilization and progress have a status in the cosmology of industrial societies that amounts to what anthropologists call “ ancestor myths . ”
Ancestor myths validate a contemporary social order by presenting it as a natural and sometimes heroic progression from earlier times .
Social scientists label this a “ progressivist ” view .
It supposes that cultural complexity is intentional , that it emerged through the inventiveness of our ancestors .
Progressivism is the dominant ideology of free - market societies .
But inventiveness is not a sufficient explanation for cultural complexity , which requires facilitating circumstances .
What were those circumstances ?
Prehistorians once thought they had the answer :
The discovery of agriculture gave our ancestors surplus food and , concomitantly , free time to invent urbanism and the things that comprise “ civilization ” –cities , artisans , priesthoods , kings , aristocracies , and all of the other features of early states .
The progressivist view posits a specific relationship between resources and complexity .
It is that complexity develops because it can , and that the factor facilitating this is surplus energy .
Energy precedes complexity and allows it to emerge .
There are , however , significant reasons to doubt whether surplus energy has actually driven much of cultural evolution .
One strand of thought that challenges progressivism emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries in the works of Wallace ( 1761 ) , Malthus ( 1798 ) , and Jevons .
The economist Kenneth Boulding derived from Malthus ’s essay on population three theorems : the Dismal Theorem , the Utterly Dismal Theorem , and the moderately cheerful form of the Dismal Theorem .
The Utterly Dismal Theorem directly challenges the progressivist view :
Any technical improvement can only relieve misery for a while , for as long as misery is the only check on population , the improvement will enable population to grow , and will soon enable more people to live in misery than before .
The final result of improvements , therefore , is to increase the equilibrium population , which is to increase the sum total of human misery ( Boulding , 1959 : vii [ emphases in original ] ) .
The implication of this strain of thought is that humans have rarely had surplus energy .
Surpluses are quickly dissipated by growth in consumption .
Since humans have rarely had surpluses , the availability of energy cannot be the primary driver of cultural evolution .
Beyond a Malthusian view , there is another factor that undermines progressivism .
It is that complexity costs .
In any living system , increased complexity ( involving differentiation in structure and increasing organization ) carries a metabolic cost .
In non-human species this is a straightforward matter of additional calories .
Among humans the cost is calculated in such currencies as resources , effort , time , or money , or by more subtle matters such as annoyance .
While humans find complexity appealing in spheres such as art , music , or architecture , we usually prefer that someone else pay the cost .
We are averse to complexity when it unalterably increases the cost of daily life without a clear benefit to the individual or household .
Before the development of fossil fuels , increasing the complexity and costliness of a society meant that people worked harder .
The development of complexity is thus a paradox of human history .
Over the past 12,000 years , we have developed technologies , economies , and social institutions that cost more labor , time , money , energy , and annoyance , and that go against our aversion to such costs .
Why , then , did human societies ever become more complex ?
At least part of the answer is that complexity is a basic problem - solving tool .
Confronted with problems , we often respond by developing more complex technologies , establishing new institutions , adding more specialists or bureaucratic levels to an institution , increasing organization or regulation , or gathering and processing more information .
While we usually prefer not to bear the cost of complexity , our problem - solving efforts are powerful complexity generators .
All that is needed for growth of complexity is a problem that requires it .
Since problems continually arise , there is persistent pressure for complexity to increase .
Cultural complexity can be viewed as an economic function .
Societies and institutions invest in problem solving , undertaking costs and expecting benefits in return .
In problem - solving systems , inexpensive solutions are adopted before more complex and expensive ones .
In the history of human food - gathering and production , for example , labor - sparing hunting and gathering gave way to more labor - intensive agriculture , which in some places has been replaced by industrial agriculture that consumes more energy than it produces .
We produce minerals and energy whenever possible from the most economical sources .
Our societies have changed from egalitarian relations , economic reciprocity , ad hoc leadership , and generalized roles to social and economic differentiation , specialization , inequality , and full - time leadership .
These characteristics are the essence of complexity , and they increase the costliness of any society .
In the progressivist view , surplus energy precedes and facilitates the evolution of complexity .
Certainly this is sometimes true :
There have been occasions when humans adopted energy sources of such great potential that , with further development and positive feedback , there followed great expansions in the numbers of humans and the wealth and complexity of societies .
These occasions have , however , been so rare that we designate them with terms signifying a new era : the Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution .
It is worth noting that these unusual transitions have not resulted from unbridled human creativity .
Rather , they emerged from solutions to problems of resource shortages , and were adopted reluctantly because initially they created diminishing returns on effort in peoples ’ daily lives .
Most of the time , cultural complexity increases from day - to - day efforts to solve problems .
Complexity that emerges in this way will usually appear before there is additional energy to support it .
Rather than following the availability of energy , cultural complexity often precedes it .
Complexity thus compels increases in resource production .
This understanding of the temporal relationship between complexity and resources has implications for sustainability that diverge from what is commonly assumed .
I will explore these implications shortly .
It is useful first to present a historical case study , the Western Roman Empire , that illustrates these points .
The Roman Empire collapsed in the mid 5th century A.D. , but its last 200 years of existence had been a reprieve .
It had been nearly destroyed in the 3rd century .
In the half - century from 235 - 284 the empire was repeatedly breached by invasions of Germanic peoples from the north and the Persians from the east .
When these invaders were not being repelled , Roman armies were fighting each other in the service of would - be emperors .
Many cities were sacked and productive lands devastated .
For a time , rival empires broke away in the east and the west .
It seemed that the Roman Empire would not survive much longer .
The Roman government had a clear sustainability goal : the survival of the empire .
In response to the crises , the emperors Diocletian and Constantine , in the late third and early fourth centuries , designed a government that was larger , more complex , and more highly organized .
They doubled the size of the army .
This was very costly .
To pay for this sustainability effort , the government taxed its citizens more heavily , conscripted their labor , and dictated their occupations .
With the rise in taxes , population could not recover from plagues in the second and third centuries .
There were chronic shortages of labor .
Marginal lands went out of cultivation .
Faced with taxes , peasants would abandon their lands and flee to the protection of a wealthy landowner .
The Roman Empire survived the 3rd century crisis and achieved two centuries of sustainability , but at the long - term cost of consuming its capital resources : producing lands and peasant population .
When crises emerged again in the late 4th century , the empire lacked the resources to respond adequately and in time collapsed .
The Roman Empire is a single case study in complexity and problem solving , but it is an important and representative one .
It illustrates the basic process by which societies increase in complexity .
Societies adopt increasing complexity to solve problems , becoming at the same time more costly .
In the normal course of economic evolution , this process at some point will produce diminishing returns .
Once diminishing returns set in , a problem - solving institution must either find new resources to continue the activity , or fund the activity by reducing the share of resources available to other economic sectors .
The latter is likely to produce economic contraction , popular discontent , and eventual collapse .
This was the fate of the Western Roman Empire .
This understanding of complexity and resources has implications for understanding sustainability .
Both popular and academic discourse commonly assume that ( a ) future sustainability requires that industrial societies consume a lower quantity of resources than is now the case , and ( b ) sustainability will result automatically if we do so .
Sustainability emerges , in this view , as a passive consequence of consuming less .
Thus sustainability efforts are commonly focused on reducing consumption through voluntary or enforced conservation , perhaps involving simplification , and / or through improvements in technical efficiencies .
The common perspective on sustainability follows logically from the progressivist view that resources precede and facilitate innovations that increase complexity .
Complexity , in this view , is voluntary .
Human societies become more complex by choice .
By this reasoning , we should be able to forego complexity and the resource consumption that it entails .
Progressivism leads to the notion that societies can deliberately reduce their use of resources and thereby achieve sustainability .
The fact that complexity and costliness increase through mundane problem solving suggests a different and startling conclusion : Contrary to what is typically advocated as the route to sustainability , it is usually not possible for a society to reduce its consumption of resources voluntarily over the long term .
To the contrary , as problems great and small inevitably arise , addressing these problems requires complexity and resource consumption to increase .
As illustrated by the Roman Empire and other cases , this has commonly been the case .
Many advocates of sustainability will find it disturbing that long - term conservation is not possible .
Naturally we must ask :
Are there alternatives to this process ?
Regrettably , no simple solutions are evident .
Consider some of the approaches commonly advocated :
1. Voluntarily Reduce Resource Consumption .
While this may work for a time , its longevity as a strategy is constrained by the fact that societies increase in complexity to solve problems .
Resource production must grow to fund the increased complexity .
To implement voluntary conservation long term would require that a society be either uniquely lucky in not being challenged by problems , or that it not address the problems that confront it .
2. Employ the Price Mechanism to Control Resource Consumption .
This is currently the laissez - faire strategy of industrialized nations .
Since humans do n’t commonly forego affordable consumption of desired goods and services , economists consider it more effective than voluntary conservation .
Both approaches , however , lead eventually to the same outcome :
As problems arise , resource consumption must increase at the societal level even if consumers as individuals purchase less .
3. Ration Resources .
Because of its unpopularity , rationing is possible in democracies only for clear , short - term emergencies .
This is illustrated by the reactions to rationing in England and the United States during World War II .
Moreover , rationed resources may become needed to solve societal problems , belying any attempt to conserve through rationing .
Something like this can be seen in the fiscal stimulus programs enacted recently .
4. Reduce Population .
While this would reduce aggregate resource consumption temporarily , as a long - term strategy it has the same fatal flaw : Problems will emerge that require solutions , and those solutions will compel resource production to grow .
5. Hope for Technological Solutions .
I sometimes call this a faith - based approach to our future .
Members of industrialized societies are socialized to believe that we can always find a technological solution to resource problems .
Technology , within the framework of this belief , will presumably allow us continually to reduce our resource consumption per unit of material well - being .
Conventional economics teaches that to bring this about we need only the price mechanism and unfettered markets .
The flaw here was pointed out by William Stanley Jevons :
As technological improvements reduce the cost of using a resource , total consumption will actually increase .
In conclusion , sustainability is not the achievement of stasis .
It is not a passive consequence of having fewer humans who consume more limited resources .
One must work at being sustainable .
The challenges that any society ( or other institution ) might confront are , for practical purposes , endless in number and infinite in variety .
This being so , sustainability is a matter of solving problems .
In the conventional view , complexity follows energy .
If so , then we should be able to forego complexity voluntarily and reduce our consumption of the resources that it requires .
This approach to sustainability implicitly sees the future as a condition of stasis with no challenges .
In actuality , major infusions of surplus energy are rare in human history .
More commonly , complexity increases in response to problems .
Complexity emerging through problem solving typically precedes the availability of energy , and compels increases in its production .
Complexity is not something that we can ordinarily choose to forego .
Applying this understanding leads to two conclusions .
The first is that the solutions commonly recommended to promote sustainability –conservation , simplification , pricing , and innovation–can do so only in the short term .
Secondly , long - term sustainability depends on solving major societal problems that will converge in coming decades , and this will require increasing complexity and energy production .
Sustainability is not a condition of stasis .
It is , rather , a process of continuous adaptation , of perpetually addressing new or ongoing problems and securing the resources to do so .
It is useful to think of sustainability in the metaphor of an athletic game :
It is possible to “ lose ” –that is , to become unsustainable , as happened to the Western Roman Empire .
But the converse does not hold .
Because we continually confront challenges , there is no point at which a society has “ won ” –become sustainable in perpetuity , or at least for a very long time .
Success , rather , consists of staying in the game .
Biofuel to be Made from Tuberculosis Bacteria
September 28th , 2009 by Bryan Nelson
A team of researchers at MIT are engineering a strain of bacteria , which is similar to the type that causes tuberculosis , to produce biofuel .
The researchers say that the bacteria are useful because they are hungry for a number of sugars and toxic compounds and produce lipids that can be converted to biodiesel .
[ social_buttons ]
The effort is part of a larger project at MIT to develop biofuels using synthetic biology .
In this case , the focus is on soil - dwelling Rhodococcus bacteria , since they are well known to eat a variety of toxic compounds .
Of course , they are also well known due to their similarity to the tuberculosis bacteria .
But unlike their deadly cousin , the strains being used to produce biofuel are n’t ones that are bad for you– unless you ’re a toxin .
In fact , researchers have already engineered strains that can feed on glycerol , a waste product of biodiesel production , and they ’ve created one strain that can eat a mix of two types of glucose and xylose .
Now that the basic chemistry and biology has been worked out , the researchers are focused on achieving the highest possible yields , which they ’ll be working on for two or three more years , according to the report .

The Federal Reserve should be abolished , " writes Ron Paul , " because it is immoral , unconstitutional , impractical , promotes bad economics , and undermines liberty . "
This is the thesis of Paul 's End the Fed , the Texas congressman 's case against the Federal Reserve .
The title was taken from a slogan that Paul heard chanted at various rallies and conventions , filling him with hope that monetary policy has become a subject worthy of popular protest .
Many people consider the Fed an " indispensable institution , " but few know what the central bank actually does .
For example , the Fed " can create trillions of dollars and distribute them to its cronies without congressional oversight , " writes Paul , a former GOP presidential candidate .
Creating an endless supply of money is the worst offense of the Fed , an institution that Paul believes is the root of many problems , including : • A monetary policy that benefits bankers , rather than the common man .
The 1910 meeting where the idea for the Federal Reserve was drafted involved bankers and government officials working in secrecy on Jekyll Island off the Georgia coast .
• Giving too - big - to - fail banks little reason to pursue efficiency because the Fed is there to save them in a crisis .
• Giving government a blank check with which to wage war .
When governments have to finance wars without central bank cash infusions , they 're forced to economize and end the conflict as soon as possible .
Instead , Paul argues , the government , backed by the Fed , is like " an irresponsible teenager with an unlimited line of credit . "
• Interfering with the ability of the free market to give accurate feedback to borrowers and lenders .
Artificially low interest rates can distort signals that borrowers use to assess risk , which can lead to false confidence and excessive use of capital .
• Creating " moral hazard " by rescuing companies .
The sense of responsibility for one 's own actions is removed , conditioning business to believe it can enjoy the rewards of the market , yet pass on the penalties to others .
• Fueling inflation by increasing the money supply without regard to the pace of economic growth , thus debasing the currency in much the same way that counterfeiting steals value from every dollar .
In Paul 's best - case scenario , the Fed would be dismantled .
With its demise , he argues , rationality would be restored to monetary policy .
With limits on the printing of money , inflation would halt , the dollar would keep its value , and banks and government would spend within their means .
In short , the federal government would have to raise money as states do , and face the same balanced - budget constraints .
Paul also envisions a return to the gold standard , which was abandoned in 1933 , and Americans being able to trade in gold and silver bullion .
Paul offers a cogent defense of his position .
Readers may question his desire to return to a gold standard , but Paul makes a strong case for sound monetary policy .
To Paul , the small steps toward sound policy begin with curtailing the power of the Federal Reserve .

( CNN ) --
For nearly 20 years Jennifer Schuett has held onto every memory of the night she was abducted from her bedroom , raped and left for dead .
Jennifer Schuett remembers small details of the night she was abducted , raped and her throat slashed at age 8 .
It was August 10 , 1990 .
Schuett was 8 years old and lived alone with her mother in the first floor of an apartment complex in Dickinson , Texas .
The bedroom windows faced the parking lot .
Investigators were never able to identify a suspect , but new DNA testing may change that .
CNN normally does not identify victims of sexual assaults .
But Schuett wants to go public with her story -- and her name -- to increase the chances of finding and prosecuting her attacker .
" It 's not about me anymore , " she explained .
" It 's about all the little girls that go to sleep at night .
I know there are so many girls out there who have been raped and hurt .
You have to fight back . "
For that , Schuett , 27 , is relying on her voice , her memory and advances in DNA testing .
" I remember everything ; I 've always wanted to remember everything , so I can find the person that did this , " Schuett told CNN during a phone interview .
" If I had blocked this out of my memory , the investigation would n't have come this far .
I 'm a fighter . "
Schuett says she was alone in her bed when a man came creeping in through the window .
She remembers waking up in a stranger 's arms as he carried her across a dark parking lot .
" When I opened my eyes , his face was the first thing I saw and he covered my face and mouth , " she said .
" He ran with me to his car .
He told me he was an undercover cop and that he knew my family .
He seemed calm -- not nervous , not aggressive . "
After they left the parking lot , he drove her through the streets of Dickinson , Texas , pulling into a mechanic shop next to her elementary school .
" Watch the moon .
The moon will change colors and that is when your mom will come to get you , " she recalled him saying .
" Oh , it looks like she is not coming . "
Schuett said he drove her to an overgrown field next to the school and raped her .
" He had a knife to my throat and touched my face and offered me Reese 's pieces , " she said .
" I was scared but I knew I could n't be fast enough to get away .
Cars would drive by but I could n't get away to get help . "
She believes she passed out .
" I woke up to him dragging me by my ankles , " she said .
" I felt thorns ripping the skin off my back .
I would see him turn to look at me and I would play dead . "
She passed out again , and awoke at daybreak .
" I remember feeling dew around me and I could n't figure out why when I screamed I could n't hear myself , " said Schuett .
She lay naked on top of an ant hill with her throat slashed from ear to ear , and her voice box torn .
Much later , she said , " I heard children playing hide and seek .
That is when one of the kids tripped over my foot , " said Schuett .
She was found at 6 p.m. on a hot August day .
She had been lying in the field for nearly 12 hours .
She was rushed to the hospital in critical condition .
" Three days after the attack , I started giving a description .
The doctors told me I would never be able to talk again , but I proved them all wrong , " said Schuett .
She believes she got her voice back so she could tell her story .
" I never wanted to play the victim role .
I wanted to be a strong survivor , " she said .
But the attack left its mark .
" For the first two years , I had nightmares and was scared , " she said .
" But I never wanted sympathy .
...
If I had given up , he would have won , and I wanted to show him : ' You did n't win . ' "
Shuettt said she is now " on a manhunt . "
Houston FBI Special Agent Richard Rennison is one of the lead investigators in the case , along with Dickinson police Detective Tim Cromie .
Both men were discussing the case , when Rennison received a memo from the FBI 's Child Abduction Rapid Deployment ( CARD )
Team , saying they were looking for cold child abduction cases that could be retested for DNA evidence .
The Schuett case was one of the cases selected .
Rennison , who has 10 years of experience in child abduction cases , said he has never seen a case like Schuett's .
" This is the only one that I can think of that the victim has suffered some traumatic injuries and survived , " he said , " The main reason the CARD team picked this case was because she was alive .
In cases of child abduction it is rare that the child is recovered alive .
Frequently you recover a body and most times you never find them . "
Schuett is a living witness who can help put the pieces together .
The investigators found evidence collected 19 years ago , which can be retested .
It includes the underwear and pajamas Schuett was wearing , as well as a man 's underwear and T - shirt , which were found in the field where Schuett was left for dead .
The clothes were tested in 1990 , but the sample was n't large enough for conclusive results .
But now , modern techniques allow DNA to be isolated from a single human cell .
Once they get back the DNA results -- " any time now , " Schuett said -- they will run them through the FBI 's criminal database and see if they get a match .
The FBI has also offered a $ 10,000 reward for information that could lead to a break in the case .
And last weekend Schuett appeared in " America 's Most Wanted , " which resulted in several leads from viewers who called in with information .
" Someone might remember something about that night , " Schuett said .
" Dickinson is a really small community .
Everybody knows everybody .
I know someone in town knows something . "

Once they were threatened by wildcat gold - miners and a measles epidemic that slashed their population to just 56 .
But now the Ikpeng , a proud tribe of Amazon warriors , say a new catastrophe looms over their future : the damming of the rivers they depend upon for food .
Across Brazil alarm bells are ringing over plans to build at least 229 small hydroelectric dams , known as PCHs , which the government hopes will generate electricity and drive economic development .
Opponents say they will damage the environment and destroy the livelihoods of thousands of Brazilian tribespeople .
There are 346 PCHs in Brazil , with another 70 under construction and 159 awaiting licences .
If the construction of dams continues , " the fish will run out and the waters will start to go down , " warned Komuru Txicao , a local tribesman .
" Here in the forest we do n't need electricity .
We need fish , water and land . "
Other hydroelectric projects planned by the government are huge — the $ 4bn Belo Monte dam further north along the Xingu river from Pavuru would be the third biggest plant of its kind on earth , producing over 11,000 megawatts of electricity .
While Belo Monte has been described by the government as a " gift from God " , critics say it will destroy lives , homes and traditions .
For Komuru and his neighbours , the immediate concern is the construction of a network of PCHs around the Xingu national park in Mato Grosso state .
Komuru fears the dams will block the tributaries of the Xingu , itself the largest tributary of the Amazon .
According to the National Electric Energy Agency ( Aneel ) , four PCHs – the Paranatinga II , Culuene , ARS and Ronuru – operate near the reserve ; another , Paranatinga I , is waiting for its licence .
Aneel says 13 PCHs are being built in Mato Grosso state , while another 19 projects are awaiting licences .
The government says such dams will help power the agricultural revolution that is sweeping Brazil 's mid-west and bring electricity to small towns .
Recent years have seen the Ikpeng , a proud tribe of Amazon warriors , embrace many of the comforts and distractions of the outside world .
Three months ago wireless internet was installed here in Pavuru , one of over 30 villages located in the Park — a vast , 2.8 million hectare indigenous reserve home to some 5,000 Indians from 14 different ethnic groups .
Today Ikpeng teenagers spend their afternoons downloading tracks by artists such as Enrique Iglesias and the US rapper 50 Cents while many of the tribe 's hunters use shot - guns rather than the traditional bow and arrow to hunt spider monkeys and wild - boar in the surrounding forests .
" Things are changing , " admitted Karane Txicao , 28 , sat behind an HP laptop in the village 's concrete internet cafe .
" Now people never leave the front of the computer screen . "
Several of the traditional huts – or owros – also shelter large television sets , powered by a diesel generation which is switched on at 9 am each day and turned off at 9 pm .
But unlike the telenovelas and MP3s , government plans for PCHs around the Xingu Park have met with a furious reception .
" It is very worrying , " said Kumare , a resident who is the local head of Funai , Brazil 's indigenous agency .
" This will directly affect us .
They are damming all of the rivers . "
Kumare said the dams would make it impossible for the fish to migrate upstream thus decimating the main source of food for the reserve 's Indians .
Last March the conflict escalated when eight staff from the electricity company responsible for one PCH spent five days held " hostage " near Pavuru .
They were released only after the president of Brazil 's indigenous agency , Funai , personally intervened .
" We did n't kill them , we ' arrested ' them , " recalled Komuru .
Similar battles are raging across the Amazon region , where plans to build roads , hydroelectric dams and other major infrastructure projects have triggered a conflict between those who want to protect the world 's largest tropical rainforest and its indigenous tribes and those wishing to drive development and relieve poverty .
A dispute over the Belo Monte dam turned violent in May when an engineer from the Brazilian power company Eletrobras was attacked during a presentation about the plant .
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has sought to allay fears over the dam , vowing that it " would not be shoved down anyone 's throat " .
But concerns grew in July when a federal court lifted an embargo on the Belo Monte licensing process , clearing the way for a bidding round later this year .
Having witnessed the Ikpeng 's plight in the 1960s , Melobo , an Ikpeng shaman , who says he is around 60 years old and wears 15 shell ear - rings in each ear , fears history may be repeating itself .
" The farmers ruin the Indian 's things , " Melobo said , in heavily accented Portuguese , standing on the banks of the Xingu river .
" They ruin the Indian 's water .
They ruin the Indian 's land . "
" We do n't want to negotiate , " added Komuru .
" We do n't want money .
We do n't want things that are worth nothing .
We want our land . "

An old adage states , " As California goes , so goes the nation . "
If that 's true , then advocates of textbook reform -- and college students bearing the brunt of spiraling textbook prices -- have to be excited by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's push to use digital textbooks in high schools .
So - called e-textbooks present a slew of advantages over their print brethren : they 're cheaper , easily searchable , and in some cases , can be modified to better fit the teacher 's vision for the course .
But while digital textbooks may have entered the public consciousness only recently , the idea has been around far longer .
A growing number of publishers -- both individuals and major textbook companies -- are offering their content digitally , in some cases for little or no charge .
" One big positive of free books is that it gets you out of the horribly exploitative textbook market , " wrote Fullerton College professor Ben Crowell in an e-mail .
" It 's just a scandal that they 're charging students as much as $ 250 for an organic chemistry book , and bringing out a new edition every three years in order to kill off the used book market . "
The Yale - educated physics professor began his digital textbook 12 years ago , when his lecture notes " gradually morphed " into a book .
His interest in the open - source operating system Linux convinced him that free was the way to go , and his textbook is available for anyone to use at www.lightandmatter.com.
More than 40 colleges and high schools have adopted the book , according to the Web site .
Crowell is n't alone .
He runs a site ( www.theassayer.org), which catalogues free books on everything from philosophy to military science .
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology makes much of its course materials , including textbooks and videos of lectures , available on its open courseware site ( ocw.mit.edu ) .
Professors at other prestigious institutions , such as the California Institute of Technology , have also written and released textbooks free of charge .
But the free digital textbook movement is n't restricted to a small band of altruistic authors -- some people want to make money .
Enter Flat World Knowledge , a two - year - old startup that lets users read its textbooks for free at www.flatworldknowledge.com .
Eric Frank and Jeff Shelstad , who have a combined 31 years of experience in the traditional publishing industry , started the company after becoming disillusioned with the business .
The trouble began in the 1980s , Frank said , when 60 - or - so textbook publishers competed to create the largest sales force .
After the companies consolidated into a few mega-publishers in the 1990s , the industry entered what Frank called a " nuclear arms race of supplements , " when companies competed to distinguish their products with extra materials like CD - ROMs .
The textbook companies passed on the costs of all that competition to consumers , Frank said .
Between 1986 and 2004 , textbook prices rose at double the rate of inflation , according to a study conducted by the U.S. Government Accountability Office .
Around the turn of the millennium , students were fed up , and with the growth of the Internet , able to find alternatives , Frank said .
A student in Florida could buy a used book from someone in Alaska .
Desperate to kill the used book market , publishers rushed out new edition after new edition , succeeding in the short term but driving textbook prices skyward , he said .
Amid the turmoil , Frank and Shelstad , both executives for Prentice Hall Business Publishing , found themselves on a train together .
" We looked at each other and said , ' Is anybody happy in this industry ? ...
Who are the constituents ?
Students , they hate us , ' " Frank recalled .
Their solution , to release digital textbooks online for free -- and sell the extras , such as print copies and study guides -- found a polarized response .
Some looked at Frank and Shelstad " like we had two heads , " Frank said .
Others asked , " Can I invest ? "
So far , the results have been promising , Frank said .
About 70 percent of the students who have used the site for class buy products , spending a little more than $ 30 each , he said .
About 40 percent paid around $ 40 for a printed black - and - white textbook with study aides , he said .
" There 's always a lot of student complaints about the cost of textbooks , especially in intro courses , " explained Robert Meeds , the chair of the communications department at Texas Tech University , which started using a Flat World Knowledge textbook in an introductory course this spring .
" That 's always something you 're aware of .
That does n't necessarily guide the decision . "
Clemson University psychology professor Fred Switzer said he appreciated the flexibility of the company 's e-books , which allow professors to rearrange or remove content as they see fit .
CourseSmart ( www.coursesmart.com) is a digital publisher with a more traditional business model .
Started as a collaboration among five major textbook publishers , the company says it offers e-textbooks for about half the cost of the print version .
After purchase , the digital textbooks are available for 180 days .
" While the industry is moving in ( the digital ) direction , the transition to digital textbooks will not happen overnight , and textbooks will continue to be offered in print format , " wrote Frank Lyman , executive vice president of CourseSmart , in an e-mail .
CourseSmart 's main advantage is volume .
The company offers more than 7,000 titles , compared to the 11 currently available on Flat World Knowledge 's Web site .
Lyman said sales were up 600 percent this year compared to last .
" I suspect that ( the free textbook model ) will increase and will be a good solution for a small segment of the market , " Lyman wrote .
" The primary problem with this model , however , is that it is hampered by the limited availability of content . "
The digital textbook movement may get a boost from new , more portable technology , such as the tiny laptops called netbooks and Amazon 's lightweight e-book reader known as the Kindle , which is as thin as a magazine but can hold thousands of volumes .
This spring , Amazon unveiled the Kindle DX , a new version of the reader with a larger display designed specifically for digital newspapers and textbooks .
Six schools will test the new device this fall for its possible use in the classroom .
" There 's a broad interest in whether ( digital textbook ) technology is about to get launched , " said Martin Ringle , chief technology officer at Reed College , one of the schools that will test the Kindle DX .
" A lot of the pieces have been around for several years , but there 's been pretty negative reaction from both teachers and students about content delivery and the tools for reading and utilizing the content .
We 're not sure that this is the breakthrough product , but Amazon has been pretty successful in the consumer market in terms of its content delivery . "
" We 're reaching that point where the cost of conventional textbooks has become so astronomical that anybody that provides any relief ... is going to be favorably received by the students , " he added .
Whether the nearly $ 500 Kindle DX will provide long - term savings remains to be seen .
A Kindle edition of an applied chemistry textbook costs $ 119 , compared to $ 134 for the hardcover print edition .
A Kindle toxicology textbook costs $ 92 , compared to $ 115 for the print edition .
Other obstacles to widespread adoption of e-textbooks remain .
A study conducted by a group of student public interest research groups found that 75 percent of students preferred printed textbooks , which could hinder the use of e-textbooks that limit printing , such as those offered by CourseSmart .
And the availability of Internet and computer access could complicate the introduction of e-textbooks in high schools .
In other cases , a lack of information could prevent students and teachers from using the digital textbooks that are already out there .
" Most people have absolutely no idea that there are hundreds and hundreds of high - quality , free textbooks on the Web , " Crowell wrote .

This is n’t exactly what BJ Penn needed with a title fight right around the corner .
A huge uproar has just begun over inflammatory comments Penn made during an interview with Kevin Iole of Yahoo .
Penn said he believes Georges St. Pierre uses steroids .
Penn said he believes St. Pierre uses steroids , though he concedes he has no proof .
St. Pierre is arguably the sport ’s most popular fighter and Penn knows that making such allegations is n’t going to win him any friends .
Penn , though , is n’t the type to be shy about offering his opinion though it may be unpopular .
“ It ’s just my opinion that he uses steroids , ” Penn said .
“ That ’s it .
My opinion .
I do believe it .
I ca n’t hand you any proof , but that ’s my opinion . ”
In an earlier conversation on the topic , Penn said , “ In my opinion , he does n’t play by the rules when it comes to steroids and growth hormones and that stuff .
Look at him .
He ’s the worst .
He looks like that every day .
That ’s cheating .
There is a reason why there are rules against using steroids .
The rest of us , we get fat , then we train and get skinny and the cycle goes over and over again .
He looks the same way all the time .
Come on . ”

" If you want to help poor people , restricting their options and opportunities is not the answer . "
Why are rich people rich while poor people are poor ?
Is it because governments fail to protect the poor with stringent standards on wages and workplace safety , or is it because of something else ?
In spite of the hue and cry of international organizations clamoring for more stringent labor standards , the real solution to global poverty is to increase economic freedom .
Instead of limiting the choices available to the global poor , we should be looking to expand them .
The International Labor Organization and other groups argue that the absence of international labor standards are barriers to the escape from poverty for the world 's poor .
Further , they argue that strict standards should be part of international aid efforts .
The problem , though , is that labor standards seek to address the effects of poverty rather than its causes .
They are also based on bad economics .
International labor standards are going to make things worse , rather than better , for the world 's poor .
If you want to help poor people , restricting their options and opportunities is not the answer .
In the internationally competitive global labor market , people earn wages equal to the value of their marginal products .
In other words , a unit of labor is worth what it can produce .
The proximate cause of low wages is low productivity .
The ultimate causes of low wages are institutional environments that stifle entrepreneurship and investment and in turn reduce productivity .
Sweatshop opponents criticize the use of child labor in developing countries and argue that these children should be in school rather than the labor market .
At current income levels , this simply is not feasible for many people .
In subsistence economies , many people do not have the luxury of diverting their attention away from manual agricultural labor and toward education .
The best way to fix this is not to mandate more stringent labor standards but to encourage economic growth .
This helps us reframe the question of global poverty .
Instead of looking for ways to make the labor market less efficient , which international standards would certainly do , we have to look for the specific institutional mechanisms by which opportunities are restricted .
A growing body of evidence suggests that economic freedom is essential to growth .
Critics of the working conditions in poor countries argue that the wages offered in so - called sweatshops are unacceptably low , and the working conditions wretched .
They likely are when we compare them to Western standards .
As economists have pointed out time and again , however , Western working conditions are not the relevant benchmark when we are talking about the quality of working conditions in the developed world .
The relevant comparison is the worker 's next best opportunity , which is always worse .
As economist David Henderson has argued , we do a worker no favors when we remove the best of a lot of very bad possible choices .
Opponents of sweatshops would make more headway by looking for ways to expand the options of sweatshop workers , especially by increasing mobility across national borders .
Relaxing restrictions on international labor mobility would substantially increase standards of living for the poor .
Progressives are enthusiastic about microfinance programs , and while these are probably a step in the right direction they are unlikely to fully alleviate poverty .
In a book available for free download , economist Lant Pritchett argues that the increase in earnings associated with a lifetime of access to microfinance programs is roughly equal to the increase in income associated with working in the United States for eight weeks .
This suggests that the appropriate policy is not to strengthen labor standards but to open borders and allow people to cross them freely .
While Congress is still in recess , it is relevant to remember that one of the most critical pieces of legislation , Ron Paul 's HR 1207 Bill is still waiting in the corridors , compliments of several individuals who for some reason or another are trying to do all they can to prevent a bill which has a guaranteed passage , with 282 co-sponsors , the second it goes to a vote .
And yet the heat is already rising in the Senate , with Bernie Sanders ' S. 604 Bill aka the " Federal Reserve Sunshine Act of 2009 " already receiving increasing endorsement .
At last count the bill had 23 co-sponsors , listed below :
John Barrasso [ R - WY ]

Fuck Vampires and Zombies : " Put a Bonnet On It ! "
Modern " Christian " fiction is a strange hybrid of bad and stupid .
Any fiction project with a transparent ulterior motive is difficult to take seriously , because if writers are forever bending their plots to an orthodox checklist , it automatically means that they will forget to let stories tell themselves or reveal unexpected truths .
Sitting down to write a story is an act of faith comparable to throwing yourself in front of a train to see what Heaven is like .
Any writers who cheat and speculate from a comfortable metaphysical bunker are difficult to trust .
Do n't get me wrong : some of the most voracious and intelligent readers I 've ever met have been devout fundamentalists .
They merely read classics ; work long verified as containing wisdom , truth , and beauty that transcends contemporary fads .
Or they obsess over the slide - whistle insanities of round - the - bend lunatics like Anne Rice , C.S. Lewis , and Orson Scott Card : writers who find validation for their own troubling preoccupations in Christianity ( in addition to finding a ready - made market for likeminded fetishists ) .
More often than not , however , Christian fiction is a watered - down knock - off of current best - selling formulas .
There are Christian vampire novels .
There are Christian techno - thrillers .
There are Christian bodice - rippers .
The " Left Behind " series is essentially a Christian " Harry Potter , " except " You - Know - Who " is literally the Antichrist .
There 's even Christian zombie fiction .
But none of this is to be trusted .
All of these genres are consolation prizes for fundamentalists who are starved to participate in the fun pop-culture sensations that they are denied by their church .
What does a fundamentalist know about technology or sexual exploration ?
But to write fundamentalists off as not " creative " is a mistake .
They are merely limited in their opportunities for expression ; not depth .
Some of the world 's most successful creative projects have been undertaken within strict limitations of code and creed .
And now , knock - offs aside , Christian fiction has finally found an original genre that actually works .
A genre that makes sense .
A format within which I would trust a fundamentalist to write a great novel .
The genre is called " Amish Fiction , " and ( Hosanna ! ) it is as big in some circles as an honest barn .*** From an AP article about the Christian fiction market " The undisputed industry leader is so - called Amish fiction Ã ¢ÂÂ " typically , romances and family sagas set in contemporary Amish communities .
They 're a surprise hit with evangelical women attracted by a simpler time , curiosity about cloistered communities and admiration for the strong , traditional faith of the Amish .
" The success of the genre has spawned not just new Amish fiction authors but spinoff series about other cloistered communities .
If you want to sell it , as one literary agent put it , put a bonnet on it .
" Amish fiction is exactly what I would tell a devout fundamentalist to write if they asked me for advice ( maybe we are stuck in an elevator for days ) .
Think about it : a closed and disciplined community of wholesome and sexless iconoclasts appeals to religious zealots so much that they have staked their entire existence on it .
Why not explore the subject in its most pure historical context ?
Why not figure out all the possibilities for human love and redemption that exist within a world without freedom or rights ?
Write what you know !*** Amish fiction was invented by an author named Beverly Lewis from Colorado , who wrote a book called " The Shunning " in 1997 which has sold over a million copies and has kick - started the genre .
She does n't just write about Amish women .
She writes about SASSY Amish women .
From the same AP article : " For every lineup of Amish women at a gathering of any kind , you 'll always see one of them that has her hand kind of on her hip , " said Lewis , who grew up a Pentecostal preacher 's daughter in Pennsylvania Amish country .
" That 's my character .
She 's the one that 's pushing boundaries .
" Do the Amish read Amish fiction ?
How accurate is it ?
What are the main preoccupations and conflicts ?
Are the characters as simple as their way of life ?
Are there Amish fiction stock characters ?
What " churns " beneath the surface of Amish life ?*** Here are the plots to some " Coming Soon " Amish fiction titles " THE MISSING , " by Beverly Lewis " Twenty - one - year - old Grace Byler longs to find her missing mother and to uncover the secret that drove her to leave them three weeks before .
Grace suspects the reason has to do with her father and his reserved , uncommunicative ways .
This conviction led Grace to break off her betrothal to her quiet , staid beau , and she is now resigned to remain single .
But when the young Amishman she thought was courting her best friend takes a sudden interest in her , Grace is befuddled and wonders if he can be trusted .
" Englisher " Heather Lang has come to Amish country to relive fond memories of her mother and to contemplate a grave medical prognosis of her own .
While in Bird - in - Hand , Heather meets Grace Byler and the two young women strike up a fast friendship , amazed by how well they click . " " LOVE FINDS YOU IN CHARM , OHIO , " by Birdie Etchson " Raised by Amish grandparents , Carly Berndt has always wondered about the parents she never met .
During her rumschpringa , she searches for clues to her identity .
Along the way she finds herself drawn to an Englisher whose lifestyle intrigues her and to a gentle Amish man .
In whose world does she belong ?
Will God make the answer clear ? "
" A COUSIN'S PROMISE , " by Wanda E. Brunstetter " When a horrific accident cripples Wayne Lambright , he finds it difficult enough to take care of himself , much less Loraine Miller , his future bride .
Will he sacrifice his happiness to give her a better life ?
Having already been jilted once , Loraine is terrified of yet another rejection .
But does she love Wayne enough to marry him , for better or worse ?
When her old boyfriend Jake Beechy returns from exploring the English world , he hopes Loraine will give him another chance .
How will God work to give Loraine the desires of her heart ? " " THE HANDMAID'S TALE , " by Margaret Atwood *** In these books , God is an immanent main character that is having a good time fucking with people 's lives .
This is the pure , unironic expression of postmodernism : the author has injected themselves into the worlds of their characters to shepherd them along and demand their love .
The men in these novels are all staid and decent .
They work hard and they ask for little .
The women are all plain and fierce .
They pray .
They hope for happiness .
It 's a strange genre , and not my cup of tea , but you must admit : it is truly CHRISTIAN .
These perverse narratives could not be written by a heathen nor Hindu .
They require the cold , white hand of a blue - blooded believer to see the light of day .
So if you are staring in the mirror this morning , popping some hangover aspirin , and asking God : " How the fuck am I going to get paid for writing in this lifetime ?
What the hell do I have to do to get some money from my misguided , rotten discipline ?
" Fuck vampires and zombies : " Put a bonnet on it ! "

Police and prison officials continue searching today for an inmate who used bedsheets to escape from a Galveston hospital Saturday night .
This is the third escape attempt for 21 - year - old Joshua Duane Barnes , sentenced to 35 years in prison on seven burglary charges , two charges of escape and one of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon .
Cime Stoppers today offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to Barnes ' capture .
He was last seen around 8:15 p.m. for a routine inmate count in his room at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice medical facility in Galveston .
About 15 minutes later , he was gone .
Officers reported finding a hole in the wall where a vent had been removed and several blankets were tied together , leading to the hospital 's roof .
Barnes went to the Galveston hospital for treatment on Wednesday after a fight in the TDCJ 's Ferguson Unit , 20 miles northwest of Huntsville , which left his face swollen and badly bruised .
He has escaped from custody twice in the past year , once from a Potter County courtroom where he faced burglary charges , and again from the Potter County Detention Center a few months later .
Both times he was found in an Amarillo hotel room , according to reports .
“ We 're continuing to canvas the area , ” said TDCJ spokesman Jason Clark .
“ We 've got a perimeter up and patrol officers searching and tracking dogs out following the scent .
Anyone with information about the case or Barnes ' whereabouts is urged to contact Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS or on line at www.crime-stoppers.org .
All tipsters remain anonymous .

A former Thai prime minister and foreign minister should be criminally prosecuted for endorsing Cambodia 's bid to have an ancient temple on their shared border listed as a world heritage site , a state agency ruled Tuesday .
The two countries have a longrunning territorial dispute over land surrounding the 11th - century Preah Vihear temple .
That dispute escalated this week as Cambodia 's Prime Minister Hun Sen warned that any Thai who illegally entered Cambodian territory would be shot .
Last week , several hundred members of a Thai nationalist group tried to force their way near the site , triggering clashes with police and residents inside Thailand that injured at least 17 people .
On Tuesday , Thailand 's National Anti-Corruption Commission said former Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej and former Foreign Minister Noppadon Pattama should be prosecuted for dereliction of duty and negligence .
It said a Cabinet resolution last year to endorse Cambodia 's listing of Preah Vihear as a UNESCO World Heritage Site was illegal because it was issued without consulting Parliament .
" As the head of government at the time , ( Samak ) should know that the matter was sensitive and likely to have both social consequences and legal consequences , " commission spokesman Klanarong Jantik said .
The commission will forward its findings to the state prosecutor 's office , which will decide whether to file charges .
Neither of the former officials was immediately available to comment on the ruling .
The World Court awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962 , but sovereignty over the surrounding land has never been clearly resolved .
Critics claim the Cabinet endorsement was tantamount to conceding the 4.6 square kilometers ( 1.8 square miles ) of land to Cambodia .
The Constitutional Court last year ruled that a joint communique Noppadon signed with Cambodia backing the UNESCO bid violated the constitution , and Thailand withdrew its endorsement .
However , the counter - corruption commission 's finding is likely to be seen by some as reflecting political bias , because it fits a pattern of rulings against supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who was toppled by a 2006 military coup after being accused of corruption and abuse of power .
Samak became prime minister after a pro-Thaksin political party won a December 2007 general election but was forced out of office when a court ruled that payment he received for hosting a TV cooking show constituted an illegal conflict of interest .
If web design is the heart of website success , we can term SEO as the brain of website success .
Normally , a website comes for optimization once the design part gets completed .
At this point , the website is raw , without any SEO stuff .
The burden of optimization worsens things for both SEOs and designers .
SEOs need to optimize the visually - compelling website .
Designers need to make phenomenal modifications in it to achieve higher ranking in SERPs .
To avoid all these circumstances , it is better if SEO and design get married in the initial phases itself .
Better if they evolve together into a well - optimized and well - designed website .
SEO is not an old snake oil with stereotypical strategies or straitjacket methodologies .
It is a fast growing , ever - changing ‘ happening ’ field in the world wide web .
Search Engine ranking algorithms change every now and then so much so that one can easily forget about meta tag optimization , keyword stuffing etc .
In such a state of flux , does Link , Design and Content deliver any value to a website ?
If they do , should web design and SEO work together to achieve this ?
The answer is a big YES !
Make Links Carry Value
No more “ click here ” and “ learn more ” links will be seen in a website if SEOs and Designers work together .
When we try to go with terms like “ click here ” and “ learn more ” for making a clickable anchor text , we lose vital keyword rich anchor texts in internal navigation / internal linking .
Make Design Deliver Value
The word “ Link Baiting ” is not for SEO territory alone .
It can even be used by designers .
Websites with great design can easily catch people ’s attention and would gain more backlinks from bloggers .
On the other hand , you can design a great site , validate with CSS , submit to CSS galleries and gain even more link backs .
Make Content Speak Value
Make search engine bots read your content much earlier .
This can be done using ” source ordered content ” which incorporates placing content as close to the beginning of the page as possible and using CSS to display page elements where they “ belong ” .
It allows you to give prominence to keyword - optimized sections of your site and thus helps you achieve better rankings for optimized keywords .
Last but not the least , let ’s finish up with the footer part .
Footer Not Only to Rest :
Create a compelling footer .
Designers , do n’t forget to leave your link .
SEOs do n’t forget to include your keywords !
For instance , instead of going for site created by “ Dot Com Infoway ” you can go with Site Created by “ Dot Com Infoway – Web Design Company ” .
Once you design a few sites with your keyword - rich attribution links , change the wording .
It does n’t need to be drastically different , but make some variations .
Do this periodically .
Simple things can help us achieve bigger targets .
Though the above tips do not show the way to any phenomenal SEO or design strategy , they sure will help you create a well - optimized website with near - perfect SEO and design elements .
The first time I saw in detail the way a fully automatic weapon worked - using the power generated by the energy of the last round to expel the spent cartridge , re-cock the hammer and fire off another round - I was absolutely enthralled .
It seemed like such an amazing combination of engineering and ingenuity that the idea that someone could " invent " something like that was incredible bordering on magical .
The truth of course is that no one person did invent everything that went into creating an automatic weapon .
Mankind 's need to kill things as efficiently as possible worked over time as incredibly strong market force pushing invention and innovation forward in the field .
The reason that a fully automatic weapon seemed so amazing to me is that it most likely incorporated a couple dozen or more " Aha ! " moments by the greatest thinkers in the field , combined with a significant amount of engineering and trial and error to get everything to work just so ( and most likely more than a couple of exploded barrels ) .
But the fact of the matter is that no amount of rote engineering would get you there .
You need individuals with the right amount of knowledge and experience applying themselves to difficult problems to get innovate solutions that advance the field .
Something designed by the world 's greatest " Software Architect " , providing UML diagrams that look like works of art , can still quite easily end up being a dud when it 's implemented .
Because of the term " Software Engineering " - many people often assume that software development is simply the application of a set of principles and code patterns to a problem to come up with a working solution , like doing the calculations to build a road .
In a nutshell , a common belief is that the smart , higher paid software architects generate some UML diagrams and then pass those off to the code monkeys to bash their fingers against the keyboard and output the necessary code .
Throw in some unit and integration testing at the end and there you have it - freshly engineered software .
I 'd love to say that belief and method of operating is a lie , but it 's not .
It 's definitely possible to develop software this way and lots of company 's do it .
Lots of them also fail horribly
There is a reason that despite the proliferation of code generation tools and the buzz about off - shoring there is a still a very strong market for us code monkeys .
As it turns out - implementation matters , and it can matter a lot .
In cases where software is going to grow , change hands and live a life of it's own after the first deployment there are significant benefits to having well written code : it 's easier to understand what 's happening , it 's easier to change , it 's easier not to completely bork some other system down the line .
Something designed by the world 's greatest " Software Architect " , providing UML diagrams that look like works of art , can still quite easily end up being a dud when it 's implemented .
Two carpenters each building a cabinet based on the same design can end up with products of widely varying quality .
While at the most basic level ( sure , they both hold dishes ) , it 's quite possible one cabinet might feel like a rock - solid heirloom piece of furniture and one that seems like it might be ready to fly apart from a cross - breeze .
Anyone who 's been in the software industry for a couple years has most likely seen the same thing .
One piece of custom software in the company is rock solid , it 's easy to add bits to and take parts away from without worrying about the whole thing falling to pieces .
Other custom software is less stable , however , and programmers try to whisper magical incantations over it in the hope that the two line change they just made wo n't end up frying the mainframe .
To cast a sad aspersion against the software industry - I 'd bet that in down times good programmers are more likely to get laid off than bad ones simply because the bad ones have such left such a destructive wake of spaghetti code behind them that no one but them knows what to do with it .
Think about that - the worse you are the better your job security .
What other industry has that depressing feature ?
Software developers , at least those who live , eat and breathe software development are the same - by some accounts more than an order of magnitude better than their less engaged peers .
To go back to the cabinets from a few of paragraphs previous - the reason we call finish carpentry a craft and carpenters craftsmen is because the good ones , those that have the knowledge , experience and commitment to do good work do it a heck of a lot better than those who do n't .
Software developers , at least those who live , eat and breathe software development are the same - by some accounts well over an order of magnitude better than their less skillful and engaged peers .
Of course on the flip side , you do n't always need a craftsman - if you run a cheap chair factory the last thing you want is someone who cares too much about what 's coming off of the assembly line .
The software your company is developing might be the same thing , and it might just not be worth spending the money to do it right .
A couple of off - shore programmers fed with a few pages of UML diagrams might do just the trick , and that 's fine .
Just like IKEA is making buckets of money selling cabinets that are n't heirlooms , your company can probably do the same with some barely passable software and save a few bucks .
A word of warning though - when that project is months behind schedule and looks like it might not get done because things that worked last week are no longer working , that savings might not look quite as good .
The temptation from the MBA set is to believe that all it takes is itheir great idea and a quick - and - dirty implementation by the lowest bidder and the $ $$ will start rolling in .
The reality is that no one gets it right the first time , and if , when it 's time to implement all those small tweaks that take the great idea and turn it into a great product , your codebase is falling apart - the value of having paid for or not having paid for a solid implementation will be pretty clear .
As we write this article the first tropical storms of the season have formed In the Atlantic basin and Gulf of Mexico .
The latest forecast from the Colorado State University ( CSU ) for this year 's tropical storm season authored by lead scientists Dr. Phillip Klotzback and Dr. William Gray of the Department of Atmospheric Science shows another reduction from their prior forecasts .
The team now looks for a total of 10 tropical storms with only four becoming hurricanes and two of them significant hurricanes ( Category 3 , 4 or 5 ) .
The official forecast says they " anticipate a below - average Atlantic basin tropical cyclone season in 2009 , " which is attributed to the development of El Niño in the Pacific Ocean .
The new forecast also anticipates below - average probabilities for major hurricane landfalls on the U.S. coastline and in the Caribbean .
As the El Niño phenomenon developed this year , the CSU forecasters pointed out the potential for its dampening effect on tropical storm formation when issuing earlier forecasts .
The CSU team has been gradually reducing its projected number of storms by category and the corresponding number of storm days .
With reduced expectations for the number of storms this season , especially since two of the storm season 's six months have passed with no storms , the probabilities of major hurricane landfalls have also declined , but by a smaller reduction than the number of storms since projecting a storm 's path before it forms is difficult .
As we all know , it only takes one storm making landfall , and it does n't have to be among the strongest storms , to cause loss of life and extensive damage while creating extreme chaos .
Despite the challenge of predicting landfalls , the CSU forecasters have been issuing probability forecasts for a few years for each of the 11 coastal regions of the United States and 205 coastal and near - coastal counties from Brownsville , Texas , to Eastport , Maine .
The team believes developing better landfalling forecasts is an important benefit of their work since it allows earlier and presumably better storm preparation .
In the current forecast , for the first time , the CSU team prepared landfall probabilities for the 18 coastal states using data from 1856 - 2008 .
They have also prepared landfall probabilities for the Mid- Atlantic and Northeast U.S. regional groupings of states .
The CSU forecasters showed how the historical landfall probability for both hurricanes and major hurricanes for selected states and regions is reduced by the formation of El Niño .
One of the interesting phenomenons impacting the formation of hurricanes appears to be the relative warmth of the Atlantic basin coupled with the strength of El Niño .
From May to July , the tropical Atlantic has warmed by 0.25-0.5°C .
Despite this warming , the Atlantic remains slightly cooler than the 1995 - 2008 average .
What also has been learned from the historical data is that the ratio of named storms forming south of 23.5 °N and east of 75 °W with
storms forming north of 25 °N changes considerably between neutral and La Niña years to El Niño years .
The CSU forecasters have determined that from 1950 - 2008 , approximately 45 % of all storms form north of 25 °N in a La Niña year or a neutral year compared to 60 % of all storms forming north of 25 °N in El Niño years .
The CSU report contained a chart showing the number of storms and their tracks below that cut - off in the six warmest El Niño years and the six coldest La Niña years .
The ratio between the aggregate numbers of storm days during La Niña years to those in El Niño years is 4.1:1 , a significant difference .
Based on this data and the CSU team 's assessment of the future weather patterns that will be in existence during the mid-August to mid-October period , it believes conditions facilitating the formation of Atlantic basin hurricanes will be moderated .
The other forecasting change the CSU team has introduced is a twoweek forecast rather than its traditional monthly forecast .
We assume this change is an attempt to be timelier in its forecasting than it has been in the past .
Shortly after issuing the revised 2009 hurricane seasonal forecast , the CSU team issued a forecast of the August 6 - 20 period .
The team believes this will be a below average period compared to the historical data for 1950 - 2000 .
The team 's forecast is backed additionally by a chart from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) showing the current forecast period compared to the climatology record , which shows storm activity traditionally picking up in early August .
Activity peaks in early September but continues strong until the latter part of October .
While we can take some comfort in the revised CSU forecasting team 's outlook for a below - average storm season , the fact we are just entering the peak seasonal storm period should be a reminder to be on your guard and ready for action .
This is the latest formation of the first storm .
In 1992 , the first storm developed late in the season .
It was Hurricane Andrew that devastated south Florida .

PHOTO COURTESY ALBEMARLE CHARLOTTESVILLE
REGIONAL JAIL
Elisha Strom sat in jail for a month for publishing the address of a Jefferson Area Drug Enforcement officer .
Now the American Civil Liberties Union is offering its assistance in the case .
" This is a classic free speech issue , " says Kent Willis , ACLU of Virginia executive director .
" Ms. Strom has taken information that 's publicly available and put it on a website .
A federal court has already struck down as unconstitutional a nearly identical law in Washington . "
Strom was arrested July 16 for publishing the address and home photos of one of JADE 's officers on her blog , i HeArTE JADE .
She 's tracked the activities of the drug task force since October 2008 , published photos of them at work and given them nicknames like " Porn Star , " " Longhead " and " Pringle . "
She was charged under Virginia code § 18.2 - 186.4 that prohibits publication of law - enforcement officers ’ addresses or photographs with the “ intent to coerce , intimidate , or harass . ”
She was arrested by Special Agent Jason Trent with the State Police 's Bureau of Criminal Investigations , who did not immediately return a reporter 's phone call .
Strom disputes that her blog harasses cops , and the ACLU agrees .
She has n't decided whether to accept the ACLU 's offer of assistance , which could be legal representation or an amicus brief .
" I 'd be interested in talking to them , " she says from her home in Bedford County .
" The only thing I 'd worry about is making JADE mad . "
While she says she does n't feel threatened by the drug task force , she does feel intimidated .
" They 're already upset with me , " she says .
" I do n't want to end up with 40 new charges because I 'm getting support . "
Strom has said her interest in JADE stems from the arrest and trial of her estranged husband , white separatist leader Kevin Strom , who was charged with child porn possession , enticement of a minor and intimidation of a witness after Elisha found him masturbating in front of a photo of young girls .
An investigator on the case also works for JADE .
The enticement and intimidation charges were thrown out of federal court in October 2007 .
Kevin Strom blamed the charges on " false accusations " by Elisha , but pleaded guilty to one count of child porn possession in January 2008 and served 23 months in prison .
Elisha Strom was released on $ 7,500 bond August 13 and is scheduled to appear in Albemarle General District Court September 17 .
And the i HeArTE JADE blog is still up .
" I 'm not allowed to use a computer , " says Strom .
" It 's not active– but it went from hundreds of viewers a week to thousands a day . "
Correction :
The court in which Strom will appear was misidentified in the original story and has been corrected .
Since then he has been caught by more than 60 anglers from across the world who travelled to Bluebells Lakes for a shot at landing the ' King of Common Carps ' .
RIVERSIDE , Calif . –
How fast can evolution take place ?
In just a few years , according to a new study on guppies led by UC Riverside 's Swanne Gordon , a graduate student in biology .
Gordon and her colleagues studied guppies — small fresh - water fish biologists have studied for long — from the Yarra River , Trinidad .
They introduced the guppies into the nearby Damier River , in a section above a barrier waterfall that excluded all predators .
The guppies and their descendents also colonized the lower portion of the stream , below the barrier waterfall , that contained natural predators .
Eight years later ( less than 30 guppy generations ) , the researchers found that the guppies in the low - predation environment above the barrier waterfall had adapted to their new environment by producing larger and fewer offspring with each reproductive cycle .
No such adaptation was seen in the guppies that colonized the high - predation environment below the barrier waterfall .
" High - predation females invest more resources into current reproduction because a high rate of mortality , driven by predators , means these females may not get another chance to reproduce , " explained Gordon , who works in the lab of David Reznick , a professor of biology .
" Low - predation females , on the other hand , produce larger embryos because the larger babies are more competitive in the resource - limited environments typical of low - predation sites .
Moreover , low - predation females produce fewer embryos not only because they have larger embryos but also because they invest fewer resources in current reproduction . "
Study results appear in the July issue of The American Naturalist .
Natural guppy populations can be divided into two basic types .
High - predation populations are usually found in the downstream reaches of rivers , where they coexist with predatory fishes that have strong effects on guppy demographics .
Low - predation populations are typically found in upstream tributaries above barrier waterfalls , where strong predatory fishes are absent .
Researchers have found that this broad contrast in predation regime has driven the evolution of many adaptive differences between the two guppy types in color , morphology , behavior , and life history .
Gordon 's research team performed a second experiment to measure how well adapted to survival the new population of guppies were .
To this end , they introduced two new sets of guppies , one from a portion of the Yarra River that contained predators and one from a predator - free tributary to the Yarra River into the high - and low - predation environments in the Damier River .
They found that the resident , locally adapted guppies were significantly more likely to survive a four - week time period than the guppies from the two sites on the Yarra River .
This was especially true for juveniles .
The adapted population of juveniles showed a 54 - 59 percent increase in survival rate compared to their counterparts from the newly introduced group .

It will feature him competing against other athletes at their own sports .
In this video , shot on a cell phone camera , the mismatch between Shaq and Mr. De La Hoya is obvious from the start .
Despite the boxer 's advantage in terms of skill and experience , the physics simply works against him ...
OK , its like watching a midget box a polar bear .
Its ridiculous .
I do n't know if De La Hoya can even reach Shaq 's face .
And Shaq is a lot faster than I would have imagined .

If the moon ’s water could be collected , lunar astronauts could use it as drinking water and split it into oxygen and hydrogen to make rocket fuel for their return journeys to Earth ( Image : NASA )
Newly confirmed water on the moon could help sustain lunar astronauts and even propel missions to Mars , if harvesting it can be made practical .
A microwave device being developed by NASA could do just that .
Three spacecraft – India ’s Chandrayaan - 1 and NASA ’s Cassini and Deep Impact probes – have detected the absorption of infrared light at a wavelength that indicates the presence of either water or hydroxyl , a molecule made up of a hydrogen and an oxygen atom .
All found the signature to be stronger at the poles than at lower latitudes .
Some of these molecules may be created continuously when solar wind protons – hydrogen ions – bind to oxygen atoms in the lunar soil .
Comet impacts may also have brought water to the moon .

Water delivered by comets or generated by the solar wind could randomly diffuse over time into permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles , which were recently measured to be colder than Pluto .
“ Once it gets in there , it ’s not going to come out , ” says Carle Pieters of Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island , lead scientist for the NASA - built instrument that made the Chandrayaan - 1 measurements .
‘ Railroad to space ’
So far , the water does not appear to be very abundant – a baseball - field - sized swathe of lunar soil might yield only “ a nice glass of water ” , Pieters told New Scientist .
But if it could be harvested , lunar astronauts could use it as drinking water and split it into oxygen and hydrogen to make rocket fuel for their return journeys .
That would slash launch costs , since it would reduce the amount of fuel they would need to lug with them from Earth .
Rocket fuel produced on the moon might even help mount a human mission to Mars .
Because of the moon ’s weaker gravity , it would take less energy to loft fuel into space for a Mars mission from the lunar surface than it would from Earth .
“ It completely changes the spaceflight paradigm , ” says Paul Spudis of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston , Texas .
“ It ’s like building a transcontinental railroad to space . ”
Cold plate
But how do you extract water that is likely locked up as small concentrations of ice in the lunar soil ?
Microwaves could provide the key , according to work by Edwin Ethridge of NASA ’s Marshall Space Flight Center and William Kaukler of the University of Alabama , both in Huntsville , who first demonstrated the technique in 2006 .
They used an ordinary microwave oven to zap simulated lunar soil that had been cooled to moon - like temperatures of - 150 °C .
Keeping the soil in a vacuum to simulate lunar conditions , they found that heating it to just - 50 °C with microwaves made the water ice sublimate , or transform directly from solid to vapour .
The vapour then diffused out from higher - pressure pores in the soil to the low - pressure vacuum above .
On the moon , the vapour could be collected by holding a cold metal plate above the soil .
The rising water vapour would then condense as frost onto the cold plate and “ you could scrape it off ” , Kaukler says .
Baking and processing dry lunar soil at high temperatures could also release oxygen and hydrogen for rocket fuel or other uses .
But that would take about 100 times as much energy as extracting them from native lunar water , Spudis says : “ Everything becomes easier and cheaper and quicker . ”
[ WARNING : This list contains graphic images ]
In the last several years thanks to the advancement of medical equipment and improved microsurgery techniques the success rate for limb reattachment surgeries has improved dramatically compared to when it was fist performed successfully almost 50 years ago .
This list includes some of the more interesting and dramatic reattachments of body parts due to accidents and assaults .
( This is not to be confused with the recent success of transplanting body parts from donors . )
According to what I have read if you wish to help someone in this situation the best course of action is to wrap the digit or limb in wet paper towels , then wrap it in plastic , and then pack it in ice .
Remember : save the patient , save time and save the limb .
10 Everett Knowles Right Arm Reattachment
This was the first successful reattachment of a human limb .
In 1962 , 12 year old Everett Knowles was trying to hop a freight train in Somerville , Massachusetts and was thrown against a stone wall ripping his right arm off cleanly at the shoulder .
Knowles walked away from the tracks using his left hand to hold his right arm inside a bloody sleeve and was then rushed to the emergency - room .
Chief surgical , Dr. Ronald Malt immediately assembled a team of experts he would need .
After hours of surgery the doctors reconnected the blood vessels , pinned the arm bone together , and grafted skin and muscle together .
After the boys hand turned pink and a pulse returned to the wrist doctors reattached four major nerve trunks .
After four years of recovery , Knowles had the same use of his right arm and hand as a natural lefty .
He eventually drove a six - wheel truck and lifted sides of beef at his job .
Interesting Fact : After the accident Everett became a celebrity of sorts .
He was interviewed repeatedly and received letters and souvenirs from major league baseball players and astronauts , even a fan club was formed .
9 Kaitlyn Lasitter Right Foot Reattachment
Teenager Kaitlyn Lasitte made international news in 2007 after her accident at an amusement park .
The accident occurred while she was riding the Superman Tower of Power at Six Flags Kentucky .
During the ride a cable snapped and wrapped around both of her legs and severed both feet .
In a recent deposition Kaitlyn said she remembers something hard hitting her in the head before the ride plunged and then felt “ yanked ” from her seat before being restrained by her safety belt .
Then she remembers feeling like she was on fire and smelling burning flesh .
Doctors were able to reattach her right foot , but unfortunately were not able to reattach her left foot and had to have some of her left leg amputated below the knee .
Interesting Fact : Kaitlyn ’s medical bills total in the hundreds of thousands of dollars .
The doctors and hospitals have agreed to wait for payment until the family ’s case against the theme park is resolved .
8 Arsenio Matias Both Hands Reattached
In 2005 at a factory in North Bay Shore New York , Arsenio Matias was operating a vacuum form machine which presses plastic into parts for store displays .
Suddenly something went wrong and the machine cut both of his hands off at the wrists .
Matias looked down to see blood gushing from his wrists and both of his hands lying on the floor beside the machine he had just been operating .
After the accident coworkers put him in a chair and told him to raise his arms over his head to slow the bleeding .
Two other coworkers tied their belts around his arms and others ran to a nearby store to get ice to store his hands in .
A County police helicopter then airlifted him to University Hospital .
Four weeks after the complex reconstructive microsurgery he was able to leave the hospital .
Matias then faced about a year of rehabilitation including exercises to regain strength in his hands and increase his range of motion .
Interesting Fact : The Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited the company for 17 alleged serious violations , including limited training for employees and periodic servicing of manufacturing machinery and six other violations .
7 Yang Chiung-ming and Chen Ming - kuo 2 left arms reattached
This often is mistaken as an urban legend but it really happened .
In 1997 there was a mass tug - of - war contest along the Keelung River in Taipei in celebration of Retrocession Day .
Over 1600 participants joined in the contest .
The largest man in each group stood at the very front of each team .
The contest began and both teams of about 800 people each started pulling as hard as they could .
Unfortunately the large nylon rope was rated for less than half of the total force they were exerting on it .
Suddenly the center of the nylon rope snapped and the force caused the rope to rebound and tear off the left arm of the two men at the front of each group .
The victims were taken to Mackay Memorial Hospital and underwent seven hours of microsurgery to reattach their arms .
Interesting Fact :
Many reports claim the men had their arms wrapped around the rope but the severing of the limbs was caused by sheer rebounding force of the broken rope ripping off the men ’s arms .
6 Paul Gibbs Left Ear Reattachment
In 2008 Paul Gibbs a 26 - year - old student from Leeds was camping out with a group of friends when he was attacked by three men .
He suffered brain damage when he was hit over the head with a motorbike helmet before his left ear was sliced off .
Because his ear was not found until 17 hours after the attack the surgeons stitched it inside Gibbs stomach so some of the tissue will re-grow .
The plan is to later reconstruct the ear using some of the cartilage from his ribcage and eventually reattach his ear .
Interesting Fact : Ear reconstruction has been dated as far back as 600 BC in India when doctors were reported to have used skin from other parts of the body to reconstruct ear lobes .
5 Garrett La Fever Big Toe Reattached as a Thumb
After losing his thumb in a 2007 woodworking accident Garrett La Fever made the decision to have surgeons remove the big toe on his right foot and reattach it onto his right hand to use as a thumb .
In a six - hour surgery at Saint Mary ’s Pros Center in San Francisco , the director of microsurgery , and plastic surgeon worked in tandem to remove Garret ’s toe and reattach it where his thumb once was .
The operation involved disconnecting then reattaching blood vessels , nerves tendons and bone .
Less than two months after the surgery Garrett could easily sign his name and button his clothes .
His second toe on his right foot eventfully compensated and deviated toward that side which created a more symmetric foot .
Interesting Fact :
Toe - to - thumb surgery is nothing new ; the first successful operation was reported in 1969 .
The thumb is responsible for 40 percent of the function of the hand which is why doctors recommend this type of procedure after loosing a thumb .
4 Veterinarian Chang Po-yu Left Forearm Reattachment
When I first saw the photo above I thought for sure it was photo shopped but unfortunately for Chang Po - yu it is not .
In 2007 at the Shaoshan Zoo , Chang was removing tranquilizer darts before treating a Nile croc which had not been eating for a month .
Chang , had failed to notice that the crock had not yet been fully anaesthetized and as he put his arm through bars of the crocodile ’s cage the croc bit the Veterinarian forearm off .
After Chang was rushed to the hospital a zoo employee launched a battle to retrieve his arm by shooting two bullets at the crocodile .
Although the bullets failed to penetrate the crocodile ’s hide , it was stunned enough to cause it to drop the arm .
Chang ’s arm was then rushed to the hospital where it was reattached after 5 hours of surgery .
Interesting Fact : The Nile croc is the largest African crocodile species .
The croc can reach 16 feet ( 5 meters ) in length and are estimated to kill 200 people a year .
3 Emily Stinnett Scalp Reattachment
In 2004 , four year old Emily Stinnett and another girl were playing in the back yard on the swings when a pit bull broke free from its chain and bit Emily on her head and then dragged her around the yard .
The dog ended up ripping off huge chunks of her scalp .
After Emily was rushed to Kosair Children ’s Hospital in Louisville a deputy sheriff shot and killed the out - of - control dog .
The Doctors told the sheriff that in order for the child to survive they needed to find the rest of her scalp .
A search around the backyard yielded nothing .
Then after it was realized that the dog consumed parts of the scalp the dog ’s stomach was cut opened and the scalp was located and rushed to the hospital .
Doctors were able to reattach the majority of Emily ’s scalp but unfortunately some of the scalp pieces later died even after leech therapy .
Emily survived and faced a series of painful skin grafts .
Interesting Fact : Leeches ( mentioned above ) are now used in microsurgery to stimulate circulation in reattachment operations for organs with critical blood flow , such as eye lids , fingers , ears and in Emily ’s case the scalp .
2 Kim Tran ’ unidentified boy friend Penis Reattachment
I knew if I did n’t include at least one penis reattachment on this list there would be great disappointment .
During my severed penis reattachment research I came across several cases but this one has to take the cake .
In 2005 in Anchorage Alaska a 44 year old unidentified man was breaking up with his girlfriend Kim Tran .
An argument ensued , however at some point around midnight they decided to have sex and the man allowed his girlfriend to tie his arms to the window handle above the bed .
She then took a kitchen knife and severed the man ’s penis .
Tran then flushed the penis down the toilet , untied the man and drove him to the hospital .
After finding a nurse Tran said she was leaving to move her car but drove home instead .
Police rushed to the home and found her cleaning up the bloody scene .
Police were able to get the details about what had happened to the penis and summoned the Anchorage utility company .
Lifting the toilet from the base the workers tipped it into the tub and the penis fell out .
It had been lodged in the “ S ” curve of the toilet for more than two hours .
Officials put it on ice and drove it to the emergency room .
At around 6 AM , about six hours after the knife attack , hospital officials said the surgery was successful .
Interesting Fact : Dr. Sarah Troxel who went through training for microsurgery at Stanford and also performed this surgery said .
“ I ’d say it ’s more likely that it might not work very well . ”
I think it seemed kind of appropriate that since a woman cut off the penis it was only fair that another woman should sew it back on .
1 Sandeep Kaur Face Reattachment
This is truly an incredible story and is what inspired the list .
In 1994 nine year old Sandeep Kaur from India had her face and scalp completely amputated from a threshing machine .
The machine caught one of Sandeep ’s braids causing her head to be pulled in .
Sandeep ’s mother , who witnessed the accident , said : “ I did n’t know where her face was .
Everything was peeled off . ”
Abraham Thomas , one of India ’s top microsurgeons was on duty when Sandeep arrived at the hospital unconscious with her face in two pieces in a plastic bag .
The surgeon managed to reattach Sandeep ’s face back onto her skull and reconnect the arteries .
The above picture shows Sandeeps face right before it was reattached and Sandeep at age 19 , ten years after the accident .
Sandeep is now training to become a nurse .
Interesting Fact : Sandeep Kaur ’s groundbreaking surgery also inspired the recent face transplant procedures from donors .
+ Israel Sarrio Left Arm Reattachment
This is another groundbreaking , first time ever surgery .
In 2004 , 25 year old truck driver Israel Sarrio had his lower arm torn off in a traffic accident .
Doctors in Valencia Spain reattached the arm but the stump became infected .
To save the arm the surgeons re-amputated the arm and attached it to the patient ’s groin .
This kept the limb alive by feeding it blood through its veins and arteries while doctors worked to cure the infection .
The arm remained on the groin for nine days before it was reattached to the stump which had recovered from the infection .

Brisbane City Council will place two portable urinals for men at a Valley cab rank as its sole response to claims a shortfall of amenities in the area is leading drunk clubbers to relieve themselves in shops .
Portaloos will not be provided , despite calls from a local business , while women will have to continue using the five unisex public toilets currently available .
Hall of shame ... alleged offenders are listed on a shop wall , left , while two youngsters are caught relieving themselves at a convenience store .
AnDong Zhu , from the Valley Mall 's Lucky 7 convenience store , told brisbanetimes.com.au yesterday of men and women urinating in aisles because they could not find public toilets , found them engaged or simply refused to use them .
However , this was rejected by Councillor Jane Prentice .
Apollo 14 : Science instruments ( circled left ) and the lunar module descent stage ( circled right ) are connected by a footprint trail
A US spacecraft has captured images of Apollo landing sites on the Moon , revealing hardware and a trail of footprints left on the lunar surface .
The release of the images coincides with the 40th anniversary of the first manned mission to land on the Moon .
The descent stages from the lunar modules which carried astronauts to and from the Moon can clearly be seen .
The image of the Apollo 14 landing site shows scientific instruments and an astronaut footpath in the lunar dust .
It is the first time hardware left on the Moon by the Apollo missions has been seen from lunar orbit .
The pictures were taken by Nasa 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) spacecraft , which launched on 18 June .
The Apollo 11 mission touched down on the Moon on 20 July 1969
The spacecraft is carrying three cameras on board : one low - resolution wide - angle camera and two high - resolution narrow - angle cameras mounted side - by - side .
These are known collectively as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera ( LROC ) instrument .
" The LROC team anxiously awaited each image , " said the instrument 's principal investigator Mark Robinson of Arizona State University .
" We were very interested in getting our first peek at the lunar module descent stages just for the thrill - and to see how well the cameras had come into focus .
Indeed , the images are fantastic and so is the focus . "
Astronaut trail
The camera instrument was able to capture five of the six Apollo sites , with the remaining Apollo 12 site expected to be photographed in the coming weeks .
Future LROC images from these sites will have two to three times greater resolution .
Long shadows from a low sun angle make the locations of the lunar modules ' descent stages particularly evident .
A long shadow is cast by the Apollo 11 descent stage
The image of the Apollo 14 landing site had a particularly desirable lighting condition that revealed additional details .
The Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package , a set of scientific instruments placed by the astronauts at the landing site , is discernable , as are the faint trails between the module and instrument package left by the astronauts ' footprints .
The LRO satellite reached lunar orbit on 23 June and captured the Apollo sites between 11 and 15 July .
Though it had been expected that LRO would be able to resolve the remnants of the Apollo missions , these first images were taken before the spacecraft had reached its final mapping orbit .
HAVE YOUR SAY I am 63 , at 23 watched spellbound as it happened W A Froud , Letchworth , Herts " Not only do these images reveal the great accomplishments of Apollo , they also show us that lunar exploration continues , " said LRO project scientist Richard Vondrak of Nasa 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , US .
" They demonstrate how LRO will be used to identify the best destinations for the next journeys to the Moon . "
Although the pictures provide a reminder of past lunar exploration , LRO 's primary focus is on paving the way for the future .
Data returned by the mission will help Nasa identify safe landing sites for future explorers , locate potential resources , describe the Moon 's radiation environment and demonstrate new technologies .

Michael Frumin was intrigued by a report on 2008 subway passenger counts .
Just to get warmed up , chew on this — from 8:00 AM to 8:59 AM on an average Fall day in 2007 the NYC Subway carried 388,802 passengers into the CBD on 370 trains over 22 tracks .
In other words , a train carrying 1,050 people crossed into the CBD every 6 seconds .
Breathtaking if you ask me .
So he began wondering what New York City would have to look like without that subway capacity — or , say , if every New Yorker decided to drive where they were going .
At best , it would take 167 inbound lanes , or 84 copies of the Queens Midtown Tunnel , to carry what the NYC Subway carries over 22 inbound tracks through 12 tunnels and 2 ( partial ) bridges .
At worst , 200 new copies of 5th Avenue .
Somewhere in the middle would be 67 West Side Highways or 76 Brooklyn Bridges .
And this neglects the Long Island Railroad , Metro North , NJ Transit , and PATH systems entirely .
And that ’s not all of it .
Of course , at 325 square feet per parking space , all these cars would need over 3.8 square miles of space to park , about 3 times the size of Central Park .
At that point , who would want to go to Manhattan anyway ?
Reading Frumin ’s post , I was reminded of the early , Utopian visions , as sketched by people like Bauhaus stalwart Ludwig Hilberseimer , of cities “ built for the motor age , ” which would seamlessly blend great agglomerations of people with smooth , huge highway networks that always seemed to be largely empty , as in the image above .
What these plans never acknowledged is the point raised by Frumin :
The actual infrastructure required to move all those people by car to their massive towers , not to mention such questions as what they would all do once they got out of their cars ( if they even desired such a thing ) , where they would park , etc. etc .
On the last point , Norman Bel Geddes , writing in the seminal text Magic Motorways , thought parking provided an easy answer to the congestion question :
There is one method , however , which does point the way to a future solution .
It is the construction of parking space directly underneath or actually inside of heavily frequented buildings .
The newest building unit in New York ’s Rockefeller Center , for example , is provided with six floors in which over 800 cars can find parking space by means of ramps .
The same idea has been incorporated , even more dramatically , into Chicago ’s Pure Oil Building , in which the interior spaces of thirteen floors are reserved for tenants ’ cars 300 of them .
How providing more supply would lead to long - term solutions to the congestion problem , particularly as all those drivers poured out of their massive garages at 5 p.m. , was a question the modernist visions were never able to answer .
Of course , Hilberseimer ’s early visions were admittedly a bit dystopian , as even an automobile city proponent like Le Corbusier was moved to note :
A wretched kind of “ modernism ” this !
The pedestrians in the air , the vehicles hogging the ground !
It looks very clever : we shall all have a super time up on those catwalks .
But those “ R.U.R. ” pedestrians will soon be living in “ Metropolis , ” becoming more depressed , more depraved , until one day they will blow up the catwalks , and the buildings , and the machines , and everything .
This is a picture of anti-reason itself , of error , of thoughtlessness .
Madness .
And while the city pictured at the start of the post never materialized , that modernist dream of the ( non-congested ) automotive city never died , and its DNA carried on through GM ’s “ Futurama , ” on through fantastic visions like Geoffrey Jellicoe ’s “ Motopia , ” ( pictured above , with its rooftop roads ) through more serious ( and taken seriously ) tracts like Colin Buchanan ’s “ Traffic in Towns , ” and into built places like Cumbernauld .
“ Kill the street , ” Le Corbusier once intoned , the old “ donkey paths . ”
The new cities would do away , as the historian Stephen Marshall puts it in his excellent book Streets and Patterns , with things like the pub on the corner .
“ There would be no pub on the corner , since no building would interfere with the requisite junction visibility requirements .
There would be no crossroads , since these would be banned on traffic flow and safety principles .
Indeed , there would be no ‘ streets ’ : Just a series of pedestrian decks and flyovers . ”
And as the following video ( sent to me by Eric Boerer at Bike Pittsburgh ) from Pittsburgh , circa 1955 shows , the modernist dreams had some serious propagandistic muscle behind it ; the irony of this video ( and , I must say , the supposed congestion horror depicted here looks pretty tame ) is that just about everything that ’s proposed here is the sort of thing that , half a century later , would be seen as a nightmare from which cities were trying to awake .
I do n’t know the city , and I ’m not sure if those waterfront highways were built , for example , but it ’s hard not to see Le Corb and Broadacre City all over that image of the tall tower , surrounded by acres of parking — my initial thought was , where would you go for lunch ?
It ’s the sort of mundane question the motopians never paused much to consider as they drafted their gleaming tomorrows .
Opinions on shortened URLs are a dime a dozen these days , but the basic facts are :
They ’re awfully convenient for passing around ( and this was true even before Twitter came about )
They are , by nature , short - lived ( either the services or the URL s ) You should never rely on their being around later on
So basically you have absolutely no excuse to not be able to handle them .
I decided to mess around with the concept a few weeks back to see how simple I could make it all work , and came up with a couple of useful Python classes that I can share with the world :
Creating short URL s
The trouble with creating short URLs is that there are entirely too many shortening services , and far too many variations on APIs – in fact , nearly all of them suffer from “ not invented here ” syndrome and try to “ enhance ” their APIs to give you a lot of stuff that you basically do n’t ( ever ) need , and wrap their results in JSON or XML
Me , I refuse to put up with that kind of crap .
So I poked around a bit , found the simplest services to work against and created the following class , which will try all its known services in turn until it gives you a working URL :
import urllib , urllib2 , urlparse , httplib BITLY_AUTH = ' login=foo&apiKey=bar ' class URLShortener : services = { ' api.bit.ly ' : " http://api.bit.ly/shorten?version=2.0.1& %s & format=text&longUrl= " % BITLY_AUTH , ' api.tr.im ' : '/api/trim_simple?url= ' , ' tinyurl.com ' : '/api-create.php?url= ' , ' is.gd ' : '/api.php?longurl= ' } def query ( self , url ) : for shortener in self .
services . keys ( ) : c = httplib .
HTTPConnection ( shortener ) c . request ( " GET " , self .
services [ shortener ] + urllib .
quote ( url ) ) r = c . getresponse ( ) shorturl = r . read ( ) . strip ( ) if ( " Error " not in shorturl ) and ( " http : / / " + urlparse .
urlparse ( shortener ) [ 1 ] in shorturl ) : return shorturl else : continue raise IOError
Yes , the error handling is naïve – any network exceptions and stuff ought to be caught upstream from this – but it works fine so far .
Expanding short URL s
This is the really fun bit , because it is not immediately obvious whether or not a short URL will actually be immediately useful – there are plenty of times when you ’ll actually be redirected to something else , and while fooling around with the Google Reader API ( something I ’ll eventually write about alter ) , I found that also applied ( in spades ) to Feedburner links and whatnot .
So I decided to build some smarts into the process and have it not only ping some known hosts twice , but also turn it into a link checker of sorts , and learning which hosts were actually redirecting to other places :
import urllib , urllib2 , urlparse , httplib class URLExpander : # known shortening services shorteners = [ ' tr.im ' , ' is.gd ' , ' tinyurl.com ' , ' bit.ly ' , ' snipurl.com ' , ' cli.gs ' , ' feedproxy.google.com ' , ' feeds.arstechnica.com ' ] twofers = [ u ' \ u272A df.ws ' ] # learned hosts learned = [ ] def resolve ( self , url , components ) : " " " Try to resolve a single URL " " " c = httplib .
HTTPConnection ( components .
netloc ) c . request ( " GET " , components .
path ) r = c . getresponse ( ) l = r . getheader ( ' Location ' ) if l == None : return url # it might be impossible to resolve , so best leave it as is else : return l def query ( self , url , recurse = True ) : " " " Resolve a URL " " " components = urlparse .
urlparse ( url ) #
Check weird shortening services first if ( components .
netloc in self .
twofers ) and recurse : return self .
query ( self .
resolve ( url , components ) , False ) #
Check known shortening services first if components .
netloc in self .
shorteners : return self .
resolve ( url , components ) #
If we have n't seen this host before , ping it , just in case if components .
netloc not in self .
learned : ping = self .
resolve ( url , components ) if ping != url : self .
shorteners .
append ( components . netloc ) self .
learned .
append ( components . netloc ) return ping #
The original URL was OK return url
This one ’s a bit more convoluted but has turned out to be very useful indeed , and you can simply pickle the whole object to preserve its learned hosts .
ANALYSIS :
For months , the image of President Obama as weak had gained currency , as his drive toward health care reform looked increasingly troubled and his attempts to gain concessions from foreign allies and competitors appeared to be going nowhere .
But Mr. Obama ’s disclosure Friday that Iran had a secret nuclear facility and that he had known about it since taking office introduced a new way of looking at many of his decisions since January .
“ You have to go back and look at the nine months and all the moves he ’s made since then , and that he knew Iran was lying to him , and he still went ahead with it , ” said Joe Cirincione , president of the Ploughshares Fund , a Washington advocacy group devoted to eliminating nuclear weapons from the world .
“ He played Iran perfectly , to isolate Iran , unite all the other countries around him , with an open hand to Iran , and then he springs the trap . ”
Not only did the president look strong , he looked cunning .
Now , a question for the White House is whether it can capitalize on this moment and direct this sense of momentum toward its domestic agenda , namely health care reform .
The president ’s top advisers , after returning to Washington from the Group of 20 summit in Pittsburgh , acknowledged that Mr. Obama had cut a compelling figure during a week of maneuvering to hem in Iran ’s nuclear program .
“ The president played a strong and effective leadership role this week on the world stage , and I think Americans appreciate that , ” said David Axelrod , one of the president ’s closest advisers .
But he would not say whether he thought there might be a ricochet effect on to health care .
The most recent polling continues to show high degrees of skepticism among the public , while the Senate Finance Committee has struggled to pass a version of reform that many are looking to as the model for a bipartisan bill .
Faiz Shakir , director of research at the Center for American Progress , a liberal Washington think tank , said the president ’s good week may help him domestically “ if it translates into higher poll numbers . ”
“ But I ’m skeptical , ” he said .
“ The domestic stuff is much more about Congress right now . ”
On Capitol Hill , liberal Democrats continued to insist that a government - run “ public option ” will be part of a final bill , despite the fact that most observers do not think the bill has a chance of passing with such a component .
The absence of the public option , however , might imperil support from voting blocs on the left .
That is just one of the conundrums that still face health care reform .
Tony Fratto , a deputy assistant to the president in the George W. Bush administration , said he has “ seen nothing that will make it easier for [ Mr. Obama ] to pass health care or a climate bill . ”
“ In fact , I ’d say he lost a week , ” Mr. Fratto said .
“ While he was talking to U.N. - types and holding a sleepy G - 20 , Republicans were out talking about health care . ”
Of course , all of Mr. Obama ’s problems on foreign policy are far from solved .
The Iran issue , all by itself , remains an enormous challenge , with one government official describing the current moment as comparable to the first inning of a nine - inning baseball game .
The administration must now wait to see how Iran conducts itself at talks scheduled to begin Oct. 1 , and then react accordingly .
Then there is Afghanistan , where the president appears to be considering rejecting a request from his newly installed commander on the ground , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , for more troops .
And though Mr. Obama held talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in New York , bringing the two sides together for the first time in almost a year , his obvious impatience with the two sides at the meeting was evidence of the current state of peace talks .
The Palestinians remain divided between Fatah and Hamas , and the Israelis remain unwilling to agree to a full freeze on the expansion of settlements for a year .
However , after The Washington Times reported last week that the Israelis have proposed a freeze on new settlements for six to nine months , Mr. Obama told the Palestinians that this was “ enough to get started ” with peace talks , which are currently stalled .
The biggest impact of the Iran secret - site announcement may be that in the future , when critics level the boom on the president for a decision they do n’t like , they might hesitate for fear that , like the past week , he might have an ace up his sleeve .

ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
Two mind - numbing fast - paced dramas .
Two parallel worlds .
One real , one fiction , both deadly .
Jack Bauer , mythic hero of " 24 . "
Dying from a deadly bio - pathogen leaked from weapons developed by Starkwood , a rogue mercenary army attacking the presidency , hell - bent on taking over America .
The other drama in play : " Hank the Hammer " Paulson , iconic Wall Street hero , a Trojan Horse placed inside Washington by Goldman Sachs as Treasury Secretary in control of America 's $ 15 trillion economy .
Goldman , a modern dynasty with vast financial powers much like those once used by the de '
Medici , Rothschilds and Morgans to control nations .
Both dramas play high - stakes games with financial WMDs that have lethal consequences .
Jack compresses thrills , kills and chills into 24 hours .
Hank , Goldman and their army of Wall Street mercenaries move with equally blinding speed , heart - pounding action .
Drama ?
You bet .
Six short months ago Hank led an assault on Congress .
The scene parallels one in " 24 : " Sangala War Lord Juma 's brazen attack inside the White House .
But no AK - 47s necessary .
The Hammer assaulted Congress with just a two - and - a - half page memo in hand .
Like a crack special - ops warrior , he took down the enemy , demanding $ 750 billion , absolute control , total secrecy , no accountability and emergency powers to act immediately ... warning that inaction was not an option , that collapse of America 's banking system was imminent , would bring down the global monetary system , pushing world 's economies into a " Great Depression II . "
Congress surrendered .
Here 's the whole plot :
Scene 1 . American government is now run by the ' Goldman Conspiracy '
Oh , you really think just I 'm plotting a television series ?
Or just paranoid , exaggerating this power grab ?
You better read " The Usual Suspects , " Matthew Malone 's brilliant article in Portfolio magazine : He " exposed " the " Goldman Sachs ' conspiracy ' to take over the U.S. financial system . "
Read it in this context : America 's financial sector has exploded from 19 % of corporate profits in 1986 to 41 % today , becoming a magnet for every wannabe billionaire .
They know why Wall Street must control Washington .
Malone focuses on the incestuous " conspiracy " of Goldman alumni in Treasury , Bank of America , Merrill Lynch , AIG , Citigroup , Washington lobbyists and politicians .
Scene 2 .
Huge conflicts motivating Wall Street 's ' Trojan Horse '
And just in case you think any emphasis on The Hammer 's conflict of interest was invented purely to increase drama , please remember that he worked at Goldman for three decades after serving under Nixon .
He got $ 38 million his last year as CEO in 2006 before becoming Treasury Secretary .
Then during the market meltdown six months ago the $ 700 million personal fortune he built at Goldman was threatened by Goldman 's huge $ 20 billion derivatives exposure at AIG : Suddenly his responsibilities at Treasury merged with a strong self - interest in protecting his personal fortune .
AIG was " saved . "
Scene 3 . Wall Street 's ' quiet coup ' also runs world 's banking system
There 's another equally disturbing expose in " The Quiet Coup , " Simon Johnson 's great article in Atlantic magazine .
A former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund , Johnson also warns that America 's " financial industry has effectively captured our government " and is " blocking essential reform . "
Worse , he says that unless we break Wall Street 's stranglehold ( unlikely in the new Washington ) we will be unable " to prevent a true depression , " warning that " we 're running out of time , " echoing many of our predictions of the " Great Depression II " coming soon .
See previous Paul B. Farrell .
Scene 4 . Wall Street used the meltdown to take over America 's government
Matt Taibbi , author of " The Great Derangement , " captured this drama in a Rolling Stone piece , " The Big Takeover , how Wall Street insiders are using the bailout to stage a revolution . "
A must - read : " As complex as all the finances are , the politics are n't hard to follow .
By creating a crisis that can only be solved by those fluent in a language too complex for ordinary people to understand , the Wall Street crowd has turned the vast majority of Americans into non-participants in their own political future .
... in the age of CDS and CBO , most of us are financial illiterates . "
Wall Street " used the crisis to effect a historic , revolutionary change in our political system -- transforming a democracy into a two - tiered state , one with plugged - in financial bureaucrats above and clueless customers below . "
Scene 5 . How Obama is keeping alive Bush 's ' disaster capitalism '
Back in 2007 at the start of the meltdown , Hank was misleading us in Fortune : " This is far and away the strongest global economy I 've seen in my business lifetime . "
In the real world , Naomi Klein , author of " The Shock Doctrine : Rise of Disaster Capitalism , " was warning us that " during boom times it 's profitable to preach laissez faire , because an absentee government allows speculative bubbles . "
But " when those bubbles burst , the ideology becomes a hindrance and goes dormant while big government rides to the rescue . "
Then , free - market " ideology will come roaring back when the bailouts are done .
The massive debts the public is accumulating to bail out the speculators will then become part of a global budget crisis . "
TARP paybacks : Obama has a new " disaster capitalism . "
Scene 6 . Wall Street 's CEOs rule like dictators in a banana republic
Seriously , here 's how bad Taibbi sees it : " Paulson and his cronies turned the federal government into one gigantic half - opaque holding company , one whose balance sheet includes the world 's most appallingly large and risky hedge fund , a controlling interest in a dying insurance giant , huge investments in a group of teetering megabanks , and shares here and there in various auto - finance companies , student loans , and other failing business . "
And let 's include $ 5.5 trillion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Wall Street 's greed and stupidity resembles the self - destructive reigns of banana republic dictators .
Scene 7 . Wall Street makes an un-American bet on ' disaster capitalism '
Today as you ponder buying some Goldman stock , remember , you 're really betting that " disaster capitalism " is back , strong , tightening its stranglehold on Washington and on the American taxpayers , who will guarantee all Wall Street 's future failures .
Yes , this is un-American , but so what ?
The " Goldman Conspiracy " is still probably a good short - term buy ... if you 're interested in betting on America 's new " democracy of capitalists , by capitalists , and for capitalists , " with " The Conspiracy " leading the joint chiefs of this new mercenary army ... and it only took six short months for their " Quiet Coup ! "
Scene 8 .
Banks recycle TARP money , pump earnings , cheat America
Here 's how it worked :
The Hammer conned a clueless Congress , then shelled out $ 350 billion of our taxpayer money ( Helicopter Ben Bernanke helped by upping the ante with a couple trillion side - bet ) , buying toxic debt to save his ol ' Wall Street buddies .
They stopped lending and used the dough to doctor their balance sheets .
So no surprise that Goldman , Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan Chase are now reporting " blockbuster " first - quarter earnings , says the New York Times , while just months ago " many of the nation 's biggest banks were on life support . "
Get it ?
They screwed taxpayers and borrowers so they can repay TARP with ( you guessed it ) our recycled TARP money .
Now it 's back to business - as - usual , with no restrictions on CEO pay and bonuses ... no thank - yous ... no admissions of guilt ... while some even arrogantly deny that they ever needed TARP money .
Scene 9 . Wall Street 's already set the stage for new disaster
Right after the election in November , at the peak of the banking crisis , when Hank , Goldman and the Wall Street mercenary armies were divvying up the $ 350 billion TARP money , we detailed 30 reasons for the " Great Depression II " likely coming around 2011 .
We quoted John Whitehead , former Goldman Sachs chairman , former chairman of the New York Fed , former Reagan deputy secretary of state .
He warned America 's problems will take years , burn trillions , result in massive deficits :
" This is a road to disaster , " he said .
" I 've always been a positive person and optimistic , but I do n't see a solution here . "
He did see a depression at the end of that road , one you can call the " Great Depression II . "
Scene 10 .
Obama turned ' The Goldman Conspiracy ' into a superpower
Do you see the parallels : Jack and Starkwood , Hank and Goldman ?
Jack 's a great mythic hero .
We need to believe a hero will defend the little guy , stand between us and total annihilation .
But Jack Bauer 's " dead . "
Yes , dead .
Jack 's not real .
Never was " alive . "
Jack 's a fiction , a figment of Main Street America 's vivid imagination , the symbol of " hope " for a populist revolution .
Hope that Jack , Barack or some other new hero will emerge , take power back from Wall Street and return it to the people .
Unfortunately that wo n't happen , folks .
Yes , on TV Jack will come back from near - death , again .
But in real life , Hank , Goldman and Wall Street 's mercenaries are winning the war .
Read and weep Portfolio 's chilling finale : " Obama 's victory and Geithner 's appointment are the completion of Goldman 's meticulously crafted plan to become a superpower .
The firm now has the clout to impose its will on the financial markets , and the world . "
GOP or Dems ?
Conservatives or liberals ?
It does n't matter .
We 'll all controlled by " The Conspiracy . "
So why not surrender , let them have the power ?
The truth is , through their lobbyists and surrogates in Washington , they already rule America .
Surrender is a mere formality .
Accept reality .
Hold them accountable later .
After the next crisis .
After the next meltdown of disaster capitalism -- if there 's anything left after the " Great Depression II " sweeps like a pandemic across the planet , consuming all economies , for a long time .
But for now , Goldman and other banks may well be short - term buys .
Just be ready to dump them in the near future ... a scenario that will be here sooner than you think .
I am going to post this in two parts :
The first part here will be regarding the dismissal hearing , the second part will be our interactions with the courthouse , Yuma PD and the Border Patrol -- which had nothing to do with Steven Anderson , except we were there to observe his case .
I had wanted to get some quotes but nobody 's talking .
I hope to get some more specific info on the hearing and post as an update since the hearing was videotaped by the court .
I am waiting for the video from the hearing to arrive from the court .
Background :
The trial was originally to be held at the Justice Court in the town of Wellton near where the arrest took place .
But the judge , Cora Romine , had recused herself in June for reasons not stated .
That presumably meant she believed that she could not be impartial or that there were circumstances that could make it appear that she might not be impartial or for any other reason she could not handle this case .
So she did the honorable and ethical act and withdrew from the case .
[ My speculation :
While the reasons are unknown , presumably she either has a family member who was or is in the Border Patrol , or whom was affected by the checkpoints .
She does not know Pastor Anderson .
But there are many other reasons for a judge to recuse themselves from a particular case . ]
This has been updated for clarity and detail now that I have spoken with Defense Attorney Marc Victor .
This is still just the first part which deals with the hearing , not our problems with Yuma government which are not part of this case .
I am going to post this in two parts :
The first part here will be regarding the dismissal hearing , the second part will be our interactions with the courthouse , Yuma PD and the Border Patrol -- which had nothing to do with Steven Anderson , except we were there to observe his case .
I am waiting for the video from the hearing to arrive from the court .
Background : Pastor Steven Anderson exercised his Rights back in April at an unlawful permanent federal government internal security checkpoint in April and was electrocuted , beaten up and arrested for his trouble .
He had a hearing in Yuma to dismiss his two charges -- failure to obey and apparently stopping his car at a federal law enforcement roadblock ( which is a felony if you do n't stop ) -- which was quite illuminating .

She does not know Pastor Anderson .
But there are many other reasons for a judge to recuse themselves from a particular case . ]
So the hearing began at 10 AM , August 5 , 2009 in the Yuma Justice Court ( Dist. 1 ) .
The Honorable Justice Yolanda V. Torok presiding .
Prosecutor William Katz , Deputy County Attorney representing the State ( Wellton District ? ) Defense Attorney Marc J. Victor [ note redesigned website ]
Case # : J-1403 -MS - 2009000009
Case # : J-1401 - MS - 200900179 Defendant Steven Lee Anderson , presentCase # : J-1401 - MS - 200900179
This was a hearing requested by the defense to dismiss both charges brought against Pastor Anderson .
The court initially spent a bit of time getting the case designation clarified .
Judge Torok seemed pleased she was getting a 4th Amendment case --- a little variety ?
The prosecutor was angry that the case was transferred from Wellton to Yuma , and seemed incapable of understanding the jurisdiction had not been changed even though the location had been .
He objected to Judge Romine 's recusal and wanted it transferred back to Wellton 's jurisdiction .
He would not accept that the jurisdiction had not changed , just because it had been moved down the road to another judge 's courtroom .
He cited a case in which a judge who had recused themselves was reversed because their reason given for recusal was not good enough and not handled in a timely manner .
Well , Judge Romine recused herself before June 26th , here it was August 5th ... seems timely .
She did not state any reason -- nor is she required to -- so there is nothing to hang onto here .
The prosecutor had also filed a
The prosecutor objected to the case number -- which was in error -- in order to get a continuance .
Judge Cooper who was sitting in the audience interjected as a friend of the court , what the correct case number should be .
The prosecutor sought a special action to delay the hearing which was denied .
The prosecutor tried for a continuance to September by objecting that Judge Torok had not studied the case and the arguments well enough to understand and rule on a dismissal hearing .
Marc
Victor countered that he and the defendant had traveled a good distance to be here for this scheduled hearing as well as the five Border Patrol officers and were prepared for the hearing to go into the afternoon .
He suggested the dismissal documents were not that long and she could break for now to study them and come back later in the afternoon to continue .
When Judge Torok said she already had items on her calender that afternoon , Judge Cooper offered as a friend of the court to take her calender for the afternoon so they could have the hearing .
So the hearing was scheduled for 1 PM .
The prosecutor filed a
The prosecutor had also filed a form 10.2 the prior week requesting a different judge than had been re-assigned to the case --- which was presiding Judge David F. Cooper .
Judge Cooper agreed to the request and Judge Torok was now assigned to the case .
The prosecutor objected to the case number -- which was in error -- in order to get a continuance .
Judge Cooper who was sitting in the audience interjected as a friend of the court , what the correct case number should be .

When Judge Torok said she already had items on her calender that afternoon , Judge Cooper offered as a friend of the court to take her calender for the afternoon so they could have the hearing .
So the hearing was scheduled for 1PM .
The prosecutor filed a form 10.1 petition nine minutes before the hearing would resume for Judge Torok to be removed from the case for cause .
Reason : Because Judge Cooper was orchestrating from the back of the courtroom .
Mr. Katz so certified under affidavit .
Since he has accused a judge of impropriety , or at least of losing control of her courtroom , she needs to get a non-involved judge to rule on the matter .
What I find interesting in the motion is the statement under oath that the motion is being " made on a good - faith basis and not intended to delay the present proceedings . "
Hogwash !
Katz spent the entire proceeding trying to get it delayed into a continuance .
This was his last gambit .
And a nasty one it is .
Jon R. Smith must be so proud of the working relationship his subordinates are fostering with the judiciary .
That hearing will take place in Wellton Justice Court on August 21 at 2 PM .

Moods are processes– not events .
They have a coming and a going .
They have a beginning and ending .
Depending on where you are with the mood there are basically 3 things you can do :
Prevention -
Things are either less likely or more likely to happen .
Moods , although they may feel like it , do n’t , for the most part , just come out of the blue .
Moods are the emotional momentum of your life , and frequently people who know you can sense a change in your momentum long before you can feel it .
Prevention is the set of skills that have to do with how you maintain positive momentum and redirect negative momentum .
It includes things like : self maintanence ( what you do to take care of yourself ) , knowing high risk situations and warning signs ( being able to “ see it coming ” ) , and cues ( knowing exactly what you do that tells you exactly how you are doing– for ex. on the manic scale an 8 means what ? ) .
Finally it means those plans that you are going to follow once you “ see it coming . ”
Prevention means becoming an expert on yourself with some degree of efficiency and expertise .
Coping - Coping is what you do when you know “ its here . ”
It means limiting the damage and beginning the process of positive momentum .
A lot of coping is tied up with how you process your experience and the plans you have for support when you can no longer trust the way you process your experience .
It means knowing that because something “ feels so ” doesnt make it so .
It means having a sounding board - whether it is a script or series of statements you do or another person you can trust– that helps to clarify reality when it doesnt seem so clear .
It is trying so hard not to leap and find yourself dealing with consequences of your mood that you really do n’t want to see happen .
Learning - Learning has to do with how you view the “ finished product ” and what you learn that you can use next time .
It means seeing mistakes and also seeing successes .
It means viewing your experience not just as a source of deprivation , but as a possible opportunity to learn more about life .
Obviously this is a simple look at a complex thing .
Many things are beyond control and your particular brain chemistry figures into your emotional momentum in life .
Even so we have a lot of ability to affect .
The brain is responsive to our experience .
And even when you feel totally out of control you still have the ability to make things more or less likely to get better .
• Booze takes its toll on Tkachiev in Kolkata match • Praveen Kumar wins after opponent dozes off
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
A leading French chess player turned up drunk and dozed off after only 11 moves in an international tournament in Kolkata , losing the round on technical grounds , Indian media reported today .
Grandmaster Vladislav Tkachiev arrived for yesterday 's match against India 's Praveen Kumar in such a tired and emotional state that he could hardly sit in his chair and soon fell asleep , resting his head on the table , the Hindustan Times newspaper reported .
Indian papers carried pictures of the world No58 sleeping and the organisers ' futile attempts to wake him up .
The game was awarded to the Indian on the technical ground of Tkachiev being unable to complete his moves within the stipulated time of an hour and 30 minutes , the paper said .
The player was reportedly warned and reprimanded by the organisers afterwards but has been allowed to take part in the remainder of the competition .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A 17 - year - old Briton became the youngest person to sail round the globe single - handed on Thursday after nine months at sea .
Mike Perham suffered knockdowns and damage to his yacht during the 24,000 - mile ( 38,700 - km ) trip and the teenager from Hertfordshire , southern England , said he was now looking forward to a “ good meal and a very good night ’s sleep . ”
Fewer than 250 people have sailed solo around the globe , but his record is already in jeopardy if a 13 - year - old Dutch girl persuades a court to allow her to set sail .
Perham , who started sailing aged seven , was the youngest person to sail across the Atlantic Ocean , aged 14 , in 2007 .
Perham crossed the start line for his round - the - world trip between Ushant , northern France , and Lizard Point , southern England , on November 18 last year as a 16 - year - old and celebrated his 17th birthday in the southern Indian Ocean .
Early on , he suffered technical problems with his Open 50 yacht , TotallyMoney.com , and was forced to seek repairs at various ports , including in Portugal , Gran Canaria , Cape Town , Tasmania and Auckland .
Because of that , Guinness World Records categorized his record as “ assisted . ”
“ The low points are when things go wrong unexpectedly and it is down to you to fix it , because that ’s not getting you nearer to home , that ’s only getting you further away , ” he told BBC television by phone .
He had to deal with his genoa sail ripping from top to bottom and swimming under the boat ’s hull to cut free a jammed spinnaker sheet .
Poor weather and the onset of winter forced him to go through the Panama Canal rather than sail around Cape Horn , on the southerly tip of South America .
Perham said he never doubted he would complete the trip , but he did have moments when he questioned what he was doing .
“ But you push on and you handle it , ” he told the BBC .
“ I knew exactly what I was letting myself in for in terms of being on my own , but it ’s definitely the hardest bit of the trip being on your own because there is nobody to help you and you do miss the physical contact . ”
The previous youngest to complete a similar voyage was American Zac Sunderland last month , but his effort is not recognized by Guinness World Records .
Craig Glenday , editor - in - chief of Guinness World Records , described Perham ’s latest achievement as heroic .
“ It shows Mike as a truly unique young man , whose dream was realized through sheer determination and commitment . ”

Australian parents urged to get the real facts on vaccination
Businessman , aviator , and explorer , Dick Smith , has funded an Australian Skeptics ’ advertisement to urge parents to access factual information on vaccination , in the wake of the country ’s largest Whooping Cough epidemic .
The advertisement warns people to avoid advice from groups such as the Australian Vaccination Network ( AVN ) , which state that they are ‘ pro- choice ’ but are opposed to vaccination and spread misinformation about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines .
“ Dick Smith Foods has funded this advertisement in the public interest , to ensure parents access unbiased , accurate advice from reputable medical sources .
The Australian Vaccination Network is no such source , ” said Mr Smith .
The advertisement – placed in the Thursday , August 6 edition of The Australian newspaper – warns parents that the AVN is spreading false claims including that vaccines contain toxic quantities of mercury , aluminium , and formaldehyde ; that vaccines cause conditions such as autism , and that the AVN is providing incorrect information about the risks of childhood illnesses .
Following the tragic death of three babies to Whooping Cough , Australian Skeptics has established an information page with information on the myths and realities of vaccines and links to reputable sources .
The parents of four - week - old Dana McCaffery , who died from Whooping Cough in March , have welcomed the Skeptics ’ actions .
“ We implore parents to access reputable sources for information about vaccination .
We thank the Australian Skeptics for presenting this information , which informs parents about the risks of preventable illnesses , addresses fears of vaccines with proven evidence , and debunks common myths .
It is vital all Australian governments act now and implement comprehensive education campaigns to fully inform parents about the importance of vaccination , ” said Toni and David McCaffery .
Eran Segev , president of Australian Skeptics Inc , said : “ Australian Skeptics believes strongly that the public should have access to full and factual information so that they can form their opinions and choices in life , not half - truths , mistruths and fantasies . ”
The Australian Skeptics has several thousand members across Australia , and investigates paranormal and pseudo - scientific claims from a responsible scientific viewpoint .

The rise in Clostridium difficile infections in recent years is due to genetic changes rather than dirty hospitals , say UK researchers .
Comparison of an historic strain and a strain from the outbreak at Stoke Mandeville hospital in 2003 found it had evolved to be more virulent .
It can spread more easily and cause more severe symptoms , the team reports in Genome Biology journal .
NHS trusts have a target to cut C. difficile infections by 30 % by 2010 / 11 .
The bacteria are present in the gut of as many as 3 % of healthy adults and 66 % of infants .
It rarely causes problems in healthy people but can lead to illness when the normal balance of bacteria in the gut is disrupted , for example with use of certain antibiotics , and it is the leading cause of hospital - acquired diarrhoea .
The deep clean programme was never going to work against this organism in the long term
Professor Brendan Wren
In the past five years , a new group of highly virulent C. difficile strains has emerged - PCR - ribotype 027 - which cause more severe diarrhoea and a higher rate of deaths .
Analysis of the full genome of the " hyper- virulent " strains and an older strain showed the bacteria have acquired genes which enable them to survive better in the environment , spread more easily and make patients more severely ill .
In all , five different genetic regions appear to have accumulated in the bacteria in past couple of decades , the team reported in Genome Biology .
Fighting back
The number of cases of C. difficile has risen dramatically since the 1990s , although latest figures show cases are now consistently falling .
Stoke Mandeville Hospital saw two major outbreaks of C. difficile between 2003 and 2006 that caused 35 deaths .
Study leader Professor Brendan Wren , from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said the study would help scientists understand how C. difficile became so aggressive .
" These strains came from nowhere and the sudden rise in C. difficile was due to their spread .
" The bugs are fighting back and the one clear thing that comes out of this study is it is not down to cleaning but that the strain has evolved with new chunks of DNA .
" The deep clean programme was never going to work against this organism in the long term . "
Hygiene measures are still needed to keep the infection under control , he added .
A spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency said it closely monitored the evolution of C. difficile strains .
" All strains of C. difficile require intervention and control - the intervention involved when dealing with the 027 strain is no different than how any other strain is treated .
" All C. difficile requires treatment and vigilant infection control procedures in order to reduce rates of infection . "

As a candidate , Barack Obama assured us that if he were elected president , when the time came to reform America ’s health care system , “ insurance companies , drug companies -- they 'll get a seat at the table , they just wo n't be able to buy every chair . ”
Unfortunately , he did n’t mention that when he became president the people with a real solution to the problem – a single - payer insurance system – would n’t get any of the chairs at all .
Now it ’s not just me saying that “ single payer ” is a legitimate solution to the problems of incomplete and inadequate coverage and bureaucratic waste – Obama has been pretty clear about it himself .
On New Year ’s Eve , 2007 , he told an Ames , Iowa crowd that “ If I were designing a system from scratch I would probably set up a single - payer system ...
But we 're not designing a system from scratch ...
For now , I just want to make sure every American is covered . ”
Fair enough as a seemingly pragmatic rationale , except that on July 22 , 2009 he told a press conference that “ the truth is that unless you have a what ’s called a single - payer system in which everybody is automatically covered , then you ’re probably not going to reach every single individual . ”
Well , that completes the circle , does n’t it ?
So , by this point it should be obvious why those pesky single payer advocates have been keeping at , even when no one will let them sit at the table – someone ’s got to make some sense out of this situation .
In his effort to avoid the Clinton Administration fiasco of a coming in with a plan so massive that it could be attacked on a thousand points , Obama himself has largely washed his hands of the details , leaving it to various congressional committees to decide whom and what to let in or leave out .
And as Senator Max Baucus ( D - MT ) , chairman of one of those committees – Senate Finance , acknowledged during a May 21 appearance at the Health Care Reform Newsmaker Series ( sponsored by Kaiser Family Foundation , Families USA and the National Federation of Independent Business ) , so far as the single payer option goes , “ just to be honest , it ’s not on the table .
It ’s the only thing that ’s not , because it cannot pass . ”
And just so you knew he was n’t fooling , sixteen days earlier eight single payer advocates were arrested at one of his committee meetings for trying to speak about the problem that the one proposal that the President acknowledges would “ reach every single individual ” was “ not on the table ” at the Senator ’s committee .
But guess what – on June 24 , the New York Times reported that Baucus “ conceded that it was a mistake to rule out a fully government - run health system , or a ‘ single - payer plan , ’ not because he supports it but because doing so alienated a large , vocal constituency and left Mr. Obama ’s proposal of a public health plan to compete with private insurers as the most liberal position . ”
( The Times here makes the all too frequent error of calling the single payer proposal “ a fully government - run health system . ”
There are “ fully government - run ” health systems , to be sure – in Great Britain , for instance .
But a single payer system , such as exists in Canada , is a not one of them .
It is more a variant of Medicare with its role limited to approving and processing payments for treatment provided by doctors who may work independently or for any kind of institution .
Privately provided health care would remain largely intact ; privately provided health insurance would not . )
Did this mean that single payer was now on the table after all ?
Well , no – and maybe that ’s not too surprising given that the Center for Responsive Politics says “ The health sector has given Baucus at least $ 2.8 million during his career ” and Consumer Watchdog reports him trailing only former presidential candidate John McCain ( R - AZ ) in congressional campaign contributions received from both the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries over the past six years .
And maybe it ’s not so surprising that the President has taken the position he has either – The Atlantic reports that “ in 2008 , Barack Obama collected 72 percent of the [ health care ] industry 's donations ” to the presidential candidates .
( It further reports that “ So far in this [ congressional election ] cycle , Democrats are receiving about 66 percent of ... the $ 3.5 million donated by health care companies . ” )
Still , it ’s one thing for Baucus , or even Obama to marginalize single payer , but it seems genuinely strange when people who actually do understand and support it and are not getting campaign contributions write it off as well .
And yet this has been happening with distressing frequency .
When one longtime fixture on the left op - editorialized asking where was Obama ’s famous volunteer army on the question of health care reform , the answer seemed only too obvious .
The only health care reform movement there is out there is for single payer and that movement has been slapped in the face from day one .
Another longtime leftist addresses the persistent single payer advocates and suggests that they start asking themselves what compromise they can live with for the simple reason that single payer is “ ‘ off the table ’ in terms of political reality . ”
And why is that ?
“ Mostly because of the opposition of the insurance corporations and drug companies . ”
Right .
And by that logic , I guess we ’d just concede them a veto based on the superior financial resources that they ’ve “ earned ” from their rate payers and customers and concern ourselves with the more limited scope of things the general public is allowed to be concerned with .
Does n’t seem to be much point getting up in the morning – politically speaking – with that outlook .
Of course , none of what we ’re dealing with here is new or unusual , nor is it confined to the left .
For one thing , an administration of the right is just as likely to disappoint its base by dealing toward the center when fishing for votes , with the same rationale that its base has nowhere else to go .
Nor is it unusual for campaigners of any stripe to hold illusions about their presidential candidate .
Perhaps campaigns would be impossible without a certain starry eyed belief among many of the rank and file that their candidate actually privately agrees with them much more than he lets on , but that he has to say what he says for , you know , political reasons .
And when you add in the fact that the President is under attack for attempting to do anything at all , since what the health insurance industry really wants the government to do about the health care situation is leave them alone – and maybe loosen up the regulations a bit while they ’re at it – you can understand a reluctance to publicly criticize “ our guy ” when he ’s taking so much heat from the other side .
But in this case the reluctance to criticize seems to extend significantly beyond what it was when Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter was in the White House .
He ’s an African - American ; he understands .
He was a community organizer ; he knows what ’s going on .
We find self identified radicals bubbling on the Internet about Obama ’s ability to talk baseball on the All Star Game broadcast – No wonder we love this guy !
They even “ Obama - ize ” their pictures – We are all Obama !
Friends caution me about not appearing to criticize the man himself when criticizing his policies .
And the consequences of the infatuation are not limited by issue or geography .
As a pair of D.C. based antiwar organizers recently wrote back to their allies in the provinces : “ What we 've just learned in the past three months is that with Barack Obama in the White House , our Congressional work has become more difficult on issues of war and peace . ”
One aspect of all this that seems particularly strange for a president and a core of supporters who claim to be all about community organizing is that they sometimes seem woefully deficient in analyzing what they have for a base .
His supporters should rally around what ?
The “ public option ” ?
Met anyone lately who can tell you exactly what that is ?
Probably not .
It is possible to craft a piece of legislation and pass it relatively quickly and that legislation might even be quite good .
But you cannot build a movement about a proposal in a field so complicated as health insurance overnight , particularly when it does n’t come with particulars .
The government will sell a certain amount of health insurance on its own – that ’s about all anyone ’s going to be able to tell you about a public option at this point .
Most people still do n’t know what you ’re talking about when you say “ single payer ” either , but there are far more who do than there were fifteen years ago for the simple reason that a substantial number of committed people have been persistently working at it all that time .
They did n’t put in that effort because they ever thought that the insurance industry would allow it to be “ on the table ” if it could prevent it from being there , but rather because the logic of the situation of huge and growing numbers of people lacking health insurance combined with the colossal amount of money wasted by the private health insurance industry demanded it .
Any organizers who think they can motivate single payer supporters by telling them to toss away what they know to be true because the other side has more clout on Capitol Hill might want to think about re-upping in organizing school .
Fortunately , not everyone has drunk the Kool Aid and some of the single payer advocates have soldiered on , paying no heed to the cautions of the more “ realistic . ”
In Congress itself , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) succeeded in getting the House Committee on Education and Labor to pass an amendment to the House health - care reform bill specifically granting states the power to create their own single - payer health care systems .
Now that ’s a public option we can believe in .
And by his efforts to substitute a national single payer bill for the committee ’s bill , Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - NY ) has elicited a promise from the House Leadership that a single payer bill will come to the floor for a vote by the entire House .
So , what now ?
It ’s one thing to argue that it was substantively as well as tactically stupid to eliminate single payer from the mix at the outset , but it ’s quite another to believe that it could win this year even under the best of circumstances , which these have certainly not been .
Valuable time that might have been used to clarify the debate has been squandered with this “ not on the table ” foolishness .
And perhaps the most damaging aspect of the single payer freeze out is that the Congressional Budget Office has never provided a financial analysis of what it would do .
And when you ’re pushing a bill on the basis of its ability to cut costs , that ’s a mighty big handicap .
At the least , the commitment to a full House vote will allow us to see who ’s really willing to buck the insurance industry and who ’s blowing smoke .
No more “ I ’d be for it , but it ca n’t win . ”
Just cast your vote .
But what ’s a single payer advocate to do in the event that the votes are n’t there ?
Is the public option a fair compromise ?
Until and unless someone can explain just how it is going to function and guarantee that it ’s not some tiny pilot program , probably not .
The state single payer option may be something else , though .
American single payer advocates did not opt to go with it because it represented the only potential solution to the problem .
Ron Dellums , for instance , took an entirely different approach when he was in Congress .
He introduced legislation to create a government run health service along the lines of some European systems .
But most American health care reform advocates judged that the specter of “ government - run ” health care would just be too high a hurdle to surmount and opted instead for a plan that would affect the billing system but not the delivery system .
And there was something else – the Canadian system is province based , not run out of Ottawa .
It started in Saskatchewan and spread to the rest of the country after its success there could not be denied .
The state option , then , would be following the Canadian model in that regard as well .
The California Legislature has twice passed a state - based single payer system , only to have it vetoed by Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
A Democratic governor and a guarantee of all of the waivers from federal regulation needed to allow the state law to operate would make for an entirely new ball game .
Not that the state would be home free after that , mind you .
First off , there is that immense California budget problem .
And then there ’s the question of how many of the legislators who ’ve been willing to vote for the bill when they knew it was sure to be vetoed will continue to vote that way when they know it counts .
After all , during his ( unsuccessful ) campaign the last Democratic gubernatorial candidate would n’t even commit to signing the bill .
Nevertheless , there is more than a glimmer of hope there and the Kucinich Amendment just could ultimately turn out to be the piece that matters .
With California having more people than all of Canada ’s provinces combined , a single payer system there would be the world ’s largest .
And with apologies to Frank Sinatra and New York City , if single payer can make it there ... well you know how it goes .
It took me too long to realize .
What was missing in my life was a man .
Specifically , a poultry butcher .
Yes , I learned to carve a whole chicken in culinary school , but bad student that I was , found it too much of a chore .
After graduation I rarely brought home whole chickens to dissect .
Instead , at the supermarket , I made a beeline for neatly packaged drumsticks and wings .
In China 's wet markets , however , you can select your chicken from the poultry guys , who will pluck , carve , and bag your bird in a matter of minutes .
The more expensive chickens at the wet markets are free - range , ol ' skool - style , raised by local farmers who let them run around their neighborhoods and feed them grain or table scraps ( consider the alternative . )
The cheaper birds at the wet markets , not to mention any packaged chicken you 'll find at supermarkets , are factory - farmed .
These are what Chinese people mean when they refer to " chicken that has no chicken taste . "
So , a poultry butcher is a lazy cook 's best friend .
Especially when it comes to making stupidly easy but insanely addictive dishes like Three Cup Chicken .
A Taiwanese dish , three cup chicken consists of bite - sized chicken ( bone - in ) braised with equal parts soy sauce , white rice wine , and sesame oil .
The combination , plus some sugar and a potent amount of garlic and ginger , eliminates the need for any spices .
An essential ingredient to add at the end is Thai or oriental basil , with adds a mild clove - like flavor to the dish .
And it takes only 15 minutes from start to end .

By Wojciech Moskwa and Joergen Frich
OSLO , Aug 14 ( Reuters ) - Norway ’s $ 397 billion sovereign wealth fund said on Friday it now owns 1 percent of the world ’s stocks and signalled the end of its emerging markets asset ramp up after posting its best ever quarterly results for April - June .
Buoyed by a broad financial market rally from the depths of the global downturn , Norway ’s oil fund posted a 12.7 percent return on its investment , or a $ 45 billion gain -- its biggest quarterly gain in relative and absolute terms .
Europe ’s biggest owner of stocks also launched an initiative aimed at fostering dialogue on environmental issues with firms in its portfolio , a blueprint for green activism by often passive institutional investors .
[ ID:nLD26718 ]
Including inflows from oil and gas revenues , the fund grew 14.9 percent in the three months to end June to reach 2.385 trillion crowns ( $ 396.6 billion ) , in line with preliminary figures .
Since June , the fund has swelled above 2.5 trillion .
“ Economic developments showed clear signs of stabilising in the second quarter and the uncertainty over the financial sector decreased , ” the fund ’s executive director Yngve Slyngstad said .
“ The positive development has continued into the third quarter , ” he told a quarterly news conference .
The Government Pension Fund -- Global , commonly known as the “ oil fund ” , invests Norway ’s energy revenues in foreign stocks and bonds to save for future generations .
Norway , whose prudent oil wealth management has helped the resource rich country avoid overheating and high inflation , has 4.8 million people , less than 0.1 percent of global population .
The world ’s second largest sovereign wealth fund after that of the United Arab Emirates has tilted its global investment profile towards Europe to better reflect Norway ’s trade flows .
It owns 1.7 percent of all listed European companies , compared to 1 percent of global stocks .
It also owns 0.7 percent of European bonds and 0.4 percent of bonds in the Americas .
EQUAL WEIGHT IN EMERGING MARKETS ?
Slyngstad signalled that the fund ’s year - long ramp up in asset allocation to emerging markets was over as its proportional holdings in developing markets reaching par with those in developed markets .
“ We have a weight in the emerging markets that is proportionally identical with the developed markets , ” he told Reuters when asked if the fund had reached its desired level of emerging markets exposure .
“ This is a level ( of emerging market exposure ) which is set by the finance ministry , and we have so far not sent a request with a proposal to increase this amount , ” said Slyngstad , who rarely gives forward looking forecasts or comments .
Bouncing back from its worst performance in its 10 - year investment history in 2008 , the fund outperformed its benchmark by 2.1 percentage points during the second quarter .
Slyngstad said the fund had also completed a two - year drive to raise its equity allocation to 60 percent of total assets from 40 percent , at the cost of lower bond holdings .
Because the fund bought a larger than normal amount of equities during the downturn , its share of global stocks has more than doubled over the past year , Slyngstad said .
“ Since the markets turned in March and up until today , the value of the fund has increased by more than 600 billion crowns , ” he said , adding that liquidity was “ beginning to return ” to a number of fixed income markets .
The fund was badly burnt on U.S. securitised debt last year , triggering a formal government review of procedures and changes in the way it actively manages assets , including a sharp reduction in the number of external managers it hires .
The fund 's biggest equity holdings include near $ 3 billion stakes in oil major Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L , food group Nestle NESN.VX and banking group HSBC HSBA.L.
It owns about $ 13 billion worth of both British and U.S. state debt and $ 7 billion in notes from U.S. mortgage lender Fannie Mae FNM.N .
We , the undersigned , wish to declare our support for the direction in which the HTML5 specification is heading .
Its introduction of a limited set of additional semantic elements , its instructions on how to handle failure , and its integration of application development tools hold the promise of richer and more consistent user experiences , faster prototyping , and increased human and machine semantics .
HTML5 is not perfect in our estimation , not that any markup language could be .
In particular , we have significant concerns about some aspects of the specification .
But we are optimistic that the official channels provided by the working group will offer a sufficient and fair hearing of our concerns .

Rasmus Lerdorf is undoubtedly the most famous Greenlandic geek alive .
Having created PHP as a bunch of hackish scripts to support his website in 1995 , he turned it into a powerful , fully fledged language that 's now used by millions around the world .
Linux Format magazine caught up with him to find out more about his position in the PHP camp today and the decisions he made early on that made the project a whopping success .
Linux Format :
How much involvement do you have with PHP development today ?
Rasmus Lerdorf : A lot less now than 10 or 15 years ago , that 's for sure .
But I still read the mailing lists every day , discuss features and fix bugs occasionally .
Personally , I tend to be more interested in security and performance - related issues than other things .
I 'm as involved as I have been in years .
LXF : What 's the structure of the PHP team ?
It does n't seem clear ...
RL : There is no structure !
LXF : Who makes the final decisions ?
RL : We do .
We have a mailing list called Internals that 's completely open – anyone can subscribe to it , read it , post to it and I 've always been insistent on keeping the process transparent .
Anybody can go back and read the mailing list archives to figure out how we got to any one position .
It tends to be that code wins .
If two groups are arguing , but one group has an implementation and the other does n't , well , the implementation wins .
It almost does n't matter how braindead it is ; if we should have the feature , but we can't agree on the implementation , we 'll go with whoever builds it .
LXF : Is there pressure to be the final arbiter of decisions ?
RL : Sure , there is .
I 've always tried to downplay that role , because I do n't want to have the final say in a lot of these things .
I want the project to be self - sufficient and I want it to be self - propelling .
If I 'm in the loop as the decision - maker , I make every decision – that does n't scale at all .
Honestly , there 's a bunch of things I do n't know enough about .
I mean , take Sybase .
I 've never used Sybase in my life .
How would I make an intelligent decision about this versus that with a Sybase extension ?
For a lot of PHP , that 's the way it is .
There are groups of people that are much better off making these decisions .
LXF : Has that slowed down development of PHP 6 ?
It 's been in progress for two and a half years ...
RL : What 's slowing down development on 6 is n't decision making : it 's finding people interested in and capable of doing unicode - oriented programming .
It 's difficult – unicode is n't easy .
There 's a lot of complexity , and there 's also plenty of people who do n't care that much .
From a big - business point of view , everyone wants unicode in there , but from a day - today perspective , a lot of people do n't need unicode because they 're building things for one locale .
Theoretically , everyone wants to go to UTF - 8 eventually .
But it 's one of those ' I 'll get to it later ' things .
It does n't have the same sense of urgency as many of the other features in PHP .
When someone says : " I need this now , " that 's when things start moving .
Developers are responsible for this in their own use , their jobs , their companies , whatever .
That 's not quite there in PHP 6 .
It 's being pushed mostly by the larger companies , because they 're the ones that tend to need internationalisation .
" If you really want to hear about it , the first thing you 'll probably want to know is where I was born , and what my lousy childhood was like , and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me , and all that David Copperfield kind of crap , but I do n't feel like going into it , if you want the truth . "

unicorn : Rack HTTP server for fast clients and Unix
unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve fast clients on low - latency , high - bandwidth connections and take advantage of features in Unix / Unix - like kernels .
Slow clients should only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients .
Features
Designed for Rack , Unix , fast clients , and ease - of - debugging .
We cut out everything that is better supported by the operating system , nginx or Rack .
Compatible with Ruby 1.9.3 and later .
unicorn 4.x remains supported for Ruby 1.8 users .
Process management : unicorn will reap and restart workers that die from broken apps .
There is no need to manage multiple processes or ports yourself .
unicorn can spawn and manage any number of worker processes you choose to scale to your backend .
Load balancing is done entirely by the operating system kernel .
Requests never pile up behind a busy worker process .
Does not care if your application is thread - safe or not , workers all run within their own isolated address space and only serve one client at a time for maximum robustness .
Builtin reopening of all log files in your application via USR1 signal .
This allows logrotate to rotate files atomically and quickly via rename instead of the racy and slow copytruncate method .
unicorn also takes steps to ensure multi-line log entries from one request all stay within the same file .
nginx - style binary upgrades without losing connections .
You can upgrade unicorn , your entire application , libraries and even your Ruby interpreter without dropping clients .
transparent upgrades using systemd socket activation is supported since unicorn 5.0
before_fork and after_fork hooks in case your application has special needs when dealing with forked processes .
These should not be needed when the " preload_app " directive is false ( the default ) .
Can be used with copy - on - write - friendly GC in Ruby 2.0 + to save memory ( by setting " preload_app " to true ) .
Able to listen on multiple interfaces including UNIX sockets , each worker process can also bind to a private port via the after_fork hook for easy debugging .
Simple and easy Ruby DSL for configuration .
Decodes chunked requests on - the - fly .

It must be exhausting to be a monarchist , forever finding ways to pretend a family of cold , talentless snobs are better than the rest of us .
They have to make gold out of mud .
The system of monarchy – selecting a head of state solely because of the womb they passed through , and surrounding them with sycophants from the moment they emerge – produces warped and dim people and demands that we scrape before them .
What 's a poor monarchist to do ?
They can only lavish a thick cream of adjectives – " dignity " , " charm " , " majesty " – over the Windsor family in the hope that some of us are fooled .
This process corrupts even the most intelligent monarchists .
A strange case study is the new , authorised , 1,000 - plus pages biography of Elizabeth Bowes - Lyon ( the " Queen Mother " ) by William Shawcross .
He is a smart man : his study of the secret bombing of Cambodia by Henry Kissinger is extraordinary .
Yet as a monarchist he has an impossible task .
He has to present a cruel , bigoted snob who fleeced millions from the British taxpayer as a heroine fit to rule over us .
His mind turns to mush .
Before the real Bowes - Lyon is lost in a frenzy of royalist rimming , we should remember who she really was : more Imelda Marcos than the good fairy Glinda .
By the time she died , Elizabeth Bowes - Lyon was treating the British Treasury – our tax money – as her personal piggy bank , with her bills running way beyond the millions she was allotted every year .
Even the ultra-Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont complained that " she far exceeds her Civil List and the Treasury gets very het up about it " .
She used the money to pay for 83 full - time staff , including four footmen , two pages , three chauffeurs ( what do they do , split her into three parts for transportation ? ) , a private secretary , an orderly , a housekeeper , five housemaids ... the list goes on and on .
She even insisted that it was a legitimate use of public funds to maintain a full - time " Ascot office " , whose job was to do nothing but keep a register of members of the Royal Enclosure and send them entry vouchers .

She presented this spending ( enough to open and run a new hospital that would save thousands of lives every year ) as an act of selfless patriotism .
Michael Mann , the former Dean of Windsor , who knew her very well , explained : " She feels that Britain is Great Britain and that , therefore , ours must be no banana court .
To lower standards [ i.e. , her spending on champagne , caviar and limos ] is to denigrate the country and , insofar as high standards require big spending , so be it . "
When single mothers take 0.1 percent of this sum from the state , the same newspapers that lauded Elizabeth as " the best of British " savage them as " scroungers " .
If they refused to pay tax – as Elizabeth did – they would have been put in prison .
What did she do to earn these vast sums ?
Her parents were " Lord " and " Lady " Strathmore , and from birth she was waited on by a gaggle of servants including a butler , two footmen , five housemaids , a cook and numerous room maids .
She grew up with four palaces at her disposal , but it was n't enough .
She was obsessed with " bloodlines " , which she believed determined a person 's worth , and wanted to marry into what she regarded as " the best " – the Windsor family .
At first she tried to woo Edward Windsor , but when he was n't interested , she settled for his stammering , highly strung younger brother , George .
When Edward became King , she plotted to force his abdication so George could ascend and she could become " Queen " .
His " crime " was to fall in love with a divorcee – and one with such poor bloodlines !
Once Edward was successfully toppled , Elizabeth insisted that he and his wife Wallace be driven into exile and blanked by royal circles ( the couple had plenty of real flaws , but Elizabeth was blind to them : it was the American - ness and the divorce that she loathed ) .
This was her way with any relatives who displeased her by showing vulnerability .
When her cousins became mentally ill , they were locked in asylums and never seen again .
Elizabeth 's entry in Who 's Who ?
falsely announced that they were dead .
This icy ruthlessness startled people who met her .
In 1939 , the French prime minister Edouard Daladier said she was " an excessively ambitious young woman who would be ready to sacrifice every other country in the world so that she might remain Queen " .
The most striking aspect to Shawcross 's biography is that , once she had contrived to marry , Elizabeth really did n't do anything else for the rest of her life except spend , spend , spend – our money .
He has to pad out whole decades .
She did n't even raise her own children : she would see them for an hour a day and get them to chant : " We are not supposed to be normal .
We are not supposed to be normal . "
But to be fair , she did do one more thing .
In her spare time , she supported far - right politics .
She was a passionate defender of appeasing Adolf Hitler , lobbying behind the scenes to garner support for Neville Chamberlain .
The reasons are plain : even 50 years later , she bragged to Woodrow Wyatt that she had " reservations about Jews " .
Once the war began , she was rebranded as a symbol of Britain 's heroic resistance to the Nazis , but what did she actually do ?
Unlike everyone else , she did n't live on rations , but was fattened by pheasants and venison on the royal estates .
She did n't stay in bombed - out London very much , anything like as much as the myth suggests : she spent much of the war in Windsor , Norfolk and Scotland , far from the Nazi planes , surrounded by battalions of servants .
Elizabeth Bowes - Lyon kept up her support for far - right politics throughout her life .
She did everything she could to bolster the torturing , white minority tyrannies in Rhodesia and South Africa , because – as the journalist Paul Callan , who knew her , put it – " she is not fond of black folk " .
Our beaming Queen Mum was Alf Garnett in a tiara .
She believed Britain 's class system reflected a natural hierarchy , and the people below her creamy , upper tier were inferior .
She told Wyatt : " I hate that classlessness .
It is so unreal . "
At first , she was appalled by the idea of her eldest daughter marrying Phillip Mountbatten because his " bloodlines " were n't good enough : his family had fallen from power , so they were n't " really " royal .
When Diana Spencer started hugging Aids victims and lepers , Elizabeth was disgusted .
When Diana started rebelling , Elizabeth announced to friends that the girl was " schizophrenic " , but she was bemused because Diana came from " a good family " .
The rest of us , by implication , come from " bad families " , where you would expect schizophrenia and other lower - class disorders .
The defenders of Elizabeth were left claiming that her drunken inactivity was itself an achievement .
WF Deedes , the late Daily Telegraph columnist and editor , claimed : " In an increasingly earnest world , she teaches us all how to have fun , that life should not be all about learning , earning and resting .
In a world where we have all become workaholics , there she is ... grinning at racehorses .
Bless her heart . "
He was in favour of the dole after all , provided it was worth £ 3 m and went to one single aristocrat .
William Shawcross has won the favour of his fellow monarchists by taking this curdled life and presenting it as the best of British .
It 's the single most unpatriotic claim I 've ever heard .
If you do n't think Britain can do better – far better – than this nasty leech and her stunted family , then you do n't deserve to live in this Sceptred Isle .

Live and Let Live Faisal Gazi explains why secularism is key to Islam Secularism , as an ideal and a political assertion , has not had an easy ride in traditional Muslim history .
But contrary to popular belief , secularist philosophy is not alien to Islam .
In fact , a close reading of classical and modern Islamic history exposes an ongoing tension between the forces of secularism and theocracy since the medieval age .
Unfortunately , secularism and democracy have not fared much better in modern times for Muslim - majority societies either .
Repressive state - sponsored secular fundamentalism has kept Muslims largely ambivalent , and in many cases wholly hostile , to the idea of secularism .
The institutions of Islamic orthodoxy misunderstand , often wilfully , secularism to mean a Western recalibration of the religious and cultural norms of Muslim societies .
This need not be the case if secularism is understood to mean , first and foremost , a secular state not a secularised society .
To put it simply , secularism is the separation of state institutions and policies from religious institutions and beliefs .
Unfortunately , this simple assertion has aroused , amongst Muslim thinkers , an undertone of paranoia which equates secularism with Westernisation .
In particular , the Enlightenment ideals of individual liberty and freedom , taken for granted in Western societies , are seen as anathema to Muslim societies which elevates the concept of community or Jama'ah to paramount importance .
Absolute freedom of the individual is secondary to public interest and the concerns of the religious community in Muslim - majority societies .
Today a number of Islamist organisations exist , such as Hizb ut - Tahrir , Ikhwan al - Muslimeen ( the Muslim Brotherhood ) and Jamaat - e - Islami , whose ultimate aim is the re-establishment of the Caliphate or the Khilafa which was abolished in 1924 .
The Khilafah movement to which all these organisations subscribe , to a lesser or greater extent , supports the creation of a single totalitarian state encompassing the entire globe under the rule of one Caliph , whose function is to impose one interpretation of Shari'a as law , as opposed to a traditional understanding of Shari'a as a body of ethics .
For the advocates of this ideology , the creation of the Khilafah is nothing less than a religious duty ( fard ) .
The claim that Islam and the Khilafah , or religion and state , are inseparable is a debunked fallacy but this has not stopped Islamists such as the Muslim Brotherhood or Jamaat - e - Islami elevating it to the level of a dogmatic axiom .
However the struggle to separate religion from politics is not alien to Islamic history , rather it is a fundamental part of its historical narrative which began some two hundred years after the death of the Prophet Muhammad .
In the eighth century a school of thought , founded by the philosopher al - Kindi , emerged in the Arab world known as the Mutazilites , or the Rationalists .
This was a group of scientists , philosophers , and poets who stood against a legalistic dogma based solely on the Shari'a which was encroaching into Muslim societies .
The most well - known Mutazilites were Ibn Sina and al - Farabi who had come to be known as the Islamic Hellenistic philosophers because they had incorporated Aristotelian metaphysics and cosmology into their philosophy .
The Mutazilites argued that it was possible to act morally with the use of rational thought alone .
By corollary , they refuted the need to combine religion with the state .
The Mutazilites were opposed by another school of thought called the Asharites which was founded by the tenth century theologian , Ashari .
The Asharites rejected rationalism , and argued that the human mind was not capable of understanding the nature and attributes of God .
By extension , they maintained that the discernment of morality was beyond rational thought .
The Asharites rejected this Hellenistic philosophy because they regarded it as alien and dangerous The Asharites also argued that the state was representative of God 's power on Earth as well as the sole adjudicator of the morality of its citizens .
The Asharites represented the intellectual force which pulled the institutions of the Caliphate towards the institutions of religion .
It boasted such giants as the polymath al - Ghazali , the mathematician Faqr - al - din Razi , and the formidable figure of the fourteenth century historian and sociologist , Ibn Khaldun .
For the next four hundred years the intellectual battle that waged between the Mutazilites and Asharites could be likened to a conceptual football match : the Scientists vs. the Theologians .
The intellectual and philosophical history of this period was dominated by this contest : to find the exact point where the sovereignty of God ( huquq Allah ) ended and where the sovereignty of man ( huquq ibaad ) began .
The greatest minds of the time were drafted into either one or the other side .
Al Ghazali was intimately adept in the nuances of both philosophical positions , but his conservative nature compelled him to side with the Asharites .
He went on to write many treatises condemning the philosophers and scientists and went as far as accusing them with the charge of heresy .
This did not stop him , however , from embedding Aristotelian logic into the principles of Islamic jurisprudence ( fiqh ) .
Ultimately the Asharites , the theologians , won the day , the legacy of which affects us to this day .
Traditional Muslim societies would henceforth place less spiritual value on philosophy , rational thought , and free thinking , and , perhaps most unfortunately of all , the forces of absolute power began to regard religion and state as inseparable entities .
Ironically , the orthodoxy of today reject the ideals of the Enlightenment such as personal liberty and freedom of speech in a kind of perverse echo of the Asharite position of medieval times .
Over the past two centuries , the Islamic world 's stagnation was compounded by the rapid advance of post - Enlightenment Europe and , to add insult to injury , followed by the humiliation of colonisation .
For the first time Muslims were politically subjugated by the European empires of Russia , Holland , Britain , and France .
The weakened power - bases and the moribund institutions of the Caliphate was outmatched for a battle against the forces of colonisation .
Islamic educational , legal , and economic institutions , not to mention the Islamic faith itself , was challenged by Christian missionaries and European imperialism .
After WWII colonialism began to recede , but Islamic nation states were too weak to challenge the secular autocratic military regimes , which filled the vacuum left by Europeans .
Possibly the greatest disservice done to the concept of secularism in the post - colonial Muslim - majority world has not been through Western actors , and certainly not by Islamists , but at the hands of home - grown military regimes that emerged after the end of colonisation .
The concept of secularism is now not only misunderstood , but is increasingly abhorred by many Muslims worldwide .
This is perhaps unsurprising , as recent post - colonial histories have seen the creation of brutal dictatorships ruled by so - called secular leaders who could be just as extremist and dogmatic as their unctuous religious counterparts .
In Egypt , Gamal Abdal Nasser 's secular regime tortured and executed members of the Muslim Brotherhood .
But his tactics backfired with horrendous consequences .
Nasser 's actions can arguably be held responsible for the popularisation of the extremist reactionary Islamist outfit which he so brutally repressed .
In the 1960s , the secular , nominally socialist Ba'athist regimes of Iraq and Syria were even more barbaric than Nasser's .
Meanwhile in Algeria , the National Liberation Front , a secular political party , enjoyed massive support .
But its secular mandate turned ugly when it stepped up a campaign of persecution of anyone who identified with Islam .
It is no wonder that Islamist parties , in spite of their threatening totalitarianism , began to appeal to the Muslim peoples as a reaction to the corruption and viciousness of pseudo - liberal " secular " regimes .
Ironically , the greatest damage inflicted on secularism in the Islamic world was perpetrated by the Turkish despot Kemal Ataturk , who was probably the most successful leader to embark on a tyrannical campaign to overhaul the social norms of a Muslim society .
Ataturk unilaterally abolished the Ottoman Empire , Europeanised schools and colleges , retracted the power and influence granted to religious institutions , and closed down all Sufi orders .
He aligned Turkish society to his personal perception of European society by banning beards , turbans , hijab , even chappals .
He made the Turkish military the enforcers of his secularism to ensure every Turkish man and woman at every level of society was turned out in ill - fitting Western clothing .
Turkey was transformed but only at the cost of an unrelenting social engineering campaign , shoe - horned into public space by a slavish emulation of Western norms .
What Ataturk got away with in 1927 cannot and should not be attempted in the 21st century .
However , there is a change in the air as more Muslim thinkers begin to re-evaluate democracy and secularism , pushing forward the idea that the two must go hand in hand in order for individuals to live freely and without persecution in their countries .
The recent mass protests in Iran , the democratic electorates voting out Islamist parties in Bangladesh and Indonesia signal a desire for change .
Muslim attitudes are , once again , coming round to revisiting the ideas originally argued and proposed by the Mutazilites .
As Ziauddin Sardar , a prominent Muslim thinker in the West , says : " Writers and thinkers in Iran , Pakistan , and Turkey began to argue that secularism had a role to play in Muslim societies .
But if Muslims were to accept secularism , both secularism and religion had to be reformulated . "
Some of these " reformulators , " academic and political philosophers , include Sardar himself but also Abdul Wahab al - Effendi , Hamza Yusuf , Abdul Hakim Murad , Javed Ghamdi , and Abdullahi An - Na'im , to name a few .
It is worth noting that these thinkers have all largely arrived at a similar conclusion on the efficacy of a secular state in spite of coming from diverse academic , theological , and religious backgrounds .
Modern Muslim secularist thinkers are agreed that secularism is not an ideology or a belief that can be injected into society like a " displaced " alternative belief system .
Or in other words , a pseudo - religious doctrine applied , usually by force , into the public space , as Ataturk tried to do .
Instead , they advocate secularism as a pragmatic social and political philosophy which influences democratic process along with other normative ideas such as pluralism and human rights .
All of these underpin the ideals of the liberal , democratic state .
Notably , it is the Sudanese Muslim scholar , Abdullahi an - Na'im whose deep understanding of the dynamics of nominally " Islamic states " has demonstrated how secularism can inform aspects of law and governance in the Islamic context .
In the social sense , an - Na'im argues for " public reason , " a notion based on the liberal philosophy of John Rawls .
" Public reason " is applied to public decisions forcing public policy to be based on evidence and fact and free from religious influence .
For example , if Bangladesh were legislating for equal inheritance rights for women , as is currently the case , secularism would ensure that the decision would be subjected to input from public debates , empirical data , social factors , anecdotal evidence , the opinions of non-Muslim minorities , as well as other forms of " public reason " and secular ethics , and not solely upon the reliance on divine law .
Secularism is simply a prescription of how the state conducts itself in relation to the individual .
The state is a political institution not a breathing life form .
Which is why it cannot be " Islamic " -- a quality peculiar to personal faith .
The same applies to a " community . "
Neither the state nor a community can believe in God or practice a religion .
Logically , it is the individual who believes and practices a faith and can only do so freely when the state is secular .
In this sense , the state must be neutral towards religious belief so as to ensure that the individual has complete free will to believe in religion or not .
Coercion by the state does not guarantee that the individual would believe in a religion or not , which is why the state must in all cases maintain neutrality in order for religious pluralism and practice to develop and mature .
Secularism in Bangladesh , as in many other Muslim - majority nations , is misunderstood both by its supporters and its detractors .
Far from being anti-religion , secularism is actually necessary for religions to thrive , facilitating the freedom to practice religion without persecution .
Secularism explains why diverse Islamic creeds flourish in places like Britain and North America .
The failure to adopt secularist principles also explains why Sufi shrines , like that of Shah Jalal , are bombed in places like Sylhet and Pakistan .
If democracy is to succeed in Bangladesh , secularism must become a non-negotiable principle of a healthy and thriving liberal democracy .

Microsoft today is spinning up a new 501.c non-profit effort as a forum to support open source community projects .
The new effort is called the CodePlex Foundation and it builds on the efforts of Microsoft 's Codeplex site .
The timing of this foundation , during the same week in which it was revealed that Microsoft was allegedly trying to unload anti-Linux patent is somewhat curious , do n't you think ?
The foundation is initially being funded by Microsoft and will be led by Microsoft's Sam Ramji ( ** UPDATED ** Ramji is leaving Microsoft on September 25th ) .
Novell 's Miguel de Icaza will be part of the new foundation 's Board of Directors ( do n't forget Microsoft and Novell have an interop and patent deal ) .
So why does Microsoft need its own open source foundation ?
And what 's the difference vs what they are doing with Codeplex.com anyways ?
A Microsoft FAQ on the new foundation notes that Codeplex was started in 2006 as a project hosting site that met the needs of commercial developers .
The Foundation is related but is a seperate effort .
Dick Armey calls Medicare " tyranny "
While seniors across the country are worried about cuts to Medicare under health care reform , Dick Armey thinks that the popular program is " tyranny . "
The former House Republican majority leader and current chairman of conservative group Freedom Works characterized Medicare as such on NBC's " Meet the Press " because seniors are forced to participate .
" Why do they not let people who do n't want to be in , out ? "
Armey asked Sunday , highlighting the cost of the program to the federal government .
" This is important ... The anti-health care reform lobby thinks that Medicare is tyranny , " said an incredulous Rachel Maddow , the NBC weekday host who was seated next to Armey on the panel .
The skyline over Denver will be busy with military helicopters today , as the Colorado National Guard trains for its mission as a responder in the event of a biological , chemical or nuclear attack .
Civil Air Patrol volunteers will stage a disaster scene beginning at about 9 a.m. , and some “ victims ” will be airlifted to Pepsi Center as part of the training , said Capt .
Michael Odgers , spokesman for the National Guard .
About five helicopters will be used , UH - 60 Black Hawks and CH - 47 Chinooks , with guardsmen aboard , he said .
The training also will includes flights to and from Colorado Springs and Pueblo , with the exercise expected to wrap up about 5 p.m. , according to Denver police .
The helicopter training over the city is similar to the day - and evening - long event last summer by active - duty military personnel that alarmed some residents when it began unannounced a few weeks before the Democratic National Convention .
Denver police announced the exercise Wednesday and urged media to publicize it .
Swept up by revolutionary fervor in the late 1970s , many Iranians assumed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was a pragmatist .
However , Khomeini had assimilated theocratic ideas unsuccessfully expounded by Ayatollah Fazlollah Nuri during the Constitutional Revolution seven decades earlier .
Khomeini went on to augment Nuri 's belief - that clergymen must rule because secular governance fails to follow divine will - with Maslaha or fundamentalist Muslim interests .
Khomeini then used his personal popularity and revolutionary authority to install an absolutism centered on velayat-e faqih or guardianship of Islamic jurists headed by an autocratic supreme leader .
The current supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei follows the tenets of his late teacher , regarding himself as God 's singular representative on Earth .
To a growing number of Iranians , however , religious fundamentalism is a luxury they can no longer afford .
Half of them are under the age of 40 with no ideological connection to the Islamic Revolution of 1979 .
Their difficulties and desires of life take precedence over doctrine and dogma .
At least 12 percent of adults are unemployed .
An inflation rate of about 20 percent saps their meager purchasing power .
They face a housing shortage .
They are frustrated as well by 30 years of sociopolitical repression impinging on all aspects of daily life in the name of religion .
As a result , orthopraxy is equated with fundamentalism by them - and both are rejected .
Khomeini 's statecraft went not only against the historically secular ideals of most Iranians but violated the politically quietist attitudes of most mullahs .
Many Shiite clerics believe they should only be offering advice to lay administrators .
Indeed , all 12 imams or infallible spiritual guides of Shiism as practiced in Iran warned against the lure of molk or secular power .
Since Khomeini was respectfully called an imam only in the sense of a religious teacher , other Shiite clerics contend he should not have overridden established traditions .
Involvement of Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri , Grand Ayatollah Asadollah Bayat - Zanjani , Ayatollah Jalaleddin Taheri , former President Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , former President Seyyed Mohammad Khatami , the late first supreme leader 's grandson Seyyed Hassan Khomeini , and mullahs in the Association of Teachers and Researchers of Qom and in the Association of Combatant Clerics at Tehran indicates how far theocracy has fallen from grace .
It is particularly telling of the un-theocratic mood in Iran that conservative madrasa students at Qom , Mashhad , and Esfahan , usually vocal about the role of their faith , are not demonstrating in favor of hardliners like Khamenei and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Inherent contradictions within the Islamic Republic of Iran are gushing forth .
But keep in mind that it still is possible for the fundamentalist state to prevail if mullahs put their collective self - interest before all else .
A majority of members in the Assembly of Experts - which can dismiss Khamenei from the post of supreme leader - have chosen a middle path so far , chastising both their own chairman Rafsanjani and President Ahmadinejad for endangering the theocracy .
Clerics close to the supreme leader are suggesting that Ahmadinejad , the proximate generator of tensions , be ditched to salvage the larger status quo of a Shiite theocracy .
As governance of the Iranian state is contested once more , the leaders and people of other nations are grappling with how they should and should not respond .
US President Jimmy Carter met and toasted the last Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in November 1977 when the imperial Iranian regime was becoming not just more secular but more brutal .
Iranians working toward a pluralistic and democratic society at that time felt Carter chose national security interests over humanitarian needs .
Those feelings reinforced antipathy for American and British involvement with the overthrow of Iran 's Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq in 1953 .
The negative emotions erupted publically during the Islamic Revolution .
Utilizing the familiar rhetoric of " death to " and " great Satan , " but switching targets , Iranians now are denouncing the leaders of Russia , China , and other countries in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the BRIC group for choosing strategic needs over basic ones by meeting with Ahmadinejad as his regime brutalizes its people allegedly on behalf of Islam .
Interestingly , external support in quashing the gholat or religious extremists is regarded by Shiites as God 's helping hand .
The Ottoman Turks defeating Ismail Safavi in the early 16th century is cited positively even by mullahs .
Quoting Islam 's Prophet Mohammad , Rafsanjani directed a pointed remark at Khamenei and Ahmadinejad , " Leave the people if they do not want you ! "
Montazeri enjoined as well , " A political system based on force ... is illegitimate .
Taking action against it entails paying heavily , but will be rewarded greatly by God . "
Historical and current circumstances suggest Iranians eventually will succeed in separating faith from state .
They will not reject Shiism , but return it to its appropriate place in society .
Iranians know well too that they are not under the spell of interfering foreigners .
So circumstances suggest that leaders and peoples of other nations should assist vigorously those Iranians striving for liberty from ever - present religion .
This post concludes a series on privacy , stemming from Cory Doctorow 's book Little Brother ( on the Libertarian Reading list ) .
A common response in support of trading privacy for security is " I have nothing to hide " or some variation to that regard .
However , the " nothing to hide " argument assumes privacy is about secrecy / deception , or as Bruce Schneier puts it , " ... they accept the premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong .
It 's not . "
Rather , privacy is most often an issue of accountability and trust .
Here 's an extreme example of this point from Little Brother :
There 's something really liberating about having some corner of your life that 's yours , that no one gets to see except you .... There 's nothing shameful , deviant or weird about [ getting naked or squatting on the toilet ] .
But what if I decreed that from now on , every time you went to evacuate some solid waste , you 'd have to do it in a glass room perched in the middle of Times Square , and you 'd be buck naked ?
The NSA surveillance , data mining , or other government information - gathering programs will result in the disclosure of particular pieces of information to a few government officials , or perhaps only to government computers .
This very limited disclosure of the particular information involved is not likely to be threatening to the privacy of law - abiding citizens .
Only those who are engaged in illegal activities have a reason to hide this information .
Although there may be some cases in which the information might be sensitive or embarrassing to law - abiding citizens , the limited disclosure lessens the threat to privacy .
Moreover , the security interest in detecting , investigating , and preventing terrorist attacks is very high and outweighs whatever minimal or moderate privacy interests law - abiding citizens may have in these particular pieces of information .
This promotes conformity and discourages free expression , as the surveillance of even legal activities discourages their use
However , the combination of surveillance and processing created the haystack in the first place
If there is a medical test that is accurate 99 % of the time ... about a disease that occurs in 1 out of 10,000 people , then the expected value of testing one million people would be the following :
Healthy and test indicates no disease ( true negative )
1,000,000 * ( 9999 / 10,000 ) * .99 = 989901
Healthy and test indicates disease ( false positive )
1,000,000 * ( 9999 / 10,000 ) * .01 = 9999
Unhealthy and test indicates disease ( true positive )
1,000,000 * ( 1 / 10,000 ) * .99 = 99
Unhealthy and test indicates no disease ( false negative )
1,000,000 * ( 1 / 10,000 ) * .01 = 1

Terrorists are really rare .
In a city of twenty million like New York , there might be one or two terrorists .
Maybe ten of them at the outside .
10/20,000,000 = 0.00005 percent .
One twenty - thousandth of a percent .
Terrorism tests are n’t anywhere close to 99 percent accurate .
More like 60 percent accurate .
Even 40 percent accurate , sometimes .
What this all ( means ) is that the Department of Homeland Security ( has ) set itself up to fail badly .
They ( are ) trying to spot incredibly rare events - a person is a terrorist - with inaccurate systems .

Instead of finding 10 terrorists , the test would label millions of citizens , who likely love their country , as enemies of the state

Privacy holds a social value
Data from the World Values Survey has dispalyed a significant correlation between confidence in state institutions with effective democracy ( Confidence in non-state institutions shows no correlation ) .
If government security measures continue to intrude on privacy , the relationship between citizens and government institutions will continue to decline .
One of the very few proper roles of government is upholding contracts , maintaining the trust necessary for the free market to work effectively
Privacy is , first and foremost , about trust and accountability
However , one of the handicaps in the battle against privacy invasion is the vague definition attributed to " privacy . "
Daniel J. Solove does not attempt to provide one standard definition , instead referring to privacy as a " web of related problems .
" This web goes beyond the typical complaints of surveillance , including information processing and dissemination .
Solove expanded , " The problems still exist regardless of whether we classify them as being ' privacy ' problems .
" Since " I have nothing to hide " is a poor argument , Solove rephrased it to make it stronger :
While this argument is stronger , it is still flawed .
First , the original assumption of " hiding a wrong " remains .
Second , intense data mining , especially impersonally by computers , looks for irregular / nonstandard trends in collected data .
Essentially , this data mining approach creates suspicion out of irregular / nonstandard behavior .
Advocates of security over privacy will often justify their position on data mining by touting the technology as the solution to finding a needle in a haystack ..
These techniques also create a problem known as the false positive paradox .
However , as Doctorow points out inLet 's assume that a terrorist test is 80 percent accurate .
In New York City , the test would indicate false positives for overcitizens .
Unfortunately , the U.S. judicial system has consistently ruled in favor of security over privacy .
Solove concludes , " ... the lack of Fourth Amendment protection of third party records results in the government ’s ability to access an extensive amount of personal information with minimal limitation or oversight .
"
The courts ruled this way because plaintiffs were unable to meet the court 's demand to prove harm caused by privacy invasion .
However , like the environment , overtly harmful single events rarely occur .
Rather , harm occurs as very small events compile over time .
The extent of harm caused in an individual case should not be the judicial litmus test for its legality .
In ( 1989 ) , the court ruled , " Privacy is inherently personal .
The right to privacy recognizes the sovereignty of the . " ; it need not conflict with the interests of society as a whole .
I touched on this social value in a previous post
The courts risk further eroding institutional trust if they do not , at the very least , begin upholding the privacy clauses in contracts .
Privacy is not all about secrecy and deception ( " hiding a wrong " ) - although it can be used for such purposes .
Authorities closed eastbound 60 Freeway near Perris Boulevard in Moreno Valley on Saturday afternoon after an officer shot a carjacking suspect who fled onto a highway off - ramp .

Steve Hanke and Alex Kwok just published a paper calculating last year ’s hyperinflation in Zimbabwe , when “ conventional inflation measures were not available . ”
Their conclusion is that in mid-November , prices were doubling every day .
That means Zimbabwe ’s hyperinflation ranks second worst in world history .

Hey guys .
Just to let you know , there was a SECRET double update yesterday .
I did a comic with a punchline involving AIDS recently , but decided to take it down .
In addition to being perhaps a bit over the line even for me , it 's probably not ideal for publishing reasons .
I 'm still wrestling with this choice , but for now it seems to be the right one .
And the bonus for you guys is an extra comic if you click back to that day .
I 'm working on a votey comic right at this moment , so if you check back in an hour or so , it should be up .
Also , some crazy people are paying way too much for the current PW ads .
So please make them feel like it was worth it by giving a click .
thanks !

The world first went into " ecological debt " in 1980 , according to Nef The recession has had little impact on humanity 's over - consumption of resources , says a report .
The New Economics Foundation ( Nef ) calculates the day each year when the world goes into " ecological debt . "
This is the date by which humanity has used the quantity of natural resources that ought to last an entire year if used at a sustainable rate .
This year , " ecological debt day " falls on 25 September - just one day later than in 2008 .
According to Nef , this means that the biggest recession for nearly a century has made very little difference to global consumption .
The report , entitled The Consumption Explosion : the Third UK Interpendence Day Report , asserts that the overall trend of our collective ecological footprint is deeply negative , with humanity still environmentally over - extending itself to a dangerous degree .
Debt - fuelled Andrew Simms ,
Nef policy director and co-author of the report , said : " Debt - fuelled over - consumption not only brought the financial system to the edge of collapse , it is pushing many of our natural life support systems toward a precipice .
" Politicians tell us to get back to business as usual ; but if we bankrupt critical ecosystems , no amount of government spending will bring them back .
" We need a radically different approach to rich world consumption . "
Calling for an end to the consumption explosion , he said that while billions in poorer countries subsist , " we ( in the rich West ) consume vastly more , and yet with little or nothing to show for it in terms of greater life satisfaction . "
The report calls for an end in particular to what it calls " boomerang trade " , where countries simultaneously import and export similar goods .
For example , the report says the UK imports 22,000 tonnes of potatoes from Egypt and exports 27,000 tonnes back the other way .
While 5,000 tonnes of toilet paper heads to Germany from the UK , more than 4,000 tonnes is imported back .
The report calls for us to pay the full environmental cost of transport , and calls for more investment in renewable energy .
It also rejects suggestions that reducing the size of the Earth 's human population would help the environment , claiming this focus is a critical distraction from tackling over - consumption in wealthy countries .
It points out that one person in the US will , by 4 am on the morning of 2 January , already have been responsible for emitting as much carbon as someone living in Tanzania would generate in an entire year .
It says that a UK citizen would reach the same position by 7 pm on 4 January .
Nef used figures from the Global Footprint Network to make its calculations .

This page is an updated version of this one where Traci first appeared as our guinea pig .
The deficiencies in human vision are many , but few are as striking and demonstrable as this one .
It 's a fact that our perception of colour is not as detailed as our perception of black and white .
This is the primary reason the NTSC standard works as well as it does - we can't tell that it 's ripping us off .
If it looks just as good then it must be jsut as good , right ?
What you 're about to see is incontrovertible proof that your eyes suck at blue .
It 's totally true - you see more details in green colours than red or blue , and you might be surprised how far you can go before you notice any actual difference in image quality .
Now , please meet Traci :
This is an unmodified picture , straight off the digicam and reduced in size .
Now what I 'm going to do is reduce this image into its primary colour components , each consisting of a single hue image of 256 shades : one red , one green , one blue .
If you look closely you may notice the blue one looks kind of dark and blurry , and the green one looks pretty clear .
The same image in 4 flavours .
If you combine the three single - colour images you 'll end up with the one on the left .
The next step is to reduce the resolution of one layer , and recombine the images .
Here 's a small version of what each slice looks like when there is a 3 x reduction in detail .
Each pixel in these images is nine times larger than the ones above .
As you can see , reducing the blue detail hardly makes an impact at all , even when you know it 's there .
Try looking at the diagonal line on the hood of the car .
You can just barely make out some yellow fringing , a bit of stair - steps where the blue detail is reduced .
This is why DVDs , JPGs , and NTSC video can cut the detail in the colour channel - sometimes to an extreme extent - and still not cause riots when consumers realize they 've been bilked .
They just do n't notice , and if you do n't notice you do n't care .
The above images are reduced in a very granular fashion - the pixels are large and square edged .
If you were to increase their size in a fashion that blurred them , similar to how JPG , DVD + NTSC do , you 'd be able to get away with much greater reductions without noticing much reduction in quality .
Consider the following images , which were reduced by a factor of four , instead of 3 as above :
You sure notice when someone tampers with your green !!
The difference with red is certainly noticable , but not to the same extent that the green channel is .
Mucking with the blue channel of course leaves you with basically no effect .
This is how DVDs work : a high res green image and two low - res images , one for red , one for blue .
Please check

Now , about those specifics :
The HELP plan achieves near - universal coverage through a combination of regulation and subsidies .
Insurance companies would be required to offer the same coverage to everyone , regardless of medical history ; on the other side , everyone except the poor and near - poor would be obliged to buy insurance , with the aid of subsidies that would limit premiums as a share of income .
Employers would also have to chip in , with all firms employing more than 25 people required to offer their workers insurance or pay a penalty .
By the way , the absence of such an “ employer mandate ” was the big problem with the earlier , incomplete version of the plan .
And those who prefer not to buy insurance from the private sector would be able to choose a public plan instead .
This would , among other things , bring some real competition to the health insurance market , which is currently a collection of local monopolies and cartels .
The budget office says that all this would cost $ 597 billion over the next decade .
But that does n’t include the cost of insuring the poor and near - poor , whom HELP suggests covering via an expansion of Medicaid ( which is outside the committee ’s jurisdiction ) .
Add in the cost of this expansion , and we ’re probably looking at between $ 1 trillion and $ 1.3 trillion .
There are a number of ways to look at this number , but maybe the best is to point out that it ’s less than 4 percent of the $ 33 trillion the U.S. government predicts we ’ll spend on health care over the next decade .
And that in turn means that much of the expense can be offset with straightforward cost - saving measures , like ending Medicare overpayments to private health insurers and reining in spending on medical procedures with no demonstrated health benefits .
So fundamental health reform  reform that would eliminate the insecurity about health coverage that looms so large for many Americans  is now within reach .
The “ centrist ” senators , most of them Democrats , who have been holding up reform can no longer claim either that universal coverage is unaffordable or that it wo n’t work .
Items are often the lifeblood of a multiplayer game .
Without those bullets , that armor or that glowing green dot that gives some random gauge a momentary boost , youâre basically fucked .
A key item - grab can turn the tide of battle in your favor , give you those few extra seconds of life , even revive your dead grandparents so you can tell them you love them one last time .
Thatâs why itâs so excruciatingly painful to watch the item you just earned through cold - blooded murder get snapped up by some jerk who couldnât score a headshot if he were fighting an enemy made entirely of heads .
It wasyou who caused that roasted leg of lamb to pop out of that orc by shooting it with an arrow , and by God , it should be you who walks over it , instantly absorbing it into your being as health .
Getting your collision detection stripped , so that from now on you pass through all items like a tortured wraith , unable to pick up or interact with anything , wandering through player - created maps for all eternity .
6 Quitting Out ( Envy )
Imagine It :
When you booted up Mario Strikers that evening , you never imagined youâd be in for the fight of your life .
But when the lobby computer decided to pit you against a player with a 156 and 0 record , you knew there was no turning back .
Let the Bagel Bites burn , you said .
Itâs go time .
After a scoreless first game spent slogging through quicksand , evading Thwomps , and running shrieking from a 50 - foot Luigi , you cram some blackened Bagel Bites down your gullet and itâs back to the slaughter .
Early in the second game , you tragically let a mega - strike by when the Wiimote slips out of your bagel - greased hands , leaving you down by two .
Thatâs when you catch your second wind .
Suddenly youâre unstoppable , making two goals in rapid succession by leaping the goalie with Toadstool .
Finally , with ten seconds on the clock , you make your move , blasting your opponentâs goalie with a shock - shell .
Totally paralyzed , the goalie can only watch in mute horror as Birdo nudges the ball past him .
Your victory assured , you sit back and congratulate yourself on a job well done .
Thatâs when youâre booted out to the lobby .
A screen informs you that your opponent quit the game one fifth of a second before your victory could be counted .
And you suddenly realize , you didnât beat a great player after all .
You beat a flaming asshole .
The Army is set to introduce a new mental - health test of unprecedented size and scope as part of its increasing efforts to improve soldiers ' mental wellness amid the strain of repeated deployments .
Come October , the service will require all its active duty , National Guard , and reserve soldiers to take a test that will help identify potential problem areas for soldiers .
The 170 - question test will look at physical , mental , emotional , spiritual , and family issues and then recommend follow - on training as needed .
The program comes as the Army is tackling rising suicide rates , divorce , and depression among thousands of soldiers returning from war .
But unlike other programs , which seek to intervene when a soldier 's issues have already been flagged by other screening methods , this program aims to be more proactive .
About 4,000 soldiers have already taken the test under a pilot program begun with the help of the University of Pennsylvania .
" We recognized that we did not have a good preventive and strengthening model for psychological health , " said Brig .
Gen. Rhonda Cornum , chief the Army 's Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program .
" We talk about it a lot – we say all the time , being ' Army Strong ' is not just being physically fit , it 's about mental and emotional maturity , compassion and all those great qualities .
But we did n't know how to measure them and improve them . "
Cornum is particularly well - suited to lead the effort .
During the 1991 Gulf War , she was riding in a helicopter that was shot down inside Iraq .
She was held captive for eight days and experienced the indignities of being a female prisoner of war , including sexual assault .
For an institution that molds warriors , the program will test the ability of the rank and file to move beyond the natural stigma of talking about feelings .
James Quick , a fellow at the American Psychological Association and a retired Air Force colonel , says such a program aims for more thorough wellness .
" Most people understand the physical rigor that is required of combat troops , " he said .
" But the mental - health attributes are equally as important . "
The results of the assessment will remain confidential – withheld even from soldiers ' commanders .
The results are intended to help the soldier find appropriate training or counseling .
The effort is a good one , but it does n't get to the root of the problem , says Larry Korb , a former Pentagon official and now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress .
" The fundamental problem that they 're not dealing with is that they 're not giving people enough rest between deployments , " he says .
The military has long pushed its force to the brink and must take substantive steps to give its force the rest it needs , he says .
That seems unlikely as the Obama administration girds for a surge of forces in Afghanistan .
" I understand they have no choice , but somebody 's got to say enough is enough , " Mr. Korb adds .
Thirty years ago , Sony began selling a device which would not be an easy sell today .
It was a portable music player with a battery life of around three hours , with which you had to choose the music you wanted to listen to before setting off on your journey , could only play tracks in a set order , and ran a good risk of literally chewing up your media .
At the time , though , the launch of Sony ’s Walkman was revolutionary : the portable cassette player allowed people to listen to music on the move without having to carry a boombox on their shoulder .
Or , in the case of my family , it kept my sister occupied on car journeys without the rest of the family having to sit through Enid Blyton audiobooks for the thousandth time .
The BBC marked the anniversary by asking a 13 - year - old boy to replace his mp3 player with a Walkman for a week .
There ’s some interesting insight to how the device has aged but , at the ripe old age of 32 , I must admit the article exposed cultural differences beyond technology .
The boy complained that “ the weight of the unit is enough to haul down a low - slung pair of combats ” , which only made me wonder why he did n’t invest in a belt .
He also noted the nostalgic response of a teacher , but revealed the incident came about because “ In some classes in school they let me listen to music . ”
Among the other problems the child encountered , which are of course hilarious to anyone who ’s ever operated a Walkman , and perfectly understandable to anyone else , was that he took several days to realize the tape could be turned over , and that he mistook the ‘ Metal ’ switch for a genre - specific form of a graphic equalizer .
Still , youthful ingenuity is n’t dead yet : the child created his own shuffle function by holding down the rewind button and releasing it at a random point .
Sadly one person who wo n’t be cashing in on the anniversary is John Young , the designer of the Retropod .
It ’s pictured above and if you thought it was simply a Walkman , take another closer look .
It ’s actually a customized carrying case for the iPod :
Unfortunately Young had to stop selling the product after Sony ’s lawyers complained that consumers “ will be misled into thinking that Sony is backward in its design of products and is going away from miniaturization , as the size of the tape player housing is quite large by today ’s standards . ”
For British users , the anniversary also brings back memories of one of the most unlikely tributes to consumer electronics , Cliff Richard ’s Wired For Sound :
After 30 years , one question does remain unanswered about the device .
How come when my sister and I got identical Walkmans one Christmas , hers lasted for a decade and mine was defunct within months ?
The Mufti allied himself with the Nazis
Israeli embassies are being instructed to use for public relations purposes an infamous photograph of Adolf Hitler meeting a top Palestinian cleric .
Far - right Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has personally requested that the photo be sent to missions around the world , a senior official said .
The 1941 shot shows the Nazi leader meeting the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem .
The US is pressuring Israel to end a Jewish building project at a hotel once owned by the cleric , Amin al - Husseini .
AFP news agency quoted an Israeli official as saying the move by Mr Lieberman was linked to the row over the Shepherd Hotel .
" It is important that the world know the facts , " a spokesperson for Mr Lieberman told the BBC , without giving further detail .
Haj Amin al - Husseini was a Palestinian nationalist leader who led violent campaigns against Jews and the British authorities in what was then British - ruled Palestine in the 1920s and 1930s .
He fled the territory in 1937 , but continued his campaign to oppose British plans to set up a Jewish State in Palestine , allying himself with the Nazis during World War II .
He died in Lebanon in 1974 .
The meeting with Hitler took place in November 1941 in Berlin , during which Husseini asked Hitler unsuccessfully to back Arab independence and publicly oppose the future creation of Israel .
Last week US officials reportedly summoned Israel 's ambassador to Washington and requested a stop to the project to build 20 apartments at the Shepherd Hotel site in Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood .
It was bought in 1985 by American Jewish millionaire Irving Moskowitz .
The site is in East Jerusalem , which Israel has occupied since 1967 .
It has annexed the occupied territory and declared all Jerusalem Israel 's eternal capital in a move that has not been recognised by the international community .
Palestinians hope to establish their capital in East Jerusalem , as part of a two - state peace deal with the Israelis .
They say Israel uses settlement and demolition orders to try to force them from the area .
First cash payouts to families who delay having a child as India 's population threatens to overtake China's
Thousands of couples in India who agreed to put off having babies for at least two years after their wedding will collect cash payments this month as health officials attempt to curb the country 's rapidly growing population .
While neighbouring China shows the first signs of relaxing its strict policy of one child per couple in the face of an ageing population , India is searching for a way of restricting the size of families as the battle over scarce resources grows .
The country 's population stands at 1.2 billion and is expected to reach 1.53 billion by 2050 .
But increasing pressure on resources means that there is barely enough water and food to go round .
A pilot project in the Satara district of Maharashtra has proved a success and other states , including Delhi and Assam , are now considering cash incentives .
Satara , funded by the National Rural Health Mission , is offering couples a reward of 5,000 rupees ( £ 62 ) if they delay having a child for two years ( 70 rupees a day is a good wage in rural areas ) .
If they wait another year , they receive a further 2,500 rupees .
The birthrate in the district rose from 16.5 births a thousand people in 2005 to 17 in 2007 .
The project initially attracted 977 couples , but that figure has risen to 2,366 .
Satara has about 25,000 marriages a year and 80 % result in the birth of a child within the first year .
Only 155 couples on the programme left to have children .
The first cheques are to be issued on 15 August , with officials cautiously optimistic about a reversal in the birthrate , which is now down to 16.1 per thousand .
Couples who take part are also eligible for family planning advice and free condoms .
In China , officials in Shanghai told couples last week that they could take advantage of exceptions to the one - child policy .
The move was seen as a reaction to the city 's ageing population and to years of population decline .
Indian health officials could be forgiven for feeling envious of Shanghai .
More than 27 million children are born in India every year and half the population is below the age of 25 .
If the projections are correct , India will overtake China to become the world 's most populous nation by 2050 .
Vivek Baid , president of the Mission for Population Control , said India could no longer sustain large families , and that it should now aim for zero population growth .
" We feel that two children is a necessity , but that a third is not required .
It is better for families to control their family size , " he said .
" People 's economic situation is not improved by having more children .
It places them under greater financial pressure and exposes them to malnutrition and disease and they do not have the money for education and clothes . "
Indians have traditionally had large families , partly to counter the effects of high infant mortality .
The preference for a male child has also led to large families as couples continue to try for a boy .
Falling infant mortality rates and better education meant many families were now prepared to subscribe to the two - child solution , Baid said .
But India was never likely to adopt the Chinese model .
" Family is a must among villagers .
People would break the rule , " he said .
India 's health minister , Ghulam Nabi Azad , raised eyebrows last month when he suggested that the best way to curb population growth was to provide electricity to rural areas .
Couples would spend more time watching television and less time making babies , he suggested .
Although his suggestion was regarded as frivolous in some quarters , Azad was making a serious point .
With the country 's population increasing by 18 million a year , he urged couples to wait until they were 30 before they married and started a family .
" It 's a great concern .
We need to work at supersonic speed to curb population growth , " he said .
Other politicians have taken a harder line .
The health secretary of Karnataka state – population , 64 million – used the recent World Population Day to call for couples who had more than two children to be jailed .
India 's approach to population control has been anything but consistent .
Jawaharlal Nehru , the country 's first prime minister after independence , considered a large population to be an asset for a poor country .
That did not stop India introducing its first family planning programme in 1952 , promoting the use of contraceptives , although it was not a great success .
By the 1970s , under Indira Gandhi , India was pursuing an aggressive policy of forced sterilisation for men with two children or more .
That was abandoned when Gandhi was forced out and a more moderate policy of " Hum do , hamare do " ( one family , two children ) was adopted .

The first paragraph of this article definitely caught my attention .
It said , “ One Dutch retailer refusing to stock the PSPgo is an isolated incident .
But when the Aussie branch of EB Games says “ no , thanks ” as well , you ’ve got a trend on your hands . ”
Wow !
Really ?
First off , I definitely want to hear from the Australian readers .
They mention that GAME and JB Hi-Fi will still be carrying the system , but does EB Games not carrying it affect your decision to buy it in anyway ?
And / or were you ever even intending to buy it in the first place ?
Second , my two cents .
Now as of right now I have no plans on buying a PSPgo , but things can definitely change down the road .
That said , from a consumer ’s point of view I think it sucks that Australia ’s branch of EB Games , EB Games being one of the biggest video game retailer ’s in the world , will not be carrying the latest incarnation of Sony ’s handheld .
But since I ’m not a regular patron of EB Games , they ’ll neither gain nor lose my business when and if I ever decide to buy own .
But from a business point of view , I kind of understand why they did it …
Let ’s compare the PSPgo to the iPhone , of which AT&T is the exclusive retailer it here in the U.S. Both the PSPgo and the iPhone have no physical “ cartridges ” that hold their games or applications on , they are all received digitally .
Also , both the iPhone and the PSPgo have very little profit to be gained by the retailer from sales the actual device .
With that said , when AT&T sells the iPhone they still make money from the consumer for monthly service fees for at least the next two years .
Now when EB Games were to sell a PSPgo , that ’s where their profit gains cease .
There ’s no misconception that EB Games makes the majority of it ’s money of the sale of the video games of consoles .
And that their highest profits come from sales of used video games .
So here ’s the question :
If you were a company where the majority of your money came from the sale of used video games , would you support a system that if it does well will hurt you financially in the long run ?
Or would you not support it in the hopes that your company ’s shunning is it ’s undoing ?
Definitely a mixed bag of tricks on that one .
One last thing , I will be at SPX this weekend .
And I will be keeping up with the happenings via my Twitter account .
So if you want to know what ’s going on at SPX or just follow me for fun , here ’s a good time to do so .
Texas Republican Pete Olson probably figured he could get away with using a young child as a propaganda tool at a recent town hall meeting -- but he was in for a big surprise .
Republican Congressman Olson ( R - TX ) tells the townhall about a mother who was turned away by the free market doctors for her unborn child 's heart defect .
She was denied by the free market doctors but persisted and was able to find a specialized doctor and got a very delicate operation and a heart transplant 17 days after he was born .
Olson then claims that the public option would have denied him the needed health care and he would have died !
After being challenged he abruptly ended the discussion .
Watch as he is challenged , and clueless as to what to say .
As Olson spews out his talking points , people in the crowd repeatedly point out to him that it was n't the government who turned this poor child away , it was the insurance companies .
Olson was absolutely gobsmacked when people started calling him out on his obvious gaffe as he stood there looking like a deer caught in the headlights .
It ’s so encouraging to see some town hall video from health care reform supporters giving these GOP shills a taste of their own medicine !
Yet another example of the price South Carolina must pay for its AWOL governor :
The governor allowed some economic development initiatives to take a back seat during his secret trip .
Sanford was invited to — but turned down — a dinner invitation June 24 with representatives from a company looking to expand its S.C. operation , according to e-mail records .
The company ’s name was redacted .
Sanford also declined a June 25 celebration event for a plant expansion by a S.C. business because his schedule was " just absolutely jammed this summer , " wrote a staffer in an e-mail .
So on the one hand , Mark Sanford thinks the stimulus was the wrong way to go about stabilizing and boosting the economy .
On the other hand , he thinks his sex life is more important than meeting the private businesses who he says are the only way to truly grow the economy .
Apparently , Mark Sanford just is n't interested in the kind of jobs that South Carolina needs -- jobs that will put people back to work .
Should have known it would n’t be long before Chuck Norris roundhouse - kicked his way into the birther controversy .
On the heels of World Net Daily ’s “ exclusive ” today , the action hero and conservative wingnut has penned an open letter to President Obama , who turns 48 tomorrow , calling on him to release additional evidence that he is indeed an American citizen .
Nevermind that a “ Certification of Live Birth ” ( a/k / a the document you or I would use to obtain a license or passport ) was released by Obama ’s campaign , that officials in Hawaii have repeatedly confirmed that he was born there , that Obama ’s 1961 birth announcement has been unearthed in Hawaii newspapers , that organizations including FactCheck.org have investigated claims that Obama is not a natural - born citizen and determined they ’re BS — Norris would still like Obama to “ request , release and give permission to make public ” his original birth certificate .
Norris says he does n’t buy into the Obama ’s - not - a - citizen hoopla per se , but for the good of the nation , if nothing else , he believes the administration should put this whole nasty business to rest once and for all .
From Norris ’ letter :
Believe it or not , I ’m not writing you to challenge whether you were born in America , though I see nothing wrong with the American public voicing that constitutionally based grievance with someone in your esteemed position .
As one blogger wrote , after all , “ We are n’t talking about a 12 - year - old qualifying to play Little League here . ”
Or as Ronald Reagan once said , “ Trust but verify . ”
Personally , I must admit that I find it a bit of a groundless stretch not to believe in the birth announcements in two major Hawaiian newspapers in August of 1961 , in which the Hawaiian Health Department would have been required to post information they received directly from hospitals : “ Mr. and Mrs. Barack H. Obama , 6085 Kalanianaole Hwy. , son , Aug. 4 . ” Nevertheless , that proof still does n’t answer why you refuse to reveal your original birth certificate and end the growing tides of controversy .
I ’m writing you because this is no longer a matter merely about proving a presidential prerequisite in the Constitution .
Refusing to post a copy of your original birth certificate is an unwise political and leadership decision that is enabling the birther controversy .
The nation you are called to lead is experiencing a growing swell of conspirators who are convinced that you are covering up something .
So why not just prove them wrong and shut them up ?
If the birther movement is truly full of a bunch of conspiracy - fringed kooks or “ zombies , ” as the Los Angeles Times proclaims , then prove once and for all that you are a naturally born citizen by posting your original birth certificate .
And all the controversy will fade away like the pains of childbirth .
Nicht dass ich die Junge Freiheit gerne oder freiwillig lese , wer will sich schon braunes Gedankengut aneignen .
Aber bei der Lektüre des Interviews mußte ich feststellen , dass man der Jungen Freiheit da nicht viel vorwerfen kann .
Klar haben die die Fragen mit widerlichen Hintergedanken gestellt , aber das sind alles Fragen , die mal gestellt werden mußten .
Es ist eine Schande , dass das vor der Jungen Freiheit kein Journalist getan hat .
Z.B. fragen die da , wie man als Bürgerrechts - Partei gegen Zensur im Internet sein kann , und dann jemanden wegen minder krassen ( lies : nicht strafbaren ) Nazi-Äußerungen rausschmeißen kann .
Oder die Frage , ob sie nicht insgeheim doch eher links sind .
Mit wem sie koalieren würden .
Ob Zensur weniger schlimm wäre , wenn sie in Form von Bevormundung von Linken käme .
Sind das angenehme Fragen ?
Keineswegs .
Aber das will man doch als Wähler vor der Wahl wissen !
Die Piraten haben klare Aussagen zu solchen Fragen bisher gerne vermieden , und so war ich einigermaßen überrascht , wie der Herr Popp dann da souverän die " nicht nur der Staat zensiert "
Frage zu einer Antwort über Netzneutralität genutzt hat , anstatt sich in rechte Verschwörungstheorien hereinziehen zu lassen .
Kurz gesagt : ich fand das Interview gut und richtig , und ich fand die Antworten von Herrn Popp gut .
Die Leute , die da jetzt groß heulen und zähneklappern , haben offensichtlich inhaltlich überhaupt nichts vorzubringen , die Kritik hängt einzig und alleine daran , dass das Interview der Jungen Freiheit gegeben wurde .
Sind wir jetzt soweit in diesem Lande , dass nicht mehr die Frage zählt , sondern wer sie stellt ?
Auf der Gegenseite findet aber niemand etwas daran , wenn CDU - Politiker der Springer - Presse Interviews geben .
Und die arbeiten mit mindestens so lenkenden Fragen und bringen am Ende nur die ihnen genehmen Auszüge .
Daher rufe ich den Heulern und Zähneknirschern mal folgendes zu : verlogenes Pack !
Update : Jetzt mailt mir jemand , das wahre Problem sei ja , dass die JF mit solchen Artikeln ihre Wahrnehmung als Nazi-Postille abschwächen und ihr rechtes Gedankengut unter die Bevölkerung bringen will .
Hintergrund ist wohl die Theorie , dass man unsere Kinder davor schützen kann , Nazis zu werden , indem man sie nie mit Nazi - Gedankengut in Kontakt geraten lässt .
Wie gut das funktioniert , wenn dann doch mal Nazi - Gedankengut vorbei kommt , sieht man an … den Nazis .
Die Bevölkerung damals war auch eher unvorbereitet .
Nazi-Gedankengut bekämpft man nicht mit Karantäne sondern mit offen darüber sprechen .
Das erinnert mich immer an meine Ami-Freunde .
In den USA wird alles krankhaft desinfiziert , wenn auch nur das kleinste Bakterium vermutet wird .
Und wenn die Amis dann mal Urlaub in Mexiko machen , bricht deren Immunsystem sofort zusammen .
Ein starkes Immunsystem muss man sich erarbeiten , das entsteht nicht durch Leben in einem Reinraum .

Florida , Texas , Louisiana , and California are lobbying the government for up to $ 80,000,000,000 [ $ 80 billion ] in loans to bolster their flood insurance programs .
Providing residents of these areas with flood insurance lowers their costs .
This amounts to a federal subsidy for those living in hurricane zones .
Subsidies , like taxes are inducements to change behavior .
You can think of a subsidy like a negative tax–or a rebate .
A tax is a fee charged to someone for doing something .
A subsidy is a payment made to someone for doing something .
Subsidizing flood insurance for those who live in hurricane zones makes it cheaper for people to live in those zones .
This attracts more people to these areas then would naturally choose to live there .
When a hurricane inevitably destroys these areas again , the government will have to pay billions of dollars in insurance claims .
Then they will spend more money redeveloping the area .
Then they will again offer subsidized flood insurance to the residents of the area , lowering the cost of living , and thereby encouraging more people to move there .
Then another hurricane will hit the area …
This has happened so many times before .
It will likely happen again and again in the future .
While the money is being asked for in the form of loans , the terms of the loan proposals are explicitly clear that if there is a disaster , the federal government will have to pick up the tab .
The government should not subsidize people to live in disaster prone areas .
Doing so does not make sense .
It provides financial incentives for people to make a bad ( or at least life threatening ) decision .
It forces the rest of society to pay for these bad decisions .
The government should get out of the private insurance business .
It should let the market determine where people should live .
The Republican governors of two of the States , Louisiana and Texas have rejected some of the funds from the “ stimulus ” bill , but they have no problem in asking for larger handouts from the federal government .
Scientists believe that global warming will lead to an increase in the number and intensity of hurricanes .
This makes subsidizing people for living in hurricane zones a much more reckless proposal .

To test your skills , and help you learn to recognize Arial vs Helvetica , I ’ve taken 20 Helvetica logos and redone them in Arial .
( Blasphemy ! )
A lot of them are just plain awful in Arial .
But a couple of them are actually tough to tell apart .

Weiner introduces bill to kill Medicare
Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - NY ) says he plans to introduce a politically - targeted amendment forcing Republicans to vote " yes " or " no " on continuing Medicare , the government - run health care program for seniors , on the 44th anniversary of its enactment .
Weiner [ who plans to vote yes , obviously ] said he wants to tack the amendment onto the health care bill being marked up today -- to call bluff on Republicans who say federal intervention into health care has been a failure .
" It ’s put - up or shut - up time for the phonies who deride the so - called ‘ public option ’ , " Weiner said .
Weiner is targeting reps like Dr. Tom Price ( R - Ga. ) , who penned an op - ed in today 's POLITICO with the following contention :
Going down the path of more government will only compound the problem .
While the stated goal remains noble , as a physician , I can attest that nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government ’s intrusion into medicine through Medicare .
Because of Washington ’s one - size - fits - all approach , its flawed coverage rules and broken financing mechanisms , seniors are increasingly having care rationed while federal health spending spirals out of control .
40 years ago -- from August 15 to August 18 , 1969 -- hundreds of thousands of young people gathered for three days of ``peace , love and music ' ' .

SAN JOSE , Costa Rica ( Reuters ) - Costa Rican President Oscar Arias received treatment at home for the H1N1 swine flu virus on Wednesday , and officials said his symptoms were mild and he could recover by next week .
Costa Rica's President Oscar Arias walks in his residence after a meeting with Spanish Vice President Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega , Ibero - American General Secretary Enrique Iglesias and Secretary General of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) Jose Miguel Insulza in San Jose in this file picture taken August 3 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Juan Carlos Ulate / Files
Health ministry doctors tested people who have been in recent contact with the president , including members of his Cabinet , Arias ’ office said , a day after announcing he was ill with a mild case of the virus .
The 68 - year - old Nobel Peace Prize winner is the first head of state known to have contracted swine flu , which has spread around the world since April and could eventually affect 2 billion people .
Arias was being treated with the antiviral Tamiflu for symptoms like body aches and a sore throat , but was working on his computer and answering the telephone , presidential spokeswoman Lisbeth Barbosa said .
“ He will probably be back to a full schedule next Monday , ” she said .
More than 20 people in Costa Rica have died of swine flu , which was declared a pandemic on June 11 and has killed more than 800 people worldwide .
The World Health Organization stopped trying to get a precise count of flu cases .
Arias is considered a high - risk case because he also suffers from asthma .
He began feeling sick over the weekend and was tested for H1N1 on Monday .
Vice Health Minister Ana Morice on Wednesday afternoon told Costa Rican television that Arias no longer had a fever and was mainly suffering from a sore throat .
Last month , Arias brokered talks to resolve the political crisis in Honduras , where a de facto government unrecognized by most of the world has been holding power since the army ousted President Manuel Zelaya in a June 28 coup .
Negotiations broke down two weeks ago over whether the interim leadership would let Zelaya return to power .
Arias ’ illness is unlikely to affect the situation .
Behavior that almost led to systemic collapse would never have been permitted in a rational universe .
Imagine , for instance , allowing individual students to pay individual professors for good grades and allowing those same professors to co-write student papers in ways that would guarantee A’s .
But in the Wild West world of deregulated industry , this behavior was not just permissible but standard operating procedure .
With the explosion in structured products , rating agencies reaped a fortune from the very issuers who structured the products .
In some cases , the rating agencies would actually work on structuring the products with the debt issuers to ensure that they achieved the best rating possible .
And the more complicated the structured transaction , the more money the rating agencies stood to make .
The big losers in all this , of course , were the pension funds , mutual funds and others who relied on “ investor grade ” ratings , which turned out to be little more than voodoo science .
So what are government regulators prepared to do to avoid this calamity from happening again ?
As Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Schapiro testified this week , the SEC has taken incremental stepsto ban rate shopping and prevent employees from structuring the products they rate and is open to imposing liability standards on the firms .
This is all to the good but does not address a root cause of this problem , which is that the very companies whose products are rated are the same companies paying for the rating .
And as history has shown us time and time again , he who pays the piper calls the tune .
After the events of the past year , it is frankly outrageous that there is no outcry from our leaders to truly overhaul the current rating system .
Tinkering at the edges is not enough .
And make no mistake : allowing public companies to continue determining ratings for products issued by the very same firms which pay them is no different than allowing the wolf to guard the hen house .
Because rating agencies are unable to make unbiased decisions about the credit worthiness of increasingly complicated structured securities , they should no longer be the arbiters of creditworthiness .
Instead , we need an independent regulatory agency , which can police the creditworthiness of these products without interference from issuers .
Based on its recent history , I am not at all certain that the SEC has the ability to police these complicated products .
One option , though by no means the only one , is to have a central issuer - funded pool financing a quasi - independent agency whose job it would be to rate structured financial products .
The current proposals by the SEC still do not go far enough .
Preventing rating shopping wo n’t do much to solve the problem if rating agencies still know that clients will likely choose the firm which will give them the best deal .
Similarly , disclosing that an issuer paid for the rating wo n’t do much to protect the consumer if that consumer has few other options in a market where issuers routinely pay for ratings .
Like inductees in a 12 - Step program , some in Congress have acknowledged that the financial industry has played an outsized part in determining public policy , to the detriment of their constituents .
Banks and others are now girding for a battle over the creation of a new consumer protection agency and that battle will heat up exponentially over the course of the next several months .
The way debt is issued and valued is a key component in protecting consumers .
It ’s up to the Obama Administration and Congress to ensure that on this most basic of fronts , consumers are indeed protected .

I argued on Monday that Vice President Joe Biden did not intend , by his remarks on Sunday , to give Israel a US go - ahead to bomb Iran .
The fall - out from such an attack on US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan would be dire , which is one reason I ’m quite sure Obama does not want such a thing .
In an interview on CNN , President Obama on Tuesday clarified his stance on Iran and also denied that Vice President Biden ’s remarks on ABC on Sunday were intended to give Israel a green light to bomb Iran :
‘ Obama was asked on CNN this morning , “ Are you giving Israel a green light ? ” “ Absolutely not , ” the president replied .
“ And I think it ’s very important that I ’m as clear as I can be , and our administration is as consistent as we can be on this issue . ”
“ I think Vice President Biden stated a categorical fact which is we can’t dictate to other countries what their security interests are , ” Obama added .
“ What is also true is that it is the policy of the United States to try to resolve the issue of Iran ’s nuclear capabilities in a peaceful way through diplomatic channels .
That is our policy , I have been talking about this for the last two years , we are going to continue to pursue this , and you know we have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and solve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East .
“ Now this is a tough job and nobody is under any illusions that it will be easy , and I ’ve always said that we , the United States , preserve the right , and I as the commander in chief preserve the right to take whatever actions are necessary to protect the United States .
But we are committed to a peaceful resolution to this conflict and I think it is still possible , but ultimately if we present an opportunity to the Iranians at some point , they ’ve got to seize that opportunity . ” ‘

Thousands of Japanese citizens queued outside a Tokyo courtroom today to witness the most radical change to their country 's criminal justice system since the second world war with the introduction of trial by jury .
Inside , six people chosen at random from millions of voters became the first Japanese people for three generations to decide whether a fellow citizen walks free or pays for his crimes .
The jurors – five women and a man – were chosen from a pool of 47 people this morning to take their seats in court later in the day .
Their task : to decide an appropriate punishment for Katsuyoshi Fujii , a 72 - year - old man accused of stabbing a neighbour to death earlier this year .
They and three professional judges at Tokyo district court will sentence Fujii , who has admitted killing 66 - year - old Haruko Bun .
The lay judges must arrive at a majority decision and have the assent of at least one professional judge for the sentence to stand .
Until today the only exposure Japanese below a certain age have had to genuine courtroom drama has been textbook accounts of historical trials or cross-examinations by Raymond Burr in TV repeats of Perry Mason .
Modern Japanese trials , by contrast , managed to turn potentially dramatic murder trials into something approaching the public reading of a weighty legal text .
Japan introduced trial by jury in 1928 but abolished it in 1943 , when its leaders tightened their grip on power at home as the tide of war began to turn against them .
While justice officials today hailed a new era of openness , the men and women expected to dispense justice have mixed feelings about their new role .
Some look forward to the prospect of handing out justice to their fellow citizens , while others live in dread of the day they might be called on to consider sending another human being to the gallows .
A recent survey found that one in four potential jurors were unwilling to serve , even though their absence could land them a 100,000 yen ( £ 600 ) fine .
The landmark legal change came amid widespread criticism of the glacial pace of trials for serious crimes and the absence of lawyers during the questioning of suspects – a practice police have exploited to force confessions that are later used in court .
Verdicts and sentences were decided by panels of judges , with 99 % of criminal trials ending in a conviction .
Penal reformers hope the " citizen judges " will be more sympathetic to defendants who say they were forced to confess .
" With the change , trials will become more democratic , " said the justice minister , Eisuke Sato .
" We hope to achieve a justice system that is speedier , more accessible and reliable . "
Protesters outside the Tokyo district court said the new emphasis on speed – a verdict in Fujii 's case is expected on Thursday – would allow miscarriages of justice to continue .
" Lay judge trials only force unwilling people to take part in trials , and their conclusions will be the same as those made by professional judges [ under the old system ] , " said Shunkichi Takayama , a lawyer .
Legal experts have conducted hundreds of mock trials in recent years to allay fears among potential jurors .
The public 's fascination with western - style justice will intensify when lay judges are asked to rule on a case in which the death penalty is an option .
Although capital punishment enjoys wide public support , progressive lawyers believe jurors will find the noose a punishment too far .
In recent years Japan has come under fire for its enthusiastic use of capital punishment , just as the practice is being abandoned in other countries .
Last week it executed three men on death row , bringing the number of hangings to seven this year .
It hanged 15 people last year , the highest number since 1975 .
With the Motorola Android Event less than 2 weeks away , chances are the mysterious Motorola device that just passed through the FCC with T - Mobile bands , 3G , Wi-Fi and other distinguishable similarities is the T - Mobile destined Motorola Morrison !
If the phone making the rounds really is the Morrison , it comes with Model number T56KV1 .
We ’re pretty sure this thing will be officially announced on September 10th and as of now the rumored launch date is October 21st .
The timing seems spot on and we hope the rest is clockwork .

... If reports of his attempting to block a lawful DoJ investigation of CIA - related crimes are true ...
Brad Friedman Byon 8/28/2009 , 2:55 pm PT
I have come to see very little difference between CIA chief Leon Panetta 's reported attempts to intercede in a Dept. of Justice investigation into Bush / Cheney Era war crimes and illegal torture by members of the CIA , and the reported attempts of folks like former Sen. Pete Domenici ( R - NM ) and former Congresswoman Heather Wilson ( R- NM ) to similarly inject themselves into a DoJ investigation ( in their case , to force one over phony " voter fraud " allegations and other politically - based investigations of Democrats ) leading up to the U.S. Attorney Purge under George W. Bush .
Why should the Director of Intelligence have any say within the DoJ and / or White House administration , over what and who is investigated when crimes have allegedly been carried out ?
The fact that he has been attempting to do so --- as reported recently , including as late as today by the New York Times --- seems clearly inappropriate , and should lead to his immediate dismissal or resignation as far as I 'm concerned ...
Reports the Times today :
In July , Leon E. Panetta , the C.I.A. director , tried to head off the investigation , administration officials said .
He sent the C.I.A. ’s top lawyer , Stephen W. Preston , to Justice to persuade aides to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to abandon any plans for an inquiry .
It 's one thing to argue against the release of certain documents , such as the 2004 CIA Inspector General 's report [ PDF ] on our government 's use of torture , or against the release of photographs said to document abuse of detainees , etc. , as reported elsewhere previously .
I 'd disagree with him , but he's in his rights to argue within internal administration deliberations against such things on behalf of his department .
It 's quite another matter entirely to attempt to stop , or affect in any way , an independent Dept. of Justice investigation into possible crimes .
If he 's done that , he should be forced to resign .
Am I wrong ?
If so , why ?
By the way , Fox " News " and other wingnut outlets are helping to float the rumor that Panetta may be resigning under protest of the recently - announced lawful DoJ investigation .
If he does , great .
Let him come out and talk about it and voice his objections publicly .
That would be the appropriate way to voice his concern , as opposed to attempts at exploiting his insider status , to skew the wheels of justice .
I do n't believe he 'll do that , but that would be fine by me .
On the other hand , it seems to me he should resign or be fired for his outrageous attempt at obstructing justice if , in fact , the reported allegations of him attempting to do so are actually true .
For any Progressive who argued for accountability of Domenici , Wilson , and the others who inappropriately attempted to politicize the Justice Department ( Rove , Gonzalez , et al ) when they attempted to affect legal investigations one way or another from the inside , to argue differently now in the case of Panetta seems rather hypocritical to me .
But perhaps I 'm missing something .
You 'll let me know .
But anyone willing to meet the expected $ 3,000 ( £ 1,835 ) price tag should be warned that the double screen is likely to push the weight of the Spacebook significantly above standard laptops .

( CNN ) --
If all goes according to plan , cancer survivor Kyle Garlett will compete in October 's Ford Ironman World Championship , a grueling triathlon made up of a 2.4 - mile ocean swim , a 112 - mile bicycle ride and a 26.2 - mile run .
Heart transplant recipient and cancer survivor Kyle Garlett will compete in October 's Ironman World Championship .
And he 'll do it with another man 's heart pumping in his chest .
" I do n't think there 's anybody who would n't consider me a success story and a survivor , " Garlett said .
His medical issues began in 1989 when he received his first Hodgkin 's disease diagnosis as a high school senior .
In 1995 , during his third battle with the cancer , doctors ceased his chemotherapy treatment when they discovered it had weakened his heart .
Two years later , Garlett learned he had secondary leukemia as a result of chemotherapy to treat the Hodgkin's , and three more years of chemotherapy ensued .
And after five years on the waiting list , he received a new heart in 2006 .
Now , the 37 - year - old savors his body 's capabilities .
" It 's kind of like the starving person who all of a sudden finds himself in front of a buffet .
And now I 've got the buffet .
I 've got my all - you - can - eat plate , and I 'm just loading it up , " Garlett said .
A heart transplant may seem extremely daunting , but Garlett saw it as a more hopeful operation than his years of cancer treatments .
" Going in for chemotherapy , as a patient you know what 's happening .
Your body is being poisoned and you know that when you come out on the other side of it , you 're going to have given up something , " said Garlett , a sportswriter and motivational speaker living in Marina del Rey , California .
" On the heart transplant , though , it was completely the opposite .
I knew that from the day of the transplant on , every day I 'd be getting stronger .
And they were now doing something that was going to fix me , improve my life . "
Garlett , who says he's " not a klutz " but " definitely not a natural athlete , " trains about 15 hours a week for October 's Ironman in Kona , Hawaii .
Closer to race time , he expects to spend 20 to 25 hours a week in intense training to achieve his goal of finishing within the 17 - hour time limit .
Garlett was invited to compete in the elite event because organizers believe he " demonstrates the Ironman mantra : Anything is possible , " said Blair LaHaye , director of communications for Ironman .
LaHaye said a handful of athletes are invited to take part in the event each year , but their inclusion does n't reduce the number of slots for those who get in by doing well in qualifying events , or by winning a spot through the Ironman lottery .
Garlett will compete in a half - Ironman or other long - distance event before Kona to validate his selection .
The training and competition are demanding enough for competitors without health issues .
But being a heart transplant patient comes with the extra challenge of getting the organ to beat at an acceptable rate .
" When the old heart comes out , all the nerves are severed .
And when the donor heart comes in , the nerves are not connected , " explained Dr. Jon Kobashigawa , medical director of the UCLA Heart Transplant Program , where Garlett is a patient .
In a person whose heart is intact , " the brain will tell the heart , ' Let 's go , start exercising , let 's start beating faster , ' " Kobashigawa said .
A donor heart , however , relies on circulating adrenaline in order to get it going .
As a result , heart transplant recipients must warm up thoroughly to get their heart pumping properly .
The " denervated " heart works about 80 to 90 percent as well as a normal heart , Kobashigawa said , " but through exercise , these patients who do strenuous activities , I believe , do get their exercise capacity almost to the normal range , if not normal . "
It 's also possible , doctors say , for the donor heart to re-innervate -- or grow nerves onto the donor heart .
Following in his footsteps
Garlett is on a trail blazed by Dwight Kroening , the first heart transplant recipient to complete the Ironman , last year in Canada .
Kroening , now 49 , got a new heart in 1986 after his swelled to about twice its normal size for unknown reasons .
He was 26 at the time -- a gym teacher , coach and athlete .
At first , running with his students became a struggle .
Within days , he could n't walk up a flight of stairs without stopping to rest .
Soon , combing his hair and brushing his teeth became too taxing , he said .
When doctors examined him as a candidate for a heart transplant , they told him his heart was working at 8 percent of its normal capacity and he probably had about two months to live .
Kroening began exercising a week after the surgery , but soon discovered he was incapable of athletic activities that required sprinting , he said .
" I [ told my doctors ] , there 's something wrong here .
I 'm not able to do these things .
And they said , ' Of course not , ' " Kroening said .
" So being me , I was more or less bound and determined to prove that they were wrong , that I could actually train myself to be able to do these things , " he said .
But overcoming those hurdles was n't easy , even after 22 years of practice .
Three - quarters of the way into the Ironman 's bicycle leg , Kroening felt ill and fatigued , he said .
He questioned whether he would be able to finish .
He did , in 15 ½ hours -- one hour longer than his target .
Watch Kroening compete in the Ironman »
" When we test [ heart transplant recipients ] on the treadmill , their peak heart rate is around 140 beats [ per minute ] and they can maintain that for one minute .
...
When Dwight did the Ironman , we recorded his heart rate , and he was able to exercise at a heart rate of 133 beats per minute for 15 ½ hours , " said Mark Haykowsky , a professor of rehab medicine at Canada 's University of Alberta .
Haykowsky studied Kroening for research on exercise habits of heart transplant recipients .
Since the Ironman , Kroening has competed in other events , including a marathon and a triathlon .
He may compete in another Ironman next year in Arizona , the state where he received his heart transplant .
" I relate [ the Ironman ] to what I guess would be like childbirth , " Kroening said .
" In the process , you 're thinking , ' I 'll never do this again in my whole life .
This is absolutely crazy . '
But I think probably about three days later that I started thinking , ' Now this might be something that I might want to do again . ' "
' The ultimate price '
Both Garlett and Kroening say promoting organ donation motivates them to compete in these endurance challenges .
Kroening also says he wants to make the most of his " orphaned " heart .
" I wish I could meet my donor family and ... thank them personally , " Kroening said .
" [ I want to let them ] know for 23 years , I 've been taking good care of their son's heart . "
Garlett , too , recognizes his donor 's family , who provided the heart of a 42 - year - old construction worker who died on the job .
" I never lost sight of the fact that that moment for my family of great joy was only going to be coming ... with somebody else having to pay the ultimate price like that , " Garlett said .
" And that always was in my head , and this man who gave me his heart would always be with me . "

According to an SEC filing released today , the internet ’s favorite electronic retailer Newegg will be going public .
The offering is being underwritten by JP Morgan , Bank of America , and Citigroup .
A date and ticker symbol have yet to come , but the IPO will likely happen before the end of the year .
Newegg has been around since 2001 , and sales in 2008 are purported to be over $ 2 billion .
Newegg prides itself on speedy delivery and low cost on some of the most popular electronic goods , and has become a go - to establishment for the cheapest prices on the latest consumer electronics with a computing emphasis .
The issuing is expected to bring in $ 175 million for Newegg which , according to the sec filing , will in part be used to expand their business to Canada and China .

Improving Bulgaria 's transport infrastructure is a key and urgent prerequisite for the country 's economic development .
It is for this reason that close to a quarter of cohesion funds as been assigned to this objective .
This is written in the chapter for Bulgaria of the annual country assessments of the European Economic Recovery Plan , approved in November last year in the peak of the global financial and economic crisis .
The report shows that the weak uncoordinated and inefficient administration , as well as corruption , has led to substantial delays in current projects .
That is why , these challenges need to be tackled with the utmost urgency and as a first priority the document suggests that the road infrastructure agency should be re-organised .
The report was presented as an accompanying document to the public hearing , held on Friday in Sofia and organised by the Single Market Observatory of the European Economic and Social Committee , called : " Bulgaria and the single European market " .
Beside the above mentioned , the report outlines several more challenges that Bulgaria needs to face , like improving the business environment , cutting the red tape on local and national level , as well as improving competitiveness through increasing productivity , decrease of energy expenses and orienting the economy towards more science and green technology .
According to the conclusions in the document , Bulgaria is the most energy - intensive economy in the EU and is particularly vulnerable to energy price shocks .
It is recommended that Bulgaria makes a transition towards low - carbon economy and increasing the long - term potential of the country for economic growth .
With regard to the improvement of the business environment and the reform of the administration , most concrete recommendations were made by Vasil Velev , member of the Economic and Social Council of Bulgaria ( ESCB ) .
He reminded that in Bulgaria it is still a practice some illegal licenses to be administered , mostly on local level .
Besides , quite often there are willing or unwilling mistakes in the interpretation or translation of the European legislation and sometimes , the harder license is being selected for the Bulgarian legislation .
A body to oversee the implementation of legislation is also lacking .
For example in many legislative acts the respective decrees from the e-government law and the trade register law are not included .
Vasil Velev also pointed out that Bulgaria is lacking a reasonable effect estimation of the legislation over business .
Quite often laws are being worked out in comfort to the administration instead the business and the citizens .
Last but not least Mr. Velev outlined the problem with the silent refusal , incorporated in Bulgarian legislation .
" Unless the silent agreement is not explicitly agreed in a law , the principle of silent refusal is default .
The position of the business and the ESCB is that it must be vice versa - unless silent refusal is explicitly agreed in a law , then the default principle should be the silent agreement " .
The ESCB wants an overall review of the current legislation and the preparation of proposals for Parliament to incorporate the requirements of the law for restriction of administrative regulation and the e-government law in all respective laws .
Another recommendation of the Council is the utmost simplification of all procedures and services , administered by the local and national authorities .
A very good example for unnecessary complication of the relations between the business and the administration , according to Vasil Velev , is that each company pays its obligations to the National Revenues Agency by writing 30 payment orders instead of doing it with 1 document , 1 signature , 1 tax of the bank and the state to be obliged to distribute in the necessary proportions the necessary installments .
The administration still requires the business to provide it with documents for the actual status of companies , documents for no obligations to the state , as well as certificates showing no previous conviction .
And all this in spite the decree for e-government , requiring the administration to get these documents internally .
The ESCB also propose a alleviation of the annual financial reports of micro- and small enterprises because they are to a large extent the same as for the big enterprises .
In Bulgaria there are some 700 big enterprises and over 250,000 medium and small enterprises which makes them 90 % of all .
At the moment there is a process going on in the EU of changing the relevant Directive , but the position of Bulgaria is reserved .
Regarding the single market , the chairman of the ESCB Mr. Lalko Dulevski said that the Council insists on a single European concept on the matter .
He also put forward the following questions : " Is it possible for us now to talk about a single European market of labour , given the current distinctions on basic indicators like productivity of labour , wages , employment and unemployment ?
Let me clearly underline , with a lot of examples for national protectionism , and low workers ' mobility ?
And let me put the question in another way - can we , after all , think and go to development of criteria that can help us say that Europe has the foundations of a single market of labour ? "
On his part , the minister for labour and social policy Mr. Totyu Mladenov said that Bulgaria needs to better adapt to the single market by realizing structural reforms of the labour market , education and the social sector .
In its position for this year regarding the legal impediments for competitiveness , the European Economic and Social Council shows that the internal market is not yet fully established because the EU law has still not led to the effective functioning of the market in crucial areas like finance and energy .
Regarding finance , the EU is already moving ahead towards common regulation and standardization .
However , due to he lack of political will for a common energy policy , the issue with energy cannot be solved so far .
So , 3 years after the last enlargement of the Union , we can hardly say that it has a well functioning single market .
And the harms can easily be seen , especially in times of global crises .

There is a state of emergency in the city of Vaughan after a tornado touched down , damaging a number of homes .
Vaughan 's fire chief is confirming that luckily , no one suffered serious injuries .
" It 's amazing when you do see the destruction and it's amazing that no one , absolutely no one has serious injuries , " said Greg Senay , York Region Fire Chief .
At least 120 families are being " permanently evacuated " from their homes .
" By declaring a state of emergency , it allows us to procure equipment faster and quicker , " said Vaughan mayor Linda Jackson at news conference late Thursday .
" It allows us to open emergency shelters and access other agencies to provide us with more assistance . "
He warns that there are still hydro wires down and gas leaks in the area .
" We 're here for the long haul .
We 're here tolook after you , " he said at the news conference .
Part of Vaughan Mills mall was also destroyed due to the storm .
It was one of at least two tornadoes have touched down in Southern Ontario .
Another near Owen Sound left one person dead .
Emergency shelters are set up at :
- Father Ermanno Bulfon Community Centre 8141 Martin Grove Road , south of Langstaff Road in Woodbridge
- Maple Community centre , 10190 Keele Street , near Major MacKenzie Drive in Maple
Anyone in Vaughan who requires more information can call 905-832-2281 .
Multiple homes were destroyed on Tierra Avenue in the Rutherford Road and Highway 400 area .
The roofs were ripped off .
Cars in the area were flipped over by wind .
A number of families are now homeless .
Up to 30 police cars and ambulances were on scene .
" It looked like an explosion , " said Jeff Carnavale who was in the area when the storm hit .
" All you saw was wood and dust everywhere and for the next five to ten minutes , debris is falling from the sky . "
" I'm in the window near my house , and I see it looks like the roof picked up like this and flew all over , " one woman from the area told CP24 as she motioned with her arms .
" I 'm so scared . "
Falling trees have knocked down hydro lines in the area .
It also appears one home in Mississauga caught fire because it was hit by lightning .
Environment Canada had warned people to take shelter .
The warning included Toronto , Vaughan , Richmond Hill , Markham and Newmarket .
Videos and photos submitted to CP24 by viewers show tornadoes touching down in the Vaughan area .
There were multiple power outages reported by Toronto Hydro and Hydro One .
There was flooding at Ontario Place , on Lake Shore Boulevard , and in parts of Whitby and dozens of cancellations at Pearson International Airport .
Residents of the town of Durham , located in Grey County , reported severe tornado damage on Thursday afternoon .
At least one person died .
The town 's Home Hardware store appears to have been hit and is now missing most of its roof .
" We have also had someone in the Blue Mountain area reporting they 've seen a tornado , " says Environment Canada 's Geoff Coulson .
" Most of the activity to this point looks like it 's going to stay west and north of ( Toronto ) . "
Deputy Mayor Dan Sullivan , deputy mayor of Durham , reports significant property damage and multiple injuries , saying several trailers were blown over in the town 's conservation area .
There are also some reports that houses have been completely levelled .
Brenda Ailles was in her trailer in the conservation area that was hit when she heard several loud snapping sounds .
She came outside to find downed trees surrounding her trailer .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper , currently on a tour of Canada 's North , expressed his concern .
" We share our thoughts and prayers with any who have lost lives or have dislocation because of this , " Harper said .
" Obviously the government of Canada , where appropriate , will work with local and provincial authorities to deal with this situation . "

Allowing insolvent banks to fail is critical , and would be the first step in a badly - needed restructuring of our economy .
Too many talented people are lured into the financial industry by outsized pay - packages .
We need to shrink the industry and get these people in productive industries .
The rise of “ financial innovation ” has only slowed real growth and led to rampant moral hazards .
Shrinking the sector , if done responsibly , would not lead to breadlines and a depression .
Experts like William K. Black have outlined the strategy for removing these SDIs ( systemically dangerous institutions ) .
Recovery ( in a sustainable fashion ) would take place quicker than most people think .
The alternative is 20 years of Japan - style malaise , and that ’s a best case scenario in my opinion .
Stagflation and other nasty outcomes are real possibilities .
Our financial sector remains a disproportionately large drain on the economy , and impedes recovery efforts .
Profits from financial firms peaked at 41 % of total corporate earnings in 2006 , and they ’re heading back to pre-crisis levels .
That is wildly unsustainable , as noted by Simon Johnson in his must - read The Quiet Coup .
Bank activity is currently a net - negative on US growth .
Responsible lending makes up an increasingly small part of the finance sector .
The vast majority of their activity has a parasitic effect on the economy : derivatives , selling swaps to naive investors , flash - trading , usury - level CC interest rates , front - running , bonus - madness , etc . [ Read Do n’t Fear the Brain Drain for more . ]
See these charts from The Quiet Coup :
Simon Johnson comments :
From 1973 to 1985 , the financial sector never earned more than 16 percent of domestic corporate profits .
In 1986 , that figure reached 19 percent .
In the 1990s , it oscillated between 21 percent and 30 percent , higher than it had ever been in the postwar period .
This decade , it reached 41 percent .
Pay rose just as dramatically .
From 1948 to 1982 , average compensation in the financial sector ranged between 99 percent and 108 percent of the average for all domestic private industries .
From 1983 , it shot upward , reaching 181 percent in 2007 .
Mr. Johnson ’s writes at BaselineScenario.com .
He is among the few mainstream economists who acknowledges Wall Street ’s corrupting influence on government .
We need more people like him in government .
While his pro-stimulus policies are n’t ideal ( artificial stimulus is inefficient , in my view ) , he would be an immeasurable improvement over existing appointees .
Getting someone like him in a top government post would be a first step towards meaningful curbing of Wall Street ’s ponzi game .

Exxon Mobil Corp. pleaded guilty in federal court in Denver to killing at least 85 protected waterfowl , hawks and owls in five states over the past five years , the Department of Justice announced today .
The birds died from exposure to natural gas well reserve pits and waste water storage facilities at Exxon Mobil drilling and production facilities in Colorado , Kansas , Oklahoma , Texas and Wyoming between 2004 and 2009 .
Under the plea agreement reached yesterday with DOJ , the company will pay $ 600,000 , as well as make changes to prevent related deaths in the future .
Exxon told the court it has already spent $ 2.5 million on the effort .
Exxon will pay $ 400,000 in fines , which will be deposited into the federally administered North American Wetlands Conservation Fund , and $ 200,000 in community service payments , which will be sent to a nonprofit waterfowl rehabilitation foundation in Colorado and the congressionally chartered National Fish and Wildlife Foundation .
During a three - year probationary period , Exxon Mobil has also agreed to implement an environmental compliance plan to prevent future bird deaths at the company 's facilities in the five affected states .
" The environmental compliance plan that Exxon Mobil has agreed to in this multi - district plea agreement is an important step in protecting migratory birds in these five states , " said John Cruden , acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department 's Environment and Natural Resources Division .
Cruden said Exxon 's cooperation in the case provided a useful example to other companies charged with violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act .
" Exxon Mobil has worked with us and we commend them for that , " Cruden said .
" The company took steps to minimize risks to the birds when this was brought to their attention . "

CLEVELAND , Ohio —
Record or near - record cold swept much of the middle part of the nation in July -- with some records being broken from the 1860s -- but a late - month rally in Northeast Ohio left the area barely in the top 20 for coldest July on record .
Other areas -- from Cincinnati to Madison , Wis. -- broke cold records and even Ohio cities such as Akron , Toledo , Youngstown , Columbus and Dayton came close to their historic marks .
" We still have n't figured that one out yet , " said meteorologist Mark Adams at the National Weather Service station at Cleveland Hopkins Airport .
" Everyone around us was in the top five or 10 coldest months on record and we finished 18th , but we really do n't know why exactly .
" Cleveland 's average temperature in July was 69.9 degrees -- still two full degrees below normal ( 71.9 ) for the month , but well off the chilly pace set by the summer of 1960 at 67.6 degrees .
But more than 1,100 daily record low temperatures were broken in July nationwide , according to figures at the National Climatic Data Center reported today by AccuWeather .
An additional 1,200 stations tied records .
States in the Northeast and Midwest reported low temperatures that dropped down into the 50s and 40s in July -- with 36 degrees reported in Michigan .
Records were broken or nearly fell in other Ohio and Great Lakes communities .
Youngstown and Mansfield both endured the second - coldest July in more than 100 years of record keeping .
Youngstown 's average was 67.4 degrees , just a shade over the 67 set in 2000 , while Mansfield 's average was 67.1 , second only to the 66.6 of 1947 .
Akron had its fifth - coldest July on record at 68.1 degrees .
The record July monthly average of 67.6 was set in 1904 .
A July record were set in Cincinnati ( 70.1 degrees - 6.2 degrees below normal ) , Columbus had its fourth - coldest July ( 4.7 degrees below normal ) and Dayton had its second - coldest July .
Dayton 's mark was colder than the weather in Cleveland at 69.6 degrees , or 4.7 below normal .
Records were also set in Michigan cities of Flint and Saginaw , while Detroit had its third - coldest July in more than 100 years .
Indianapolis had its second - coldest July on record , behind only 1947 .
Chicago had its ninth - coldest , but second coldest since its weather station moved further away from Lake Michigan in 1942 .
" It was quite a month all over the region , mostly because the jet stream was dipping down into the lower Great Lakes , " Adams said .
But the all - important jet stream is just about to shift .
" It looks like it should stay farther north -- in the upper lakes , " Adams said .
" That should allow us to have some very warm days through at least next week sometime .
" That should be good news for people who like going to the beach , but it 's also a trade - off because you also might need to use your air conditioner more . "
A few thousand years ago , someone living in what is now Ireland made some butter , stuck it into an oak barrel , wandered out into a bog about 25 miles west of Dublin , and buried it .
Somehow , that someone lost track of it , which two lucky archaeologists discovered when they dug up the stashed loot earlier this year in the Gilltown bog , between the Irish towns of Timahoe and Staplestown .
But that was n't the first keg of butter that 's been preserved by the strange chemistry of the bog .
Or the 10th .
More than 270 kegs of bog butter have been retrieved from the wetlands , along with dozens of ancient bodies , swords , and ornaments .
Here , we run down some of the strangest things that scientists and citizens have pulled from the peat .
All kinds of bodies have been found with their skin and organs intact .
The objects are preserved by the remarkable properties of Sphagnum mosses , which come with preservatives built into their cell walls .
After they die , they decay very slowly .
and anything that falls into the Sphagnum peat bogs decays more slowly , too .
Murder weapons are a common find .
Archaeologists believe the bogs were sites for ritual sacrifices , because many of the bodies appear to have been tortured or " overkilled . "
In the picture ( above ) of a find named Yde girl , you can see the cord that was used to strangle her .
Tollund Man suffered a similar fate : A noose was found around his neck .
Murder was n't all that happened out on the bogs .
Multiple trepanated skulls , that is to say , skulls with holes drilled in them , have been found .
Based on the use of the procedure in medieval times , one hypothesis is that the " operation may have been performed to remove a blood clot or a less - tangible thing like a spirit " from an individual .
Even now , there 's still a small number of people who think drilling holes in their skulls is therapeutic .
While we do n't know much about the people who wandered these bogs thousands of years ago , analytical chemistry has helped identify substances that make them seem startlingly modern .
One corpse 's hair appears to have been coated with primitive hair gel , made from " vegetable oil mixed with resin from pine trees found in Spain and southwest France . "
The man lived around 300 B.C .
Beyond the bodies , which were the subject of a traveling international exhibit , The Mysterious Bog People , functional artifacts are often found , too .
These swords from what are now Sweden and Denmark were discovered in the late 1890s .
This wheel was discovered in the Netherlands along with another just like it .
It 's about 2 ½ feet in diameter and carved from a single piece of oak .
It 's been dated to 2700 B.C. , which makes it one of the oldest wheels found in Europe .
( But let 's not get bogged down in reinventing the wheel . )
A construction crew working on a highway in 1955 pulled up this dugout canoe from a Dutch bog .
It 's almost 9 feet long and was radiocarbon - dated to 8500 B.C .

( CNN ) --
One man 's trash is another man 's mystery .
Nick DiMola holds what he believes are about 60 artifacts and pieces of artifacts from Mexico .
Five years ago , Nick DiMola 's rubbish removal company was hired to clean out a Manhattan apartment following the death of the owner , abstract artist Clinton Hill .
The contents of a barrel that DiMola salvaged from the trash then has today raised a series of questions .
What DiMola holds are about 60 artifacts and pieces of artifacts that he thinks are from Mexico , dating to between 300 B.C. and 500 A.D .
The mystery , which the Mexican Consulate in New York is trying to solve , is twofold :
How much are the artifacts worth ?
And , if authentic , whom do they belong to ?
DiMola first saw the collection of pottery and figurines while cleaning Hill 's apartment in 2004 .
He stored the barrel in his warehouse instead of disposing of it , then promptly forgot about it .
Last week , DiMola rediscovered the pieces , only this time he told the New York Daily News about what he had found , announcing that he would sell them .
That caught the attention of the Mexican government , which is studying the origins of the items and has claimed them .
Now , DiMola wants to donate his find , but not necessarily to Mexico , he told CNN .
The Queens native was excited about his discovery when he allowed representatives from the Mexican Cultural Institute to examine and photograph nearly all the pieces , DiMola said .
His curiosity about them was growing , and he was expecting an appraisal from the government officials .
What he got instead was a heads - up about a possible petition to return the entire collection to Mexico .
" My reaction is that that is not very diplomatic , " DiMola said .
" It 's a blow to the jaw . "
Ruben Beltran , Mexico 's consul general in New York , was not available for comment Tuesday .
However in an interview with the U.S. - based Spanish - language TV network Telemundo , he said that if the pieces are part of Mexican culture , the government will try to get them back .
But as of now , no one is certain what the pieces are .
Howard Nowes , an ancient art dealer who does appraisals , examined a handful of the pieces that DiMola holds .
Nowes told CNN he saw a mix of authentic and non-authentic pre-Columbian pieces , which he valued at $ 3,000 .
The pieces were broken and were n't very artistic , he said , adding " from what I can see , it was mostly junk . "
Unfazed , DiMola thinks all the pieces probably are worth more than $ 16,000 total , he said .
" Something like this , you can't put a price on , because I may have a figure that no one has seen before , " DiMola said .
" There 's a big value in these pieces . "
The Mexican government is n't taking any chances , and is conducting its own research into the authenticity and significance of the pieces .
Museums in Houston , Texas ; San Francisco , California and Washington , D.C. , have expressed interest in the pieces as well , DiMola said .
He said he'd like to donate the artifacts to museums across the country , and some to the Mexican Cultural Institute at the Mexican Consulate in New York City , but that could change if Mexico uses international law to claim the items .
The foundation that hired DiMola to clean the house is unlikely to try to reclaim the pieces , said John Koegel , the attorney who handled Hill 's estate .
When Hill died , he left all his possessions to his lifelong partner , Allen Tran , Koegel told CNN .
In turn , Tran bequeathed all of Hill 's possessions to a foundation " to carry out his artistic legacy , " he said .
Hill had some pieces from Mexico in his apartment that were cataloged , but the artist had no strong connection to the country , Koegel said .
For DiMola , all the fuss stems from a simple truth .
" Sometimes you find things that are good and salvageable in the trash , " he said .

Specter faces fury : ' You work for us !'
Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - Pa. ) fired back Tuesday at a raucous town hall audience that booed and jeered him for more than an hour .
Specter immediately tried to temper the rough crowd , which started booing him before the question - and - answer session even began , with the blunt warning : “ If you want to stay in here , we ’re not going to tolerate any demonstrations or booing .
So , it ’s up to you . "

But minutes later during the senator ’s response to a question on whether Americans would be able to maintain their private insurance under the Democratic health care proposal , a protester who was not selected to speak stood up , walked into the aisle and began shouting at him .
“ Do you want to be led out of here ? ” the senator told the man , pointing at him .
“ You ’re welcome to go . ”
Specter then walked toward the heckler who was being pushed back toward his seat by another member of the crowd .
“ Now wait a minute , ” Specter shouted repeatedly into the microphone .
“ You want to leave ?
Leave . ”
“ I ’m going to speak my mind before I leave , because your people told me I could , ” the protester said once the room quieted down .
“ I called your office , and was told I could have the mike to speak .
And then I was lied to because I came prepared to speak . ”
“ I ’ll leave , ” the protester said , as several police officers stood nearby .
“ And you can do whatever the hell you please to do .
One day God ’s going to stand before you , and he ’s going to judge you and the rest of your damned cronies up on the Hill .
And then you ’ll get your just deserts .
I ’m leaving . ”
The man received loud applause and shouts of support as he walked out of the room .
Trying to regain control , Specter pleaded with the crowd “ to figure out some way to have an orderly procedure . ”
And he tried to respond to the protester .
“ When he says that I ’m tramping on constitutional rights , I have to disagree with him , ” said the senator , who switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party this year .
“ I ’m encouraging constitutional rights .
I ’m encouraging constitutional rights by coming to Lebanon [ Pa. ] to talk to my constituents .
I could be somewhere else .
I do n’t get [ any ] extra pay .
I do n’t have any requirement to be here . ”
But Specter ’s assertion that he was not required to attend the town hall was not received so well .
“ You work for us ! ” shouted several members of the crowd .
“ You work for us ! ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama ’s “ pay czar ” said on Friday he was using formulas and data analysis to determine executive compensation rather than relying on pay caps .
Kenneth Feinberg , appointed in June to decide compensation packages for the highest - paid personnel at companies that received U.S. government bailouts , said his team of 15 people is reviewing pay data submitted by seven firms that needed extraordinary assistance , a group that includes Citigroup Inc , Bank of America Corp , and American International Group Inc .
“ We are now immersed in looking at all this data that has been submitted to us , ” Feinberg said while speaking at a New York conference hosted by Labaton Sucharow LLP , a law firm .
Feinberg called his task “ daunting , ” but said he expected to release the first wave of pay decisions within a few weeks .
He did not plan to reveal the names of employees under his jurisdiction .
“ We do n’t want specific names next to dollars , ” Feinberg said .
Citigroup energy trader Andrew Hall , whose pay package could exceed $ 100 million this year , is the target of the public ’s ire .
Last week , Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit said that $ 100 million is too much for an employee to earn , considering the bank ’s circumstances .
But Feinberg ruled out capping pay , saying he is building “ models ” which he believes will set a precedent for government agencies and companies tackling the controversial issue of executive compensation .
SETTING A PRECEDENT
Feinberg said his work could set a precedent for forthcoming pay rules from the U.S. Federal Reserve , which would impact pay at all Fed - regulated banks .
Both Feinberg and the Fed are looking to set rules that discourage excessive risk - taking and that relates pay to performance .
The model he is building , Feinberg said , is complicated by the fact that “ avoiding excessive risk means different things to different people in different situations . ”
The pay plans should also be generous enough that the companies can retain top people and become profitable enough to repay taxpayer investments , the Treasury has said .
Feinberg has a great deal of latitude in making his determinations and can even claw back pay that employees have received if he finds that it was paid out unfairly .
After Feinberg makes his initial determination about whether to approve or disapprove pay contracts , the companies have 30 days to ask him to reconsider , after which Feinberg has 30 days to make a final determination .
The final determinations are binding , Treasury has said .
After Feinberg finishes his review of pay packages for the companies ’ top 25 employees , he will have to approve broader compensation structures for the 75 next - highest - paid employees .
Feinberg previously oversaw funds for families of victims of the September 11 attacks .
In those cases , he worked with teams to develop formulas to determine payouts .

The Story is a new Irish political blog , one which has set itself up in the Woodward and Bernstein mold , and which has so far trumped the press here on pointing out the true depth of the financial mismanagement in FAS .
While the newspapers and RTE concentrated on the € 600,000 spent on an advert that was never aired and on the € 600,000 or so that was simply unaccounted for , The Story dug into the records and pointed out that in fact tens of millions had been misspent due to mismanagement on a level corresponding to gross incompetence .
They ’ve also dug into the budgets of the Houses of the Oireachtas and found not only that the budget for the Oireachtas is monumentally huge ( €654 million over 5 years ) but that they ’ve also been growing at an alarming rate ( the per- annum cost rose by 125 % in that 5 - year period ) .
But the initial story which started the blog is a Freedom Of Information request .
For anyone in the US , a quick explanation – you , in the US , own every document your government produces and are entitled to a copy of it , barring national security classification and nominal reproduction fees .
We in Ireland do not enjoy this entitlement .
We can request any record produced by various branches of the government since 1998 under the Freedom of Information Act , colloquially known as an FoI request ; but that Act excludes certain records and allows for the charging of fees to cover compilation and research costs .
Back to the story .
The original FoI request was for all TDs and Senators expenses records since 1998 .
I think half the Irish audience just started drooling at the prospect , no ?
Seeing what certain infamous
TDs charged us for the free phones they bullied out of carphone warehouse and the like ?
Seeing how much we paid for John O’Donoghue ’s wife ’s hat at a horse race , or his limousine ride from Terminal 1 to Terminal 3 in Heathrow Airport ( for those not familiar with this , there ’s a free shuttle bus provided by the airport , but our TD charged us € 472 so he could take a private limousine instead ) .
How about Bertie Ahern ’s expenses ?
Brian Cowen’s ?
John Gormleys ?
The hitch is , the inital estimate of the cost of the FoI request came in today and it ’s € 2,440 .
So far , in the first two hours that that blog post has been up , readers of the blog have used its paypal donations button to donate the first € 240 of that .
So , got your wallet out yet ?
We may get the government we vote for , and we may not get to vote that often , but we can at least know just how bad they are by paying for some transparancy here .
Go on .
Go donate a few euro .

Today I was featured at the New York Times “ Room for Debate ” blog , along with five others more notable than me .
The question was “ about Goldman ’s compensation pool , which will be� $ 11.36 billion ( set aside ) for the first half of 2009 ( working out to about $ 386,429 , on average , for each of the roughly 29,400 employees and �temps ) .
The average reader may be�perplexed �about huge bonuses making such a comeback .
We ’re asking �various economists , �whether it ’s reasonable to be critical of this kind of payday at Goldman when the rest of the economy is still floundering ?
Or is this a sign that the �financial industry is stabilizing and �the federal government ’s aid is doing what we want it to do ? ”
Word limit was 300 . �
I had more to say , because if you ’ve read me for any length of time , you know that I am no fan of government intervention . �
I was against the bailout from the start , preferring Resolution Trust - style solutions .
My view is that Goldman would have survived on its own without the bailout , though it would have scraped by .�
That said , absent the bailout , Goldman might have ended up being a near - monopoly . �
Bank of America would be gone , as would Citi , and Wachovia .
Wells Fargo , JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley would be question marks .�
The amount of increased pricing power to the remaining investment banks would be even larger than it is today .
Most of the government programs Goldman Sachs benefited from were available to many institutions of their size and class . �
The government took the risk that some of the money would be used by healthy firms to make more money , in order to prevent panic regarding firms that needed the money to survive .�
Other money , like the TARP , was forced on Goldman .
Does this mean I do n’t think that Wall Street ( and thus Goldman ) has too much influence on government policy ?�
No , I believe that the US Treasury has been captured by those that regulate them . �
This includes Pimco and Blackrock , who finance the government , and the investment banks , who try to profit from government policy . �
There are too many appointees in high positions at the Treasury and Fed coming from firms that seek to influence the US government .
I do n’t fault Goldman for its actions ; they are a profit - seeking firm , and a very good one . �
I fault our government for intervening where they should not have done it .
Let the bonuses be paid , why should the employees of Goldman be held responsible for the errors of the US Government ?�
That is water under the bridge . �
Let us move on and try to make future government policy better ( less interventionist ) .
PS — does that mean we should n’t investigate Goldman Sachs to see if they are n’t front running the market with their high frequency trading ?�
No , that ’s worth looking into , but such an investigation would need some deeply smart people to be able to understand what is going on .

Early Saturday morning there was a report of an anti-LGBT attack in Hell ’s Kitchen in which two individuals were the victims of a physical assault .
I am obviously outraged by news that another bias attack has occurred in our city .
But I am also deeply concerned by reports from the victims that NYPD officers responding to the scene did not appropriately recognize the seriousness of the incident .
In fact , it has been reported that they failed to attempt to apprehend or even to collect contact information from the alleged assailant .
If these reports are true , the behavior of the police officers involved was also outrageous and merits swift action by the police department .
In response I have spoken to Police Commissioner Kelly ’s office .
They have agreed to conduct an investigation of these reports , and to have police officials meet personally with the victims this week .
I am very gratified that the police department has agreed to my requests , and urge them to complete a swift and thorough investigation .
Sony : Home repeat visitors total 25 - 30 % of PSN users Seven million have downloaded Home and active users are on the increase , says Euro director of the service

Sony's Peter Edward has revealed seven million people have now signed up for PlayStation Home .
Edward , who is platform director for the service , was speaking at the Develop conference in Brighton .
He said the figure includes three million people in Europe alone .
However , the estimated figure for those returning to the online space more than once stands at around 25 - 30 per cent of the 20 million PSN account holders , according to Edward , although he pointed out the stats " are n't definitive " and are constantly changing .
While the space saw massive interest when it first launched , numbers subsequently tailed off due to lack of content , says Edward , but are building as that content now grows .
While the Sony director could n't confirm how many users are online at any one time , he said it 's " many thousands " .
Since
Home launched seven months ago , European users have downloaded six million pieces of merchandise .
Yes , said Edward , some of those were free , but make no mistake : " This is a commercial business , it is up and running and it is making money . "
According to information previously released by Sony , Home made over one million dollars from micro-transactions in its first month .
While more current figures were n't being divulged by the company today , it says it will look to make the information available in the future .
Edward went onto confirm that " only " 80 per cent of Home users are 18 to 35 year - old males .
That might sound like a lot , he said , but think about the typical age and gender of the average console gamer .
" Home is slowly broadening the appeal of the console market out to a widening demographic , " he added .
The average time a European user spends on Home in a single session is 56 minutes .
" In terms of exposure and people 's attention , that is a huge amount of time , " said Edward .
It has n't been easy , of course - " Obviously there have been a lot of trials and tribulations along the way , " the exec conceded .
However , " Now , we 're starting to see a huge amount of content coming into the platform ...
Content is arriving which we did n't even know was being developed . "
Update : GamesIndustry.biz has clarified that the 25 - 30 per cent figure cited by Edward refers to the number of PSN account holders who have visited Home more than once .
We are all technology 's children , no matter the company names we take in vain
Squabbling about competition between companies is far less important than the effect they 're having on all of us , says Bill Thompson .
The announcement that Google 's chief executive Eric Schmidt is standing down from the Apple board hardly came as a surprise .
Google 's Android is already powering smartphones that offer an open alternative to Apple 's iPhone , while the recent announcement of plans for Chrome OS - an operating system that will directly challenge Mac OS - makes Google a direct competitor to Apple in its core market .
Apple 's recent decision to keep Google Voice out of the iPhone App Store must surely have increased tension on the board , and may have been the last straw .
The move not only annoyed customers , who wanted to take advantage of the single phone number and voice - over - IP calls it offers , but has also invited the attention of the US Federal Communications Commission .
It has asked Apple , Google and network provider AT&T to provide it with details of their decision making process .
The ongoing Federal Trade Commission investigation into his position and that of the other joint Apple / Google director , Arthur Levinson , may also have been preying on Schmidt 's mind , although it seems the investigation will continue even after his departure .
We are bootstrapping a new world , one in which information technology and computational systems are as deeply embedded in our society as the scientific method or religious belief seem to be
Bill Thompson Schmidt 's status on the Apple board may have gone from " it 's complicated " to " single " , but reports that this marks the beginning of all - out war between Google and Apple seem to exaggerate the real importance of the separation , and also to misstate the current state of affairs in the IT industry .
From the inside the competition between Google and Apple , and between either of them and Microsoft , is bitter and intense , as is the rivalry between SAP and Oracle , two large companies that dominate the corporate computing space but rarely get a mention in more consumer - oriented technology coverage .
But the US - based computing industry is one of the bastions of free - market capitalism and we should expect companies to undermine each other , attack each other , use dirty tricks to try to obtain monopolies and ally together in anti-competitive cartels which keep prices up , reduce choice and limit consumer freedom .
It 's all part of the great game .
Yet even though individual companies are trying to gain market share and the vast riches that will come from having a dominant position in particular sectors of the technology market , they share an ideological commitment to the increased penetration of computer technology in society , to building a world that is completely dependent on the systems , services , tools and hardware they are capable of providing .
That shared ideology is far more significant than the specifics of particular alliances or clashes over certain parts of the market .
Google 's Chrome OS , for example , is really just a minor adjustment of pieces on the chess board of the modern computing industry , neither a declaration of intent against Microsoft nor an attempt to annex GNU / Linux into Google 's worldview .
It may perhaps change the way the industry evolves , because the widespread availability of a lightweight network - oriented operating system might give strength to those inside Microsoft working on the company 's cloud computing strategy , but that does not affect the larger project of embedding information technology in all aspects of our lives .
As broadband stretches across Africa , the unconnected get fewer
The same can be said of the deal between Microsoft and Yahoo ! , whereby Microsoft 's Bing search engine will power Yahoo !
search while Yahoo !'s sales team sell Microsoft online advertising .
Sad though it is is to see Yahoo !
drop out of the search space it does not affect the growing importance of search in our online lives .
That will continue to grow whether Google or Bing or some small upstart like Cambridge - based True Knowledge dominates the market in 10 years ' time .
The current state of the IT industry is similar to that of the oil industry in the latter part of the 19th century , when the availability of oil - based products was starting to transform the wider economy in a way that increased the need for and then created a complete dependence on those same products .
We are bootstrapping a new world , one in which information technology and computational systems are as deeply embedded in our society as the scientific method or religious belief seem to be , and the precise names of the gods we worship is less important than our presence in the church of technology .
So we should keep developments in the IT industry in context .
Schmidt 's departure from Apple is mildly interesting , but matters little compared to the impact that the landfall of the Seacom fibre - optic cable in Kenya will have on the world once access speeds increase , prices fall and reliability increases to the point where connectivity can be assumed there .
Apple , Google and Microsoft are pieces on the chess board , but the board remains no matter how they are moved or which of them is captured , and we should not allow their manoeuverings to distract us from appreciating the game as a whole .

The Future of Energy A Power Station in Your Basement
Green-energy provider Lichtblick and German automaker Volkswagen are joining forces and promising to stir up the energy market with an unusual plan .
Instead of relying on massive energy facilities , the average consumer may soon have a miniature power station in their basement .
The following statement was issued today by Chicago Blackhawks Head Team Physician Dr. Michael Terry : Adam Burish went into the boards on Sunday night in Minnesota and injured his right knee .
When a player like him leaves the ice it is always concerning , and unfortunately he suffered an ACL tear .
He will undergo a reconstruction as soon as possible and we anticipate a complete recovery .
His return will take approximately six months .
" Burish , 26 , has recorded 309 penalty minutes and 17 points ( 10G , 7A ) in 156 regular - season games over the last three years with the Blackhawks .
Chicago 's ninth choice ( 282nd overall ) in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft , Burish registered career highs with six goals and nine points in 66 regular - season contests last season before collecting five points ( 3G , 2A ) in 17 tilts during his Stanley Cup Playoff debut .

A team of pitcher plant experts on an expedition in the Philippines has discovered a new species of giant pitcher plant that is able to consume rats .
The team , comprised of Stewart McPherson of Red Fern Natural History Productions based in the UK , botanist Alastair Robinson , and Volker Heinrich , of Bukidnon Province , the Philippines , set forth on a journey to discover the plant after they had heard of its possible existence after two Christian missionaries were rescued from the slopes of Mt. Victoria in central Palawan of the Philippines in 2000 .
The new species , which they named Nepenthes attenboroughii in honor of David Attenborough , was discovered at approximately 1,600 meters above sea level .
Like other pitcher plants , it uses small animals that it traps in the tube - like leaf structures as a source of nutrients .
Specimens of the new pitcher plant , and other species discovered by the team were taken to the herbarium of the Palawan State University .
According to McPherson :
The plant ( Nepenthes attenboroughii ) is among the largest of all carnivorous plant species and produces spectacular traps as large as other species which catch not only insects , but also rodents as large as rats .

When it comes to human pheromones , there are naysayers .
And although there are fewer naysayers now than ever before , they ’ve long used one tricky argument to deny the existence of human pheromones .
There ’s no vomeronasal organ ( VNO ) in homo sapiens , they say .
What good are pheromones without a VNO ?
The VNO , a bulb buried deep in the nasal cavity , is rich with neuronal receptors that detect chemical signals from others of the same species .
It processes those signals which , in turn , stimulate the hypothalamus which triggers the production of sex hormones .
Other animals use their VNOs all the time .
When a female pig or dog assumes the butt - up bow - backed mating stance , it ’s because her VNO had responded to pheromones from a male .
People have vestiges of a VNO , but there ’s no evidence that it still works .
Many studies suggest our VNOs start to form during fetal development but regress and become non-functional by the time we ’re born .
The naysayers say we lost our VNOs when we lost our need for pheromones .
We ’re not animals , they say .
We do n’t need to sniff out our mates .
But how do you explain the abundant evidence that we still use pheromones when dating and mating ( as I detail in BLONDES ) ?
It turns out that we may have lost our VNOS , but not our noses .
That is , we do n’t need a VNO anymore because we process pheromones through our regular olfactory channels .
We inhale them just as we inhale any other smell .
They hit the brain in the same way they would if we still had a VNO .
There ’s fresh proof of this in a new study .
Neuroscientist Ivanka Savic and her team at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden recruited volunteers to smell known pheromones ( estrogen - related compounds ) .
The volunteers were unusual in the one thing they had in common : they were all straight men who had lost their sense of smell ( amnosia ) due to nasal polyps .
Their olfactory channels were dysfunctional .
Savic and her colleagues knew from their previous experiments that the areas of the brain involved in mating are activated when people smell pheromones .
( Their studies are fascinating ; they help answer questions in the book such as “ Can you tell people ’s sexual orientation by their smell ? ” )
When straight guys smell estrogen - related compounds , researchers normally see the hypothalamus normally light up on a fMRI scan .
The hypothalamus triggers the release of sex hormones .
But does the hypothalamus get stimulated when people lose their ability to smell ?
The answer is no .
None of the amnosiac men in Savic ’s study could process the estrogenic pheromones the way other straight men do .
Their brains showed none of the usual activity .
The hypothalamus was silent .
This is important .
It suggests that , yes , we do appear to process pheromones through the main olfactory system .
It ’s good news because it implies that we do n’t need a VNO to get a pheromonal punch .
But we do need to smell .
( An interesting study would compare the sex lives of amnosiacs with others . )
The bad news is that it ’s possible that if you lose your sense of smell … lust may lose its luster .
Britain's war effort in Afghanistan is being hindered by a number of frontline troops too fat to fight , according to a leaked Army memo .
The Ministry of Defence confirmed today it had directed military chiefs to ensure units are following Army fitness policy after concerns were raised over a " worrying trend of obesity " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Army needs to " reinvigorate a warrior ethos and a culture of being fit " , according to the leaked memo apparently sent to all Army units and obtained by the Observer newspaper .
The memo from Major Brian Dupree , of the Army physical training corps in Wiltshire , said basic fitness policy " is not being carried out " .
Units were routinely failing to fulfil the Army 's basic fitness regime of two hours of physical exercise a week , he added .
The memo leaked to the paper said : " The numbers of personnel unable to deploy and concerns about obesity throughout the Army are clearly linked to current attitudes towards physical training . "
There are 3,860 Army personnel classified as PUD - personnel unable to deploy - with a further 8,190 regarded as being of " limited deployability " for medical reasons , it was reported .
Major Dupree added : " The current Army fitness policy states that to be fit to fight requires a minimum of two to three hours of physical activity per week .
It is clear that even this most basic policy is not being implemented .
" To cope with the demands of hybrid operations in Afghanistan and future conflicts the Army needs personnel with that battle - winning edge that sustains them through adversity .
It is clear this message has been diluted recently and this attitude must change .

" The increasing PUD list and concerns over obesity in the services are clearly linked to this indifferent attitude . "
An MoD spokesman said : " Following a review of recent evidence , direction has been given to the chain of command to take action to ensure units are following the Army 's fitness policy . "
The revelations came on the day a hard - hitting report on British efforts in the war - torn country by a committee of MPs was published .
Since deploying to Afghanistan in 2001 , the UK has suffered from " significant mission creep " with an ever - growing list of responsibilities , including drugs , human rights and state - building , which have made it more difficult for the Government to explain the purpose of Britain 's mission , said the report by the cross-party House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee .
When I first got a cell phone ( an early Sidekick ) , a new noise entered my life .
When I put on my big crazy headphones while the phone was in my shirt pocket , I 'd hear a very distinctive " blip ba da blip ba da blip ba da buzzzzzzz " noise right before my phone rang , so loud that I 'd have to wrench the headphones from my poor ears -- which was handy , because then I 'd hear the phone ringing .
It took me a long time to figure out that this noise was coming from the phone , because I 'm kind of slow .
I also heard it when the phone was near mostly any speakers ( even my TV set ) , including when I received text messages or used other data features on the phone .
I recently saw a discussion of these noises on a fellow _flosser 's blog post .
So what causes this noise ?
Basically , it 's the cell phone talking to the tower , and nearby speakers picking up that radio transmission .
There are several Metafilter articles on the subject , which make for good background reading .
The best technical explanation I 've seen of the phenonemon I 've seen is on this WiFi -Forum post :
The type of interference can occur if the following things happen
together :
1 ) a pulsing radio transmitter ,
2 ) with relatively strong power ,
3 ) in very close proximity ,
4 ) to a non-linear circuit element .
The non -linear circuit element is usually some sort of solid state
device such as a transistor or diode .
If the non -linear element is
subjected to a strong pulsing radio signal , it will act as a rectifier
and " detect " the pulsating waveform , i.e. , convert the pulsations from
a radio frequency to an audio frequency ( if the pulsation rate is in
the pass - band of audio frequencies . )
For example , a hearing aid
consists of a microphone , an audio amplifier and a small speaker .
If
a strong pulsating radio signal impinges upon the first transistor
amplifier stage , the transistor will be driven into its non-linear
range and detect the pulsations .
If the pulsation rate is in the
audio frequency range , the rest of the hearing aid amplifier will
amplify this and deliver it to the speaker , to the great annoyance of
the hearing aid wearer .
This annoyance is endemic to certain digital cellular technologies ( including ones used in music devices like the iPhone , eek ) .
The only ways I 've found to mitigate the sound are : move the phone and the speakers father apart ( this only seems to reduce the noise a bit ... ) , turn off the cellular portion of the phone ( the iPhone , for example , has an " airplane mode " that makes it practical to play music in the car -- without this turned on , the car sounds like it 's being ripped apart by buzz - saws ) , or introduce electromagnetic shielding ( good luck building your Faraday cage ) .
If you 've got tips on how to reduce this noise , or a story of how annoying it is , please share in the comments .

Weekly updates regarding the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict including the following headlines : Important EventsThe Gaza Strip after Operation Cast LeadThe Political ArenaThe Internal Palestinian ArenaOverview 21/7-28/7 :
The calm in the western Negev continues .
Hamas refrains from firing rockets into Israel and its senior figures emphasize for Western ears its policy of restraint .
Hamas spokesman Ayman Taha told a New York Times correspondent that “ the fighters needed a break and the people needed a break . ”
According to the New York Times report , the decision to suspend rocket fire was “ partly the result of popular pressure , ” and occurred because people were questioning the value of the rockets , which they regarded as relatively ineffective .
This past week the American Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and American special envoy to the Middle East George Mitchell both visited Israel .
Mitchell met with the top figures of the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority .
He said that that “ to help achieve comprehensive peace , President Obama has asked all involved to support our effort ... ”
He praised the steps taken by Israel to improve freedom of movement for the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria .
However , he demanded that Israel take “ meaningful measures , ” which include “ dealing with difficult issues like settlements and outposts . ”
The Political Arena : Hamas continues its campaign of smiles for the West
There has been an increasing number of reports that the measures taken by the IDF in Judea and Samaria to ease daily life of the Palestinians , including the dismantling of roadblocks at key locations , has already improved the Palestinians ' economic situation .
It is particularly conspicuous in Nablus , where a shopping festival is taking place ( attended by Israeli Arabs as well ) .
The festival features shopping and cultural and artistic events .
Hamas continues trying to make itself seem pragmatic to the West without changing its fundamental positions .
In talking to Western media ( e.g. , The New York Times , BBC Radio ) it reiterates that it refrains from firing missiles into Israel territory .
As to the Palestinian - Israeli conflict and the dialogue between Hamas and the West , this week the most prominent statements were the following :
• Ismail Haniya , head of the Hamas de-facto administration , preaching the Friday sermon at a mosque in Khan Yunis , said that Hamas was willing to adopt the principle of “ liberation through stages . ”
That is , Hamas would not pose obstacles to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state with the 1967 borders and with Jerusalem as its capital .
However , he said that did not mean ceding the rest of the [ Palestinian ] land or recognizing the State of Israel , but rather it was a strategic option meant to end the so - called “ occupation . ”
He also said that the “ resistance ” [ i.e. , terrorism ] was a strategic alternative the Palestinians would continue to cling to ( Al - Aqsa TV , July 24 , 2009 ) .

The sea in Hong Kong is always filthy after a typhoon .
Here 's a washed up nylon fishing rope covered in goose barnacles .
Typhoon Goni left our shores two days ago .
The aftermath was that tons of plastic trash was scattered all over the beach in Shek O .
The problem is that careless people drop trash .
That trash gets washed down rivers and storm drains all over China and beyond before it joins other bits of teeming plastic garbage floating around in the world 's oceans .
It also frequently gets dropped off the side of boats and ships by people who do n't know better .
Some of it comes from Japan .
Some of it is from Thailand .
Most of it is from mainland China .
And some of it comes from McDonald's .
I 'm not lovin ' it .
Are you ?
Here 's a colourful , yet nightmarish , tangle of seaweed , fishing line and synthetic fibre string .
Perfect for strangling a dolphin .
Some of it will get cleaned up by contract workers being paid with my tax dollars .
Some of it may get sucked into the ‘ North Pacific Gyre ’ .
This week , a group of marine scientists from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego departed to the ‘ North Pacific Gyre ’ , an enormous area of the Pacific Ocean between the United States and Asia .
Their aim is to study plastic debris accumulating across hundreds of miles of open sea dubbed by some as the ' trash vortex ' .
A research boat carrying a team of 30 scientists , researchers , technicians and crewmembers embarked on the three - week voyage to learn how plastic trash in the ocean is affecting marine life .
Project Kaisei in Hong Kong is involved .
Click here to find out more , or contact Doug Woodring ( doug at projectkaisei.org ) .
Apart from the harm to sea birds and reptiles , such as albatrosses and turtles , caused by eating bits of plastic mistaken for food that look like this :-
and this , because it looks like squid to a sea bird : -
… the Scripps mission will try to discover if small particles of broken down plastic trash could carry other pollutants , such as agricultural pesticides , far out to sea .
They will also try to determine whether marine micro-organisms attached to the fragments of floating plastic could drift over a long period of time to distant coastlines and thus become invasive species .
The scientists will also look into the possibility that carcinogens found in plastics ingested by marine organisms can enter the food chain , thus tainting seafood , ultimately posing a threat to us humans .
But fear not .
Back in Shek O , here come the Hong Kong Government contract cleaners from Lapco working for the Leisure and Cultural Services Department .
My tax dollars hard at work .
It 's a good thing we have these fine folk around .
We humans would wade up our waists in filth like rats given half a chance , but throw some money at the problem and it ’s fixed .
Let ’s be happy because our beach will be clean again , the problem is solved .
Except it ’s not .
Our coastline is vast and stretches for thousands and thousands of miles , but Shek O beach is only 250 yards long .
These ladies do a great job .
But it 's just a drop in the ocean .
A sign at the beach office warns bathers of the likelihood of pollution after a period of heavy rain like we have just had .
No outrage .
Just calm civil service words that effectively normalize a situation that is disgraceful , yet somehow expected by most Hong Kong people in these apocalyptic times .
Kids grow up thinking it 's normal .
It 's called shifting baselines .
And now for the glaringly obvious part ; if people bothered to dispose of their trash properly would we be in the sad situation that we are in now with our dirty beaches and poisoned oceans ?
It 's not that hard is it ?
The PS3 Slim has started to pop up at retail stores around the country , and iFixit has posted a tear down of the hardware so you can check out exactly what 's inside .
If you wanted to see what 's under that plastic case and did n't want to void your own warranty , go ahead and check it out .
They found some interesting things kicking around inside the system , and sent over some bullet points :
The upgraded 120 GB drive is a Toshiba - manufactured , 5400 RPM standard notebook SATA drive .
The interior of the device is dominated by the fan , heatsink , and desktop computer - sized Blu-ray drive .
The fan is an innovative design , with a massive 95 mm diameter and whopping 17 blades !
It 's evident that Sony 's chief design focus was effective heat dissipation .
Sony used a large piece of custom molded plastic to route air from the fan over the heatsink .
Time will tell how successful they were .
Do you see , Microsoft ?
Just a regular hard drive !
Cheap for you to buy , easy for us to upgrade — this is the way you do things .
It also looks like you wo n't have to worry about heat , even with the smaller design .
My launch 60 GB PS3 died during my marathon Batman : Arkham Asylum play session , and I 'm starting to get tempted to pick up a Slim .
This is some pretty cool stuff .

Aerosmith 's tour has been plagued by health problems Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler has been airlifted to hospital after falling off stage during a concert .
The 61 - year - old fell while dancing to entertain the crowd , after the sound system failed at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota .
Tyler was on a catwalk when he fell backward onto a couple of fans , said Mike Sanborn of the Buffalo Chip Campground , which hosted the event .
The singer was in " good spirits " as he left the grounds , Sanborn said .
" He was good natured about it , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
" He was talking and joking with the physician . "
The singer suffered neck and shoulder injuries , Sanborn added , but it was not immediately clear how serious they were .
About 30 minutes after the accident , guitarist Joe Perry came out to tell the crowd that the remainder of the show had been cancelled .
Tyler 's daughter , actress Mia Tyler , later informed fans : " Just got the news that my dad is okay .
Thank you all for your wonderful prayers and positive energy ! "
Prayers Journalist Matt Becker was at the concert , and said Tyler 's fall looked " very rough " .
" They were playing Love In An Elevator and the main sound completely blew out , " he told the BBC News website .
" No - one in the crowd could hear them any more and , after about a minute , Steven Tyler came out on a catwalk and started dancing . "
" It had rained about an hour earlier and they had tried to keep the stage dry , but during a spin Steven lost his balance and fell towards the audience into an area that was barricaded off - and there was no - one there to catch him .
" There is a possibility that he smacked his head off the rail that separated him from the crowd , which might have been why he was airlifted to hospital . "
Becker , who runs music website Melodic Rock Concerts added there was " a little confusion in the audience " but " people were very understanding " .
Health issues Aerosmith 's recent concert appearances have been plagued by health problems .
Seven shows were postponed this summer after Tyler injured his leg at a gig in June , while bassist Tom Hamilton pulled out of several dates as he recovered from " non-invasive " surgery .
Guitarist Brad Whitford also missed some concerts after hurting his head , and the band cancelled a gig in Venezuela in January when guitarist Joe Perry developed " unforeseen complications " with his replacement knee .

The wheels of justice turn slowly , but they turn .
At long last , some six months after a little spate of shutting down Web sites , and a year after they were supposed to come out with one , Wizards of the Coast has published an official fansite policy and you can see it here .
Here ’s some analysis for you .
The Bottom Line
Basically , if you follow some guidelines you get to use some images they provide you in a zip file .
That ’s it .
Is / Is Not
The guidelines are n’t too bad ( though you have to have long copyright stuff on every single page ) , but in the end the payoff is a little pointless – you just get to use some ( 38 , mostly product covers ) of their images to use while worshiping them online .
But what it most crucially does NOT allow is any kind of original work or use of the actual content of the D&D game ( in my opinion , graphics are incidental content ) .
I quote :
Please note that this Fan Site Policy does not allow you to publish , distribute or sell your own free - to - use games , modules or applications for any of Wizards ’ brands including , but not limited to , Dungeons & Dragons and Magic : The Gathering .
If you want to engage in any of these activities related to Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition , such use is subject to the Game System License .
So all it lets you do is add graphics to your site , but not meaningfully develop content .
You can then use the GSL , which allows you to develop certain content as long as it ’s in PDF ( HTML and plaintext are NOT ok ) .
Here ’s more analysis of the GSL to help navigate those waters .
Technically you have to use the GSL to refer to their trademarked terms , rules , etc .
From the GSL :
Licensee may reprint the proprietary 4E reference terms , tables , and templates ( each , a “ 4E Reference ” ) described in the 4E System Reference Document …
If you want to make a D&D adventure , or new class / race , or variant rules , or whatnot and put it on your Web site , this fansite policy does not help you .
You have to either follow the GSL or do a really good job of knowing your rights to use their content under existing copyright / trademark / trade dress law , which is tricky .
( But doable – Kobold Quarterly and other products have published for 4e without a license . )
( NB : I am assuming that clause could be construed to “ override ” the GSL clause that “ For the avoidance of doubt , and by way of
example only , no Licensed Product will ( a ) include web sites , interactive products , … ” Otherwise the fansite thing says “ See the GSL ” and the GSL says “ see a cold day in hell . ” )
Comparison – Pathfinder
Compare the Pathfinder fan site policy , which allows such use as part of itself –
• You may descriptively reference trademarks , proper names ( characters , deities , artifacts , places , etc. ) , locations and characters from products listed in Section 1 of our Community Use Approved Product List at paizo.com / communityuse / products , provided it is clear that these are our marks .
•
You may descriptively reference dialogue , plots , storylines , language , and incidents from products listed in Section 1 of our Community Use Approved Product List at paizo.com / communityuse / products in campaign journals and play - by - post or play - by - email games .
And of course the rules are OGL in the first place , which is why they do n’t mention rules terms in that quote .
Comparison – White Wolf
Hmmm , even the quite objectionable White Wolf fansite policy allows use of copyright / trademarked stuff :
White Wolf trademarked and copyrighted material may be used in the presentation of standard nonprofit , nonrevenue generating HTML World Wide Web Pages , non-graphical MUSHes , MUDs , MOOs , IRC and all similar Chat environments as per the Requirements and Restrictions listed below .
If , for some reason , you do not wish to participate in Dark Pack , please understand and acknowledge that you and your site must still fulfill all of the other requirements listed on this page .
The same goes for fan projects .
They must be nonprofit and nonrevenue producing .
No money .
You can not make any kind of money off of White Wolf intellectual property .
Your site should not have Google Adwords .
Your site cannot be hosted by a company that inserts banner advertisements or Adwords , even if you do not get the revenue .
Of course that banner / AdWords stuff is pure hateful crap but at least in general you can use the material .
Conclusion
This new fansite policy does n’t explicitly have any “ evil ” statements in it , which is a step up for WotC in their first passes at new licenses .
But it is telling in what it leaves out – any “ safe ” ability to use the 4e rules and content itself .
Is this deliberate ?
Or do they think of D&D as a “ brand ” exclusively now so mentioning what us old timers think of as the “ real ” part of the game is passe ?
While kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit has been rotting in captivity for 1,136 days now , about 100 Palestinian security prisoners jailed in Israel received a first - level university degree this week from the Open University , which is recognized by Israel 's Council for Higher Education .
Some 250 additional security prisoners are currently studying at the Open University .
Delay ' Shalit law ' wo n't be advanced for now Aviad Glickman Ministerial committee to delay discussion of law aimed at preventing Hamas prisoners ' visitation rights , as security sources have yet to form final stand ' Shalit law ' wo n't be advanced for now
Some of the prisoners who have received a diploma or are still studying are affiliated with Hamas .
Security prisoners jailed in Israel enjoy further generous benefits , including hot water all day long , ventilators , a television with all Arab channels , and the option to borrow books from the prison library .
In addition , each prisoner has a walkman , a radio and a budget for the jail 's canteen .
The security prisoners are allowed the send four letters a month and receive an unlimited number of letters .
They are entitled to a family visit once every two weeks , and are allowed to have their picture taken by the prison 's photographer and to send the photo to their families .
Additional benefits include a daily morning exercise and regular medical treatments , including dental care and a visit by an optician .
Last March , the government appointed a ministerial committee to look into cutting Palestinian prisoners ' benefits .
The committee presented its recommendations , but the cabinet has yet to discuss the matter .
The " Poor Fellow - Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon " order , better known as " The Knights Templar " , was founded in 1119 AD , and dissolved by the Pope in 1312 .
In just under 200 years , they became an immensely powerful and important order of fighting monks .
They were far from the only military order , but they became ( and remain ) the best known .
They were the wealthiest , and most prestigious order .
Everyone loved them , from the Pope downwards , and their rise was spectacular .
Their fall 200 years later was equally dramatic , and the Papacy was forced by the French King into dissolving them .
Many of the Templars were burned alive , particularly in France .
In other countries , such as England , most were allowed to go quietly on their way , many joining other orders of monks .
Radley Balko made the following observation at his blog :
“ Illinois has sentenced 224 people to death since reinstating capital punishment in 1977 .
Since then , 20 have been exonerated .
I ’m not sure what an acceptable rate of error in death penalty cases would be , but nine percent seems awfully high , does n’t it ? ”
One wrongfully killed person at the hands of the state is too many , nine percent is completely unacceptable .

Over the past couple of days , I ’ve been emailing with a couple of colleagues about this very odd building in Myanmar ( nee Burma ) .
Staring at that big box was the main reason I tweeted that “ This Burma - NORK nuclear link has me worried . ”
Allen Thomson , Bruno Tertrais and some folks at VERTIC all found it too — working from the recent story in the Sydney Morning Herald and an older story originally published by an opposition group .
We ’d been quietly discussing what the thing might be .
Now , no one wanted to go declare the vaguely suspicious looking building to be something suspicious in particular — but since ISIS has found it too ( the damn thing is visible from 4,000 feet ) and published a nice analysis , I do n’t suppose there is any harm in crowdsourcing it .
ISIS describes what I am calling the BOB ( let ’s leave the M out for now ) as an “ anomalous building ” — noting that they cannot “ ascribe [ it ] with obvious nuclear industrial characteristics . ”
It ’s big and tall .
It is also nestled into the mountains and revetted .
There seems to be a power transmission line running in ( or out of it ) .
It is several clicks from an obvious water source .
Still , someone has been very interested in it — in addition to this 2005 image , Digital Globe has happy snaps from 2008 and 2009 centered right on it .
What do you all think ?
Health Canada has issued a recall of a popular energy drink , Hardcore Energize Bullet , warning that utility knife blades had been found in the drinks , which are sold in vials that look like test - tubes .
Yesterday , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said blades were found in one vial each of Hardcore Energize Bullet and New Whey .
Only Hardcore Energize Bullet is sold in Canada and Health Canada issued a recall to pull the drink from store shelves .
No injuries have been reported as a result of tampering .
In his Congressional testimony , the CEO of a health insurance company said :
Rescission is rare .
It affects less than one - half of one percent of people we cover .
As you probably already have learned , rescission is the insurance company practice of refusing to pay for health care because they found an ( even unrelated ) mistake on your original health insurance application .
But in claiming that this practice is rare , the insurance companies , whose very business depends on understanding statistics and probability , are betting that you do n’t understand probability enough to catch the lie .
Indeed , “ Figures never lie , but liars always figure . ”
For starters , even if you take the insurance company ’s statement at face value — that it only affects one - half of one percent — this is a huge number of people .
The population of the US is greater than 300 million people .
Even if you assume that insurance companies only insure two - thirds of all Americans , one - half of one percent of that is over one million people .
They are depending on the fact that “ one - half of one percent ” sounds small .
But the much bigger lie is carefully documented in a brilliant article in Taunter Media , which points out that calling rescission rare is , shall we say , misleading at best .
Yes , the insurance company may only cancel the policies of one - half of one percent of the total people they cover , but the more significant statistic would be what percentage of the people who have very expensive medical care claims do the insurance companies cancel ?
After all , the insurance companies only try to use rescission on people who have expensive claims .
The insurance companies do not provide this data , of course , but based on other hard data , Taunter calculates it to be somewhat higher than fifty percent .
Let me clarify that .
If you are one of the lucky people who has adequate health insurance , but you are unlucky enough to contract a disease or have an accident that is very expensive to treat , you have a greater than 50 % chance that the insurance company will find some reason to cancel your policy , and not pay for your treatment ( likely forcing you into bankruptcy at the same time that you are trying to deal with a serious health problem ) .
And of course , the health insurance company will keep all the money you paid to them in premiums .
One more time .
If you ever really need your health insurance policy , you have less than even odds that the insurance company will actually pay for your health care .
Would you put up with a bank that confiscated your life savings when you tried to withdraw it , because of a trivial mistake you made on your original application form ?
The insurance companies have even cancelled policies for omissions on application forms that the applicant had absolutely no knowledge of .
No wonder we have so many people in the US who do n’t have health insurance .
It is a ripoff .
No wonder the health insurance industry is spending millions of dollars in misleading ads and campaign contributions to defeat a public option .
Who would n’t choose a public option over such a ripoff ?

Forget what it was but it happened early .
I believe , yeah its men who are way too large to be hitting each other that hard cause theyll do serious damage , who hit each other that hard and therefore injuries are part of life in the NFL , * cough * patriots last year .
But wethere you believe in the supernatural or not , I do not , its pretty big coincidence and enough to make me beleive that it just happens .
I do n't think its evil spirits causing the curse , its just gonna happen .
Does n't ruin a career , or else then i might believe in the curse part , but it will end up in you being out for part of the next season .
It looks like Troy will be back later in the season so hes thats good .
I know Larry is too good to be scarred but if I were his coach I 'd be soo worried about losing my top receiver .

Not sure what to make of this ( via the Benen ) :
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) confirmed this past week that he personally supports a public option for insurance coverage [ . ]
I supposed I should be heartened .
But I 'm not .
Instead , I 'm frustrated because it reminds me of how differently history might be playing out if certain individuals would make different and better choices .
Generally speaking , I 'm skeptical of individual - centric explanations of historical events .
I prefer structural explanations , especially economic ones .
But in today 's health coverage debate , I think that a very small group of individual legislators really could materially change History , if they were so inclined .
For instance , imagine a world ( long , long ago in a galaxy far , far away ) where the centrists
Dems decided that they truly wanted to make coverage reform happen .
Imagine if Joe Lieberman and Kent Conrad and Ben Nelson got on TV and said , " we 're going to make this happen , it 's just too important to fail . "
The media would go absolutely nuts -- David Broder would attain nirvana .
Reform would have new momentum , and new pressure would ricochet back to the moderate Republicans .
If Kent Conrad is behind it , why are n't you ?
Modern media cycles and herd mentality ( information cascades ) are unfortunately playing a large role in this legislative debate .
But that can work both ways .
A unified and active " centrist " bloc really could shift the narrative , and swing History in a different direction .
It 's such a rare thing for individuals to have this sort of opportunity -- the opportunity to do great , historic things just by choosing differently .
I mean , this is why they 're Democrats , right ?
But alas , that 's not the world we live in .
In this world , Kent Conrad and Mike Ross feel that it is their god - given duty to say 100 % negative and unhelpful things about the bill .
Joe Lieberman ( but he 's great on domestic policy ! ) could choose not to emphasize abandoning the uninsured .
Max Baucus -- the American Sphinx -- could choose to wrap things up in Finance .
It 's just maddening to have so much riding on the whims of so few .
NASA scientists announced Friday that they had picked a 60 - mile - wide crater near the moon ’s south pole as the place where they will send a rocket to punch a hole in the lunar surface next month in search of water .
Instruments aboard other satellites and on Earth have detected a significant amount of hydrogen , a telltale marker for water , on the northwest rim of the crater known as Cabeus A .
“ We ’re very confident we ’re going to hit a good place , ” Anthony Colaprete , lead scientist for the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite , or LCROSS , mission , said at a briefing at Ames Research Center in Mountain View .
LCROSS consists of a small satellite and an accompanying rocket launched two months ago with a second spacecraft , the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter .
Shortly after launch , the two spacecraft separated .
While the lunar orbiter is using its instruments to map the moon remotely in search water traces , the smaller LCROSS satellite and its rocket are scheduled to plunge into the moon ’s surface on Oct.
9 .

If all goes according to plan , scientists say , the giant cloud of dust sent wafting over the lunar surface will contain traces of water in the form of ice .
The moon has long been thought to be a dead , dry world -- a place , in the words of astronaut Buzz Aldrin , of “ magnificent desolation . ”
But some scientists have suggested that water ice millions of years old might be found in the shadowed craters of the north and south poles , where the sun never shines .
Finding water on the moon would not only be a major scientific discovery , it would also have a profound effect on plans to establish a semipermanent moon base .
Water would not only be useful for drinking , it could also be used to produce oxygen for respiration and to serve as a source of rocket fuel for a trip to Mars .
Even though President Obama is reconsidering plans to return astronauts to the moon and , ultimately , Mars , NASA is proceeding under President George W. Bush ’s ambitious Vision for Space Exploration .

The LCROSS mission has targeted the lunar south pole from the start .
But NASA scientists said Cabeus A was chosen as the specific site after a vigorous debate that drew on data from a variety of resources , including Earth - based telescopes and Japanese and Indian satellites circling the moon in recent years .
Instruments have picked up evidence of large quantities of hydrogen in a number of places in the 2 - mile - deep crater , scientists said .
The current bull ’s - eye , or “ sweet spot , ” Colaprete said in an interview , is a 2 - mile - wide zone on the northwest rim of Cabeus A .
Hydrogen is no proof of water .
It could be evidence of other compounds , such as methane .
Even that would help scientists better understand the processes that helped build the inner solar system .
At about 4:30 a.m. Pacific time on Oct. 9 , the LCROSS spacecraft is scheduled to send its accompanying Centaur rocket plunging into the crater .
After the crash , the satellite is to fly through the dust cloud rising 2 miles above the moon ’s surface .
It will use its onboard instruments to sniff for water .
After flying through the dust cloud , the satellite will itself plow into the lunar surface several miles away .
Advertisement
The event will be witnessed by observatories from Hawaii to New Mexico .
The dust cloud should also be observable by amateur astronomers using telescopes with mirrors 10 inches or larger , Colaprete said .
Managers at NASA ’s
Ames center plan to set up a huge outdoor screen to project video from the spacecraft as it plummets toward the moon .
Colaprete said as many as 8,000 people are expected to attend .
If there is water beneath the crater , there could be as much as Lake Erie contains , or as little as 3 % of the amount in the Great Salt Lake , depending on how far underground the water table is , said Dan Andrews , the LCROSS project manager .

Acid : A Debugger Built From A Language
Phil Winterbottom
philw@plan9.bell-labs.com
ABSTRACT
Acid is an unusual source - level symbolic debugger for Plan 9 .
It is implemented as a language interpreter with specialized primitives that provide debugger support .
Programs written in the language manipulate one or more target processes ; variables in the language represent the symbols , state , and resources of those processes .
This structure allows complex interaction between the debugger and the target program and provides a convenient method of parameterizing differences between machine architectures .
Although some effort is required to learn the debugging language , the richness and flexibility of the debugging environment encourages new ways of reasoning about the way programs run and the conditions under which they fail .
1. Introduction
The size and complexity of programs have increased in proportion to processor speed and memory but the interface between debugger and programmer has changed little .
Graphical user interfaces have eased some of the tedious aspects of the interaction .
A graphical interface is a convenient means for navigating through source and data structures but provides little benefit for process control .
The introduction of a new concurrent language , Alef [ Win93 ] , emphasized the inadequacies of the existing Plan 9 [ Pike90 ] debugger db , a distant relative of adb , and made it clear that a new debugger was required .
Current debuggers like dbx , sdb , and gdb are limited to answering only the questions their authors envisage .
As a result , they supply a plethora of specialized commands , each attempting to anticipate a specific question a user may ask .
When a debugging situation arises that is beyond the scope of the command set , the tool is useless .
Further , it is often tedious or impossible to reproduce an anomalous state of the program , especially when the state is embedded in the program ’s data structures .
Acid applies some ideas found in CAD software used for hardware test and simulation .
It is based on the notion that the state and resources of a program are best represented and manipulated by a language .
The state and resources , such as memory , registers , variables , type information and source code are represented by variables in the language .
Expressions provide a computation mechanism and control statements allow repetitive or selective interpretation based on the result of expression evaluation .
The heart of the Acid debugger is an interpreter for a small typeless language whose operators mirror the operations of C and Alef , which in turn correspond well to the basic operations of the machine .
The interpreter itself knows nothing of the underlying hardware ; it deals with the program state and resources in the abstract .
Fundamental routines to control processes , read files , and interface to the system are implemented as builtin functions available to the interpreter .
The actual debugger functionality is coded in Acid ; commands are implemented as Acid functions .
This language - based approach has several advantages .
Most importantly , programs written in Acid , including most of the debugger itself , are inherently portable .
Furthermore , Acid avoids the limitations other debuggers impose when debugging parallel programs .
Instead of embedding a fixed process model in the debugger , Acid allows the programmer to adapt the debugger to handle an arbitrary process partitioning or program structure .
The ability to interact dynamically with an executing process provides clear advantages over debuggers constrained to probe a static image .
Finally , the Acid language is a powerful vehicle for expressing assertions about logic , process state , and the contents of data structures .
When combined with dynamic interaction it allows a limited form of automated program verification without requiring modification or recompilation of the source code .
The language is also an excellent vehicle for preserving a test suite for later regression testing .
The debugger may be customized by its users ; standard functions may be modified or extended to suit a particular application or preference .
For example , the kernel developers in our group require a command set supporting assembler - level debugging while the application programmers prefer source - level functionality .
Although the default library is biased toward assembler - level debugging , it is easily modified to provide a convenient source - level interface .
The debugger itself does not change ; the user combines primitives and existing Acid functions in different ways to implement the desired interface .
2. Related Work
DUEL [ Gol93 ] , an extension to gdb [ Stal91 ] , proposes using a high level expression evaluator to solve some of these problems .
The evaluator provides iterators to loop over data structures and conditionals to control evaluation of expressions .
The author shows that complex state queries can be formulated by combining concise expressions but this only addresses part of the problem .
A program is a dynamic entity ; questions asked when the program is in a static state are meaningful only after the program has been ‘ caught ’ in that state .
The framework for manipulating the program is still as primitive as the underlying debugger .
While DUEL provides a means to probe data structures it entirely neglects the most beneficial aspect of debugging languages : the ability to control processes .
Acid is structured around a thread of control that passes between the interpreter and the target program .
The NeD debugger [ May92 ] is a set of extensions to TCL [ Ous90 ] that provide debugging primitives .
The resulting language , NeDtcl , is used to implement a portable interface between a conventional debugger , pdb [ May90 ] , and a server that executes NeDtcl programs operating on the target program .
Execution of the NeDtcl programs implements the debugging primitives that pdb expects .
NeD is targeted at multi-process debugging across a network , and proves the flexibility of a language as a means of communication between debugging tools .
Whereas NeD provides an interface between a conventional debugger and the process it debugs , Acid is the debugger itself .
While NeD has some of the ideas found in Acid it is targeted toward a different purpose .
Acid seeks to integrate the manipulation of a program ’s resources into the debugger while NeD provides a flexible interconnect between components of the debugging environment .
The choice of TCL is appropriate for its use in NeD but is not suitable for Acid .
Acid relies on the coupling of the type system with expression evaluation , which are the root of its design , to provide the debugging primitives .
Dalek [ Ols90 ] is an event based language extension to gdb .
State transitions in the target program cause events to be queued for processing by the debugging language .
Acid has many of the advantages of same process or local agent debuggers , like Parasight [ Aral ] , without the need for dynamic linking or shared memory .
Acid improves on the ideas of these other systems by completely integrating all aspects of the debugging process into the language environment .
Of particular importance is the relationship between Acid variables , program symbols , source code , registers and type information .
This integration is made possible by the design of the Acid language .
Interpreted languages such as Lisp and Smalltalk are able to provide richer debugging environments through more complete information than their compiled counterparts .
Acid is a means to gather and represent similar information about compiled programs through cooperation with the compilation tools and library implementers .
3. Acid the Language
Acid is a small interpreted language targeted to its debugging task .
It focuses on representing program state and addressing data rather than expressing complex computations .
Program state is addressable from an Acid program .
In addition to parsing and executing expressions and providing an architecture - independent interface to the target process , the interpreter supplies a mark - and - scan garbage collector to manage storage .
Every Acid session begins with the loading of the Acid libraries .
These libraries contain functions , written in Acid , that provide a standard debugging environment including breakpoint management , stepping by instruction or statement , stack tracing , and access to variables , memory , and registers .
The library contains 600 lines of Acid code and provides functionality similar to dbx .
Following the loading of the system library , Acid loads user - specified libraries ; this load sequence allows the user to augment or override the standard commands to customize the debugging environment .
When all libraries are loaded , Acid issues an interactive prompt and begins evaluating expressions entered by the user .
The Acid ‘ commands ’ are actually invocations of builtin primitives or previously defined Acid functions .
Acid evaluates each expression as it is entered and prints the result .
4. Types and Variables
Acid variables are of four basic types : integer , string , float , and list .
The type of a variable is inferred by the type of the right - hand side of an assignment expression .
Many of the operators can be applied to more than one type ; for these operators the action of the operator is determined by the type of its operands .
For example , the + operator adds integer and float operands , and concatenates string and list operands .
Lists are the only complex type in Acid ; there are no arrays , structures or pointers .
Operators provide head , tail , append and delete operations .
Lists can also be indexed like arrays .
Acid has two levels of scope : global and local .
Function parameters and variables declared in a function body using the local keyword are created at entry to the function and exist for the lifetime of a function .
Global variables are created by assignment and need not be declared .
All variables and functions in the program being debugged are entered in the Acid symbol table as global variables during Acid initialization .
Conflicting variable names are resolved by prefixing enough ‘ $’ characters to make them unique .
Syntactically , Acid variables and target program symbols are referenced identically .
However , the variables are managed differently in the Acid symbol table and the user must be aware of this distinction .
The value of an Acid variable is stored in the symbol table ; a reference returns the value .
The symbol table entry for a variable or function in the target program contains the address of that symbol in the image of the program .
Thus , the value of a program variable is accessed by indirect reference through the Acid variable that has the same name ; the value of an Acid variable is the address of the corresponding program variable .
5. Control Flow
The while and loop statements implement looping .
The former is similar to the same statement in C .
The latter evaluates starting and ending expressions yielding integers and iterates while an incrementing loop index is within the bounds of those expressions .
acid : i = 0 ; loop 1,5 do print ( i=i+1 )
0x00000001
0x00000002
0x00000003
0x00000004
0x00000005
acid :
The traditional if - then - else statement implements conditional execution .
6. Addressing
Two indirection operators allow Acid to access values in the program being debugged .
The * operator fetches a value from the memory image of an executing process ; the @ operator fetches a value from the text file of the process .
When either operator appears on the left side of an assignment , the value is written rather than read .
The indirection operator must know the size of the object referenced by a variable .
The Plan 9 compilers neglect to include this information in the program symbol table , so Acid cannot derive this information implicitly .
Instead Acid variables have formats .
The format is a code letter specifying the printing style and the effect of some of the operators on that variable .
The indirection operators look at the format code to determine the number of bytes to read or write .
The format codes are derived from the format letters used by db .
By default , symbol table variables and numeric constants are assigned the format code ’ X ’ which specifies 32 - bit hexadecimal .
Printing such a variable yields output of the form 0x00123456 .
An indirect reference through the variable fetches 32 bits of data at the address indicated by the variable .
Other formats specify various data types , for example i an instruction , D a signed 32 bit decimal , s a null - terminated string .
The fmt function allows the user to change the format code of a variable to control the printing format and operator side effects .
This function evaluates the expression supplied as the first argument , attaches the format code supplied as the second argument to the result and returns that value .
If the result is assigned to a variable , the new format code applies to that variable .
For convenience , Acid provides the \ operator as a shorthand infix form of fmt .
For example :
acid : x=10
acid : x // print x in hex
0x0000000a
acid : x = fmt( x , ’ D ’ ) // make x type decimal
acid : print( x , fmt( x , ’ X ’ ) , x\X ) // print x in decimal & hex
10 0x0000000a 0x0000000a
acid : x // print x in decimal
10
acid : x\o // print x in octal
000000000012
The ++ and -- operators increment or decrement a variable by an amount determined by its format code .
Some formats imply a non-fixed size .
For example , the i format code disassembles an instruction into a string .
On a 68020 , which has variable length instructions :
acid : p=main\i // p=addr ( main ) , type INST
acid : loop 1,5 do print ( p\X , @p ++ ) // disassemble 5 instr’s
0x0000222e LEA 0xffffe948( A7 ) ,A7
0x00002232 MOVL s+0x4 ( A7 ) , A2
0x00002236 PEA 0x2 f ( $0 )
0x0000223a MOVL A2 , -( A7 )
0x0000223c BSR utfrrune
acid :
Here , main is the address of the function of the same name in the program under test .
The loop retrieves the five instructions beginning at that address and then prints the address and the assembly language representation of each .
Notice that the stride of the increment operator varies with the size of the instruction : the MOVL at 0x0000223a is a two byte instruction while all others are four bytes long .
Registers are treated as normal program variables referenced by their symbolic assembler language names .
When a process stops , the register set is saved by the kernel at a known virtual address in the process memory map .
The Acid variables associated with the registers point to the saved values and the * indirection operator can then be used to read and write the register set .
Since the registers are accessed via Acid variables they may be used in arbitrary expressions .
acid : PC // addr of saved PC
0xc0000f60
acid : *PC
0x0000623 c // contents of PC
acid : * PC\a
main
acid : * R1=10 // modify R1
acid : asm (* PC+4 ) // disassemble @ PC+4
main+0x4 0x00006240 MOVW R31,0x0 ( R29 )
main+0x8 0x00006244 MOVW $ setR30 ( SB ) , R30
main+0x10 0x0000624c MOVW R1 , _clock ( SB )
Here , the saved PC is stored at address 0xc0000f60 ; its current content is 0x0000623c .
The ‘ a ’ format code converts this value to a string specifying the address as an offset beyond the nearest symbol .
After setting the value of register 1 , the example uses the asm command to disassemble a short section of code beginning at four bytes beyond the current value of the PC .
7. Process Interface
A program executing under Acid is monitored through the proc file system interface provided by Plan 9 .
Textual messages written to the ctl file control the execution of the process .
For example writing waitstop to the control file causes the write to block until the target process enters the kernel and is stopped .
When the process is stopped the write completes .
The startstop message starts the target process and then does a waitstop action .
Synchronization between the debugger and the target process is determined by the actions of the various messages .
Some operate asynchronously to the target process and always complete immediately , others block until the action completes .
The asynchronous messages allow Acid to control several processes simultaneously .
The interpreter has builtin functions named after each of the control messages .
The functions take a process id as argument .
Any time a control message causes the program to execute instructions the interpreter performs two actions when the control operation has completed .
The Acid variables pointing at the register set are fixed up to point at the saved registers , and then the user defined function stopped is executed .
The stopped function may print the current address , line of source or instruction and return to interactive mode .
Alternatively it may traverse a complex data structure , gather statistics and then set the program running again .
Several Acid variables are maintained by the debugger rather than the programmer .
These variables allow generic Acid code to deal with the current process , architecture specifics or the symbol table .
The variable pid is the process id of the current process Acid is debugging .
The variable symbols contains a list of lists where each sublist contains the symbol name , its type and the value of the symbol .
The variable registers contains a list of the machine - specific register names .
Global symbols in the target program can be referenced directly by name from Acid .
Local variables are referenced using the colon operator as function : variable .
8. Source Level Debugging
Acid provides several builtin functions to manipulate source code .
The file function reads a text file , inserting each line into a list .
The pcfile and pcline functions each take an address as an argument .
The first returns a string containing the name of the source file and the second returns an integer containing the line number of the source line containing the instruction at the address .
acid : pcfile ( main ) // file containing main
main.c
acid : pcline ( main ) // line # of main in source
11
acid : file ( pcfile ( main ) ) [ pcline ( main ) ] // print that line
main ( int argc , char * argv[ ] )
acid : src(* PC ) // print statements nearby
9
10 void
> 11 main ( int argc , char * argv[ ] )
12 {
13 int a ;
In this example , the three primitives are combined in an expression to print a line of source code associated with an address .
The src function prints a few lines of source around the address supplied as its argument .
A companion routine , Bsrc , communicates with the external editor sam .
Given an address , it loads the corresponding source file into the editor and highlights the line containing the address .
This simple interface is easily extended to more complex functions .
For example , the step function can select the current file and line in the editor each time the target program stops , giving the user a visual trace of the execution path of the program .
A more complete interface allowing two way communication between Acid and the acme user interface [ Pike93 ] is under construction .
A filter between the debugger and the user interface provides interpretation of results from both sides of the interface .
This allows the programming environment to interact with the debugger and vice - versa , a capability missing from the sam interface .
The src and Bsrc functions are both written in Acid code using the file and line primitives .
Acid provides library functions to step through source level statements and functions .
Furthermore , addresses in Acid expressions can be specified by source file and line .
Source code is manipulated in the Acid list data type .
9 . The Acid Library
The following examples define some useful commands and illustrate the interaction of the debugger and the interpreter .
defn bpset ( addr ) // set breakpoint
{
if match ( addr , bplist ) >= 0 then
print ( " bkpoint already set : " , addr\a , "
" ) ;
else {
* fmt ( addr , bpfmt ) = bpinst ; // plant it
bplist = append bplist , addr ; // add to list
}
}
The bpset function plants a break point in memory .
The function starts by using the match builtin to search the breakpoint list to determine if a breakpoint is already set at the address .
The indirection operator , controlled by the format code returned by the fmt primitive , is used to plant the breakpoint in memory .
The variables bpfmt and bpinst are Acid global variables containing the format code specifying the size of the breakpoint instruction and the breakpoint instruction itself .
These variables are set by architecture - dependent library code when the debugger first attaches to the executing image .
Finally the address of the breakpoint is appended to the breakpoint list , bplist .
defn step ( ) // single step
{
local lst , lpl , addr , bput ;
bput = 0 ; // sitting on bkpoint
if match ( * PC , bplist ) >= 0 then {
bput = fmt(* PC , bpfmt ) ; // save current addr
* bput = @bput ; // replace it
}
lst = follow ( * PC ) ; // get follow set
lpl = lst ;
while lpl do { // place breakpoints
*( head lpl ) = bpinst ;
lpl = tail lpl ;
}
startstop ( pid ) ; // do the step
while lst do { // remove breakpoints
addr = fmt ( head lst , bpfmt ) ;
* addr = @addr ; // replace instr .
lst = tail lst ;
}
if bput != 0 then
* bput = bpinst ; // restore breakpoint
}
The step function executes a single assembler instruction .
If the PC is sitting on a breakpoint , the address and size of the breakpoint are saved .
The breakpoint instruction is then removed using the @ operator to fetch bpfmt bytes from the text file and to place it into the memory of the executing process using the * operator .
The follow function is an Acid builtin which returns a follow - set : a list of instruction addresses which could be executed next .
If the instruction stored at the PC is a branch instruction , the list contains the addresses of the next instruction and the branch destination ; otherwise , it contains only the address of the next instruction .
The follow - set is then used to replace each possible following instruction with a breakpoint instruction .
The original instructions need not be saved ; they remain in their unaltered state in the text file .
The startstop builtin writes the ‘ startstop ’ message to the proc control file for the process named pid .
The target process executes until some condition causes it to enter the kernel , in this case , the execution of a breakpoint .
When the process blocks , the debugger regains control and invokes the Acid library function stopped which reports the address and cause of the blockage .
The startstop function completes and returns to the step function where the follow - set is used to replace the breakpoints placed earlier .
Finally , if the address of the original PC contained a breakpoint , it is replaced .
Notice that this approach to process control is inherently portable ; the Acid code is shared by the debuggers for all architectures .
Acid variables and builtin functions provide a transparent interface to architecture - dependent values and functions .
Here the breakpoint value and format are referenced through Acid variables and the follow primitive masks the differences in the underlying instruction set .
The next function , similar to the dbx command of the same name , is a simpler example .
This function steps through a single source statement but steps over function calls .
defn next ( )
{
local sp , bound ;
sp = *SP ; // save starting SP
bound = fnbound (* PC ) ; // begin & end of fn .
stmnt ( ) ; // step 1 statement
pc = * PC ;
if pc >= bound [ 0 ] && pc < bound [ 1 ] then
return {} ;
while ( pc< bound [ 0 ] || pc>bound [ 1 ] ) && sp>=*SP do {
step ( ) ;
pc = * PC ;
}
src(* PC ) ;
}
The next function starts by saving the current stack pointer in a local variable .
It then uses the Acid library function fnbound to return the addresses of the first and last instructions in the current function in a list .
The stmnt function executes a single source statement and then uses src to print a few lines of source around the new PC .
If the new value of the PC remains in the current function , next returns .
When the executed statement is a function call or a return from a function , the new value of the PC is outside the bounds calculated by fnbound and the test of the while loop is evaluated .
If the statement was a return , the new value of the stack pointer is greater than the original value and the loop completes without execution .
Otherwise , the loop is entered and instructions are continually executed until the value of the PC is between the bounds calculated earlier .
At that point , execution ceases and a few lines of source in the vicinity of the PC are printed .
Acid provides concise and elegant expression for control and manipulation of target programs .
These examples demonstrate how a few well - chosen primitives can be combined to create a rich debugging environment .
10 . Dealing With Multiple Architectures
A single binary of Acid may be used to debug a program running on any of the five processor architectures supported by Plan 9 .
For example , Plan 9 allows a user on a MIPS to import the proc file system from an i486 - based PC and remotely debug a program executing on that processor .
Two levels of abstraction provide this architecture independence .
On the lowest level , a Plan 9 library supplies functions to decode the file header of the program being debugged and select a table of system parameters and a jump vector of architecture - dependent functions based on the magic number .
Among these functions are byte - order - independent access to memory and text files , stack manipulation , disassembly , and floating point number interpretation .
The second level of abstraction is supplied by Acid .
It consists of primitives and approximately 200 lines of architecture - dependent Acid library code that interface the interpreter to the architecture - dependent library .
This layer performs functions such as mapping register names to memory locations , supplying breakpoint values and sizes , and converting processor specific data to Acid data types .
An example of the latter is the stack trace function strace , which uses the stack traversal functions in the architecture - dependent library to construct a list of lists describing the context of a process .
The first level of list selects each function in the trace ; subordinate lists contain the names and values of parameters and local variables of the functions .
Acid commands and library functions that manipulate and display process state information operate on the list representation and are independent of the underlying architecture .
11 . Alef Runtime
Alef is a concurrent programming language , designed specifically for systems programming , which supports both shared variable and message passing paradigms .
Alef borrows the C expression syntax but implements a substantially different type system .
The language provides a rich set of exception handling , process management , and synchronization primitives , which rely on a runtime system .
Alef program bugs are often deadlocks , synchronization failures , or non-termination caused by locks being held incorrectly .
In such cases , a process stalls deep in the runtime code and it is clearly unreasonable to expect a programmer using the language to understand the detailed internal semantics of the runtime support functions .
Instead , there is an Alef support library , coded in Acid , that allows the programmer to interpret the program state in terms of Alef operations .
Consider the example of a multi-process program stalling because of improper synchronization .
A stack trace of the program indicates that it is waiting for an event in some obscure Alef runtime synchronization function .
The function itself is irrelevant to the programmer ; of greater importance is the identity of the unfulfilled event .
Commands in the Alef support library decode the runtime data structures and program state to report the cause of the blockage in terms of the high - level operations available to the Alef programmer .
Here , the Acid language acts as a communications medium between Alef implementer and Alef user .
12 . Parallel Debugging
The central issue in parallel debugging is how the debugger is multiplexed between the processes comprising the program .
Acid has no intrinsic model of process partitioning ; it only assumes that parallel programs share a symbol table , though they need not share memory .
The setproc primitive attaches the debugger to a running process associated with the process ID supplied as its argument and assigns that value to the global variable pid , thereby allowing simple rotation among a group of processes .
Further , the stack trace primitive is driven by parameters specifying a unique process context , so it is possible to examine the state of cooperating processes without switching the debugger focus from the process of interest .
Since Acid is inherently extensible and capable of dynamic interaction with subordinate processes , the programmer can define Acid commands to detect and control complex interactions between processes .
In short , the programmer is free to specify how the debugger reacts to events generated in specific threads of the program .
The support for parallel debugging in Acid depends on a crucial kernel modification : when the text segment of a program is written ( usually to place a breakpoint ) , the segment is cloned to prevent other threads from encountering the breakpoint .
Although this incurs a slight performance penalty , it is of little importance while debugging .
13 . Communication Between Tools
The Plan 9 Alef and C compilers do not embed detailed type information in the symbol table of an executable file .
However , they do accept a command line option causing them to emit descriptions of complex data types ( e.g. , aggregates and abstract data types ) to an auxiliary file .
The vehicle for expressing this information is Acid source code .
When an Acid debugging session is subsequently started , that file is loaded with the other Acid libraries .
For each complex object in the program the compiler generates three pieces of Acid code .
The first is a table describing the size and offset of each member of the complex data type .
Following is an Acid function , named the same as the object , that formats and prints each member .
Finally , Acid declarations associate the Alef or C program variables of a type with the functions to print them .
The three forms of declaration are shown in the following example :
struct Bitmap {
Rectangle 0 r ;
Rectangle 16 clipr ;
’ D’ 32 ldepth ;
’ D’ 36 id ;
’ X’ 40 cache ;
} ;
defn
Bitmap ( addr ) {
complex Bitmap addr ;
print ( " Rectangle r {
" ) ;
Rectangle ( addr.r ) ;
print ( " }
" ) ;
print ( " Rectangle clipr {
" ) ;
Rectangle ( addr.clipr ) ;
print ( " }
" ) ;
print ( " ldepth " , addr.ldepth , "
" ) ;
print ( " id " , addr.id , "
" ) ;
print ( " cache " , addr.cache , "
" ) ;
} ;
complex Bitmap darkgrey ;
complex Bitmap Window_settag : b ;
The struct declaration specifies decoding instructions for the complex type named Bitmap .
Although the syntax is superficially similar to a C structure declaration , the semantics differ markedly : the C declaration specifies a layout , while the Acid declaration tells how to decode it .
The declaration specifies a type , an offset , and name for each member of the complex object .
The type is either the name of another complex declaration , for example , Rectangle , or a format code .
The offset is the number of bytes from the start of the object to the member and the name is the member ’s name in the Alef or C declaration .
This type description is a close match for C and Alef , but is simple enough to be language independent .
The Bitmap function expects the address of a Bitmap as its only argument .
It uses the decoding information contained in the Bitmap structure declaration to extract , format , and print the value of each member of the complex object pointed to by the argument .
The Alef compiler emits code to call other Acid functions where a member is another complex type ; here , Bitmap calls Rectangle to print its contents .
The complex declarations associate Alef variables with complex types .
In the example , darkgrey is the name of a global variable of type Bitmap in the program being debugged .
Whenever the name darkgrey is evaluated by Acid , it automatically calls the Bitmap function with the address of darkgrey as the argument .
The second complex declaration associates a local variable or parameter named b in function Window_settag with the Bitmap complex data type .
Acid borrows the C operators .
and -> to access the decoding parameters of a member of a complex type .
Although this representation is sufficiently general for describing the decoding of both C and Alef complex data types , it may prove too restrictive for target languages with more complicated type systems .
Further , the assumption that the compiler can select the proper Acid format code for each basic type in the language is somewhat naive .
For example , when a member of a complex type is a pointer , it is assigned a hexadecimal type code ; integer members are always assigned a decimal type code .
This heuristic proves inaccurate when an integer field is a bit mask or set of bit flags which are more appropriately displayed in hexadecimal or octal .
14 . Code Verification
Acid ’s ability to interact dynamically with an executing program allows passive test and verification of the target program .
For example , a common concern is leak detection in programs using malloc .
Of interest are two items : finding memory that was allocated but never freed and detecting bad pointers passed to free .
An auxiliary Acid library contains Acid functions to monitor the execution of a program and detect these faults , either as they happen or in the automated post - mortem analysis of the memory arena .
In the following example , the sort command is run under the control of the Acid memory leak library .
helix % acid -l malloc / bin / sort
/ bin /sort : mips plan 9 executable
/lib/acid/port
/lib/acid/mips
/lib/acid/malloc

27680 : breakpoint _exits+0x4 MOVW
$ 0x8,R1
acid :
The go command creates a process and plants breakpoints at the entry to malloc and free .
The program is then started and continues until it exits or stops .
If the reason for stopping is anything other than the breakpoints in malloc and free , Acid prints the usual status information and returns to the interactive prompt .
When the process stops on entering malloc , the debugger must capture and save the address that malloc will return .
After saving a stack trace so the calling routine can be identified , it places a breakpoint at the return address and restarts the program .
When malloc returns , the breakpoint stops the program , allowing the debugger to grab the address of the new memory block from the return register .
The address and stack trace are added to the list of outstanding memory blocks , the breakpoint is removed from the return point , and the process is restarted .
When the process stops at the beginning of free , the memory address supplied as the argument is compared to the list of outstanding memory blocks .
If it is not found an error message and a stack trace of the call is reported ; otherwise , the address is deleted from the list .
When the program exits , the list of outstanding memory blocks contains the addresses of all blocks that were allocated but never freed .
The leak library function traverses the list producing a report describing the allocated blocks .

acid : refs ( )
data...bss... stack ...
acid : leak ( )
acid :
The presence of a block in the allocation list does not imply it is there because of a leak ; for instance , it may have been in use when the program terminated .
The refs ( ) library function scans the data , bss , and stack segments of the process looking for pointers into the allocated blocks .
When one is found , the block is deleted from the outstanding block list .
The leak function is used again to report the blocks remaining allocated and unreferenced .
This strategy proves effective in detecting disconnected ( but non-circular ) data structures .
The leak detection process is entirely passive .
The program is not specially compiled and the source code is not required .
As with the Acid support functions for the Alef runtime environment , the author of the library routines has encapsulated the functionality of the library interface in Acid code .
Any programmer may then check a program ’s use of the library routines without knowledge of either implementation .
The performance impact of running leak detection is great ( about 10 times slower ) , but it has not prevented interactive programs like sam and the 8 ½ window system from being tested .
15 . Code Coverage
Another common component of software test uses coverage analysis .
The purpose of the test is to determine which paths through the code have not been executed while running the test suite .
This is usually performed by a combination of compiler support and a reporting tool run on the output generated by statements compiled into the program .
The compiler emits code that logs the progress of the program as it executes basic blocks and writes the results to a file .
The file is then processed by the reporting tool to determine which basic blocks have not been executed .
Acid can perform the same function in a language independent manner without modifying the source , object or binary of the program .
The following example shows ls being run under the control of the Acid coverage library .
philw - helix % acid -l coverage / bin/ls
/ bin/ls : mips plan 9 executable
/lib/acid/port
/lib/acid/mips
/lib/acid/ coverage
acid : coverage ( )
acid
newstime

102 : return 1 ;
103 : }
104 : if ( db[ 0].qid.path&CHDIR && dflag==0 ) {
105 : output ( ) ;
ls.c:122,126
122 : memmove ( dirbuf+ndir , db , sizeof ( Dir ) ) ;
123 : dirbuf [ndir ] . prefix = 0 ;
124 : p = utfrrune(s , ’/’ ) ;
125 : if ( p ) {
126 : dirbuf[ndir ]. prefix = s ;
The coverage function begins by looping through the text segment placing breakpoints at the entry to each basic block .
The start of each basic block is found using the Acid builtin function follow .
If the list generated by follow contains more than one element , then the addresses mark the start of basic blocks .
A breakpoint is placed at each address to detect entry into the block .
If the result of follow is a single address then no action is taken , and the next address is considered .
Acid maintains a list of breakpoints already in place and avoids placing duplicates ( an address may be the destination of several branches ) .
After placing the breakpoints the program is set running .
Each time a breakpoint is encountered Acid deletes the address from the breakpoint list , removes the breakpoint from memory and then restarts the program .
At any instant the breakpoint list contains the addresses of basic blocks which have not been executed .
The analyse function reports the lines of source code bounded by basic blocks whose addresses are have not been deleted from the breakpoint list .
These are the basic blocks which have not been executed .
Program performance is almost unaffected since each breakpoint is executed only once and then removed .
The library contains a total of 128 lines of Acid code .
An obvious extension of this algorithm could be used to provide basic block profiling .
16 . Conclusion
Acid has two areas of weakness .
As with other language - based tools like awk , a programmer must learn yet another language to step beyond the normal debugging functions and use the full power of the debugger .
Second , the command line interface supplied by the yacc parser is inordinately clumsy .
Part of the problem relates directly to the use of yacc and could be circumvented with a custom parser .
However , structural problems would remain : Acid often requires too much typing to execute a simple command .
A debugger should prostitute itself to its users , doing whatever is wanted with a minimum of encouragement ; commands should be concise and obvious .
The language interface is more consistent than an ad hoc command interface but is clumsy to use .
Most of these problems are addressed by an Acme interface which is under construction .
This should provide the best of both worlds : graphical debugging and access to the underlying acid language when required .
The name space clash between Acid variables , keywords , program variables , and functions is unavoidable .
Although it rarely affects a debugging session , it is annoying when it happens and is sometimes difficult to circumvent .
The current renaming scheme is too crude ; the new names are too hard to remember .
Acid has proved to be a powerful tool whose applications have exceeded expectations .
Of its strengths , portability , extensibility and parallel debugging support were by design and provide the expected utility .
In retrospect , its use as a tool for code test and verification and as a medium for communicating type information and encapsulating interfaces has provided unanticipated benefits and altered our view of the debugging process .

Ein Polizist entdeckt auf einem Spielplatz einen älteren Mann und meint einen potenziellen Kinderschänder entdeckt zu haben .
Er will ihn verscheuchen .
In seinem Übereifer wird er jedoch handgreiflich und landet letztlich vor Gericht .
Wie sieht ein typischer Kinderschänder aus ?
Ist er bärtig , weißhaarig , untersetzt und treibt sich auf Spielplätzen herum ?
An einem Frühlingsvormittag beantwortete ein Berliner Polizist all diese Fragen mit " Ja " .
Er witterte beim Anblick eines solchen Herrn die scheinbare Gefahr und zog alle Register seiner Macht .
Ein gutes
Jahr später muss sich Frank Marten * wegen Nötigung und Beleidigung vor dem Richter verantworten .
Attraktiv sieht er aus , der Kontaktbereichsbeamte aus dem Berliner Stadtbezirk Friedrichshain .
Sein ebenmäßiges
Gesicht mit den hellen Augen ist sonnengebräunt , die grauen Haare millimeterkurz geschnitten , seine Figur wirkt sportlich .
Zu den Vorwürfen der Anklage hat der 45 - jährige Familienvater einen Brief an das Gericht geschrieben .
Der Richter bietet an , diesen vorzulesen und zu besprechen .
Bauchgefühl als Grund für die Kontrolle
Frank Marten war an jenem Mittwoch im April 2008 mit dem Fahrrad in seinem Gebiet unterwegs .
Am Vormittag kontrollierte er einen großen Spielplatz , auf dem sich etliche Kinder mit und ohne Eltern befunden hätten .
Der Beamte wollte gerade den Platz verlassen , als ihm ein etwa 60 - jähriger , untersetzter Mann begegnete .
" Er benahm sich anders als andere Personen " , schrieb Marten .
" Er warf mir einen kurzen , unauffälligen Blick zu . "
Der Verdächtige habe den Spielplatz durch den Hinterausgang verlassen wollen , aber vergeblich an dem verschlossenen Tor gerüttelt .
Er beschloss , die Person zu kontrollieren .
" Ich entbot den Tagesgruß und fragte , ob ich behilflich sein könne " , schrieb der Angeklagte .
Nein , entgegnete der ältere
Herr , er schaue sich hier nur um , weil er bis Mitte der 90er Jahre hier gewohnt habe .
Der Polizist verlangte nun den Ausweis seines Gegenübers , den er auch erhielt .
" Auf welcher rechtlichen Grundlage verlangten Sie den Ausweis " , will der Richter wissen .
Frank Marten beruft sich auf das Allgemeine Sicherheits - und Ordnungsgesetz : " Ich hatte ein komisches Bauchgefühl , was die Person da macht . "
Er habe die Angaben überprüfen wollen .
" Ihre Ermächtigungsgrundlage war also Ihr Bauchgefühl " , sagt der Richter .
" Da war doch keine Gefahr zu erkennen , die von der Person ausgeht ?
Er hat ja gar keine Kinder angesprochen ! "
Dem Richter kräuseln sich die Zehennägel
Er wolle den Mann ja nicht falsch verdächtigen , windet sich der Angeklagte : " Das Thema Kinderschutz ist ein kompliziertes Thema .
Ich habe aus meinem Lebensgefühl als Familienvater , aus meinem Zivildasein und meiner Berufserfahrung heraus nun mal unangenehme Maßnahmen zum Schutz der Kinder durchzuführen . "
Ob es in seinem Umfeld schon einmal Vorfälle gab , die ihm persönlich nahe gegangen seien , fragt der Richter .
" Etliche " , antwortet der Polizist .
Aus den Medien habe er davon erfahren .
Der Richter liest weiter aus dem Brief : " Dann herrschte die kontrollierte Person mich an und sprach von einer willkürlichen Maßnahme .
Er werde unter Generalverdacht gestellt . "
Der ältere
Herr wollte wissen , was er falsch gemacht habe und verlangte Martens Dienstnummer , welche dieser ihm auch gab .
Der Beamte erklärte , sein Gegenüber habe eine Ordnungswidrigkeit begangen .
Er dürfe sich ohne Kinder nicht auf Spielplätzen aufhalten .
Auf dem Eingangsschild stände nämlich : " Nur für Kinder bis 15 Jahren " .
Frank Marten schrieb nun : " Ich habe ihm einen Platzverweis erteilt und diesen mit körperlichem Zwang durchgesetzt . "
" Da bekommt der Jurist in mir kräuselige Zehennägel " , sagt der Richter .
" Das Schild verbietet nicht , dass sich dort Erwachsene aufhalten , sonst dürften auch die Eltern da nicht drauf .
Alles ist erlaubt , was nicht ausdrücklich verboten ist . "
In Vorbereitung der Verhandlung hat sich der Richter die " Öffentlich - rechtliche Benutzungsregelung " angeschaut .
Aus dieser habe sich kein Grund für Ordnungsgeld und Platzverweis ergeben .
Ein letztes Mal begehrt der Angeklagte auf : " Aber wenn die Banden nachts auf Kinderspielplätzen saufen ?
Wie will man denn sonst verhindern , dass Jugendliche wilde Partys feiern ?
Da werden Hunde mitgenommen et cetera pp . ! "
" Kopf abreißen " oder " Hals umdrehen "
Vehement bestreitet Frank Marten , den älteren Herrn beleidigt zu haben .
" Schieb deinen Arsch hier raus !
Hau ab ! " , soll er gesagt haben und " Wenn ich dich noch mal hier sehe , reiße ich dir den Kopf ab ! "
Nein , er sei seit 27 Jahren Polizist und geschult , sich solche Äußerungen zu verkneifen .
Gerhard Gans * schildert die Auseinandersetzung ähnlich - bis auf den Schluss .
Er habe damals wissen wollen , warum der Beamte ihm den Platzverweis ohne Begründung erteile .
" Da kam nichts .
Er schob sein Unterbecken gegen das meinige und äußerte in ziemlich aggressivem Ton : ‚ Wenn ich dich noch mal erwische , drehe ich dir den Hals um ! '
Vorher hat er noch nach links und rechts geguckt , ob ihn jemand hört .
Das zeigte mir , dass er sich des polizeilichen Übergriffs bewusst war " , sagt der 68 - jährige Journalist .
" Sprach der Angeklagte von ‚ Kopf abreißen ' oder von ‚ Hals umdrehen ' " , fragt der Richter den Zeugen .
Der antwortet : " Entschuldigen Sie , das ist doch dasselbe in Grün ! "
Er weiß nicht , wie genau es Juristen mit den Fakten nehmen .
" Haben Sie eine Vorstellung , warum Sie der Beamte angesprochen hat " , will der Richter wissen .
" Vielleicht hat er gedacht , das könnte ein potentieller Kinderschänder sein " , antwortet Gans .
" Aber ich denke , wer etwas im Schilde führt , der versucht , schnell und unbehelligt davon zu kommen .
Ich jedenfalls fühle mich beleidigt .
So kann sich niemand verhalten , der im öffentlichen Dienst arbeitet und von meinen Steuern bezahlt wird . "
Der Staatsanwalt wirkt ratlos
Ratlos wirkt der Staatsanwalt in seinem Plädoyer .
Er spricht von einer " undurchsichtigen Rechtslage " , auf dessen Grundlage der Angeklagte den Zeugen angesprochen habe .
Er glaube dem Zeugen , halte aber auch den Polizisten für integer .
Nach dem Willen des Anklägers soll Frank Marten frei gesprochen werden , " weil ich ihm die Tat nicht nachweisen kann . "
Der Verteidiger betont die Unglaubwürdigkeit des Zeugen : Dieser habe Vorurteile gegenüber Beamten , weil diese seine " Steuergelder verschleudern " würden .
Der Angeklagte sagt , er habe schon mehrere Retourkutschen erlebt : " Diese übertrifft an Boshaftigkeit alles .
Ich werde auch in Zukunft weiter so handeln müssen .
Ich weiß nicht , wie ich sonst meinen Beruf weiter ausüben könnte . "
Unbeeindruckt von seinen Kollegen entschließt sich der Richter zu einer Verwarnung .
Normalerweise hätte er das Verfahren wegen geringer Schuld eingestellt .
In seinen Augen habe der Angeklagte die Sachlage falsch eingeschätzt und übertriebenen Diensteifer gezeigt .
Doch sei es nicht das erste Mal , das Frank Marten wegen einer Beleidigung angeklagt wurde .
Damals wurde das Verfahren eingestellt .
Ein zweites Mal steht dem Gericht diese Möglichkeit nicht zur Verfügung .
Darum soll der Polizist 1600 Euro ( 20 Tagessätze ) nur dann zahlen , falls er innerhalb von zwei Jahren eine weitere Straftat begeht .
Das Urteil sieht außerdem ein Schmerzensgeld von 150 Euro für Gans vor .
" Ein älterer Mann auf einem Spielplatz begründet keine Gefahr "
Der Richter geht davon aus , dass die Worte " Schieb deinen Arsch raus !
Hau ab ! " gefallen sind .
Die andere Beleidigung habe nicht geklärt werden können .
Jedoch genüge der erste Satz für die Verurteilung : " Nicht wegen dem Arsch - das ist ein unschöner Ausdruck - sondern weil es ein Duzen darstellt .
Beamte können nicht das tun , was sie selbst zur Anzeige bringen " , argumentiert der Richter .
Auch der Platzverweis sei völlig rechtswidrig .
Um ihn auszusprechen , bedürfe es einer konkreten Gefahr , nicht einer bloßen Vermutung oder eines Vorurteils .
" Ein älterer Mann auf einem Spielplatz begründet keine Gefahr " , sagt der Richter .
Er glaubt aber nicht , dass Marten mit dem Platzverweis beabsichtigte , eine Gefahr zu bannen .
" Wohl eher wollte er sich das opponierende Verhalten von Gans nicht gefallen lassen . "
" Ich folge dem Zeugen , weil sich seine Version zwanglos in den Ablauf einordnet " , führt er weiter aus .
Am Anfang hätten die beiden Herren noch friedlich miteinander gesprochen .
Dann habe der Polizist den Ausweis verlangt und so die erste Stufe der Auseinandersetzung eingeleitet .
" Es hat keine Steigerung der Gefahr gegeben , doch Marten entschloss sich zur nächsten Stufe , dem Platzverweis . "
Für den Richter ist klar : " Der aggressivere Part lag beim Angeklagten . "

The Django Python web application framework provides tools to parse multi-part form data as any web framework should .
In fact , the developer responsible for creating Django web applications need not concern themselves with the underlying parsing machinery .
However , it is still there and very accessible .
The Django boundary iterators are used to help parse multi-part form data .
These iterators are also general enough to be used in different contexts .
Theclass collaborates with other iterator classes such asand .
An example of these classes collaborating are illustrated below .
In this example , we have a sample message containing two boundaries that is to be parsed .
In order to achieve this , we create three iterators , and a stream .
Theiterator is ainstance that is a very general iterator used to read a single chunk of data at a time .
This iterator expects a file - like object to iterate over .
The two boundary iterators , and , are instances of theclass .
This iterators expect both a data stream and a boundary .
In this case , ainstance is passed to the boundary iterators .
We finally display the results of iterating over the boundary iterators .
By the time the second iterator is reached , the data stream is now shorter in length .
Untrained officers must never again be put in the frontline of policing public protests , according to a highly critical MPs ' report on the G20 protests published today .
The conclusion from the Commons home affairs select committee inquiry into the G20 protests of April 1 follows admissions from senior Metropolitan police officers that some inexperienced officers , who were clearly quite scared , used " inappropriate force " .
The report by the cross-party group of MPs says they " cannot condone the use of untrained , inexperienced officers on the frontline of a public protest under any circumstances " .
Their inquiry also calls for the police to seriously consider whether they can continue with the use of tactics such as kettling – containing protesters behind cordons for a sustained period of time – and the controlled use of force against those who appear hostile without first holding a public debate over the future of policing public protests .
During the G20 protests the Met repeatedly attempted to " kettle " thousands of mainly peaceful demonstrators .
The technique is widely believed to have sparked angry confrontations with protesters , who complained that they were penned in for hours and subjected to baton charges .
Officers in charge of the Met 's public order operations have been lobbying hard to retain the kettling tactic , which they regard as an effective method of preventing unruly protests from spreading through large areas of a city .
The select committee stops short of commenting on the death of the newspaper vendor Ian Tomlinson or the case of Nicola Fisher , who was struck across the face by a police sergeant .
But the MPs say that the images and film footage of those incidents shocked the public and have the potential to undermine trust in the police .
They hoped the incidents would mark the start of a widespread debate on the use of force by the police .
" The basic principle that the police must remember is that protesters are not criminals – the police 's doctrine must remain focused on allowing protest to happen peacefully , " said Keith Vaz , the committee chairman .
" In many ways this was a large protest which passed off remarkably well .
But it is clear that concerns about the policing of the G20 protests have damaged the public 's confidence in the police and that is a great shame . "
He said the ability of the public and the media to monitor every single action of the police through CCTV , mobile phones and video equipment means they have to take even greater care to ensure that all their actions are justifiable .
" There must not be a repetition of this – never again must untrained officers be placed on the frontline of public protest . "
The report describes the policing of the G20 protests as a " remarkably successful operation " in which more than 35,000 demonstrated in the centre of London yet with the minimum of disruption to the City : " Aside from a few high - profile incidents , the policing of the G20 protests passed without drama , " say the MPs before adding that an element of luck played a part in that success .
The MPs repeat their belief that there are no circumstances in which it is acceptable for police officers not to wear their identification numbers and urge those who consciously remove them to face the strongest disciplinary action .
During the Commons inquiry , Commander Bob Broadhurst , the " gold commander " in charge of the G20 policing operation , told the MPs that there had not been any large - scale disorder in London for a number of years of the kind seen summer after summer in the 1980s and 1990s : " That means I now have a workforce of relatively young people that we draw on who are policing Sutton High Street one day and the next day called into central London . "
He said there were 2,500 officers who had only two days of public order training a year and the vast majority of whom had never faced a situation as violent as the G20 protest before .
" That may also be why one or two of them , as you have seen on television , may have used inappropriate force at times ...
I would probably say that was probably more fear and lack of control , whereas our experience in the past is the more we experience these things , the less quick officers are to go to the use of force because they understand more the dynamics , " he said .
The MPs say the risk of relying so heavily on untrained , inexperienced officers in such a highly combustible atmosphere must never be taken again .
Their report also confirms criticisms of police communications with the media and with the protesters and question why it took the personal intervention of Broadhurst to relay the message that the press should be let out of the cordons .
The MPs ' findings are published ahead of a report by Denis O'Connor , the chief inspector of constabulary , in which senior police officers will be told they must use " reasonable discretion " when containing large numbers of protesters .
O'Connor was asked to carry out a national review of public order policing by the Metropolitan police commissioner in April .
He is due to publish his findings this week .
O'Connor is considering whether to endorse a " human rights - based " approach to policing advocated by Sir Hugh Orde , the incoming chief of the Association of Chief Police Officers .
Orde is promoting a model of policing protest developed in Northern Ireland that sees greater emphasis placed on communicating with protesters and facilitating their right to protest .
However , Orde 's position , which gives protesters more freedom to roam , is considered soft by some senior Met officers .
Recently by Gary North : ‘ Dr. Deflation ’ Changes His Mind After 27 + Years
Ken Burns is at it again .
This time , it is a PBS series on the national parks .
He subtitles it “ America ’s Greatest Idea . ”
The national parks are not America ’s greatest idea .
They are the super - rich ’s greatest idea . . . for themselves .
The super rich love nature .
Anyway , they love owning big chunks of nature .
But they face competition .
The masses can buy property right next door .
Land developers buy up acreage and build condos or even worse , time - shares .
Then Mr. and Mrs. Sack Lunch buy the condos and move in .
They litter the area with themselves .
The super - rich want privacy .
This is one of the three identifying marks of being super - rich today .
First , you own magnificent houses that cannot be seen from the highway .
They can be seen only by your peers , after driving down a long highway or from the air in a private plane or helicopter .
Second , you hire lots of servants to manage these properties .
Third , you own private aircraft to take you to your hidden properties with all the servants .
The mark of great wealth in America is inconspicuous consumption .
Who are the main beneficiaries ?
The servants .
They live on the properties year - round and get paid for the privilege .
The super - rich enjoy the view twice a year for a couple of weeks .
It costs them millions of dollars in forfeited income .
The super - rich like to buy low , watch it appreciate , and then never sell .
They do not like price competition .
So , John D. Rockefeller , Jr. devised a plan to get this .
He began this just after the turn of the century in 1900 .
He bought up property in Maine .
So did his peers — the younger super - rich .
Then they gave the surrounding land to the National Park Service .
This was for The People .
The People could come and visit , but they could not come and stay .
The People are allowed to marvel at the scenic beauty .
“ If only we could own a piece of this ! ” they think .
Comes the answer from the family estates : “ Too late , suckers ! ” That puts them in their place .
That is a big part of being a card - carrying member of the super - rich .
You put others in their place .
The secret is to keep them from finding out how you do it .
So , you fund “ The National Parks : America ’s Greatest Idea . ”
They have run this restricted - access land scheme over and over since 1906 .
The popular place to have done this in my generation is in the area around Jackson Hole , Wyoming .
But the first experiment was in Maine .
I wrote about this back in 2000 .
I described the three islands from which the true Powers That Be in the United States have built their family enclaves : Mr. Desert Island in Maine , Jekyll Island in Georgia , and Jupiter Island in Florida .
You can read my essay here .
KEEPING OUT THE MASSES
The national parks remove land from land speculation .
“ All those in favor of grasping land speculators , please stand up . ”
( “ OK , North , you may sit down now . ” )
Land speculators buy property that they believe people would like to own .
They develop the properties at their expense .
If they guess wrong , they lose money — lots of money .
So , they try to offer properties for sale that people will be willing to pay for .
These properties are cut up and sold in terms of the taste of buyers .
The horror !
The elite super - rich do not like what common people like .
One of the ways that a super - rich family demonstrates its rise to status is to sit on the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art ( MOMA ) .
This position is difficult to achieve .
( This is described by a member of the elite , Nelson Aldrich IV , in his book , Old Money . )
They know that if MOMA burned down tomorrow , the general public would not know or care .
A few of the commoners would even rejoice .
( Put me in this category . )
General headquarters for the aesthetic war of America ’s richest elite against the common man ’s idea of beauty is MOMA .
The national parks allocate access in two ways : ( 1 ) first come , first serve and ( 2 ) price .
Commoners must apply to reserve a pass into the popular parks , then drive there .
If there is a waiting list , we know the price was set too low .
If too few people show up at some less desirable park , we know the land is not being put to its highest use — highest use as determined by the free market ’s principle of allocation : “ high bid wins . ”
The parks are becoming famous for huge forest fires .
Rival theorists of land management have competed for a century to gain control on the National Park Service .
There are the “ let it burn ” people .
There are the “ controlled burning ” people .
The parks are the great Federal laboratories for these two views .
There are also rival theories of park access .
There are the hikers - only people .
They are challenged by the internal combustion engine people .
There are the bicycle trails people .
What there are n’t are “ high bid wins ” people .
A society can allocate resources by price or by power .
The national parks have always been allocated by power .
In this competition , The People lose .
“ Power to the People ! ” matches “ I will still respect you in the morning ” as a popular slogan .
Both slogans promote the same result .
FUNDING FOR KEN BURNS
Ken Burns is a hired servant .
He gets to do what he wants at other people ’s expense : the super - rich and the taxpayers .
Burns was funded by General Motors for 22 years .
General Motors last year discovered that it is better for the United Auto Workers union to allocate by power than by price .
The company had priced itself out of the market .
It took an infusion of Federal money to keep the factories humming .
Then the Obama administration gave controlling ownership to the UAW .
The company immediately cut off funding for Burns .
His latest documentary on the parks is the final cut for GM .
An artist just cannot trust those blue collar types !
Burns has survived because the Public Broadcasting System has run his shows .
He would not make it on any other network .
PBS affiliates initially received grants of free television spectrum from the U.S. government .
It also receives money from the Federal government .
Had the principle of high bid wins not been banned by Federal law in the realm of broadcasting spectrum , I doubt that you would have heard of Ken Burns .
Aesthetically , his work appeals to the college - educated people who would rather not walk through MOMA , but who are afraid to admit this to anyone .
PBS is where the super - rich fund the extension of their worldview .
If they should ever quit , “ viewers like you ” will no longer be viewers : not enough funding .
The tax - exempt foundation money keeps the people with brains and cultural influence on their side .
Ken Burns is a man with brains .
He did a documentary on baseball .
Let me know when he does a documentary on NASCAR .
CONCLUSION
My view is that the Federal government should auction off the national parks and use the money to reduce taxes .
Soft - core conservatives think this money should be used to reduce the national debt .
That is the equivalent of putting a 17 - year - old female page on the staff of a Congressman .
It only tempts them .

There is no denying the fact that the world has indeed changed right before our eyes .
Apart from the fact that it has become swift , it has become more convenient and accessible to some extent as well .
Hence , in simpler words , it will not be wrong to say that the world has indeed transformed , with time , into a global village .
Everything is now merely a click of a button away , and even though it does have its downfalls , technology has made life far more comfortable and enjoyable than before .
The introduction and success of the internet have a significant part to play in this .
With the internet came the phenomenon that shook the world to its core : social media .
Social media is something that is so addicting and so helpful that it has now become a significant part of our lives , whether it be for personal purposes or professional reasons .
We cannot ignore the impact social media has had on our lives .
One of the most famous and crucial platforms that changed the dynamics of the way we use the internet is Instagram .
Apart from it being a social media application and platform where users can generate and share content in the form of text , captions , messages , videos , and photos , it has also considerably changed the way we conduct business .
Many businesses worldwide have recognized Instagram as a potential opportunity and have spent a lot of their time and resources in building strategies confined only to Instagram .
Instagram is now being used as a means to conduct and to promote service businesses online .
Many different features allow users to make the most of the platform and get the most out of their business and also to encourage customers to buy and sell online .
Some of these features are discussed below .
Increase followers
One of the most effective ways of conducting any business is to have more customers .
Followers can be your customers in one way or the other .
So a business must look to expand its base by looking at ways to increase followers organically .
One of the easiest ways is getting help from Instagram growth services that promote your account and get real followers , some of these services even have a free trial period when you can see what they are capable of .
Follow this link and find out more about the service and their free trial https://www.simplygram.com/instagram-followers-free-trial/
Invite users to virtual window shop
Instagram is one of the best applications that allow customers and followers to look at some of the products and services a business offers virtually .
This gives a good indication of whether or not a follower should be interested in buying a specific product or service or not .
From the business ’s point of view , it is critically important that the profile should be aesthetic , easy on the eye , user friendly , and highly compatible because it is the first point of contact for the customers .
Offer discounts and benefits
In order to promote online buying and selling , businesses can offer exclusive benefits and discounts on Instagram .
A business may make the most of its reward program or provide exclusive merchandise for its followers etc .
A good and a highly popular way of offering something to the followers is via online giveaways .
Reading about the first Quarterly Bloomberg Global Poll of investors , which found that almost 75 percent of those surveyed give Ben Bernanke favorable marks for his actions as chairman of the Fed during the current financial and economic crisis , my first reaction was to wonder , What are these people thinking ?
The news article also notes that Martin Feldstein , a leading establishment economist , recently said in an interview with Bloomberg that Bernanke has “ done a very good job and I think he should be reappointed . ”
Feldstein is a fairly reliable barometer of what mainstream economists think about macroeconomic policy .
In contrast , when I think of Bernanke ’s actions as chairman of the Fed , I am appalled .
During the past year , he has taken the lead in flooding the financial system with an unprecedented amount of newly created central - bank credit — more than a trillion dollars of new Fed credit has been advanced since mid-September 2008 , more than doubling the total amount outstanding .
Thus , Bernanke has shown himself to be the greatest inflationist of modern times in the advanced economies .
Because the commercial banks have added almost all of the newly created base money to their reserve accounts at the Fed , rather than using it to make new loans and investments , the effect on the money supply and hence on the price level has been muted so far .
Bernanke clearly supposes that he has been heroically fending off the greatest threat to the world economy he can imagine – the dreaded deflation of the price level for currently produced goods and services , a phenomenon associated in his mind with the horrors of the Great Contraction of 1929 - 33 .
He also believes that when the price level begins to accelerate as the banks put their vast , ( legally ) excess reserves to use , he will be able to take counter - measures , such as paying a higher rate of interest on commercial - bank reserves at the Fed or selling securities now held by the Fed in the open market , which will soak up just enough of the potential for the creation of new money that the Fed will be able to disengage gradually and smoothly from its recent , gigantic effusion of new credit , thus avoiding the hyperinflation that it might otherwise produce .
I have serious doubts about whether Bernanke will be able to pull off this Houdini escape from the ravages of the still - dormant monster he has created , but at the moment my concern is not so much with that issue as with the amazing fact that so many investors and economists have applauded his actions so far .
The politicians are not so puzzling : in today ’s world , they invariably demand resort to inflation of money and credit whenever a recession begins — they are inflationists to their very souls ( that ’s assuming they have souls ) .
Putting aside the politicians , I am willing to conjecture as to why so many investors and economists are making what seems to me a huge mistake in evaluating Bernanke ’s actions .
The root problem , I believe , lies in the aggregative character of contemporary thinking about macroeconomic fluctuations .
In this view , rising aggregate real output is good , no matter what the composition of the newly produced goods and services .
A recession , which most analysts understand as a sustained decline of aggregate real output , is bad , and , in their view , it should be combated by fiscal “ stimulus ” and by expansionary monetary policy in order to reverse the decline in aggregate demand .
They do not worry about – indeed , they rarely even pay much attention to — the makeup of the aggregate output that is added during business expansions , lost during business recessions , or brought into being by the government ’s compensating fiscal and monetary actions .
Output is output ; spending is spending .
In fact , the whole idea of using government spending to offset reduced spending by investors or consumers turns on this assumption that a dollar spent is a dollar spent , regardless of what it is spent for .
In today ’s vulgar Keynesian environment , investors and economists do not appreciate how the seeds of macroeconomic busts are sowed by artificially created credit that is employed to finance investments that would not be undertaken if they had to be financed by real savings — investments known in economic theory as malinvestments .
When a large volume of malinvestments has been undertaken during a boom ( e.g. , much of the investment in residential housing and commercial real - estate development between 2002 and 2006 ) , and when for whatever reason the pace of new credit creation slows , causing interest rates to rise , then the unsustainability of these malinvestments becomes increasingly apparent .
More and more of them are terminated , often in unfinished condition , and many such projects go bankrupt for want of buyers willing and able to pay for them in the market .
If the government and the central bank use their fiscal and monetary policies to prop up these malinvestments , they do not solve the basic problem ; they only paper it over for the time being .
The vast assistance given recently to financial institutions embarrassed by investments in bad real - estate - related securities , for example , has allowed these institutions to delay the write - offs and other balance - sheet adjustments that would reflect the errors they have made .
The bailouts have created a large number of zombie financial institutions , much like the ones that caused the Japanese economy to stagnate during the 1990s and later .
Owners and managers of financial firms laden with rotten securities have been holding out for government rescues of various sorts , rather than carrying out the required restructuring , which in many cases must include bankruptcy proceedings .
Just as the malinvestments were made possible in the first place by effusions of artificially created credit and hence artificially depressed interest rates , so now the Treasury and the Fed are keeping the owners of these malinvestments afloat by further effusions of artificially created credit .
But so long as these inherently unsustainable projects continue , they constitute a huge legion of the living dead .
They may look viable , but their viability hinges entirely on de facto subsidies via the government ’s various bailout schemes .
Such projects will remain unsustainable unless continually propped up at the expense of the general public , who will suffer because of increased ordinary taxes or a mounting inflation tax on their dollar - denominated assets .
If the government goes forward in this fashion , it will be sustaining an economy rife with malinvestments kept in operation only by constant transfusions of other people ’s wealth channeled to the zombie projects by the Treasury and the Fed — a permanent policy of robbing prudent , responsible Peter to pay imprudent , irresponsible Paul .
No sound , long - run economic development can be based on such productivity - sapping transfers of wealth into projects that are not worth the expense of keeping them going and which misallocate resources to the overall economy ’s detriment so long as they continue .
Meanwhile , to return to the Bloomberg poll , “ more than three - quarters of investors expect U.S. financial institutions will be in better shape a year from now , ” and a majority believe “ the world economy is stable or improving . ”
And why do they expect this progress will occur ?
Because , “ almost three quarters say [ , ] central banks will hold rates near current levels to support growth . ”
Indeed , Bernanke promises that this policy is precisely the one he will continue to follow .
“ Monetary policy remains focused on fostering economic recovery , ” he declares .
The Fed will maintain a “ highly accommodative ” stance “ for an extended period . ”
In short , if an immense amount of monetary - base inflation and other artificial credit expansion is good , then a great deal more of the same is even better .
Après nous le déluge — oh , but I forget , Bernanke stands ever ready to sponge up that base money the minute the price indexes begin to rise at more than a slight , tolerable annual rate .
Trust him .
Except for the Austrian School economists , hardly anyone is worried that the extensive restructuring necessary to put the economy back on a healthy , market - sustainable track is not being carried out — or , certainly not being carried out on the scale that the current situation requires .
For the overwhelming majority of today ’s investors , economists , and policy makers , output is output , and spending is spending .
They are blind to the mountain of malinvestments staring them in the face .
In the seventy years since John Maynard Keynes steered macroeconomic policy thinking into the dead - end street of misleading , highly aggregative thinking , tremendous damage has been done , but clearly a great deal of additional damage will have to be suffered before the people who bear the burdens of this kind of policy - making awaken to its operation as a mechanism for robbing the many for the benefit of the politically connected few .
AGGRIEVED PARTY : Jakob Christie and David Linton , who says his face was stomped on , outside a flat .
A teenager says his neck was broken by a baton as police shut down a rowdy Wellington party .
Officers were called to a flat in Homebush Rd , Khandallah on Friday night after uninvited guests started fighting outside .
The gatecrashers fled when police arrived , but partygoers say 18 officers entered the house and drove out the remaining 40 - odd guests , using batons to force them down a hallway .
Jakob Christie , 19 , said his neck was broken when the end of a police baton was jabbed into it .
He woke up on Saturday unable to move his head .
X - rays showed that one of his vertebrae had been snapped .
He is in a neckbrace and may need surgery to re-attach a broken piece of bone but he is not paralysed .
Mr Christie , a student , said he had asked the officer he thought had hit him for his badge number .
He repeated his request to the officer in charge at the scene .
" They told me to eff off . "
At least six people who were at the party have contributed to a complaint to be submitted to the Independent Police Conduct Authority about the officers ' behaviour .
Police insist they were simply trying to gain control of the situation .
Josh Kosmala , 23 , who was the sober driver for a group of friends , said most guests were sitting in the lounge when police entered , and were not causing trouble .
" It was like running a gauntlet , " he said .
" [ Police ] were just being totally unreasonable . "
Guest David Linton , 20 , said he had his face stomped on by police .
He said another person was hit in the stomach with a baton as he sat on a couch .
Robert Morrison , 20 , who lives at the flat , said he and a few other people had tried to stop police coming inside by holding the door closed .
That could have frustrated police but they should have taken a more low - key approach , he said .
" They could have at least said , ' Can I come have a look inside ? '
They would have seen there was n't any trouble . "
Wellington police area commander Inspector Peter Cowan said he understood officers had arrived to a confused situation and needed to quickly gain control : " People were fighting on the street , bottles were being thrown .
What needs to happen immediately is firm and assertive action . "
Wellington City Council had been called that evening by neighbours complaining about the noise , he said .
He was aware of the partygoers ' allegations and had encouraged them to make a complaint to the conduct authority .
Mr Cowan said he would not tolerate inappropriate police action , if it was shown that officers had breached the law .
" If people need to be held to account we will hold them to account . "
Eight people arrested in the incident will appear in Wellington District Court on Friday .
Thirty years ago , on July 15 , 1979 , President Jimmy Carter went on national television to give a jolting speech .
Billed as an address about the “ energy crisis ” — the recent cutoff of Iranian fuel that generated long and angry gas lines at home — it wound up lashing out at the American way of life .
Carter decried Americans ’ “ self - indulgence and consumption ” as well as their “ fragmentation and self - interest . ”
This was a “ crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will , ” he asserted .
Today , we should listen to his words again , especially as debates about climate change legislation turn tough and confrontational in the Senate .
Carter believed Americans could n’t solve the energy crisis if they did n’t move beyond their own self interest and embrace a common good .
He called on Americans to unify themselves around a sense of shared purpose , as they did during a war .
“ Every act of energy conservation is more than just common sense — I tell you it is an act of patriotism . ”
Since then , Carter ’s speech has been widely condemned for laying the blame for his own failures on the backs of ordinary citizens .
Far from it .
The speech won Carter huge amounts of support .
Immediately afterward , Carter ’s poll numbers shot up , something that rarely happened during his presidency .
He got more letters than he ever had before , almost all of them positive .
Citizens pledged they would ride a bike to work or cut down on unnecessary trips .
The counterintuitive happened :
The president criticized his fellow citizens but gained their support .
What better time than now to revisit Carter ’s speech ?
The Senate is just about to debate a climate change bill that barely squeaked through the House in late June .
Many conservative politicians have complained the bill would wind up taxing citizens for the sake of decreasing our reliance on fossil fuels .
Obama ’s retort has been that the bill would cost less than a postage stamp a day for the average American .
Now ’s the time for political leaders who support climate change legislation to return to the language Jimmy Carter used and that Obama himself used during his inaugural address .
There , Obama warned about economic and environmental crises and then diagnosed “ a sapping of confidence across our land . ”
He went on to say : “ The challenges we face are real , they are serious and they are many .
They will not be met easily or in a short span of time . ”
The language here rang with a challenge and with realism and toughness .
Obama sounded like he expected more from the American people than the cost of a postage stamp .
Unfortunately for us today , we understand Jimmy Carter ’s speech as one about “ malaise , ” a word that does n’t appear in the speech .
Many historians argue that the president was looking for a way to blame citizens for his own problems .
But Carter shared the blame in the speech , admitting to his own faults .
“ I realize that more than ever as president I need your help , ” he explained , with a sense of humility .
Remembering Jimmy Carter ’s “ Crisis of Confidence ” speech ( its actual title ) today reminds us of important lessons :
Tough rhetoric can actually mobilize citizens to action , and leaders can demand and expect sacrifice from citizens .
Most important of all , though , it reminds us that to solve our energy crisis , we need to examine our way of life and confront a culture of consumerism and self - interest .
That Carter spoke honestly and found praise for doing so should give Obama grounds for taking Americans into his confidence and arousing them to follow him on moral grounds .
Jimmy Carter tried that .
His successors can do so too .
( Corrects second last paragraph to reflect that Garrido , not Dugard , was arrested )
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Authorities investigating a man accused of kidnapping an 11 - year - old girl and keeping her in his backyard for 18 years searched his California home on Friday for evidence in the 1990s murders of prostitutes .
Police apologized for failing to follow up an anonymous tip in 2006 that could have led them to Jaycee Dugard , who was snatched from a bus stop near her South Lake Tahoe home in 1991 .
Authorities believe that the now 29 - year - old Dugard spent most of the past two decades living in squalid tents and sheds in the backyard of convicted rapist Phillip Garrido , who is accused of fathering two children with her .
Police searched Garrido ’s home on Friday for evidence that might also connect him to killings of prostitutes in the 1990s the area around his home near the Bay Area suburb of Antioch .
“ They ’re out there right now .
They ’re searching the house again , ” said Jimmy Lee , spokesman for the Contra Costa Sheriff ’s Department .
Contra Costa Sheriff Warren Rupf acknowledged that a neighbor of Garrido called police in 2006 and said he was a “ psychotic ” with sexual addictions and had children living in tents in his backyard .
When an officer went to the home to follow up , he spoke with Garrido in the front yard , warning him there were restrictions against living outside in a residential neighborhood , Rupf said .
“ He did not enter , nor request to enter the backyard , ” Rupf told reporters , adding that the officer did not know that Garrido was a registered sex offender , even though he is listed as such on a public database .
“ This is not an acceptable outcome , ” Rupf added .
“ Organizationally we should have been more inquisitive or curious and turned over a rock or two . ”
Garrido , who served time in prison for rape and kidnapping in the early 1970s , made his first appearance in court on Friday .
He wore an orange jumpsuit and sat next to a female attorney .
His wife , 54 - year - old Nancy Garrido , is also in custody .
Police have said that she matches the description of a woman riding in the car into which Dugard was pulled when she was abducted .
Authorities say Garrido kept Dugard and the two daughters he fathered with her in the backyard of the home he shared with his wife .
The yard was surrounded by tarps and tall trees , making it difficult for outsiders to see inside , they say .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
Dugard was found this week after she showed up with Garrido for a meeting with his parole officer .
The appearance of Dugard and her 11 - and 15 - year - old daughters , all of whom the parole officer had never before met , caused suspicion and Garrido was arrested soon thereafter .
Suspicions first arose the day before , when Garrido was seen on the campus of University of California at Berkeley passing out leaflets with the two children .
