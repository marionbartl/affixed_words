GOP CONGRESSMEN : NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE EXCEPT US The new ' Harry and Louise ' ad that is set to air Monday features Harry killing Louise because under Obama 's socialized medicine plan , doctors are forced to tell Louise how to commit suicide .
Satire by R J Shulman
WASHINGTON - ( PTSD News ) -
Saying that they will fight to the death to stop any reform of America 's health care system , Republican senators and representatives have stepped up their attacks on every health - care reform bill .
" There is nothing in the Bill of Rights that says a citizen has a right to be alive , let alone be healthy , " said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Kentucky .
" And since the first ten amendments to the Constitution were written by God , anyone who wants to propose a bill that changes any rights hates Jesus . "
Now that the vote on health care has been delayed until after Congress takes its long summer recess , Republicans have vowed to flood the airwaves with anti-health care messages .
The new ' Harry and Louise ' ad that is set to start Monday features Harry killing Louise because under Obama 's socialized medicine plan , doctors are forced to tell Louise how to commit suicide .
" I had to stop her for committing the mortal sin of killing herself and used my Second Amendment right to shoot her through the head , " Harry says .
" I know Jesus will forgive me so I will meet up with my beloved wife in heaven , a place that is not run by government programs . "
In addition , Republicans will tell Americans that Obama 's heath care plan will take away their guns , Bibles , beer , pickup trucks , will ban NASCAR and change all country music stations to ones playing nothing but Russian operas in order to grant free health care for illegal aliens , welfare mothers , and Muslim terrorists .
Another ad , featuring Senator Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) , asserts that a public option will destroy the profits of the insurance companies who will not only be unable to pay their CEO bonuses but will be forced to curtail campaign contributions to members of congress .
In the ad , Hatch rummages through a dumpster behind a fast food restaurant .
He tells the audience , " since Obama 's public option has ended congressional payments from big insurance and big pharma , I am now forced to do dive into this trash to feed my family .
Did you know my granddaughter 's first word was ' dumpster ? ' "
When accused of using scare tactics and of flat out lying about health care reform , Senate Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) said , " you would lie to save your baby from a mad killer , or your friends from a terrorist -- so you would certainly lie so save America from a Communist take over . "
President Barack Obama was unavailable for comment because he was having a beer with some police officers and citizens who had previously been yelling at each other .

Ailing cage fighter Brock Lesnar has developed a serious intestinal disorder that requires surgery , Ultimate Fighting Championship boss Dana White told TMZ.com Monday .
Lesnar , a 265 lb. former wrestler and football player , collapsed and was reportedly hospitalized last week during a vacation in Canada .
On Saturday , White told various sources that Lesnar was in dire condition .
" He 's not well .
He 's not going to be getting well anytime soon , " White told reporters after a UFC event in England .
" He does n't have cancer or AIDS or anything like this , ( but ) he 's got some problems . "
On Monday , White clarified his diagnosis somewhat .
He also said that Lesnar is back in the U.S. and that he might be admitted to the Mayo Clinic for surgery .
According to White , Lesnar , 32 , might never fight again
Lesnar himself has not been heard from since cancelling a scheduled bout three weeks ago .
Shortly thereafter , UFC announced that Lesnar had contracted mononucleosis .
Rumours swirled that he had swine flu .
Things appear to be going from bad to worse for the superstar mixed - martial artist .
In college , Lesnar was a dominating wrestler .
After school , he used his impressive bulk and outsized personality to switch over to the theatrics of professional wrestling .
He was a huge draw for World Wrestling Entertainment .
In 2004 , he decided on a mid-career switch to professional football .
Despite no high - level experience in the game , he was given a shot by the NFL's Minnesota Vikings .
He only played pre-season before being cut .
At age 30 , he decided to switch professions again .
He soon signed on to fight for UFC .
In July , he won a championship belt .
UFC has had no trouble drawing huge crowds and lots of pay - per - view customers .
Credibility , though , continues to be harder to come by .
News of Lesnar 's mystery illness has been greeted by skepticism by some blogs outside the mixed - martial arts universe .
PETA Ad Banned Over Swine Flu Fears , " Ambiguous " Message

The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
A new ad from PETA UK highlighting the role that livestock production plays in the incubation , development and spread of fatal infectious diseases has been pulled by the Advertising Standards Authority .
According to the watchdog group , complaints were received that the ad might be misinterpreted to mean that eating meat will cause people to receive the H1N1 virus .
PETA ’s highlighting of the word “ Swine Flu ” repeatedly also apparently did them no favors .
The ASA added that the poster referred to a number of diseases , two of which are known to have originated from eating meat and two that did not .
“ Although we understood the intention was to refer to livestock and meat production rather than just eating meat , we considered that the message was , at best , ambiguous , ” said the ASA .
“ PETA is sending a clear message that meat - eating fuels the demand for filthy factory farms , which , in turn , enable pathogens such as the swine flu virus to multiply , spread and cause infection ” , says PETA ’s Poorva Joshipura .
“ The easiest way for consumers to help prevent the development of animalborne disease epidemics and infectious illnesses is to go vegan . ”
RETRACTED : Inside This Morning ’s White House Afghanistan Meeting : Anger With Eikenberry , ‘ Beef ’ With McChrystal
Created : November 12 , 2009 10:06 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Update , 8:50 a.m. : I am retracting this post , published yesterday , titled “ Inside This Morning ’s White House Afghanistan Meeting : Anger With Eikenberry , ‘ Beef ’ With McChrystal . ”
My original source for the post stands by the account provided .
The individual , a National Security Council staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity , has provided truthful and verified information on past stories , and so I trusted the source for this one .
Elements of the account have been subsequently borne out : yesterday afternoon , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that President Obama will ask his Afghanistan - Pakistan advisers to provide him with an exit strategy for the eight - year war , which is congruent with but not identical to my source ’s information that Obama has asked the team to derive timetables for troop withdrawal .
But there are greater problems with the post .
For one , the source was not actually present for the video teleconference that is the post ’s central scene , and passed information to me second - hand .
Furthermore , not only has the White House ’s Tommy Vietor denied , on the record , that Ambassador Karl Eikenberry participated in a video teleconference yesterday morning , but the other two individuals I named as being present for the meeting — the inspector generals for Iraq and Afghanistan — have , through representatives , denied being present .
I cannot subsequently stand by this account .
From the start , the post should have a ) more clearly indicated that my source was n’t present at the meeting ; b ) more clearly indicated that the account provided was single - sourced ; and c ) verified the information provided before publication .
My enthusiasm for a hot story outpaced my professional judgment .
For that I take full responsibility , retract the story and issue a full apology for its publication .
Update , 10:57 p.m. : White House spokesman Tommy Vietor says he checked with Amb.
Eikenberry ’s office and the teleconference call reported in this post did not occur .
I am continuing to re-report this story and will update as soon as I have additional information .
Update :
This post has been edited for clarity .
Update 2 : My apologies .
I am told by Fields ’ spokeswoman that the Afghanistan inspector - general did not in fact feature in the meeting and is in fact in his Virginia office , not Kabul .
A Buddhist sect led by a world - renowned Vietnamese monk has been driven out of a monastery in Vietnam 's southern highlands in what sect members say is an official crackdown .
Supporters say around 100 police and plainclothes thugs evicted more than 350 Buddhist monks and nuns by force last Sunday from the hillside monastery in the town of Bat Nha .
The followers , many of them in their twenties , then found refuge in another , smaller temple in nearby Bao Loc but say they are now being pressured again to leave by local authorities .
In recent years , communist - ruled Vietnam has begun to loosen its grip on sanctioned faith groups , while keeping a close watch on dissidents .
In 2006 , the US State Department took Vietnam off a blacklist of countries that severely limit religious freedom , a move that human rights groups called premature .
Now , followers of the popular sect are asking for the US and other governments to intervene , arguing that Vietnam is persecuting them .
" We see clearly that they do n't want our young nuns and monks to stay together and practice as a community , " says Trung Hai , a monk in France who is in contact with the 354 followers holed up in the temple near Bao Loc .
He says they are fearing for their safety .
Recent crackdown on sensitive subjects
The recent religious tensions follow the detention of several Vietnamese bloggers critical of relations with China and other politically sensitive issues .
An independent public - policy research center also closed down .
Some analysts have linked the crackdown to intraparty jostling ahead of a 2011 party congress .
It 's unclear if the attacks on the Buddhist sect fit this pattern .
Followers say tensions have been rising for months after the monastery 's abbot , who initially welcomed the sect , turned against them , allegedly at the behest of Vietnamese authorities suspicious of its teachings and their popularity .
Sect founder : exiled best - selling author
The sect was founded by Thich Nhat Hanh , a best - selling author who lives in exile in France and helped popularize Buddhism in the West .
In 2005 , he was allowed to return to Vietnam after more than three decades in exile , including stays in the US where he joined protests against the Vietnam War .
( Read more about Nhat Hanh here . )
During a second visit in 2007 he established a permanent teaching center in the town of Bat Nha , around 87 miles from Ho Chi Minh City .
The sect began to expand , attracting young educated Vietnamese drawn to its emphasis on simplicity and social engagement .
Most of the monks and nuns driven from the monastery are in their twenties or younger .
Two older monks have been detained by police , according to the sect .
Nhat Hanh has criticized Vietnam 's curbs on religious freedom , making him a potential target for communist hard - liners fearful of the power of faith - based groups .
Another possible reason , says Trung , is his public support last year for Tibetan Buddhists in China , a stance that may irk pro-China leaders .
Internal dispute between Buddhist sects ?
Authorities have not commented on the latest twist in the dispute , but have said previously that it was an internal matter between two Buddhist sects .
After the communist victory in 1975 , all Buddhists in Vietnam were ordered to join the Buddhist Church of Vietnam ( BCV ) or face persecution .
Similar rules applied to other sanctioned religions .
Both the Bat Nha monastery and the temple are under the BCV , and Nhat Hanh has distanced himself from a banned Buddhist group whose members have repeatedly been detained by authorities .
THUWAL , Saudi Arabia ( Reuters ) - Saudi Arabia opened its first co-educational university on Wednesday , a high - tech campus with massive funds which reformers hope will spearhead change in the Islamic state .
Western diplomats hope the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology ( KAUST ) , which has attracted more than 70 professors and 800 students from abroad , will stimulate reform after recent setbacks such as shelving municipal elections and cancelling cultural events opposed by clerics .
King Abdullah has promoted reforms since taking office in 2005 to create a modern state , stave off Western criticisms and lower dependence on oil .
But he faces resistance from conservative clerics and princes in Saudi Arabia , one of the world ’s top oil exporters .
Al Qaeda militants launched a campaign against the state in 2003 , blaming the royal family for corruption and opposing its alliance with the United States .
It was mainly Saudis who carried out the September 11 , 2001 attacks on U.S. targets .
Officials who back Abdullah fear that without reforms young people will be drawn to militancy in the future .
“ Undoubtedly , scientific centres that embrace all peoples are the first line of defense against extremists , ” Abdullah told regional leaders such as Presidents Bashar al - Assad of Syria and Abdullah Gul of Turkey , Western officials and Nobel laureates during the inauguration .
Supporters are presenting KAUST as a tangible gain for the king ’s plans , which have included more long - term projects such as an overhaul of courts , the education system , and building “ economic cities ” to create jobs for the young population .
“ KAUST is eventually some tangible result after so much was planned and so little done , ” said a Western diplomat in Riyadh .
Former U.S. diplomat John Burgess wrote in his Saudi blog “ Crossroads Arabia ” : “ There is truly no other university in the world so well - equipped .
Anywhere .
The issue is , of course , what is to be done with the equipment and that remains to be seen . ”
One of the main goals is to produce Saudi scientists but so far locals , who had to compete in a tough admission process , make up only 15 percent of students coming from 61 countries , said KAUST President Choon Fong Shih of Singapore .
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
Located next to the Red Sea village of Thuwal north of Jeddah , the 36 - square - mile campus has lured scientists from abroad with luxury packages and a life far from the reality of the Islamic state , where clerics have wide powers over society in an alliance with the Saudi ruling family .
“ The community ’s design facilitates access to the Red Sea and encourages active , healthy living and group interaction , ” says the KAUST website .
Unlike in Saudi universities , male and female students can attend classes together and mix in cafes .
With more than 70 green spaces , gyms , clinics , spacious residential districts and staff driving around in electric cars there is no reason to leave the campus , which is far from the prying eyes of the religious police .
Staff were full of praise for the university .
“ One of the motivations ( to come here ) was that ... anything that I would dream of is here , ” said India ’s Kultaransingh Hooghan , a computer researcher who just relocated to Thuwal .
“ There is no barrier in science , ” said Canada ’s Jasmeen Merzaban , an assistant professor of biochemistry .
“ Whether you are a woman or a man , working side by side you do n’t look at the gender at all .
It ’s all based on science . ”
KAUST is run by the state oil company Aramco , which has a similar liberal enclave at its headquarters in Dhahran on the Gulf coast .
It is outside the control of the education ministry .
Columnist Abdullah al - Alami , who worked at Aramco , said more Saudis must enrol to make KAUST a success .
“ Fifteen percent is a small start , but remember that when Aramco was established the percentage of Saudis was less than 5 percent .
Today , Saudi employees make up more than 90 percent of the Aramco population , ” he said .
Analysts and diplomats say it is the state education system that Saudi Arabia needs to reform .
“ KAUST is impressive but starts at the wrong end .
Instead of pumping billions into universities you need to reform primary schools focusing on religion , ” said another Western diplomat .
It probably is best not to fiddle with switches or controls when riding in the back seat of an air force plane .
A man who failed to obey that principle found himself hurtling out of the cockpit , smashing through the Perspex canopy and into space after grabbing the black - and yellow - striped handle between his legs .
He had inadvertently pulled the eject lever and found himself blasted 100 metres into the sky on his rocket - powered seat .
The South African air force has confirmed the incident that took place last Wednesday , when the passenger took off for a flight with an experienced pilot from South Africa 's Silver Falcons air display team .
Investigators are assuming that the passenger tried to steady himself while the pilot was putting the Pilatus PC - 7 Mk II through its paces by grabbing the eject lever .
" Much of the information has yet to be tested , but it is confirmed that a civilian passenger unintentionally ejected from a Silver Falcons Pilatus PC - 7
Mk II Astra during a general flying sortie out of Langebaanweg air force base this week , " a South African air force spokesman said .
" The passenger was recovered [ by helicopter ] unharmed , and returned to Langebaanweg .
The aircraft landed safely . "
The spokesman said the flight had been cleared and all procedures adhered to " prior to the passenger boarding the aircraft " , making it unlikely charges would follow .
A retired SAAF instructor pilot said the passenger was extremely lucky to have survived the ejection with barely a scratch .
" We train for this and if you do n't get it right , and are not in the correct ejection posture , you can sustain severe spinal cord injuries or even worse , " he told South Africa 's Sunday Times .
He discounted the possibility that the seat fired of its own accord , as too many safety features were built into the system .
" All it takes is for the firing handle [ the rubbery black - and yellow - striped loop ] to be pulled up about 2.5 cm and you 're on your way out . "
He said the ejection would have been dramatic .
" You get one almighty kick under the backside and then you 're gone .
The seat separates from the pilot automatically and the chute opens , " he said .
" This is in case the pilot is incapacitated during the ejection . "
Passengers would have been briefed on the ejection sequence and warned that the " loop " between his legs was not to be touched unless the pilot called " Eject , eject , eject " during the flight .
Such a briefing is done routinely , even when two qualified pilots are involved in the flight .
It is likely the rear cockpit was extensively damaged by the firing of the cartridges and rockets during the ejection .
The Silver Falcons are the SAAF 's aerobatic team that perform precision formation and aerobatics displays at airshows around the country .
The five pilots are all serving instructors at Central Flying School , Langebaanweg .
As one observer said : " What a trip .
That guy took off in an Astra , came down in a parachute , and landed back at base in a helicopter .
Not bad for a for a single flip . "
A lesser - known consequence of having a lot of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) in the air is the acidification of water .
Oceans naturally absorb the greenhouse gas ; in fact , they take in roughly one third of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by human activities .
When CO 2 dissolves in water , it forms carbonic acid , the same substance found in carbonated beverages .
New research now suggests that seawater might be growing acidic more quickly than climate change models have predicted .
Marine ecologist J. Timothy Wootton of the University of Chicago and his colleagues spent eight years compiling measurements of acidity , salinity , temperature and other data from Tatoosh Island off the northwestern tip of Washington State .
They found that the average acidity rose more than 10 times faster than predicted by climate simulations .
Highly acidic water can wreak havoc on marine life .
For instance , it can dissolve the calcium carbonate in seashells and coral reefs [ see “ The Dangers of Ocean Acidification , ” by Scott C. Doney ; Scientific American , March 2006 ] .
In their study , published in the December 2 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA , Wootton and his team discovered that the balance of ecosystems shifted : populations of large - shelled animals such as mussels and stalked barnacles dropped , whereas smaller - shelled species and noncalcareous algae ( species that lack calcium - based skeletons ) became more abundant .
“ I see it as a harbinger of the trends we might expect to occur in the future , ” says oceanographer Scott C. Doney of the Woods Hole Ocean­ographic Institution , who did not participate in this study .
Wootton notes that the changes his team saw were linked with growing levels of atmospheric CO 2 , but he readily acknowledges that the global - warming gas might not be the main culprit in this surge in acidity .
Instead the acidification the researchers observed could have resulted from a nearby upwelling of deep ocean water loaded with carbon , so the results might not apply to the oceans as a whole .
Still , the acidity readings along the Pacific coast of the U.S. and in the Netherlands do seem to be rising , Wootton says , “ and that seems consistent with our pattern . ”
Marine life , it seems , may not have the luxury of time to act as a buffer against the changing waters .

A mother macaque demonstrating maternal behavior .
At top , she pulls the infant 's head in to gaze at him .
In the middle , she smacks her lips at him .
At the bottom , she licks her infant 's face .
The intense , special exchanges that human mothers share with their newborn infants might have deep roots all the way back in monkeys .
Rhesus macaques and their offspring interact in the first month of life in ways much like what humans often do , scientists now suggest .
" What does a mother or father do when looking at their own baby ? " asked researcher Pier Francesco Ferrari , a behavioral biologist and neuroscientist at the University of Parma in Italy .
" They smile at them and exaggerate their gestures , modify their voice pitch — so - called ' motherese ' — and kiss them .
What we found in mother macaques is very similar — they exaggerate their gestures , ' kiss ' their baby , and have sustained mutual gaze . "
Past research has shown these emotional interactions go both ways in humans — newborns are sensitive to their mother 's expressions , movements , and voice , and engage their parents in much the same way .
For years , these capacities were basically considered unique to humans , although perhaps shared to some extent with chimpanzees .
Now Ferrari and his colleagues extend these skills to macaques , " suggesting the origins of these behaviors actually goes way back , " he told LiveScience .
( Rhesus monkey ancestors diverged from those of humans roughly 25 million years ago , while chimpanzees diverged from our lineage 6 million years ago . )
The scientists closely observed 14 mother - infant pairs for the first two months of the babies ' lives .
Mother macaques and their infants spent more time gazing at each other than at other monkeys .
The researches also found that mothers more often smacked their lips at their infants , a gesture that the infants often imitated back to their mothers , suggesting that infant monkeys may have a rich internal world that we are only now beginning to see .
Moreover , Ferrari and his colleagues saw mothers actively searching for the infant 's gaze , sometimes holding the infant 's head and gently pulling it towards her face .
In other instances , when the babies were physically separated from their mothers , the parent moved her face very close to that of the offspring , sometimes lowering her head and bouncing it in front of the youngster .
Intriguingly , these exchanges virtually disappeared when infants turned about one month old .
" It 's quite puzzling , " Ferrari said , " but we should consider that macaque development is much faster that of humans .
Motor competences of a two - week - old macaque could be compared to an eight - to twelve - month - old human infant .
Thus , independence from the mother occurs very early .
What happens next in the first and second month of life is that infants become more interested in interacting with their same - age peers . "
This discovery suggests that by studying monkeys , scientists might get insights into the evolution of parental care and infant development in humans .
" These types of interactions are the way we learn to be sensitive to others ' needs , " Ferrari said .
The scientists detailed their findings online October 8 in the journal Current Biology .
Is it time for Ohio State to bench Terrelle Pryor ?
When he arrived at Ohio State as the biggest recruiting prize in the country , Buckeye fans were hopeful that Terrelle Pryor would be the second coming of Vince Young .
Instead , Pryor looks more like the next Juice Williams .
Terrelle Pryor ’s performance in yesterday ’s loss to Purdue was a disaster .
It was n’t simply a bad game from a young quarterback .
Pryor has been getting progressively worse throughout the season .
Rather , it was a performance that raised the question of whether Terrelle Pryor can ever be a good college quarterback , let alone the NFL quarterback he dreams of becoming .
Pryor had two fumbles and two interceptions .
But his stats do n’t tell the story here .
When you watch Pryor play , you wonder why anyone ever thought this kid could be a good college quarterback .
Pryor looked like a track star thrown into the game who had never played the position before .
He lacks practically all the tools one would need to play quarterback , apart from his size and speed .
* Arm strength – Pryor can throw the ball , but he hardly has a gun .
Most of his long throws look like heaves rather than smooth throws .
* Accuracy – Pryor rarely makes accurate throws .
Even short throws seem to be a challenge .
* Mechanics – Pryor ’s footwork and throwing mechanics are a mess .
He ’s not a natural at all with the ball in his hands .
Sure , coaching can help , but the coaches are n’t developing a natural passing talent .
* Pocket presence – The Buckeyes have a weak offensive line this season , so that makes it more difficult to develop a young quarterback .
But Pryor consistently panics in the pocket .
He does n’t seem to have any sense of how much time he really has to make a throw .
Not surprisingly , he often relies in his incredible athleticism to buy some time for a possible pass or run , but he often seems to make the wrong choice .
* Decision - making – He rarely seems to do the right thing .
How many times have we seen him run out of bounds under pressure and take a loss of five or more yards when he easily could have just tossed the ball out of bounds ?
He seems to throw when he should run , and run when he has an open receiver .
On blitzes , he rarely gets the ball to the hot receiver .
* Leadership and temperament – Pryor often acts like an immature kid who ca n’t control his emotions .
He ’s only nineteen years old , so we need to cut him some slack here , but compare him to freshmen like Tate Forcier at Michigan and the surfer dude playing quarterback at USC .
They seem to thrive under pressure , while Pryor seems to come unglued under pressure .
Jim Tressel made a good point early in the season when some were questioning Pryor ’s play – Vince Young did n’t become Vince Young until his senior season .
The message was clear – young players need to develop , and it ’s unrealistic to expect them to come in a perform consistently this early in a college career .
Tressel prides himself on his ability to develop young players and young men .
He knows players and teams will face adversity , and he wants to help them face it and overcome it .
For this reason , we should n’t be surprised that Tressel did n’t pull Pryor against Purdue .
He should have been pulled , but Tressel does n’t have a great option sitting on the bench , and he probably wanted to see how Pryor would react in that situation .
As an Ohio State fan , it ’s hard to imagine watching Pryor play quarterback for two more seasons .
The Buckeyes are loaded on defense , and they have a solid offense as well , even with a mediocre offensive line .
All they need right now to compete is a quarterback who can hit open receivers and avoid turnovers .
They do n’t need a Vince Young or even a Troy Smith .
Put Craig Krenzel on this team and the Buckeyes are competing for a national championship .
Instead , we have the Terrelle Pryor train wreck , and an excellent defense is being wasted .
Pryor chose Ohio State because he wanted a program that could help him develop as a future NFL quarterback .
That seems like a pipe dream now .
The kid needs to focus on just being a competent college quarterback .
What should Tressel do ?
Would sitting Pryor help ?
Tressel needs to consider this if Pryor continues to turn over the football .
He owes it to the other players on the team .
In the meantime , short of benching Pryor , Tressel needs to rethink what he ’s trying to do on offense ( the issue of Tressel calling the plays will be addressed another time ) .
We can see he ’s already tried to incorporate the option more into the offense , but we ’re seeing that Pryor ’s instincts are n’t much better there .
Perhaps with practice he ’ll get better , as the option at least plays to his running ability .
Tressel should toss aside a good chunk of the playbook and go to a much simpler offense .
Focus on running the football , the option , and other Wildcat - type plays , and have Pryor make much simpler throws that play off the running game .
Dig up old tape from Oklahoma and Nebraska from the 1970 ’s , or even most of the Woody Hayes years .
Keep it simple until the kid shows he can handle more .
Buckeye fans often get frustrated with Tressel ’s conservative play - calling , but opening up the offense is not the solution here .
He has to pull things back and start over .
And , if Pryor ca n’t cut it in a simpler offense , then Tressel will have to make a change .
A national ambassador for prostate cancer says rural men have higher mortality rates from the disease , so they need to be vigilant and have regular medical checks .
The Flying Doctor is holding a series of field days in Queensland 's central - west this week and prostate cancer will be discussed .
Ambassador Rob Stirling says the Prostrate Foundation is especially eager to raise awareness of the disease in rural and remote areas .
" It 's the number one cancer in men excluding non-melanoma skin cancer , " he said .
" The mortality rate is 10 per cent higher in regional Australia than it is in the capital cities - if you put that another way , from prostate cancer 110 men will die in regional and rural Australia and that is a terrible figure . "
Michael Moore had a few things to say about the Dow rallying past 10,000 today on the set of Morning Joe .
First on how well the markets are doing .
Moore : Oh !
It ’s so incredible .
Yes .
Fifteen million people out of work .
Scarborough : Is n’t this a perfect example for you ?
Is n’t this a great example of what you ’re trying to say ?
How there ’s a disconnect between what ’s going on on Wall Street , 10,000 , and Main Street , 10 % unemployment ?
Moore :
Oh , it ’s not a disconnect .
It ’s connected very well .
It ’s connected just the way our economic system is set up .
It ’s set up so that the pyramid scheme that we call capitalism — it ’s become a pyramid scheme now — the very few at the top get away like bandits making billions and billions of dollars .
And everybody else in the lower parts of the pyramid are told to work really hard and maybe some day they can come up and be on top of the pyramid too .
Well guess what ?
There ’s only a few people that can sit on top of the pyramid and it ’s just so revolting and so immoral when we live in a country — the wealthiest country on earth — fifteen million people unemployed .
One in every eight homes right now is in foreclosure or delinquency .
And they ’re celebrating on Wall Street ?
And they ’re paying each other bonuses ?
Surprisingly Moore gets some agreement from Joe and Mike on the disparity of wealth in the United States .
Maria Bartiromo however disagrees with Moore ’s view of the news on Wall Street .
Shocker right ?
The Wall Street flack tries to come to their defense .
Bartiromo : A couple of things I have to insert here .
On the one hand I am a big fan of Michaels but I have to disagree that capitalism is a pyramid scheme .
I think that , I actually think that ’s absurd but on the bonuses obviously compensation did get way out of hand on Wall Street and for some individuals at the top .
I agree with that .
But let ’s not forget the millions and millions and millions of people who have benefited , who have pensions , who have mutual funds who are invested in this market and may not even know it who have made a lot of money over the years .
So it ’s not necessarily just the people at the top making money when the market goes higher .
That is also absurd .
( crosstalk ) Moore :
No , I ’m sorry .
I understand what you just said .
That was the old days when Leave it to Beaver and Andy of Mayberry , that is the way it used to work .
Here ’s how it is now .
Bartiromo : Okay .
Moore :
The wealthiest — let me finish — the wealthiest one percent right now in this country have more financial worth than the ninety five percent under them combined .
One percent more than ninety five percent combined — that ’s capitalism now .
It ’s a system of legalized greed .
It ’s way out of control and when you talk about people and their pension funds — people watching us right now — nobody even knows if they ’re going to have a pension or what ’s going to happen to it .
Everybody is full of anxiety .
People do n’t know if they ’re going to have a job next year .
That ’s just not how you run a country .
This is n’t how you create the next great thing and put people to work when you ’ve got everybody going around so full of fear and just not knowing what ’s going to happen and not knowing if they can pay the mortgage next month .
There ’s a foreclosure filing once every seven and a half seconds right now .
( crosstalk ) Bartiromo : I mean there was a structure in place and there has been a structure in place in terms of regulating the banks — in terms of overseeing the risks that they take on .
Moore :
There ’s no structure !
Bartiromo :
So you ca n’t just say that you know , oh these guys were just given the go ahead to do whatever they wanted …
Moore :
There ’s no structure !
Bartiromo :
Who was watching the store in terms of the regulatory environment overseeing the services companies ?
Scarborough : Is n’t that the problem though ?
Scarborough goes on to cite how lack of regulation of Wall Street has led to this mess and Moore agrees with him and reminds everyone this has been a bipartisan failing going back to the days of Ronald Reagan .
Moore notes that the seven largest banks that took our TARP money have seventy five percent of all the baking assets in the United States and suggests people move their money out of the big banks and into community banks and credit unions .
I think Maria Bartiromo has been spending way too much time snuggling up to those CEO ’s over at CNBC and a little reality check for her by Moore on what life is like for most Americans was a welcome break from the usual hackery on Morning Joe .
As the federal government has become more powerful and more invasive , we have seen an explosion of new laws and regulations .
Interestingly , as the number of laws increase , we have seen a similar decrease in anything that resembles the rule of law .
The successful North Carolina criminal defense attorney Johnny Gaskins has found out the hard way that in the federal system , law has disappeared altogether .
Earlier this month , Gaskins was convicted in a Raleigh federal court for depositing money in a bank and faces prison for the rest of his life as a result .
I am not kidding .
The News & Observer presented a misleading headline about the case : Lawyer ’s Career Ends in Crime .
( Yes , the N&O is the same paper that published the false story which set off the infamous Duke Lacrosse Non-Rape Case almost four years ago . )
True , the lawyer ’s career is over but , no , he did not commit any crimes , despite what the N&O and a federal jury might be saying .
According to the N&O :
Johnny Gaskins was a keeper of the law who built his career defending those who disregarded it .
But a jury decided Oct. 9 that Gaskins had gone from being an officer of the court to being a criminal .
Gaskins , a Raleigh criminal defense lawyer , was convicted of dividing large sums of money into small deposits so that his bank would not fulfill an Internal Revenue Service requirement to report cash transactions of more than $ 10,000 .
The rule is intended to flag large sums of cash that might be tied to illegal activity .
The legal term for this activity is " structuring , " and readers might remember that Elliot Spitzer , a .k.a.
" Client Number 9 , " was caught doing something similar ( except he was making small withdrawals rather than deposits ) .
However , there is a huge difference between the two acts .
Gaskins did not make his deposits in order to cover up any illegal activity , while Spitzer did .
Thus , it seems to be the perfect commentary on federal criminal law that Spitzer never was charged while Gaskins faces more than 30 years in prison .
This is a compelling story , and as one who has seen injustice after injustice in the federal system , this perhaps is the worst injustice I ever have seen .
The N&O continues :
Associates of Gaskins said in interviews that many of his fees were paid in cash , often offered by clients who did n’t trust banks enough to open checking accounts .
Gaskins kept the money in a safe in his home ’s upstairs closet .
By September 2005 , he had amassed more than $ 200,000 in cash .
That month , Gaskins hired a crew to work at his house .
One evening , he noticed a set of muddy footprints on the carpet leading to his safe , even though he had locked his house .
Gaskins was sure he would be robbed .
He began moving that cash , one chunk at a time , to a personal account at RBC bank , careful to not alert any particular teller about his supply of cash .
“ I was concerned about any single bank teller having information that I had so much cash , ” Gaskins testified during his trial .
Each deposit was just below $ 10,000 , the threshold to report to the IRS so that federal authorities can track cash that might be tied to criminal activity .
Purposely structuring cash deposits to cause a bank to evade reporting requirements is against the law .
This law was passed as an " ancillary crime " to give prosecutors leverage in cases where people had amassed huge amounts of cash via drug sales or other illegal activities and were trying to avoid detection as well as avoid paying taxes on their money .
However , that clearly was not the case here , as the N&O continues :
Gaskins filed forms to the IRS accounting for more than $ 450,000 in cash payments , according to evidence at trial .
Prosecutors agreed that he had filed and paid his taxes .
He did n’t dispute that he intentionally divided his money , but he testified that it was for innocent reasons .
His habits , he said , were born of an exposure to a criminal world that most people only see on television dramas .
Prosecutors did not offer evidence of any other motive for Gaskins ’ behavior .
They said at trial that Gaskins should have known better .
“ The point of the law is to make sure we do n’t have people who try to fool the bank , ” federal prosecutor Randall Galyon told jurors last week .
“ The fact that he was trying is against the law . ”
So , we had an attorney who was paid legally in cash , decided he might be robbed , so he deposited the money in a bank .
Furthermore , he already had paid taxes on his cash earnings , so it is clear that he had no criminal motives .
Furthermore , I can guarantee the readers that there was a motive that was not mentioned , but well should be : prosecutors would have tried to frame Gaskins had he deposited all of his money at once .
That kind of a deposit — which prosecutors insist that he had to make in order to be legal — would have sent alerts to the police and prosecutors , who would have tried to make a drug case against him , claiming he actually had received that money illegally .
The question is this :
Why were prosecutors hell - bent on going after him ?
The answer lies in the success that Gaskins had in his career :
He had received death threats and had been harassed for more than a decade after he persuaded a jury to spare the life of a client convicted of killing a popular Raleigh police detective .
Some of Gaskins ’ clients were robbed and tortured , targeted because they carried large amounts of cash , court filings show .
The N&O continues :
Gaskins was a former agent with the State Bureau of Investigation who built a legal career on a reputation for asking the right questions and paying attention to detail .
He won his first jury trial as a third - year law student while attending Campbell University Law School .
Over the years , Gaskins would represent more than 20 clients facing the death penalty , nearly all too poor to afford their own lawyers .
In recent years , though , Gaskins carved a niche representing clients in massive federal drug conspiracy cases .
His clients stretched across this state and into others .
This was payback , pure and simple .
Gaskins had success representing people accused of crimes , and the police and prosecutors paid him back with what only can be a trumped - up charge .
Remember , Gaskins was convicted of depositing money in a bank .
He did not evade taxes , he did not gain his cash through illegal means , he just put the money in the bank .
This is the first time I have seen someone convicted in federal court of only an ancillary crime with no underlying accusation to buttress it .
Spitzer withdrew small amounts of money in order to evade his lawbreaking .
( Even if one believes prostitution should be legal , we should not forget that Spitzer would not have hesitated to charge someone else with the same crime if he had the chance . )
Lest anyone think that the " system works fairly , " think again .
The federal criminal system works , but it only works for the prosecutors and no one else .
While I am lambasting the prosecution , one also should save at least some venom for the judge and the jurors .
If the jurors in this case really believe that depositing one ’s money into a bank at less than $ 10 K a pop is a crime , then they need to turn in themselves and plead guilty to the same thing .

A Houston judge this morning said he was concerned about future violence when he raised the bond for a father who allegedly shot and killed his teenage son during an argument over a video game Sunday .
State District Judge Marc Carter doubled the bond to $ 100,000 for Ofelio Antonio Otero , 40 , during an initial appearance today .
“ What I ’m concerned about is the violence , ” Carter said in response to questions from Otero ’s lawyer , Rudy Duarte , about lowering the bond .
Carter also agreed with prosecutor Martina Longoria that Otero should be prohibited from returning to his home or contacting family members who are witnesses if he does make bail .
Police said Otero surrendered Sunday after a brief standoff with SWAT officers at a southwest Houston apartment .
Otero had been drinking heavily when he began arguing with his wife over the whereabouts of a missing video game around 4:15 a.m. at the family ’s home in the 7700 block of Corporate Drive , Houston Police Department spokeswoman Jodi Silva said .
Otero then started fighting with 17 - year - old Ignacio A. Otero about the game .
During the argument , he loaded his gun , authorities said .
“ The son then proceeds to try and knock the gun away and then he runs away , “ Silva said .
As the teen was running , the father allegedly fired one shot , striking his son in the neck .
The boy died at the scene and the father ran away .
Police found Otero at an apartment complex about 2½ miles away in the 9000 block of Town Park .
After a three - hour standoff with the HPD SWAT team , Otero surrendered to police at 11 a.m. , Silva said .
Otero , who is facing a murder charge , has a prior criminal history in Harris County that includes a DWI conviction .

A state blue - ribbon panel unanimously approved landmark fishing restrictions Tuesday for Southern California , creating a patchwork of havens for marine life designed to replenish the seas while leaving some waters open for anglers .
The plan , approved 5 to 0 during a meeting at which emotions boiled over briefly into shouting and shoving , was a compromise intended to sustain the 250 - mile coastline ’s environmental as well as economic health -- forged during a year of contentious negotiations between conservationists and fishing interests .
In recent decades , the catches of many species , including rockfish and cod , have fallen by as much as 95 % .
Populations of lobster , sea urchin , squid , sea bass , yellowtail and swordfish have all been in sharp decline .
Fisheries experts have argued that some of those species could disappear entirely if steps were not taken to create no-fishing zones where breeding stocks could be replenished .
But any move to close waters to fishermen has been strongly resisted by both the fishing industry and recreational boaters .
On Tuesday , representatives of both groups , many of them wearing black T - shirts , turned out at the panel ’s meeting and predicted job losses and business closures .

Environmentalists countered that stiff curbs were necessary to preserve and replenish fading stocks of marine life .
They said that some panel members were allowing economic concerns to outweigh scientific guidelines designed to ensure the long - term health of the ocean .
After hearing from dozens of speakers , the panel members agreed on a plan that would close some areas , including waters off Laguna Beach and Point Dume , while allowing fishing off the Palos Verdes Peninsula and most of Catalina Island .
“ We ’re not going to make everyone happy , but this has to be done , ” panel Chairwoman Catherine Reheis - Boyd said in an interview before the vote .
“ It ’s agony to weigh the environmental goals against people ’s livelihoods , especially here in Southern California , where the urban / ocean interface is greater than anywhere else in the nation . ”
The Fish and Game Commission , which has adopted recommendations by other Marine Life Protection Area panels , is expected to take up the Southern California plan in December .

Elected officials tried to intervene on behalf of their constituents .
On Tuesday , Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa wrote to the panel expressing his “ strong support ” for designated marine life protection areas .
A week ago , the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution in support of protecting kelp and canyon habitats at Point Dume , but leaving the waters off Palos Verdes Peninsula open to fishing .
State Assemblyman Ted Lieu ( D - Torrance ) supported that plan .
George L. Osborn , a lobbyist for the California Fish and Game Wardens Assn. , told the panel late Tuesday afternoon : “ We do not have the resources to enforce regulations currently on the books .
This is a matter that jeopardizes officer safety . ”
A group led by Laguna Beach City Councilwoman Verna Rollinger supported a proposal to ban fishing along six miles of her city ’s coastline .
“ I want fish in the ocean , and on my dinner plate , ” she said .
“ To do that , we have to restore the ocean . ”
Rollinger got what she wanted .
But the plan elsewhere yielded to fishing industry concerns that it could drive people out of work in already difficult economic times .

Commercial trawling for squid and sportfishing for species including yellowtail and swordfish would be allowed on the back side of Santa Catalina Island , but sea urchin and sea cucumber could not be taken there .
The plan would create a no-fishing zone off La Jolla -- a spawning ground for black sea bass and leopard sharks -- and prohibit fishing in the kelp beds and submarine canyons on both sides of Point Dume .
In a major win for fishing interests , the plan would allow continued fishing in the kelp forest and rocky reef habitats off the Palos Verdes Peninsula .
“ We got a good deal there , ” said Bob Bertelli , a commercial fisherman for 25 years .
But overall , fishing enthusiasts were “ upset about this plan , ” said Wendy Tochihara , a fishing advocate and national sales manager for Izorline International , a fishing line manufacturer .
“ We are a dying breed ; the average age of a commercial fisherman is 59 , and it ’s tough work , ” she said .
“ The impacts will not stop at the docks .
They will hit restaurants , markets and the gas stations where we fill up our boat fuel tanks , even the manufacturers of the nuts and bolts on the engines of our vessels . ”

Conservationists dismissed fishing industry predictions of economic catastrophe as overblown .
They pointed out , for example , that a five - year review of marine protection areas established in the Channel Islands in 2003 found no discernible change in commercial landings for some of the region ’s largest fisheries : squid , lobster , urchin and crab .
Tempers flared .
The panel was discussing proposed fishing closures Tuesday morning when kayak fishing enthusiast Charles Volkens , 44 , stood up and angrily shouted at the panelists : “ You have not listened to us throughout this whole process ! ”
When an audience member asked him to quiet down , Volkens screamed , “ Come outside and tell me to shut up ! ”
At that point , the man charged at Volkens and pushed him .
Both men were quickly ushered out of the Los Angeles International Airport - area hotel ballroom by security officers .
Advertisement
Later , Volkens said he was frustrated that the panelists were even considering the idea of banning fishing in a hot spot like Point Dume , which he described as “ the last place left in the area where we can fish for white sea bass . ”
Similarly , Sarah Lester , coastal resources director for the environmental group Heal the Bay , said , “ I ’ve got mixed feelings .
“ Some keys areas like Point Dume were protected , ” she said .
“ But I ’m concerned they overlooked scientific guidelines in places like Palos Verdes Peninsula . ”
The panel ’s effort was conducted under the California Marine Life Protection Act , which was adopted in 1999 to set aside a comprehensive , science - based network of marine parks and wilderness areas .
Advertisement
In an interview after the vote , panelist Meg Caldwell , director of Stanford Law School ’s environmental and natural resources law and policy program , expressed a measure of disappointment in the outcome .
“ There was a lot of give and take , ” she added .
“ But overall , it ’s better than what we have now . ”

They have been trying to ditch their dubious reputation and work - hard play - hard image for decades .
But a dubious new calendar featuring scantily - clad Ryanair girls posing in the skimpiest of bikinis will do nothing to improve public perception of the trolley dolly .

The girls , who look more like page three pinups than cabin crew , pout and pose in various locations around an airport and on - board their planes .
First there 's January pin-up Julia , showing off her ample assets in a barely - there white and black bikini coupled with a black hat .

The images are a long way from Ryanair 's usual uniform , demure buttoned - up blue suits and high neck blouses .
And though the girls are probably guaranteed to get flight - deck temparatures soaring , some might say they are not the best advert for children 's charity Angels Quest , which will receive proceeds from the calendar .

LONDON -- Global economic policy makers are just beginning to grapple with a key issue rising out of last year 's bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings : how to react if -- or when -- the next big global bank spins out of control .
While the furor over bankers ' bonuses has captured most of the headlines , policy makers are in the process of assigning each of the world 's 25 most complex international banks to a multinational crisis - management team to draw up contingency plans if they run into trouble .
But ...
Sen . Joseph Lieberman , speaking in that trademark sonorous baritone , utters a simple statement that translates into real trouble for Democratic leaders : " I 'm going to be stubborn on this . "
Stubborn , he means , in opposing any health - care overhaul that includes a " public option , " or government - run health - insurance plan , as the current bill does .
His opposition is strong enough that Mr. Lieberman says he wo n't vote to let a bill come to a final vote if a public option is included .
Probe for a catch or caveat in that opposition , and none is visible .
Can he support a public option if states could opt out of the plan , as the current bill provides ?
" The answer is no , " he says in an interview from his Senate office .
" I feel very strongly about this . "
How about a trigger , a mechanism for including a public option along with a provision saying it wo n't be used unless private insurance plans are n't spreading coverage far and fast enough ?
No again .
So any version of a public option will compel Mr. Lieberman to vote against bringing a bill to a final vote ?
" Correct , " he says .
This is , of course , more than just one senator objecting to one part of health legislation .
This is the former Democratic vice presidential nominee , now an independent , Joe Lieberman , still counted on to be the 60th vote Democrats will need to force a final vote on health legislation .
In opposing a public option , he is opposing the element some Democratic liberals have come to consider the cornerstone of a health - care bill .

The members of that ultimate federal board will themselves not have examined or seen the patient in question .
For another example of the growing , tumultuous resistance to " Dr. Obama , " particularly among seniors , there is a July 29 Washington Times editorial citing a line from a report written by a key adviser to Obama on cost - efficient health care , prominent bioethicist Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel ( brother of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel ) .
Emanuel writes about rationing health care for older Americans that " allocation ( of medical care ) by age is not invidious discrimination . "
( The Lancet , January 2009 ) He calls this form of rationing  which is fundamental to Obamacare goals  " the complete lives system . "
You see , at 65 or older , you 've had more life years than a 25 - year - old .
As such , the latter can be more deserving of cost - efficient health care than older folks .
No matter what Congress does when it returns from its recess , rationing is a basic part of Obama 's eventual master health care plan .
Here is what Obama said in an April 28 New York Times interview ( quoted in Washington Times July 9 editorial ) in which he describes a government end - of - life services guide for the citizenry as we get to a certain age , or are in a certain grave condition .
Our government will undertake , he says , a " very difficult democratic conversation " about how " the chronically ill and those toward the end of their lives are accounting for potentially 80 percent of the total health care " costs .

This end - of - life consultation has been stripped from the Senate Finance Committee bill because of democracy - in- action town - hall outcries but remains in three House bills .
A specific end - of - life proposal is in draft Section 1233 of H.R. 3200 , a House Democratic health care bill that is echoed in two others that also call for versions of " advance care planning consultation " every five years  or sooner if the patient is diagnosed with a progressive or terminal illness .
As the Washington Post 's Charles Lane penetratingly explains ( Undue influence , " Aug. 8 ) : the government would pay doctors to discuss with Medicare patients explanations of " living wills and durable powers of attorney … and ( provide ) a list of national and state - specific resources to assist consumers and their families " on making advance - care planning ( read end - of - life ) decisions .
Significantly , Lane adds that , " The doctor ' shall ' ( that 's an order ) explain that Medicare pays for hospice care ( hint , hint ) . "
But the Obama administration claims these fateful consultations are " purely voluntary . "
In response , Lane  who learned a lot about reading between the lines while the Washington Post 's Supreme Court reporter  advises us :
" To me , ' purely voluntary ' means ' not unless the patient requests one . ' "
But Obamas ' doctors will initiate these chats .
" Patients , " notes Lane , " may refuse without penalty , but many will bow to white - coated authority . "
And who will these doctors be ?
What criteria will such Obama advisers as Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel set for conductors of end - of - life services ?
I was alerted to Lanes ' crucial cautionary advice  for those of use who may be influenced to attend the Obamacare twilight consultations  by Wesley J. Smith , a continually invaluable reporter and analyst of , as he calls his most recent book , the " Culture of Death : The Assault on Medical Ethics in America " ( Encounter Books ) .
As more Americans became increasingly troubled by this and other fearful elements of Dr. Obama 's cost - efficient health care regimen , Smith adds this vital advice , no matter what legislation Obama finally signs into law :
" Remember that legislation itself is only half the problem with Obamacare .
Whatever bill passes , hundreds of bureaucrats in the federal agencies will have years to promulgate scores of regulations to govern the details of the law .
" This is where the real mischief could be done because most regulatory actions are effectuated beneath the public radar .
It is thus essential , as just one example , that any end - of - life counseling provision in the final bill be specified to be purely voluntary … and that the counseling be required by law to be neutral as to outcome .
Otherwise , even if the legislation does n't push in a specific direction  for instance , THE GOVERNMENT REFUSING TREATMENT  the regulations could . "
( Emphasis added . )
Who 'll let us know what 's really being decided about our lives  and what is set into law ?
To begin with , Charles Lane , Wesley Smith and others whom I 'll cite and add to as this chilling climax of the Obama presidency comes closer .
Condemning the furor at town - hall meetings around the country as " un-American , " Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi are blind to truly participatory democracy  as many individual Americans believe they are fighting , quite literally , for their lives .
I wonder whether Obama would be so willing to promote such health care initiatives if , say , it were 60 years from now , when his children will  as some of the current bills seem to imply  have lived their fill of life years , and the health care resources will then be going to the younger Americans ? <
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker has been arguing for the breakup of the biggest banks to make sure history does n’t repeat .
Current Bank of England Gov. Mervyn
King now is endorsing the same idea .
But the U.S. and British governments both seem unwilling to give up on the megabank concept that marries commercial banking with Wall Street banking .
In a speech in Scotland on Tuesday , King said there were only two ways for banking regulators to approach the mess left by last year ’s financial meltdown :
" One is to accept that some institutions are ' too important to fail ' and try to ensure that the probability of those institutions failing , and hence of the need for taxpayer support , is extremely low .
The other is to find a way that institutions can fail without imposing unacceptable costs on the rest of society . "
The first approach , King said , would entail forcing banks to raise their capital buffers to levels sufficient to protect against failure .
But in reality , he said , it would be " almost impossible to calculate how much contingent capital would be appropriate " for each institution .
The second approach , he said , would amount to rejecting " the idea that some institutions should be allowed to become ‘ too important to fail . ’ " Rather , King said :
" Instead of asking who should perform what regulation , [ the second approach ] asks why we regulate banks .
It draws a clear distinction between different activities that banks undertake .
The banking system provides two crucial services to the rest of the economy : providing companies and households a ready means by which they can make payments for goods and services and intermediating flows of savings to finance investment .
Those are the utility aspects of banking where we all have a common interest in ensuring continuity of service .
And for this reason they are quite different in nature from some of the riskier financial activities that banks undertake , such as proprietary trading .
" In other industries we separate those functions that are utility in nature -- and are regulated -- from those that can safely be left to the discipline of the market .
The second approach adapts those insights to the regulation of banking . "
King referenced Volcker ’s idea to reimpose some version of the Glass - Steagall Act , restricting banks to traditional commercial banking and forbidding them from engaging in higher - risk Wall Street - related businesses .
But as the New York Times noted in a story Tuesday , the Obama administration so far is siding with the banking titans , which naturally want to keep their empires intact .
" People say I ’m old - fashioned and banks can no longer be separated from nonbank activity , " Volcker told the Times .
" That argument brought us to where we are today . "
The British government also wants to keep the megabanks intact , despite King ’s view that the government bailouts that have propped up the institutions have created " possibly the biggest moral hazard in history . "
From Bloomberg News :
U.K. Finance Minister Alistair Darling said yesterday focusing on capital rules may be enough to ward off future crises and is unswayed by arguments that banks should be broken up .
" You regulate according to risk , " Darling said before King ’s speech .
" The greater the risk , the greater the capital requirement .
I do n’t think an arbitrary split would deal with the problem . "

DEARBORN , Michigan ( Reuters ) -
At Tuhama ’s Lebanese deli in Dearborn , and at bakeries and barbershops throughout town , it ’s no secret the CIA is looking for a few good spies .
A full page recruiting ad from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency is seen in ' The Arab American News ' newspaper in Dearborn , Michigan November 25 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Rebecca Cook
“ There is a lot of talk , and nobody likes it , ” said Hamze Chehade , a 48 - year - old Lebanese - American , taking a bite of his chicken shawarma .
In dire need of agents fluent in Arabic , the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency has made an unusual public show of its recruiting effort in Dearborn -- a city of 100,000 with the densest Arab population in the United States .
The agency has bought full - page ads in Arabic - language newspapers and it is rolling out TV ads aimed at luring Arab - Americans and Iranian - Americans to spycraft .
But despite a weak economy and high unemployment , the CIA will find it hard to hire here , residents say .
Many see U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East as misguided and anger over the perceived mistreatment of Arab - Americans runs deep .
It wo n’t be easy to win hearts and minds here , they say .
“ If anyone goes , they would be just going for the money , not following the heart , ” said Chehade , a cabinet - maker who immigrated from Lebanon 21 years ago .
CIA recruiters said the agency sorely needs speakers of Arabic and other languages due to the intensifying insurgency in Afghanistan and the continuing U.S. occupation of Iraq .
“ Obviously , with the wars going on in the Middle East , that ’s really on America ’s radar , ” said Henry Medina , who is in charge of CIA recruiting in the Midwest .
“ We ’re going to recruit that knowledge , that language , the linguistics , the cultural nuances that are critical to fully understand the foes and enemies , ” said Medina during a briefing for reporters who were shown the agency ’s new ads .
One TV spot showed a dinner party at an Arab - American home , with a narrator intoning , “ Your nation , your world .
They ’re worth protecting .
Careers in the CIA . ”
The camera zooms out to show the party taking place in a modern high - rise building , then a view of the United States from outer space .

A second spot introduces five Arab - American professionals in turn -- an engineer , a scientist , an economist , a lawyer , and an academic -- then shows them together announcing , “ We work for the CIA . ”
“ We ’re trying to de-mystify the agency .
We do n’t want people to only see us as being something like what you see in the movies or spy novels , ” said CIA recruiter Zahra Roberts .
“ DOES AMERICA LOVE US ? ”
The CIA declined to disclose the cost of the ad campaign or detail the number of Arab - American recruits it wants to hire .
Leaders in Dearborn ’s Arab community said they welcomed efforts to make U.S. intelligence agencies more inclusive .
But they said people have grown wary of the government ’s use of wiretaps and informants in the Arab - American community .
Strict enforcement of immigration laws and delays at airports and border crossings for Arab - Americans have also created a backlash , they said .
“ People have been told , ‘ Your name is Mohammed ; your name is Ahmed ; you must be a terrorist , ” said Osama Siblani , Lebanese - born publisher of the Dearborn - based Arab American News .
“ How do you bring people into the government when they have been subjected to a great deal of discrimination ? ”
He added : “ You have to believe that what you are doing is the right thing , otherwise you are just a gun for hire . ”
Siblani , whose newspaper runs CIA recruiting ads , met CIA Director Leon Panetta during a September visit to Dearborn .
“ I said , treat us like Americans , ” he said .
“ We love America but does America love us ? ”
Dawud Walid , head of the Michigan branch of the Council on American - Islamic Relations , agreed that many Arab - Americans were torn between feelings of patriotism and resentment of U.S. government policy at home and abroad .
“ I think transparency will do a lot more than airing TV commercials .
There ’s a large amount of fear and mistrust with the government , ” Walid said .
People of Middle Eastern origin make up more than one - third of Dearborn ’s 100,000 residents , an influx that began a hundred years ago when Henry Ford hired Lebanese immigrants to work in the nearby River Rouge plant .
More recently , many Iraqi refugees have also settled in Dearborn .
On Warren Avenue , where signs in Arabic outnumber those in English , other residents said they doubted the CIA would find many willing recruits in Dearborn .
“ It ’s not lack of patriotism .
It ’s questioning of wrong policy , ” said Mohammed , a 24 - year - old graduate student of Libyan descent who asked not to use his last name .
Inside Tuhama ’s , Chehade said he would warn his adult sons to consider the consequences of signing on with the CIA .
“ People are going to hate you , ” he said .

What If Things Were Made in America Again : One Man's Plan
James A. Stuber could not have imagined his 2017 book , What if Things Were Made in America Again , would resonate so clearly and loudly in 2020 with the COVID - 19 pandemic , the militaristic nationalist rise of China and the focus on impact investing .
Not only these events , but also the growing awareness of the environmental consequences of our purchases .

BAMW : No more farmed or foreign fish !
Did you know that farmed salmon is naturally gray and often dyed pink so that it looks like consumers have come to expect ?
Alaska exports two - thirds of its sustainably - harvested seafood to foreign markets such as China and Japan .
U.S. consumers have unknowingly downgraded their own seafood supply .
It is quite ironic that the United States exports the very best fish and imports some of the worst seafood alternatives .
More Wagyu for You : Black Hawk Farms
Yesterday , I told you about experiencing Japanese black wagyu — often considered the finest of all beef — but there is another option closer to home if you ’re interested .
Black Hawk Farms is located outside of Princeton , Ky. , between Bowling Green and Paducah .
This family - run operation has farmed its land for more than 40 years , and its defining difference is that its American wagyu cattle live their entire lives on the farm , raised on grain that is grown on the property .

Scientists hope the public 's help will have a big impact on research
The US space agency needs your help to explore Mars .
A Nasa website called " Be A Martian " allows users to play games while at the same time sorting through hundreds of thousands of images of the Red Planet .
The number of pictures returned by spacecraft since the 1960s is now so big that scientists cannot hope to study them all by themselves .
The agency believes that by engaging the public in the analysis as well , many more discoveries will be made .
The new citizen - science website went live on Tuesday at http://BeAMartian.jpl.nasa.gov.
The site is just the latest to use crowdsourcing as a tool to do science .
Players at Be A Martian can earn points in one game by helping Nasa examine and organize the images into a more complete map of the planet .
Another game gets users to count impact craters to help scientists understand better the relative age of rocks on Mars ' surface .
Nasa hopes the mix of real data and fun will also inspire the planetary scientists of tomorrow .
" We really need the next generation of explorers , " says Michelle Viotti , from the agency 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , which oversees Mars missions .
" And we 're also accomplishing something important for Nasa .
There 's so much data coming back from Mars .
Having a wider crowd look at the data , classify it and help understand its meaning is very important . "
Software giant Microsoft has been a major contributor to the technology powering Be A Martian .
The website was built on the Microsoft Windows Azure Platform , using the company 's Silverlight interface and its " Dallas " service to house all the information .
" The beauty of this type of experience is that it not only teaches people about Mars and the work Nasa is doing there , but it also engages a large group of people to help solve real challenges that computers cannot solve by themselves , " said Marc Mercuri from Microsoft .
Mr Barroso ( L ) and Mr Wen did not see eye to eye on currency rates
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has rejected European pressure to let its currency rise against the Euro .
Speaking at a summit with EU leaders in Nanjing , Mr Wen said it was unfair of Europe to demand exchange rate changes while maintaining trade protectionism .
For the last 18 months , China has kept the yuan pegged to the weakening US dollar , hurting EU exports to China .
Mr Wen said maintaining China 's exchange rate at a stable level had helped the world economic recovery .
Speaking after talks with European leaders and officials , Mr Wen said China would maintain what he called a reasonable and balanced exchange rate .
He said the stability of the yuan against the dollar had benefited China 's economic development as well as the global recovery .
Mr Wen condemned countries that demand an appreciation of the yuan while engaging in " brazen trade protectionism against China " .
He added : " This is unfair .
In fact , this amounts to restricting China 's development . "
Briefing cancelled
The EU is China 's largest market , accounting for about 20 % of China 's exports .
On Sunday , European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso had urged China to address the EU 's currency concerns .
" Major imbalances because of trade or because of currencies can create problems in the future if they are not fully addressed , he said .
But at the close of the two - day meeting on Monday he did not mention the currency issue in remarks to reporters and a joint China - EU statement did not mention the exchange rate discord .
After Mr Wen 's firm rejection of the Europeans ' call to adjust the yuan , EU officials cancelled a final news conference .
China has said in the past that it wants its currency to be internationally convertible but has appeared reluctant to relinquish state control of the currency and economic policy in general .
( Health.com ) --
Three runners collapsed and died during the Detroit Marathon on Sunday .
Although that news is shocking and frightening for runners and non-runners alike , such deaths are rare , experts say .
" Among young people , high school and college athletes , there 's one death in about every 200,000 people [ during exercise in general ] , " says Dr. Paul Thompson , the director of cardiology at Hartford Hospital , in Connecticut .
" For older people , there 's about one death in every 15,000 people .
If you look at really fit people , the death rate is even lower . "
In fact , other activities may be more dangerous than running a marathon .
" More people die from lightning strikes while golfing , " says Dr. William Roberts , a professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Minnesota , and the medical director of the Twin Cities Marathon .
" And it 's probably safer to be running in these races than driving in a car if you think about the number of deaths from traffic accidents . "
The three men who died in Sunday 's race were believed to be in excellent health and to have trained for the race , according to news reports .
They were 26 , 36 , and 65 years of age .
Two collapsed at roughly the half - marathon mark , or around 11 to 12 miles ; the third had just crossed the half - marathon finish line .
Autopsies have been scheduled to determine the causes of death , but officials suspect all three died from cardiac arrest .
Two other races have been in the news this month after runners died :
Two people died at the end of the Rock ' n ' Roll Half Marathon in San Jose , California , and one person died at the Baltimore Marathon .
Health.com : Heartburn or heart attack ?
How to tell the difference
" When these things happen , they get our attention , " says Thompson .
" Even if you 're in good shape , it 's no guarantee . "
Who 's at risk ?
People most at risk for cardiac arrest during strenuous exercise are those who have underlying heart problems but do n't know it .
Sometimes they have heart abnormalities , which may have been present since birth .
" With young people it 's congenital , " says Thompson .
" Their hearts are too thick , or their arteries come off the wrong areas . "

Other cardiac arrests are caused by ruptures of soft plaque in the arteries , says Roberts .
Unlike the hard plaque known to clog arteries , the soft plaque may leave arteries open enough to go unnoticed .
If they rupture it can result in blood clots and heart attacks , says Roberts .
" If someone is habitually active , they are at less risk , but [ the rupture ] is still going to happen , " says Roberts .
" Whether it happens when you 're out running the race is pretty hard to predict .
We had a death at the Twin Cities Marathon once and the man had had a [ cardiac ] stress test a few weeks before that was normal . "

Are you fit enough to run ?
Take our test
The last death at a Detroit event was reported to be in 1994 when a 42 - year - old man died after running more than 20 miles .
The race conditions in Detroit are probably not to blame for the multiple deaths , says Roberts ; he says that sometimes deaths occur in clusters just by chance .
More than 19,000 people were registered in the race .
Temperatures were low during the race ( 28 degrees at the start ) , but it was essentially good race conditions , as runners are more likely to have problems in hot weather .
Although air pollution levels are generally higher in large , urban areas such as Detroit , it 's generally safe to run anywhere unless there 's a smog alert , says Roberts .
Even the unusual course -- the Detroit route takes runners through a tunnel -- should n't have made a difference ; a Hong Kong race that takes runners through a particularly long tunnel has no higher death rates than any other , he says .
How to stay safe during a race
Marathon deaths raise a number of other health concerns related to racing .
Concern around over - hydration swirled after a runner in the 2002 Boston Marathon collapsed and died from drinking too much water .
Marathon deaths from drinking too much water are extremely rare -- there have only been five in history , says Roberts -- but it is possible .
Health.com : Marathon plans for beginners , intermediates , or advanced
Excess water intake , generally by inexperienced runners worried about dehydration , can cause a potentially life - threatening condition called hyponatremia , or water intoxication .
Runners should aim to drink enough water to replace just a little bit less than what they sweat out , says Roberts .
To approximate that amount , weigh yourself before and after a long run .
The difference is how much sweat you lost during that amount of time .
" To say , ' Drink this much every hour ' is really hard , " says Roberts , " because of the huge variability in sweat rates in people . "
Be aware of how much water you drink , but do n't refrain from drinking when you 're thirsty just because you 're scared of over - hydrating , he says .
Also , before long races , runners should avoid consuming anything that could put them at greater risk of heat stroke , which includes anything that might be dehydrating , such as alcohol , caffeine , and foods high in sodium , warns Roberts .
Some medications may also increase your risk , so check with a doctor .
Otherwise , stick to your usual medication and eating habits .
Above all , make sure you are fit enough to run .
Talk to your doctor about any family risk factors like high blood pressure or diabetes , and check for potential problems , like high cholesterol , experts say .

" If there is anything suspicious in your family history , review that with your physician and see if there 's any workup that needs to happen before you race , " says Roberts .
" If you have a clean family history and you 've been running all your life , you should be fine .
If you 've been sitting on the couch for a while , make sure your past history is n't going to catch up with you . "
Thompson recommends that runners pay attention to their body while exercising and be sure not to ignore symptoms that could be a sign of underlying problems .
" We found about 50 percent of people in our studies had symptoms they chose to ignore , " says Thompson .
Those symptoms included heartburn , tightness in the chest , and tightness in the arms brought on by exercise -- all of which could be symptoms of heart problems .
Still , the experts agree that it 's important to not worry too much about rare occurrences .
" If we worried about the rare stuff all the time , we would n't do anything , " says Roberts .
Depending on your health , perhaps a full marathon wo n't be the best fit , but that does n't by any means necessitate cutting out exercise altogether .

1989 : The Lost Year
Twenty years after the Berlin Wall came down , the end of the Cold War still inspires euphoria and triumphalism in the West .
But even as we lift toasts once again to the victory of 1989 , we should re-examine that momentous year .
Documents , memoirs , and other evidence that have come to light suggest that for relations between the United States and the Soviet Union , it was also a time of missed opportunity .
The fall of the wall was a European earthquake , but in Washington and Moscow , miscommunication and suspicion meant the leaders were badly out of sync .
While Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was eager to move on cutting nuclear arsenals , President George H.W. Bush was cautious and uncertain , and a promising moment slipped away .
It is always easier to identify a pivotal year in retrospect than as you are living through it .
When he became president in 1989 , after eight years as vice president , Bush was devoted to the ideals of prudence and good stewardship in public service .
He and others in the Republican party , conditioned by their Cold War experience , did not see how quickly the world was changing around them .
They remained wary of Gorbachev .
By year ’s end , when the unexpected happened and the gates of the Berlin Wall were flung open , Bush faced pressures made even more intense by his early hesitation .
On Dec. 7 , 1988 , just weeks after Bush was elected and before he took office , Gorbachev made a stunning announcement at the United Nations : the pullback of 500,000 troops from Europe .
It was a profound break from the past to make such a sizable one - sided withdrawal .
Gorbachev said the Soviet Union would no longer hold the countries of Eastern Europe in its grip , another breathtaking change in approach .
" Freedom of choice is a universal principle , " he said .
" It knows no exceptions . "
After the speech Gorbachev met with President Ronald Reagan and Bush at Governors Island .
Reagan , in the twilight hours of his presidency , was ebullient , but he did not discuss Gorbachev ’s remarkable speech in any detail , and they parted without having realized their goal of reducing the arsenals of long - range nuclear weapons .
The hope for a 50 percent cut was bogged down in negotiations .
Bush was low - key , and Gorbachev sensed his hesitation .
" We should take into account that Bush is a very cautious politician , " Gorbachev told the Politburo .
Two days after Bush ’s inauguration in January 1989 , Bush ’s national security advisor , Brent Scowcroft , said , " I think the Cold War is not over . "
Bush ordered a series of foreign - policy reviews , including one on the Soviet Union .
" In the end what we received was mush , " Secretary of State James A. Baker later recalled .
Throughout the spring , the new administration made public statements suggesting that Gorbachev ’s dynamism was a competitive threat , rather than an opportunity .
" I ’ll be darned if Mr. Gorbachev should dominate world public opinion forever , " Bush wrote to a friend March 13 of that year .
Bush finally decided on a policy to " test " Gorbachev ’s intentions , issue by issue , which was in keeping with his characteristic prudence but way behind the curve .
The pause of early 1989 was a mistake .
Gorbachev was , in fact , at the zenith of his powers .
It would have been an ideal time to seize the initiative to lock in the 50 percent cut in strategic weapons or make cuts in tactical nuclear weapons .
A 10 - page Kremlin work plan for arms control and defense issues for the year , which I obtained , included dozens of instructions and tight deadlines , including for reductions in tactical nuclear weapons and chemical arms .
Another draft five - page instruction laid out the rationale for dramatic Soviet weapons cuts and conversion to civilian needs .
As Bush dithered , the window of opportunity in Moscow began to close .
Gorbachev ’s power waned .
The forces of freedom and openness he had unleashed began to overtake him .
An election for a new Soviet legislature , the Congress of People ’s Deputies , the first relatively free election since the Bolshevik Revolution , was held on March 26 .
The Communist Party took a shellacking , and there was open and trenchant criticism of the authorities when the new chamber met for the first time in May and June .
In China , Gorbachev ’s visit in May brought the student protests for democracy in Tiananmen Square to a new level of intensity .
They were suppressed by the June 4 massacre a few weeks later .
Across Eastern Europe , ferment spread , especially in Hungary and Poland , where the Solidarity movement came out from the underground and won in parliamentary elections .
On July 7 , Gorbachev affirmed to leaders of the Warsaw Pact that the Soviet Union would not intervene to stop the juggernaut , and they were free to go their own way .
Anatoly Chernyaev , Gorbachev ’s aide , captured the mood in his diary , writing that socialism in Eastern Europe is " disappearing , " the planned economy " is living its last days , " ideology " does n’t exist anymore , " the Soviet empire " is falling apart , " the Communist Party " is in disarray " and " chaos is breaking out . "
Chernyaev called 1989 " The Lost Year . "
By the summer , after a presidential visit to Europe , Bush could see a tide of change , and thought it was time to reach out to Gorbachev for a summit .
" Too much was happening in the East — I had seen it myself , " he wrote in his memoir with Scowcroft .
Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev , the former chief of the Soviet General Staff and advisor to Gorbachev , made a remarkable tour of U.S. military installations during which he and Adm.
William Crowe , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , openly debated how to end the arms race .
Bush gave Akhromeyev a letter to Gorbachev suggesting a summit .
In September , Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told Baker that Gorbachev ’s situation at home was urgent and precarious .
Baker was surprised at how Shevardnadze had candidly described the forces of disintegration within the Soviet Union , pulling the republics away from the center .
A few weeks later Baker gave a speech calling for a search for " points of mutual advantage " with the Soviet Union .
But the very next day , Vice President Dan Quayle rejected the idea of helping Soviet reform and said " let them reform themselves . "
In late October , Vladimir Pasechnik , a quiet , serious scientist from Leningrad , defected to Britain and confirmed what some had suspected but no one had known for sure :
The Soviet Union had a large and ongoing germ - warfare program in violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention .
Pasechnik was the director of a leading institute in the program .
This was one of the most closely guarded Soviet secrets of the late Cold War period .
In the months that followed , Pasechnik carefully laid out for the British the frightening details : the use of plague as a strategic weapon , among other things .
The details were soon passed to Washington .
The disclosures raised a disturbing question : Did Gorbachev and Shevardnadze , the paragons of glasnost and " new thinking , " know or approve of this underside of the arms race ?
Could the West still do business with them ?
In fact , Shevardnadze and other high - ranking officials ( but not Gorbachev ) had discussed the illicit biological weapons program at a meeting in July , according to an attendance sheet , agenda and handwritten notes I obtained for my book .
The Berlin Wall came down Nov. 9 , ending the division of Europe .
Bush was again cautious .
He had in mind Gorbachev ’s many difficulties .
And indeed , there was now a perfect storm brewing : the future of Germany and indeed Europe was up for grabs ; Gorbachev was in ever - deeper trouble at home as perestroika had not improved living standards ; the arms - control talks were going nowhere ; the Baltics were leaning toward independence .
Pasechnik ’s revelations were kept secret by the West , so they would not trigger a new furor amid all the other uncertainty .
When Bush and Gorbachev finally met at the storm - tossed Malta summit in December , Bush defended his words of caution when the wall came down .
" I do not intend to jump up on the wall , " he said .
" Well , " Gorbachev replied , " jumping on the wall is not a good activity for a president . "
They laughed , but it had been a year of lost opportunity and unexpected turns .
Bush seemed eager to get down to business , but he could have started sooner .
And for Gorbachev , the hour was already growing late .
Bush and Baker made the unification of Germany within NATO a top priority , and eventually achieved it .
But hesitation about Gorbachev and the end of the Cold War put the United States behind the curve in the crucial year of 1989 .
The superpowers did n’t reach a strategic arms treaty until two years later .
And when Bush and Gorbachev did order the pullback of short - range nuclear weapons in their separate 1991 Presidential Nuclear Initiatives , the efforts were undertaken hastily , without a treaty or verification .
Late was preferable to never , but the outcome might have been better had Bush recognized , early in 1989 , what a historic period the world was passing through .

Nanodiscs cause cancer cell death
Tiny magnetic discs just a millionth of a metre in diameter could be used to kill cancer cells , according to a new study .
Laboratory tests found the so - called ' nanodiscs ' , around 60 billionths of a metre thick , could be used to disrupt the membranes of cancer cells , causing them to self - destruct .
The results of the research appear in the journal Nature Materials .
One of the study 's authors , Dr Elena Rozhlova of Argonne National Laboratory in the United States , says subjecting the nanodiscs to a low magnetic field for around ten minutes was enough to destroy 90 % of cancer cells in tests .
Cell death
The researchers used a culture of glioblastoma multiforme , an aggressive form of brain cancer , to test the nanodiscs , which are made from an iron - nickel alloy .
When the nanodiscs were exposed to an alternating magnetic field of between 10 to 20 Hz , it caused them to oscillate , disrupting the membranes of the cancer cells resulting in cell death .
The method uses magnetic fields only one tenth the strength of those of used in previous approaches , and at much lower frequencies , avoiding the negative side effects associated with higher - strength fields .
Previous research into the use of magnetic - nanoparticles have required high magnetic fields or resulted in the accumulation of particles due to permanent magnetisation of the particles which form into clumps in the body .
The researchers say this new technique offers " exciting avenues for probing cell mechanics ... as well as for advancing cancer therapies . "
In a commentary on the report , Professor Jon Dobson of Keele University in Britain says antibodies could be used to direct the discs towards tumour cells .
" This provides an elegant and rapid technique for targeting tumour destruction without the side effects associated with systemic treatments such as chemotherapy . "
A British Virgin Islands judge ruled today that a former Rhode Island dive shop owner must serve at least 25 years of a mandatory life sentence for killing his wife on a Caribbean scuba outing in 1999 , rejecting his lawyers ' bid for leniency .
Justice Indra Hariprashad - Charles said the premeditated nature of the crime bound her to deny a defence request that David Swain become eligible for parole after 18 years in prison .
" It is my view that this murder was carefully planned and premeditated and calls for stiff punishment , " the judge said .
The judge granted Swain about two years credit for time served .
The 53 - year - old is to serve his sentence at a Balsam Ghut prison on Tortola , a mountainous island about 90 miles east of Puerto Rico .
A jury unanimously convicted Swain on 27 October of murdering Shelley Tyre in what authorities portrayed as a near - perfect crime .
Tyre 's drowning near an isolated shipwreck at a depth of 24 metres ( 80 ft ) was initially ruled an accident , but authorities in the British Virgin Islands charged Swain with murder after a 2006 civil trial in Rhode Island found him responsible for her death .
The civil jury awarded Tyre 's family $ 3.5 m ( £ 2.1 ) ; Swain filed for bankruptcy and has not paid the sum .
In the criminal trial , prosecutors argued that Swain killed Tyre to pursue a romance with another woman and get his hands on his wife 's money .
Swain 's lawyers plan to appeal the verdict .
His daughter , Jen Swain Bloom , said evidence that would have helped her father was improperly barred from the trial .
" My family , and my father 's friends and colleagues are still 100 % in support of my father , and his innocence , " Bloom wrote in a letter to local journalists .
" No one that has spent any time with or actually knows my father thinks he should spend one more second behind bars . "
No eyewitnesses or DNA evidence linked Swain to the murder .
The prosecution 's case rested largely on experts who testified they believed Swain wrestled his wife from behind , tore off her scuba mask and shut off her air supply while they swam near the shipwreck .
Her mask was damaged , the mouthpiece of her snorkel was missing , and her fin was found embedded in a sandbar all signs of a struggle , prosecution witnesses said .
The defence called it a weak case that lacked physical evidence and was built on speculative theories and circumstantial evidence designed to roil the emotions of the jury .
Sloppy argument 1 : Languages with more speakers are worth more than languages with fewer .
Sloppy argument 2 : You do n't need to learn languages spoken by people that are good at English .
Sloppy argument 3 : forgetting to factor in difficulty and similarity to other languages .
Sloppy argument 4 : language X is spoken in more countries than language Y and has a higher total GDP so it 's more worth learning .
The word value is in quotes because the real value of learning and using a language lies simply in , well , learning and using it .
Since learning a language usually takes years and years , the only real criterion that should be considered before learning a language is whether you like it or not , whether this language appeals to you enough to invest years and years of your time learning it .
In spite of this , however , languages are often pitted against each other where the value of one is measured against the other in terms of number of native speakers , people studying the language , cultural value , etc .
You see this in lazy appraisals of the situation by parents or others that have decided that Language X is totally the language of the past and Language Y is the new must - learn language .
Here are some signs to watch out for that might indicate that you 're dealing with sloppy logic when someone tells you that Language X is out and Language Y is the next big thing .
Chinese and German are going to be compared a lot in this post as Chinese is an example of a language that is being a bit hyped now while German is an example of the opposite , a language just as worth learning that has been ignored recently .
This is probably the sloppiest argument of them all .
Do n't learn German , it 's only spoken in Western Europe , do n't learn Korean , it 's only spoken in Korea .
The argument is sloppy though because a mere comparison of number of speakers does n't indicate anything about a language 's influence .
Let 's take a look at the top ten spoken languages in the world as an example .
The last one has been removed from the list , so try to guess which one it is .
Chinese , English , Hindi / Urdu , Spanish , Arabic , French , Russian , Indonesian / Malay , Portuguese , and ...?
Hm , what could the missing language be ?
Japanese ?
Nope. German ?
Nope .
Vietnamese , Korean ?
No again .
The next language on the list is Bengali , one of the most spoken languages in the world with a total speaker population of 230 million .
And how often does one hear an exhortation to learn Bengali instead of German or Italian , because there are so many people to use it with ?
Clearly the sloppy argument about number of speakers is the wrong one to use .
A far better way to ascertain the " value " or influence of a language is to look at a few criteria:1 : GDP per capita2 : Status of the language in the respective countries and areas where it is used3 : Press freedom , internet freedom , economic / human development in the countries where it is usedGDP per capita is much more important than total GDP or total population , because when someone tells you that Language X is worth learning because it " helps your career " , what this means simply is that Language X is better than other languages at helping one earn more money in the end .
Okay , so let 's think about how the average person makes money .
Is it through stocks , buying and selling land , creating companies ...?
No , usually not .
The vast majority of us make money by working for a company , trading a certain number of hours a week in exchange for a certain amount of money .
In other words , since most of us work in positions like these , the total number of high - paying jobs that a language has to be able to provide in order to be more worthwhile than another is : .
It does n't matter whether the language is spoken by one million or one billion , as long as knowing it makes the difference between getting and not getting that one job that pays well and it worth doing .
Take Norway as an example .
Norwegian is the easiest language for English speakers to learn , and it has the second highest GDP per capita in the world after Luxembourg .
If knowing fluent Norwegian can help one get a job making twice as much money back home , then clearly the language has demonstrated its economic value in spite of being spoken by only 5 million people .
On the other hand , Spanish is spoken by more than 400 million people throughout the world , but its value in the workforce ( especially in the United States ) is a bit iffy , since it 's not all that rare a skill to have .
Perhaps you are fluent in Spanish , but so are a few million immigrants who do not demand all that high a salary to work .
This is not to say that Spanish is not a worthwhile language to learn , but it's not a language where simply putting it on a resume results in a higher salary .
This is important because often languages have differing statuses in the countries where they are used - some will be official languages , some simply spoken by a large segment of the population , some will be seen as cultured languages by the population , etc. Spanish in the US and French in Canada provide a good example .
Spanish is spoken by far more people in the US than French is in Canada ( though not per capita , mind you ) , but French is an official language of the country and many government jobs require fluency in French .
These government jobs start the employee out at a slightly lower pay scale than others , then give the employee a year of training in which he or she has to become fluent after which you have a cushy government job and are set .
Fluency in French is also often seen as a sign of intelligence or status in Canada , more so than Spanish in the United States .
Afrikaans is another interesting example .
It is also another easy language to learn , the cousin of Dutch , and spoken by quite a few people . ( 12 to 16 million , maybe more ) .
Unfortunately in South Africa it is technically only one of 11 official languages , and so many speak English so well that Afrikaans has to work hard to stay noticed , and even that is only in the western part of the country .
Afrikaans is also still ( unfairly ) stuck with some of the baggage that comes with the legacy of Apartheid . :
Chinese is a good example here of a language that is spoken by a large population and fairly influential , but still a bit sketchy .
A few months ago riots occurred in Xinjiang / East Turkestan , the western part of China with a large Uyghur population .
In response to this , the internet was cut off entirely .
China also often cuts off access to sites like Wikipedia and others from time to time at a whim and without warning .
This is quite a big deal since the majority of Chinese found in the world is spoken in the People 's Republic of China ; remove that country from the equation and there is little influence left .
It also remains to be seen whether China will be able to improve its overall environmental footprint in spite of a rapidly growing economy .
On the other hand , Germany and other countries where German is spoken are managing to do quite well here .
Press freedom is not restricted , internet access is good , technologies such as wind technology , electric cars and passive houses are being given a lot of importance .
Given all this , German is probably still a safer bet in spite of the hype Chinese has been given over the past few years .
Let 's get to sloppy argument 2 .
This argument is another sloppy one that has no basis in reality , and is often given by those that have spent a few weeks in Europe and are amazed at how " everyone speaks English " .
Yes , certainly a lot of people speak English in Western Europe when approached by a tourist needing help .
But no , this does not mean that learning the language spoken there suddenly becomes a waste of time and effort .
We 'll take Norwegian as an example again , since Norwegians are some of the best English speakers in Europe .
If you happen to have a very marketable skill then certainly it is possible to work in Norway while knowing only English .
Otherwise , however , knowing the language is probably one of the best ways to make inroads into the country , to impress potential employers that you are a serious and ambitious potential employee .
It 's true that most in the office will still be able to speak to you in English , but a monolingual English employee is still the only one that is not able to answer the phone , understand the conversation by co-workers in the background , understand a rental contract by themselves , understand the news , know what the bus driver is talking about when he says that there 's been an accident up ahead and they will have to take a right turn here instead of going straight as the bus usually does , etc .
In other words , monolingual employees always require a certain amount of babysitting that bilingual employees do n't .
And besides , there are also jobs out there that require a knowledge of Norwegian - Microsoft hired a large number of beta testers fluent in Norwegian when creating the Norwegian translation of Windows 7 .
This is another area in which Chinese is overhyped at the expense of others .
Check the comments section in any Canadian article on French and one is more likely than not to find a comment along the lines of " man , nobody speaks French anymore and French bilingualism is a waste of money .
We should be teaching our kids Chinese instead " .
The reason why this is a sloppy argument is easy to see : Chinese takes a lot longer to learn for a unilingual speaker of English , and it helps less in learning other languages later on .
The only languages that really become easier after learning Chinese are Japanese , Korean and Vietnamese , and this is due to a large historical Chinese influence as opposed to any real similarity between the languages .
Leave that part of the world though and Chinese does n't help to learn any other languages .
Compare this to French : French is similar to Spanish , Portuguese , Italian , Romanian and Latin , and it has had a huge influence on English as well .
It 's even similar to German in a few respects ( using the verbto make the past tense , -( German ) in 1st person plural , etc. ) .
It also takes less time to learn .
This is important because most students do not become fluent in the first language they take up in school .
Many learn one language for a few years , decide they do n't like it and then move on to a different one later on .
If you learned French in school and want to move on to Spanish or Portuguese , you 're good .
Same for learning German in school and moving on to Norwegian or Swedish later .
Chinese ... not so much .
This is n't quite as sloppy as the other arguments given above since it requires a bit of thought to come up with , but it 's still not quite accurate .
It 's seen often when the argument is given that Spanish is more worth learning than another European language because it 's spoken in so many countries , especially in Central and South America .
This is naturally a good argument when your goal is to travel or live in Central or South America .
It 's a bad argument though when one 's goal is to simply find a higher paying job , or move to a different country in order to do so .
The reason for this is that the GDP numbers here are not per capita .
Indeed , the highest GDP per capita one will find in Spanish - speaking South America is Chile , and even that is only $ 10,000 or so .
Compare that to Norway , where the minimum hourly wage is about $ 16.50 ( $ 34,320 per year ) .
Yes , the country is also much more expensive but compare being able to save some 10 % of one 's wages in Norway compared to other countries .
Conclusion : this post is not meant in any way to sway you towards languages like Norwegian or German or anything else , but merely to attempt to make sure that you are not swayed towards a language you would not otherwise learn due to sloppy logic .
It is always most important to simply learn a language that you are capable of putting in years and years of time into , and if that language is Chinese or Welsh or French or Bislama , then so be it .
Just be careful that you do not find yourself a year or two later in the middle of a textbook of a language you do not particularly like , because your parents or friends or teacher or anyone else made a sloppy argument that seemed to be valid at the time but turned out to be little more than hype .
Bankrupt Britain , A Short History
" If we manage to escape national bankruptcy , we have set up a slavery far more oppressive than any previous form of bondage ... "
BRITAIN'S BANKRUPTCY has been a long time coming .
" By our political folly we have a put a large part , probably the greater part , of the nation in possession of rights to draw from the public purse , " wrote Ernest J.P. Benn in his hilarious Account Rendered of 1930 .
How hilarious ?
Forced to live with the " smudge readers " at passport control , policemen demanding to see one 's driving license down at the station , and Whitehall drones obsessed with how many pencil sharpeners their department controlled , Britain 's moneyed classes knew the lower orders could only travel , drive and wear white - collared shirts if kill - joy regulations applied to the gentry and their staff alike .
But modern liberty , with its motor cars and mortgages , offered to keep Bolshevism out of Britain .
Along with homes " fit for heroes " and the basic state pension , however , regulating it all added to the government 's annual expense – equal at the start of the Thirties to barely one - quarter of the economy .
That was already too great for the Pound Sterling to bear ...
" Whether those [ state - funded ] rights take the form of relief , dole , pension , official salary , subsidy or interest on public debt , they all constitute heavy claims on our total production , " wrote Benn .
" If happily , we manage to escape national bankruptcy , we have set up a slavery for the minority , the producers , far more oppressive than any previous form of bondage ... "
Roll on 35 years , and even with Ernest 's young socialist nephew – Anthony Wedgwood – grandstanding against reducing expenses , Britain just about avoided bankruptcy once more .
Yet again , however , the other option – of defaulting in fact , if not in name – was too good to resist .
Just as the state defaulted in 1931 , quitting the Gold Standard and offering to pay only more paper in return for Pounds , so the UK has long serviced and repaid its debts in devalued notes .
Prior to abandoning the Gold Standard eight decades ago , only Charles II had reneged on his debts , ordering a " stop of the Exchequer " in 1672 that halted payment of interest on any debt without a specific tax revenue ear - marked to cover it .
Whereas across the Channel , in contrast , the French monarchy defaulted in part or in total four times in the 17th century , and then again in 1714 , 1721 , 1759 , 1770 and finally in 1788 – one year before the Revolution .
By 1797 , the new government also found itself unable to service or settle its debt , writing off two - thirds of the entire national debt .
Hence the higher rates of interest paid on French debt , reckoned by Niall Ferguson to be " of the order of one or two percentage points " between 1745 and 1780 , and wilder still – according to his charts at least – during and immediately after Madame Guillotine set about the rentiers .
" These differentials were based on past experience of which bonds were most likely to be defaulted upon , " writes the Oxford ( now Harvard ) scholar in The Cash Nexus ( 2001 ) .
Higher interest rates were a form of " prepaid repudiation " as another historian has called it .
And short of a deep and long - lived deflation in prices , that pre-payment is entirely absent today .
" Plenty of commentators see the risks that arise from not getting a handle on excessive spending ... not getting control of the deficit , " says Philip Hammond , Conservative spokesman on Treasury matters .
Given what the 2010 election might mean for the Pound – or rather , what the market might take it to mean – it's worth heeding just what Hammond told Bloomberg this week .
" We believe that what 's got Britain through the recession so far has been the activist monetary policy of the Bank of England – keeping interest rates low , supporting the economy through quantitative easing – and we think it is essential that in the recovery we are able to continue to keep monetary policy relatively loose .
" We will only be able to do that if we have got the deficit under control , and sent a clear signal to the markets that we intend to execute a plan , and in order to do that we need to get started .
" Nobody 's talking about slashing [ public spending ] in 2010 , but we need to make a start .
The [ Labour ] government 's planning a £ 30 billion increase ... We think that 's too much .
We would scale that back . "
As we 've long suspected here at BullionVault , in short , David Cameron 's " New Tories " can grasp the financial case for reduced public spending .
So could my five - year old ... and my cat , come to that .
But unlike the last Conservative party to stand on the brink of wresting public finance away from an economically illiterate Labour administration , the British Tories dare n't make or even conceive the ideological case for reducing the size of the state today , let alone its expense .
A return to Thatcher ?
We should be so lucky .
And after 10 years when gold prices rose on the back of surging government deficits , record - low interest rates , and an avowed policy of currency devaluation , gilt - owners might want to consider the size of Britain 's public debt , and the zero -rate policy its likely government wants to retain .

This article in the New Hampshire Union Leader gets it right :
Testimony : Drug war behind street shooting
MANCHESTER – Lennoxx Tibbs was shot to death as a result of a drug sellers ' turf war , according to police testimony yesterday at probable cause hearings in Manchester District Court for the man accused of shooting Tibbs and the man accused of accompanying him …
Meanwhile , the Herald & Record in Illinois gets it wrong :
Three charged in drug - related shooting DECATUR - Three Decatur men allegedly involved in a drug deal Thursday that ended in a shooting have been charged in Macon County Circuit Court with five Class X felonies and an assortment of drug charges ...
There 's been a longstanding and misleading tendency in the press to invoke the term " drug- related " to describe unfortunate events that did n’t even involve drug use , and that 's why the Union Leader headline above is such a rare and refreshing example of responsible reporting on drug trade violence .
When you hear the term " alcohol - related , " you can be damn sure we 're talking about someone doing something reckless & dangerous after getting wasted on booze .
Thus , we must also insist that the term " drug- related " be used exclusively to describe incidents arising from the effects of drug consumption , and never the ubiquitous harmful results of drug prohibition itself .
Just imagine if the media properly attributed every episode of horrific drug war violence to prohibition rather than just drugs .
That critical distinction is truly the fulcrum from which an individual 's view of our drug policy swings in one direction or the other .
The instant one learns to identify and distinguish between the harms of drugs and the harms of the laws against them , it becomes vastly more challenging to justify and uphold our present policies .
So please , the next time you see the term " drug- related " used to described harmful outcomes caused by prohibition , send the reporter a note suggesting that a term like " drug war violence " be used instead .
It 's just a fact that the drug war kills infinitely more people than all illegal drugs combined , and we should demand media reporting that places the blame squarely where it belongs .
The American public has no say in Federal Reserve policy .
But the gold market might .
The metal hit yet another record high on Friday , gaining $ 6.40 to $ 1,095.10 an ounce .
It jumped $ 55 for the week and is up $ 211 , or 24 % , year to date .
This cannot be comforting to Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke .
The classic view of gold is that it is the best inflation hedge .
That ’s a faulty assumption , but still : Given the record sums the Fed has pumped into the financial system -- and the fear that that money mountain could eventually power a surge in inflation -- Bernanke does n’t need rising gold prices reinforcing investors ’ doubts .
Advertisement
Coincidentally , gold ’s latest rally occurred as Fed policymakers met this week to affirm that they expected to hold short - term interest rates near zero for an “ extended period . ”
Early in the week the metal got a big boost from India ’s decision to pay $ 6.7 billion to buy 200 tons of gold from the International Monetary Fund ’s reserves .
Instead of keeping that chunk of national wealth in dollars that have been losing value all year , India ’s central bank opted for something tangible and immutable .
Investors who ’ve been swapping dollars for gold since the start of this decade are a happy lot .
After declining for most of the 1980s and ‘ 90s , gold finally bottomed in 1999 around $ 250 an ounce .
Since early 2001 the metal has been on a bull run that has mocked the U.S. stock market .
Gold has risen for nine straight years , and is up 300 % since Dec. 31 , 2000 .
Advertisement
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 index ’s return is negative since that date , including dividends .
Gold , a silly artifact to many investors in the 1990s , has become the great “ if only ” investment : “ If only I ’d bought it nine years ago , or four years ago , or six months ago . ”
But even now there are plenty of people who ca n’t bring themselves to consider gold as an investment .
It pays no interest , and if you ’re buying bars or coins ( versus owning shares of a mutual fund that holds the metal or stocks of mining firms ) , it costs money to store safely .
And if your reason for owning gold has something to do with the end of the world as we know it , shotguns and canned food probably would be more practical investments .

Yet over the last year or so gold has attracted fans far afield from the lunatic fringe .
Some investors expect rising inflation to be the inevitable outcome of the Fed ’s policy of incredibly easy money and of the Obama administration ’s complementary borrow - and - spend strategy .
Those gold buyers are counting on the metal to hold its value against the inflation they believe is on the horizon .
Other gold fans are focused on the risk of another bubble developing in global stock , bond and commodity markets , as investors and speculators borrow at rock - bottom short - term interest rates to take a flier on other assets .
Advertisement
But a large contingent of gold ’s new champions see it in the role it had played through the ages , until the last century : a form of currency , and one that ca n’t be devalued by spendthrift governments .
So - called fiat currencies , like the dollar , are backed only by the promises of the government that issues them .
“ The alternative to fiat currencies is gold , ” notes Edward Yardeni , an economist and chief of Yardeni Research .
David Einhorn , who as head of hedge fund Greenlight Capital earned kudos for warning of last year ’s financial mayhem , is among the Wall Street pros who have turned to gold as a partial replacement for cash in their portfolios .
Advertisement
“ I have seen many people debate whether gold is a bet on inflation or deflation , ” Einhorn said in a speech last month .
“ As I see it , it is neither .
Gold does well when monetary and fiscal policies are poor and does poorly when they appear sensible .
“ Gold did very well during the Great Depression when FDR debased the currency , ” he said .
“ It did well again in the money - printing 1970s , but collapsed in response to [ Former Fed Chairman ] Paul Volcker ’s austerity .
It ultimately made a bottom around 2001 when the excitement about our future budget surpluses peaked . ”
In Einhorn ’s view , gold is n’t just an antidote for the weak dollar , which has mostly been sliding since 2001 .
With major governments and central banks worldwide creating money from thin air to try and bolster the global economy , the dollar ’s chief paper rivals -- the euro and the yen , for example -- might turn out to be more in danger of devaluation than the greenback , Einhorn said .
“ So I conclude that picking one these currencies is like choosing my favorite dental procedure , ” he said .
“ And I decide holding gold is better than holding cash . ”

Officially , the Federal Reserve is n’t supposed to worry about the dollar .
But if faith in the U.S. currency suddenly were to plummet and global investors were to balk at buying Treasury securities , the Fed would be expected to step in and raise short - term interest rates -- the quickest way to defend a fiat currency ’s value .
With U.S. unemployment now above 10 % , the Fed clearly does n’t want to tighten credit soon .
And that ’s why gold ’s continuing rally is a threat to Fed policy :
If investors increasingly see gold ’s ascendance as a sign of waning confidence in the U.S. , it could become self - reinforcing .
Mohamed El - Erian , chief executive of bond giant Pimco in Newport Beach , believes there ’s little chance of the Fed tightening credit before the second half of 2010 .
But by keeping short - term rates near zero , El - Erian notes , the Fed is encouraging investors to borrow in the U.S. and buy risky assets around the globe .
El - Erian said he does n’t believe markets are yet in a new bubble phase , but he is worried .
“ The risk is that the Fed is pursuing short - term stability at the cost of longer - term instability , ” he said .

Gold may yet prove to be poor insurance against instability , but for now it ’s outshining many alternatives .

Can lawmakers who do n’t have the courage or intelligence to outlaw texting while driving really be expected to create a saner tax structure ?
Hmmm .
Developing a fairer tax environment is much less an economics problem than it is a political dilemma and , as many of you observed , it is unlikely that anything “ tax ” will be improved upon until there is some serious facial ( and cultural ) change in Washington .
Politicians focus on one issue at a time , and pretend to have problems dealing with inter-related programs .
Tenured politicians have a vested interest in resisting any change that involves their spheres of influence .
Both parties are embarrassingly mired in twentieth century class warfare that stifles all forms of productive debate .
Tax cuts do n’t just benefit the rich .
In fact , they provide the opportunity for everyone to attain greater wealth .
Demand directs resources far better than punitive taxation .
Money in consumer hands will fuel social and environmentally friendly change .
“ You can not eliminate revenue from one program without replacing it from another , equally complicated , one ” , career politicians will say philosophically .
They have little to gain from simplifying the tax collection system — yet it is obvious that a whole new approach would solve most of the economic woes plaguing us today , domestic and international .
Read
So what would become of all the CPAs , tax attorneys , and offshore laundries — new jobs as consultants , auditors , and regulators perhaps ?
Survey responses outlined constructive and manageable solutions to our multiple tax problems .
If they could only be dealt with as a whole “ New Deal ” ( catchy phrase ) , a fairer tax structure would be in reach .
Several basic concepts need to be accepted : ( a ) do n’t tax the job creators , ( b ) tax consumption instead of income , and ( c ) regulate shareholder abuse in the form of obscene executive pay .
Then , enforce compliance with the intent of a simplified tax code .
A smarter tax system would allow more people to become wealthy honestly ; smarter regulation of thieves in high places would improve the image of big business ( and big government ) significantly .
There are 44,000 pages in the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) alone , 5.5 million words , incomprehensible at best .
Obviously , there is a lot more to be said about each of the ideas that follow .
Here are the top survey ideas ; the first two were discussed in previous results articles as consumer spending enhancers and job creators , respectively .
One : Social Security .
Replace it with a plain vanilla , individually , and flexibly funded fixed pension program .
Every person has his or her own personal pension plan for both mandatory and limited voluntary contributions — limited to a maximum percent of income .
Two : Corporate Taxes .
Eliminate income and Social Security taxes and all other nuisance fees and charges that increase corporate expenses and lead to higher prices — a “ Free Trade Zone ” only policy .
Monitor employers to assure that their savings are translated into new job opportunities and / or lower prices .
Cap total compensation ( all “ perks ” included ) at mid seven figures .
Allow one year - end bonus split among all employees and shareholders .
Invade every boardroom with well - paid and expert compensation auditors .
Three : The Fair Tax .
Adopt the plan that has been negligently ignored by congress for decades .
It replaces the entire IRC with a Federal Sales Tax , and without Social Security , a number between 10 % and 12 % would probably work .
It ’s easy to understand , eliminates the lobbyist gifts and bonuses that current IRC loopholes produce , taxes the underground economy , and gives back ( with necessity only debit cards ) to lowest tier wage earners .
All businesses would be audited to assure collection compliance , and a cap would be set on the total take for all levels of government .
There would be no sales tax on food , healthcare , and educational expenses .
Four : The Flat Tax .
Institute a 10 % Federal income tax , with no exclusions , exceptions , deductions , credits etc .
All income , regardless of source , is taxed at the same level , and the total from all levels of government capped at 15 % .
A combined Flat Tax and Fair Tax environment would increase jobs and spending , while reducing tax fraud and credit abuse .
Any number of approaches could be used to assist the lowest wage earners , and Social Security benefit payments would be tax - free forever .
Compensation creativity such as stock options , country club dues , and first class airfare , need to be dealt with to protect shareholders and employees from their leaders — new jobs for those displaced professionals .
Total annual employment compensation above $ 5,000,000 would be subject to a flat tax of 55 % .
This would apply only to employees of publicly traded companies and elected public officials .
Entrepreneurs , celebrities , lottery winners , etc , must not be penalized for their creativity and good fortune .
It is likely that both new taxes will produce returnable surpluses quickly .
Five : Death & Gift Taxes .
Give them death ; they deserve it .
Six : Property Taxes .
Reduce them each year for all persons receiving Social Security benefits .
Retirees would pay no property taxes after ten years .
Seven : Tolls , Licenses , & Fees .
Eliminate all collections and charges for government provided public transportation ( roads , bridges , tunnels ) and recreational facilities ( parks , museums ) .
Eight : Value Added Tax ( VAT ) .
Several of the suggestions above should reduce the prices of American exports .
But if our trading partners assess a VAT on those exports , lets negotiate elimination or return the favor .
Healthcare reform is next , with tons of ideas not being considered by Congress .

On his radio show today Rush Limbaugh tried to rally the obese against healthcare reform by claiming that if the overweight do n’t lose weight , the bill will send them to reeducation camps .
Limbaugh said that the government could , “ send you off to some reeducation camp if you do n’t lose weight . ”
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :

Limbaugh said , “ They ’ve been trying this , they ’ve been trying to get this done since FDR .
Again , it ’s not about healthcare .
It is about one thing fundamentally , and the offshoots of this are even more hideous , but the primary thing this is about is the redistribution of wealth , which will result for the first time in well over a majority of Americans being fully dependant on Washington for their existence .
With the Democrats in charge of Washington , the theory is that no voter will ever vote against the government that is providing for him or her , and therefore Democrats will be in power in perpetuity . ”
He continued , “ That is the thing that is diving this , the redistribution of wealth , the cutting the country down to size , taking as much of the private sector away from the private sector , putting it under government control , making you dependent on government , not the private sector , for your prosperity , well whatever there wo n’t be any prosperity , for your existence . ”
Then he fear mongered the obese , “ Now the more hideous offshoots of this are that when they have this kind of power that makes you totally dependent , I mean its real power .
They can tell you when and when you ca n’t use a cell phone .
When and when you ca n’t do this , what you can and ca n’t eat , where you can and ca n’t go , what you can and ca n’t weigh , send you off to some reeducation camp if you do n’t lose weight .
They ca n’t wait to do this .
They exist for the exercise of power . ”
Limbaugh completely ignores the fact that the government is not taking over healthcare .
The House version of the public option only covers 6 million people , but this does n’t stop Limbaugh from spinning a paranoid fantasy that would make Glenn Beck proud .
Ask yourself how reducing the cost of healthcare is a redistribution of wealth ?
The obese are often discriminated against in the current health insurance system .
They are constantly turned down for coverage due to their weight being a preexisting condition , so would n’t people who ca n’t currently get coverage , support a bill that would allow them to be covered ?
Limbaugh ’s rants are getting more distant from reality each and every day .

I ’ve always been fascinated by landscapes – places that are absolutely desolate , where I can stay one on one with nature .
For me , the growing joy right before pressing the shutter button as well as the possibility of interacting with the world filled with inspiration is as important as the creative act itself .
This initial fascination has rapidly grown into obsession that eventually took control over my life .

Tactile sensations can affect how sound is heard , say researchers Sensations on the skin play a part in how people hear speech , say Canadian researchers .
A study found that inaudible puffs of air delivered alongside certain sounds influenced what participants thought they were listening to .
Writing in the journal Nature , the team said the findings showed that audio and visual clues were not the only important factors in how people hear .
The findings may lead to better aids for the hard of hearing , experts said .
It is already well known that visual cues from a speaker 's face can enhance or interfere with how a person hears what is being said .
If further research can show the same effect is observed when listening to everyday conversation in the ' real ' world , then it could help improve hearing aids
Dr Ralph Holme
RNID
In the latest study , researchers at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver wanted to look at whether tactile sensations also affected how sounds are heard .
They compared sounds which when spoken are accompanied by a small inaudible breath of air , such as " pa " and " ta " with sounds which do not such as " ba " and " da " .
At the same time , participants were given - or not - a small puff of air to the back of the hand or the neck .
They found that " ba " and " da " , known as unaspirated sounds , were heard as the aspirated equivalents , " pa " and " ta " , when presented alongside the puff of air .
Full picture
It suggests people also use tactile sensory information alongside other cues to decipher what is being said .
This additional knowledge in how a full picture of sound is built up could prove useful in the future development of communication aids for the hearing impaired , the researchers said .
Study leader Dr Bryan Gick said his team would now work to develop a hearing aid incorporating the findings .
" All we need is a pneumatic device that can produce air puffs aimed at the neck at the right times based on acoustic input into the hearing aid , and then a set of experiments to test the efficacy . "
Dr Ralph Holme , director of biomedical research at the deaf and hard of hearing charity , RNID , said : " It is well known that visual cues , like lip reading , can really help people listen to speech if they have a hearing loss .
" However , some consonants such as b and p or t and d have the same lip pattern .
" The possibility that a small puff of air on the skin could help people distinguish between these consonants is fascinating .
Early conversations
" If further research can show the same effect is observed when listening to everyday conversation in the ' real ' world , then it could help improve hearing aids . "
Dr Deborah James , lead scientist for child and family at National Biomedical Research Unit in Hearing , said the sounds associated with " tiny puffs of air " help young children differentiate between the beginnings and ends of words .
" We are exploring the earliest development of auditory / visual speech perception in very young babies with hearing difficulties - perhaps we should be looking out for how the babies respond to the natural puffs of air that parents produce when they get up close to their baby during their earliest conversations .

Barack Obama : the politics of hypocrisy and cynicism
It was supposed to be all about the end of politics as usual .
But while President Barack Obama has been happy to bring about change while abroad by doing all he can to diminish the superpower status of the United States , at home it 's been the same old , writes Toby Harnden .
The 11 - month sentence for a man over sex with a girl under 17 brings the law into sharp focus , writes CAROL COULTER
IN MULLINGAR District Court last week , Judge John Neilan imposed an 11 - month sentence on a young man who admitted the offence of sex with a girl under the legal age of consent , which is 17 years .
She was 16 and three - quarters when the incident took place , and he was 19 .
The judge accepted the youth did not know the age of consent was 17 , and a consultant psychiatrist told the court it was “ a very widely held belief ” that the age of consent was 16 .
The judge adjourned the case for consideration of victim impact and probation reports .
Earlier this year , the Oireachtas Committee on a Children ’s Constitutional amendment spent many months discussing the age of consent and the need to have a constitutional amendment to restore the situation whereby sex with a girl under this age was a crime for which there could be no defence .
Committee members who backed the idea of a constitutional amendment insisted cases such as that before Judge Neilan would never be prosecuted .
The DPP indicated that a prosecution was unlikely in such circumstances .
Nothing was said in court last week to indicate any element of coercion or violence that would have brought this case to special DPP attention .
Nonetheless , his office must have given permission for the prosecution to go ahead .
In this case the judge referred to the fact the girl ’s parents did not approve of the relationship , and the young man admitted they “ did not have a particular liking ” for him .
Her father had looked for the girl and come upon the couple , resulting in her being brought to the Garda station and a complaint being made .
Judge Neilan acknowledged the young man thought the age of consent was 16 and said he had “ set out fairly and squarely his involvement in the incident ” , but drew attention to the fact that he knew the parents did not like him .
Before sentencing , he said accused was “ strictly on notice that he should have absolutely nothing to do with her ” .
The full account of this case , made available to The Irish Times by local reporter Claire O’Brien , shows the judge laid great emphasis on the fact the girl ’s parents did not approve of the relationship between her and the young man .
Indeed , as a result , he had suggested they not see each other , but the girl had insisted .
Two weeks ago the High Court overturned an adoption order where the birth parents had been 19 and 15 when the sexual relationship began .
Yet nowhere in that case was there any hint that there had been a criminal prosecution along the way .
A conviction such as that handed down to the young man in Mullingar , who honestly did not think he was committing a crime and who did not coerce the girl , means he will carry the stigma for life , with huge implications for him .
He may be placed on the sex offenders ’ register .
He will never be able to enter the US and many occupations will be closed to him .
Last February the DPP told the Oireachtas committee his office often came under pressure from parents to bring prosecutions in cases of non-coercive sex between teenagers of similar age .
In practice , he said , neither he nor his predecessor prosecuted such cases , and of the cases prosecuted since the introduction of the 2006 Criminal Law ( Sexual Offences )
Act , there was an age gap of six years or more in almost 85 per cent of the cases .
If the determining factor in the bringing of such cases , and of their outcome in court , is the attitude of parents , it introduces an element of private prosecution at odds with the fundamental principles of our justice system .

The spectacular dust storm that swept through much of eastern Australia on Wednesday may have had its origins 12 months ago , an Australian expert says .
And with climate change set to bring more variability , Australia may experience more large scale dust storms in the future .
This week 's storm covered a large area of eastern Australia , with PM10 ( particles less than 10 micrometres ) levels in most Australian cities being well above safe levels .
" They 're classed as dangerous at levels above 200 micrograms per cubic metre , " ABC weather forecaster Graham Creed said .
" In Sydney 's east they 're recording about 256 , in the north - west 919 and in the south - west 1719 .
But Sydney is not the worst , Bathurst at the moment is 2665 . "
Severe weather forecaster Dr Deryn Griffiths of the Bureau of Meteorology says the dust storm started two days ago when 100 kilometre per hour winds whipped up dust from the central region of Australia .
" It started in South Australia and has since extended across all of New South Wales and into Queensland . "
She says extremely dry conditions throughout the interior of the country , along with strong winds , provided the perfect recipe for the dust storm .
" The township of Moomba in South Australia has had only 11 millimetres [ of rain ] this year - it 's very , very dry , " she said .
Dr Griffiths says the dust storm is the biggest to hit the city of Sydney since the 1940s .
" In 2002 and 2003 we had a few dust storm events .
In 1994 we had a couple and also in 1982 , " she said .
" So it happens about a couple of times each decade , but this density has n't happened in 50 years in Sydney . "
Outback origins
Associate Professor Michael Box of the School of Physics at University of New South Wales says the most likely source of the dust is the Lake Eyre Basin , which a few months ago was a wetland oasis .
" The Lake Eyre Basin area of central Australia is a dusty place , especially in early spring .
Dust storms originating in this region are common , although it is far less common that the dust is carried the 1,500 kilometres to Sydney and beyond , " he said .
" However , with winds of sufficient strength and the right direction dust may be carried off the Australian coast - even as far as New Zealand . "
Climatologist Dr Samuel Marx of the University of Queensland says the fine particles in this dust storm were probably laid down during after the flooding rains that occurred in outback Queensland late last year .
" You often get these dust storm events after you 've had wetter years , " he said .
" After you 've had decent rains like we had last year , you get flood waves moving through central Australia .
These deposit lots of fine material and once this dries out it easily gets entrained by the wind . "
Dr Marx , who has looked at Australian dust storms that have occurred over the last 10,000 years , says these events occur more often when there are greater oscillations between wet and dry periods .
Climate change
He says future climate modelling by the United Nation 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) suggests this may happen more often in the future .
" One of the predictions of the IPCC is that the Australian climate will be more variable and this should probably result in more dust storms , " Dr Marx said .
But he says the role of dust in climate modelling is still a large unknown .
" It changes the thermal structure of the atmosphere .
Dust particles can absorb radiation and reflect radiation - it really depends on the characteristics of the dust and where it is being transferred , " he said .
Dr Marx says previous studies estimate the amount of dust in a storm of this size between 8 and 40 million tonnes , most of which will be deposited in the ocean , which could result in a explosion of phytoplankton .
" There has been quite a bit of work that has shown that these dust plumes are actually linked with phytoplankton blooms in the Southern Ocean .
That 's a good thing in some ways , " he said .
New Zealand is also set to experience dust from this storm , having only just recovered from a similar dump last week when the city of Christchurch experienced high levels of dust blown over from Victoria 's western districts .
But Dr Marx says the greatest effect from this dust storm could be felt on New Zealand 's ski slopes .
" Most of the dust gets rained out on the west coast , " he said .
" It 's quite common to see red dust deposited through the New Zealand snowfields . "

DOL Chartbook ...
Back in August of this year I did an article that showed how bad the math was with the unemployment system ( Unemployment Benefits – More Math that Just Does n’t Work / More Data Hiding ? ) .
Well , the math is just getting worse … back in August the total 2009 outlays had already hit a record but were well under $ 60 billion .
Now they are approaching $ 100 billion , already almost 5 times the amount paid out in the year 2000 :
In my prior article on this subject I showed a chart that indicated total program collections ran about $ 38.77 billion in 2008 , a year that $ 52 billion was spent .
This chart is no longer published on the site !
But , I think it 's safe to assume that like all tax collections it is probably down at least 15 % this year , or will be about $ 33 billion in revenue with the now $ 96 billion expenditure , nearly three times the money taken in !
The exhaustion rate of those using they system were already at a record high , but have now risen above half :
The raw number of exhaustions is nearly twice that of the last recession :
When I wrote the original article , I mentioned that there were several data discrepancies and that I had written them asking for an explanation .
Nearly two months later I finally got a meaningless acknowledgement , but no real answers , and the data is still missing , particularly in the charts that would normally give insight into the solvency of the funds underlying this program .
For example , the chart showing Average High Cost Multiples , a measurement of solvency , has data missing from 1982 and 1983 ( high draw years ) , and now they will not show the data since 2006 :
In addition to missing data , some of the chart series I presented in that article are now missing entirely , like the chart showing Total Contributions collected , the program ’s income ( I ’m sure it has collapsed ) .
The Treasury holds the Unemployment Trust fund and lends money to states that fall short in their own individual funds .
More and more states are falling into the red and borrowing from the Treasury to keep unemployment payments going .
So many loans were made last year that the net borrowings and claims exceeded the amount taken in – negative net cash flow .
How good is DOL at forecasting ?
Here 's a quote from their 2008 mid year review , " Outlays from state trust fund accounts are projected to exceed revenues and interest income by $ 2.48 billion in FY 2008 and $ 4.93 billion in FY 2009 .
" Nice guess , they are only off by about $ 55 billion , or 1,100 % on their '09 estimate made only six months prior to the beginning of the year , Oops .
The following report included this fine update , " Summary : That statistic unexpectedly declined sharply , Outlays from state trust fund accounts are projected to exceed revenues and interest income by $ 29.0 billion in FY 2009 and $ 21.1 billion in FY 2010 .
The general fund advances must be repaid with interest .
" Uh huh ... still not even close to reality .
The DOL , the BLS , and all government agencies that report statistics need to be torn down and a new agency implemented with a well defined mission of transparency , independence , and consistency over time .
Just like the Fed and Treasury ( who holds these unemployment accounts ) , if they have nothing to hide , why do n’t they just provide the data ?
It ’s because they do have something to hide , the fund is insolvent – make me happy , prove me wrong .
I say audit the Treasury ( a real and meaningful audit ) and the Unemployment Trust Fund while you ’re auditing the Fed !

In the spate of recent books and articles on the burgeoning conservative movement , little has been said of its governing ideas and its intellectual leadership .
Instead , attention has been centered on the mass phenomena of the right wing : the Billy James Hargises , the Birchers , the various crusaders for God and country .
And yet , the neglect of the ruling ideas of the right wing has obscured its true nature , and has hidden an enormous and significant change in the very nature of the Right that has taken place since World War II .
In fact , due to the total absence of dialogue between various parts of the political spectrum in this country , both Right and Left are largely conducting their argument in what used to be called a severe " cultural lag " ; both sides still mistakenly believe that the categories of the debate are the same as they were immediately after the war .
In particular , under cover of a certain continuity of rhetoric , the intellectual content and goals of the right wing have been radically transformed in the last decade and a half , and this transformation has gone virtually unnoticed on either Right or Left .
The modern American Right began , in the 1930s and 1940s , as a reaction against the New Deal and the Roosevelt Revolution , and specifically as an opposition to the critical increase of statism and state intervention at home , and to war and state intervention abroad .
The guiding motif of what we might call the " Old American Right " was a deep and passionate commitment to individual liberty , and to the belief that this liberty , in the personal and the economic spheres , was gravely menaced by the growth and power of the Leviathan state , at home and abroad .
As individualists and libertarians , the Old Right felt that the growth of statism at home and abroad were corollaries : New Deal coercion , on behalf of an illusory domestic security , was matched by the ultimate coercion of war in pursuit of the illusion of " collective security " abroad ; and both forms of intervention brought with them a swelling of state power over society and over the individual .
At home , the Supreme Court was looked to for a " strict construction " of the Constitution to check governmental depredation of the liberty of the individual , and conscription was denounced as a return to an unconstitutional form of involuntary servitude .
As the force of the New Deal reached its heights , both foreign and domestic , during World War II , a beleaguered and tiny libertarian opposition began to emerge and to formulate its total critique of prevailing trends in America .
Unfortunately , the Left , almost totally committed to the cause of World War II as well as to extensions of the domestic New Deal , saw in the opposition not a principled and reasoned stand for liberty , but a mere blind " isolationism " at best , and , at worst , a conscious or unconscious " parroting of the Goebbels line . "
It should not be forgotten that the Left , not so long ago , was not above engaging in its own form of plot hunting and guilt by association .
If the Right had its McCarthys and Dillings , the Left had its John Roy Carlsons .
Now it is certainly true that much of this nascent and emerging libertarian Right was tainted with blind chauvinism , with scorn of " foreigners , " etc. , and that even then an unfortunate bent for plot hunting was becoming evident .
But still the prevailing trend , certainly among the intellectuals of the Right , was a principled and trenchant opposition to war and to its concomitant destruction of life and liberty , and of human values .
The Beardian ideal of abstention from European wars was essentially not a chauvinist scorn of the stranger , but a call for America to harken to its ancient aim of serving the world as a beacon light of peace and liberty , rather than as master of a house of correction to set everyone in the world aright by force of bayonet .
If the " isolationists " were not themselves libertarian , they were at least moving in that direction , and their ideas needed only refinement and systematization to arrive at that goal .
In the devotion to peace , in the anxiety to limit and confine state military interventions and consequent wars , there was little difference between the right - wing principle of neutrality a generation ago , and the left - wing principle of neutralism today .
When we realize this , the essential obsolescence of the old categories of " Right " and " Left " begins to become clear .
The intellectual leaders of this Old Right of World War II and the immediate aftermath were then and remain today almost unknown among the larger body of American intellectuals : Albert Jay Nock , Rose Wilder Lane , Isabel Paterson , Frank Chodorov , Garet Garrett .
It almost takes a great effort of the will to recall the principles and objectives of the Old Right , so different is the current right wing today .
The stress , as we have noted , was on individual liberty in all its aspects as against state power : on freedom of speech and action , on economic liberty , on voluntary relations as opposed to coercion , on a peaceful foreign policy .
The great threat to that liberty was state power , in its invasion of personal freedom and private property and in its burgeoning military despotism .
Philosophically , the major emphasis was on the natural rights of man , arrived at by an investigation through reason of the laws of man 's nature .
Historically , the intellectual heroes of the Old Right were such libertarians as John Locke , the Levellers , Jefferson , Paine , Thoreau , Cobden , Spencer , and Bastiat .
In short , this libertarian Right based itself on 18th - and 19th - century liberalism , and began systematically to extend that doctrine even further .
The contemporary canon of the Right consisted of Nock 's Our Enemy the Stateand Memoirs of a Superfluous Man , Paterson 's The God of the Machine ( the chapter , " Our Japanized Educational System , " virtually launched the postwar reaction against progressive education ) , and H. L. Mencken 's A Mencken Chrestomathy .
Its organ of opinion was the now - forgotten monthly broadsheet analysis , edited by Nock 's leading disciple , Frank Chodorov .
The political thought of this group was well summarized by Chodorov :
The state is an antisocial organization , originating in conquest and concerned only with confiscating production . …
There are two ways of making a living , Nock explained .
One is the economic means , the other the political means .
The first consists of the application of human effort to raw materials so as to bring into being things that people want ; the second is the confiscation of the rightful property of others . …
The state is that group of people , who having got hold of the machinery of compulsion , legally or otherwise , use it to better their circumstances ; that is the political means .
Nock would hasten to explain that the state consists not only of politicians , but also those who make use of the politicians for their own ends ; that would include those we call pressure groups , lobbyists , and all who wrangle special privileges out of the politicians .
All the injustices that plague " advanced " societies , he maintained , are traceable to the workings of the state organizations that attach themselves to these societies .
When the Cold War so swiftly succeeded World War II , the Old Right was not bemused — let alone did it lead the war cry .
It is difficult to conceive now that the main political opposition to the Cold War was led , not by the Left , then being brought into the war camp by the ADA , but by the " extreme - right - wing Republicans " of that era : by the Howard Buffetts and the Frederick C. Smiths .
It was this group that opposed the Truman Doctrine , NATO , conscription and American entry into the Korean War — with little grateful acknowledgement by left - wing peace groups then or now .
In attacking the Truman Doctrine on the floor of Congress , Rep. Buffett , who was to be Taft 's Midwestern campaign manager in 1952 , declared :
Even if it were desirable , America is not strong enough to police the world by military force .
If that attempt is made , the blessings of liberty will be replaced by coercion and tyranny at home .
Our Christian ideals cannot be exported to other lands by dollars and guns .
Persuasion and example are the methods taught by the Carpenter of Nazareth , and if we believe in Christianity we should try to advance our ideals by his methods .
We cannot practice might and force abroad and retain freedom at home .
We cannot talk world cooperation and practice power politics .
Among the intellectual leadership of the Old Right , Frank Chodorov vigorously set forth the libertarian position on both the Cold War and the suppression of communists at home .
The latter was summed up in the aphorism , " The way to get rid of communists in government jobs is to abolish the jobs . "
Or , more extensively :
And now we come to the spy hunt — which is , in reality , a heresy trial .
What is it that perturbs the inquisitors ?
They do not ask the suspects :
Do you believe in Power ?
Do you adhere to the idea that the individual exists for the glory of the state ?…
Are you against taxes , or would you raise them until they absorbed the entire output of the country ?…
Are you opposed to the principle of conscription ?
Do you favor more " social gains " under the aegis of an enlarged bureaucracy ?…
Such questions might prove embarrassing to the investigators .
The answers might bring out a similarity between their ideas and purposes and those of the suspected .
They too worship Power .
Under the circumstances , they limit themselves to one question :
Are you a member of the Communist Party ?
And this turns out to mean , have you aligned yourselves with the Moscow branch of the church ?
– Frank Chodorov
" War is the apotheosis of Power , the ultimate expression of the faith and solidification of its achievement . "
Power worship is presently sectarianized along nationalistic lines … each nation guards its orthodoxy .…
Where Power is attainable , the contest between rival sects is unavoidable .
If , as seems likely , the American and Russian cults come into violent conflict , apostasy will disappear . …
War is the apotheosis of Power , the ultimate expression of the faith and solidification of its achievement . …
The case against the communists involves a principle of freedom that is of transcending importance .
It is the right to be wrong .
Heterodoxy is a necessary condition of a free society . …
The right to make a choice … is important to me , for the freedom of selection is necessary to my sense of personality ; it is important to society , because only from the juxtaposition of ideas can we hope to approach the ideal of truth .
Whenever I choose an idea or label it " right , " I imply the prerogative of another to reject that idea and label it " wrong . "
To invalidate his right is to invalidate mine .…
If men are punished for espousing communism , shall we stop there ?
Once we deny the right to be wrong we put a vise on the human mind and put the temptation to turn the handle into the hands of ruthlessness .
And , in May 1949 , Chodorov , praising a pamphlet on The Militarization of America issued by The National Council Against Conscription , wrote that " The state cannot intervene in the economic affairs of society without building up its coercive machinery , and that , after all , is militarism .
Power is the correlative of politics . "
The Old Right reached its full flower in devotion to peace during the Korean War , which provoked several trenchant efforts during the early 1950s .
The Foundation for Economic Education ( FEE ) , generally concerned with free - market economics , devoted several studies to the problem .
Thus , Leonard E. Read wrote in Conscience on the Battlefield ( 1951 ) ,
It is strange that war , the most brutal of man 's activities , requires the utmost delicacy in discussion . …
War is liberty 's greatest enemy , and the deadly foe of economic progress .…
To fight evil with evil is only to make evil general .
In the same year , Dr. F. A. Harper published an FEE pamphlet , In Search of Peace , in which he wrote ,
Charges of pacifism are likely to be hurled at anyone who in troubled times raises any question about the race into war .
If pacifism means embracing the objective of peace , I am willing to accept the charge .
If it means opposing all aggression against others , I am willing to accept the charge also .
It is now urgent in the interest of liberty that many persons become " peacemongers . "
So the nation goes to war , and while war is going on , the real enemy [ the idea of slavery ] — long ago forgotten and camouflaged by the processes of war — rides on to victory in both camps .…
Further evidence that in war the attack is not leveled at the real enemy is the fact that we seem never to know what to do with " victory . "
Are the " liberated " peoples to be shot , or all put in prison camps , or what ?
Is the national boundary to be moved ?
Is there to be further destruction of the property of the defeated ?
Or what ?…
False ideas can be attacked only with counter - ideas , facts , and logic . …
Nor can the ideas of [ Karl Marx ] be destroyed today by murder or suicide of their leading exponent , or of any thousands or millions of the devotees . …
Least of all can the ideas of Karl Marx be destroyed by murdering innocent victims of the form of slavery he advocated , whether they be conscripts in armies or victims caught in the path of battle .
Ideas must be met by ideas , on the battlefield of belief .
And , as late as May 1955 , Dean Russell wrote , in FEE's The Conscription Idea ,
Those who advocate the " temporary loss " of our freedom in order to preserve it permanently are advocating only one thing : the abolition of liberty . …
However good their intentions may be , those people are enemies of your freedom and my freedom ; and I fear them far more than I fear any potential Russian threat to my liberty .
These sincere but highly emotional patriots are clear and present threats to freedom ; the Russians are still thousands of miles away . …
The Russians would only attack us for either of two reasons : fear of our intentions or retaliation to our acts .…
As long as we keep troops in countries on Russia 's borders , the Russians can be expected to act somewhat as we would act if Russia were to station troops in Guatemala or Mexico . …
I can see no more logic in fighting Russia over Korea or Outer Mongolia , than in fighting England over Cyprus , or France over Morocco . …
The historical facts of imperialism … are not sufficient reasons to justify the destruction of freedom within the United States by turning ourselves into a permanent garrison state . …
We are rapidly becoming a caricature of the thing we profess to hate .
There is no need to multiply examples .
Frank Chodorov consistently worked against the war drive in analysis and later , in 1954 , as editor of the Freeman .
The right - wing libertarian journal Faith and Freedom featured , in April , 1954 , an all - peace issue , with contributions by Garet Garrett , Robert LeFevre , the industrialist Ernest T. Weir , and the present writer .
We might elaborate here on two neglected contributions in that period .
One was an essay by Garrett ( " The Rise of Empire , " 1952 , reprinted in The People 's Pottage , 1953 ) which pinpointed the main issue of our time as the rise of a deplorable American imperialism : " We have crossed the boundary that lies between Republic and Empire . "
The other was a relatively unnoticed book by Louis Bromfield , A New Pattern for a Tired World ( 1954 ) , which decried statism , war , conscription , and imperialism .
Bromfield wrote with conviction of imperialism and of the revolution of the undeveloped countries :
One of the great failures of our foreign policy throughout the world arises from the fact that we have permitted ourselves to be identified everywhere with the old , doomed , and rotting colonial - imperialist small European nations which once imposed upon so much of the world the pattern of exploitation and economic and political domination . …
None of these rebellious , awakening peoples will … trust us or cooperate in any way so long as we remain identified with the economic colonial system of Europe , which represents , even in its capitalistic pattern , the last remnants of feudalism . …
We leave these awakening peoples with no choice but to turn to Russian and communist comfort and promise of Utopia .
And on American Cold War policy , Bromfield charged ,
Our warmongers and the military apparently believe … that all other nations are unimportant and can be trampled under foot the moment either Russia or the U.S. sees fit to precipitate a war . …
To this faction [ the warmongers and the military ] it seems of small concern that the nations lying between us and Russia would be the most terrible sufferers . …
The growing " neutralism " of the European nations is merely a reasonable , sensible , and civilized reaction , legitimate in every respect when all the factors from Russia 's inherent weaknesses to our own meddling and aggressiveness are taken into consideration . …
The Korean situation … will not be settled until we withdraw entirely from an area in which we have no right to be and leave the peoples of that area to work out their own problems .
These quotations give the flavor of an era that is so remote as to make it seem incredible that such views should have dominated the American right wing .
To the current right wing , which has virtually obliterated its own former position from its memory , such views today would be branded , at the very least , as " soft on communism . "
The radical transformation of the right wing can even be seen in the fate of something like the Bricker Amendment .
Only a decade ago , the Bricker Amendment was the number - one foreign - policy plank of the right wing , dear to all the " little old ladies in tennis shoes " that used to form its mass base .
And the reason the resurgent conservative movement , and its political embodiment in the Goldwater movement , have entirely buried the Bricker Amendment is because that amendment , while defining not the most important or the most idealistic foreign - policy stance , was an expression of the " isolationism , " or the fear of the effects of big government upon the individual , that bears no relation to today 's New Right .
Much of the Left , however , still writes as if the main trouble with today 's Right is its " isolationism , " its wish to withdraw from foreign aid or international commitments .
Others on the Left claim that the Right 's anticommunism is a mere cloak for laissez - fair economic views .
There could not be a more mistaken analysis of the essence of the current position of the American Right .
For that position is virtually the reverse : today 's right wing is directed , with passion , dedication , and even fanaticism to one overriding goal , to which all other possible goals are totally subordinate .
And that goal is the nuclear annihilation of the Soviet Union .
Here is the essence of the New Right , the gauge of the totality of its transformation .
As one of its major theoreticians likes to put it , " I have a vision , a great vision of the future — a totally devastated Soviet Union . "
Here , in brief , is the vision that animates the conservative revival .
For the blight that destroyed the libertarianism of the right wing and effected its transformation was nothing less than hysterical anticommunism .
It began with this kind of reasoning : there are two " threats " to liberty : the " internal " threat of domestic socialism , and the " external " threat of Soviet Russia .
The external threat is the most important .
Therefore , all energies must now be directed to battling and destroying that " threat . "
In the course of this shift of focus from statism to communism as the " enemy , " the right wing somehow failed to see that the real " external " threat was not Soviet Russia , but a warlike foreign policy of global intervention , and especially the nuclear weapons of mass destruction used to back up such a policy .
And they failed to see that the main architect in organizing a foreign policy of global nuclear intervention was the United States .
In short , they failed to see that both the " external " and " internal " threats of statism to liberty were essentially domestic .
Under pressure of anticommunist hysteria , the right wing , despite its fondness for quasi - theological or moral cant , has imitated the communists themselves in virtually abandoning all moral principles except one : in this case , the destruction of all opposition , foreign and domestic .
For the immorality of communism is not uniquely diabolic ; it stems from the fact that for communists , all other moral principles are expendable before the overriding end of the maintenance and advance of the communist system .
But , the right wing has similarly erected as its sole , overriding end the destruction of communists and communist countries , and all other considerations are scrapped to attain that end .
There seems now to be one crucial difference , however ; the communists are more convinced than ever that nuclear weapons of annihilation make imperative peaceful coexistence between states , and that social change must come about through internal changes within each state , where conflict would be relatively small - scale and confined .
But the right wing has not only failed to learn this lesson ; on the contrary , the more terrible modern weaponry has become , the more fanatically determined upon total war the right wing has grown .
This seems to be a lunatic position , and undoubtedly it is , but it is important that non-Rightists realize that this is precisely the position of the present - day Right .
Now , of course , no one has ever wanted war per se ; Hitler would not have attacked Soviet Russia , for example , if Russia had agreed to surrender unconditionally without war .
And neither would the right wing launch an H - bomb attack on Russia if Khrushchev and his government were to resign and turn over the Soviet Union to , let us say , an American army of occupation .
But that is the point : that nothing short of unconditional surrender would satisfy the right wing , or would deflect it from nuclear attack .
How does the right wing justify a position that is prima facie monstrous and even crazed ?
The essential justification is , curiously enough , theological and Christian .
It is even Catholic , for while the mass base of the right wing , apart from the Eastern cities , is fundamentalist Protestant , the intellectual leaders are almost all either Catholic or " proto - Catholic . "
The justification is a willingness to destroy the world , and the human race along with it , for matters of high principle .
The highest principle , as we have seen above , is the destruction of communists , who are , at least implicitly and sometimes explicitly , identified with the devil and his agents upon earth .
And , after all , what does the destruction of the world matter when men's immortal souls will continue in eternal life ?
As the leading publicist of the New Right has said : " If I had to ' push the button , ' I would push it unswervingly , in the firm knowledge that I am in the right . "
Those who may balk at this blithe attitude toward world destruction are accused of being cowards , and atheistic cowards at that , for only atheists would cling so adamantly to " mere biological life " when great principle is at stake .
( Not being a Catholic , I will have to leave the theological refutation of this position to others ; I am surprised , however , to hear that mass suicide and mass murder are looked upon approvingly by the Church . )
Another curious justification is the famous " red or dead " dichotomy .
But in fact the stark choice of " red or dead " is just as unrealistic an alternative for America as the old " communist or fascist " choice posed by many of the Left in the 1930s .
There is at least one other choice : peaceful coexistence and joint nuclear disarmament .
Moreover , choosing death over redness is suicide , and one would have thought that suicide was a grave sin for Christians .
And finally this dichotomy allows no reference to the fact that approximately one billion people , now living in communist countries throughout the world , are choosing redness every day , by not committing suicide .
Is there no lesson here ?
Does it make any sense , furthermore , to destroy these people , and untold Americans along with them , thus to " liberate " those who have made their own personal choice for redness over death ?
Is it moral , or Christian , to change their choice from life to death by force ?
In short , is it moral , or Christian , for American conservatives to annihilate millions of Russians , Poles , etc. , to " liberate " through murder those who have already made their choice for life ?
Also implicit in the right - wing thesis is the view that the devil is omnipotent ; that once communism " takes over , " a country , it is doomed , and its population might as well be written off to the eternal abyss .
That this is a starkly pessimistic view of mankind is obvious ; and this is all the more curious in the light of the demonstrations by libertarian economists that socialism cannot provide a viable economic system for an industrial society .
It also studiously ignores the enormous changes that have taken place within communist countries since World War II , the considerable liberalization and even increased emphasis on private enterprise in Russia and many of the countries of eastern Europe .
Communist China 's recent expression of concern as to whether Yugoslavia is a socialist country is evidence enough of the alarm felt by communist fundamentalists at the unwilling but headlong retreat from socialism in that communist land .
It is also significant that not one right - wing economist or strategist has taken the trouble to consider the surely important question of how one would decommunize Russia if it should surrender to the American army — now or at any other time .
I believe that decommunization could be achieved , and in a way similar to , though much more thoroughgoing than , the path of Yugoslavia ; but the point is that the indifference to this problem on the Right is another indication of its central concern : nuclear war .
Decommunization is to come about , not through a change in the ideas and actions of the Russian and other peoples , but , according to the Right , through their liquidation .
Evidence of the right - wing subordination of all its other goals and principles to nuclear war against communists is overwhelming , and at every hand .
It lies at the root of the obscene eagerness with which the Right hurries to embrace every dictator , no matter how fascistic or bloodstained , who affirms his " anticommunism . "
William F. Buckley 's " libertarian " apologia for the fascist regime of South Africa in the pages of National Review is a case in point .
So is the enormous enthusiasm for Chiang - kai - Shek , for Franco , for Syngman Rhee , and — most recently — for Mme .
Nhu .
It is not simply that these dictators are welcomed reluctantly , for expediency 's sake in the " war against communism . "
The Right has proceeded , in its war hysteria , far beyond that point .
For now these dictators are better , since their policy is evidently far " harder " on communists and suspected communists than the policy of the democracies .
Mme .
Nhu , as a Catholic as well as a totalitarian , has touched the heart of every right - wing publicist .
There can be nothing " harder " on one 's subjects than repressing a religious majority and herding the peasants of the country into concentration camps in order to stave off " communism . "
The fact that this is hardly a better policy than communism itself makes no imprint whatever on a right wing that often likes to boast of itself as a " conservative - libertarian " movement .
It is tragically ironic and almost incredible that a movement which began , not too many years ago , in a passionate commitment to human liberty , should end as the cheering squad for a Mme .
Nhu .
Is it really too impolite to wonder how the right wing would now regard the man who was , in his day , the " hardest " and the " toughest " anticommunist of them all : Adolf Hitler ?
In domestic affairs , the free - market rhetoric has become simply that : after - dinner talk carrying no enthusiasm or true conviction .
Indeed , the promise of laissez - faire now performs the same function for the new American Right as the promise of unlimited abundance under communism did for Stalin .
While enslaving and exploiting the Soviet people , Stalin held out a splendid future of utopian abundance that would make current sacrifices worthwhile .
The present - day Right holds out the eventual promise of freedom and the free market after communists shall have been exterminated .
If there are any survivors emerging from their civil - defense shelters after the holocaust , they will presumably be allowed to engage in free - market activities , provided , of course , that some other " enemy " shall not have raised its head in the meanwhile .
This total subordination of all concerns to anticommunism accounts for all the otherwise inexplicable reversals on the Right .
Thus , the Supreme Court is now bitterly attacked for the opposite reasons as in the 1930s : because it prevents infringements of the state on the liberties of the person .
Justice Frankfurter , once assailed as a virtual advocate of tyranny , is now hailed by the Right for his sound , pragmatic conservatism in not interfering with anticommunist persecutions — the fruits , of course , of the selfsame juridical philosophy .
Social Democrats and New Dealers , such as the New Leader , Sidney Hook , Senator Dodd , George Meany , and others are embraced for their " hard anticommunism . "
The New Leader 's collaboration with the right wing in publishing a pro-Chiang propaganda article is indicative of this change in atmosphere , a change that alters all the old categories of " right " and " left " that are still unthinkingly used in political discourse .
It is instructive , finally , to consider the political concerns of Young Americans for Freedom , virtually the political - action arm of National Review .
To my knowledge , not one political - action drive of YAF has been directed to an increase of individual liberty or of the free - market ; stressed instead have been such items as perpetuating and strengthening HUAC , calls for blockade — and more — of Cuba , opposition to the test - ban treaty , restoring prayer to the public school , and advocacy of local ordinances and " card - parties " coercively interfering with the right of stores to sell goods from communist countries — hardly a contribution to a free market .
I believe there is only one exception to this generalization : an eager enthusiasm for the Mitchell program to reduce relief payments in Newburgh , New York , an enthusiasm that may not have been unrelated to the racial issue involved .
Coterminous with the political transformation of the American Right has come a philosophical transformation , and I do not believe that the two are unconnected .
The latter greatly bolsters and perpetuates the former .
The positive positions of the various conservative thinkers vary greatly ; but they all unite in determined opposition to human reason , to individual liberty , to separation of church and state , to all the things that characterized the classical liberal position and its modern extension .
There is , unfortunately , no space here for a full discussion of the current conservative position : but basically it is a return to the essential principles of early 19th - century conservatism .
We must realize that the great fact of modern history was the classical liberal revolution against the old order , a " revolution " that expressed itself in many forms : laissez - faire economics , individual liberty , separation of church and state , free trade and international peace , opposition to statism and militarism .
Its great embodiments were the three great revolutions of the late 18th century : the Industrial Revolution , the American Revolution , and the French Revolution .
Each , in its way , was part of the general classical - liberal revolution against the old order .
Conservatism emerged , in France , Britain , and elsewhere in Europe , as a conscious , reactionary attempt to smash this revolution and to restore the old order even more systematically than it had been installed before .
The essence of that order may be summed up in the famous phrase " Throne and Altar . "
In short , the old order consisted of a ruling oligarchy of despotic king and royal bureaucracy , aided by feudal landlords and a state church , Anglican or Gallican .
It was an order , as explicated by conservatives , that stressed the overriding importance of " community " — as embodied in the state , of theocratic union of church and state , of the virtues of nationalism and war , of coerced " morality " and of the denigration of the individual subject .
And philosophically , reason was derided in behalf of pure faith in ruling tradition .
At first it might seem that this old conservatism is irrelevant to American conservatism today , but I do not believe this to be true .
It is true that an American conservative has difficulty finding a legitimate monarch in America .
But he does the best he can ; the current American right wing is , for one thing , highly enamored of European monarchy , and there is much enthusiasm for restoration of the Hapsburgs .
One leading proto-Catholic conservative still toasts " the King over the water , " and Frederick Wilhelmsen apparently regards the Crown of St. Stephen as the summit of Western civilization .
Russell Kirk , in turn , seems to prefer the Tory squirearchy of Anglican England .
At every hand , Metternich , the Stuarts , and the later Burke have replaced libertarians as historical heroes .
But a king for the United States is , of course , a bit difficult , and conservatives have had to content themselves with makeshifts : with the restoration to historiographical favor , for example , of such statists as Alexander Hamilton , and of solicitude for the peculiar institution of slavery in the South .
Willmoore Kendall has found in Congress the apotheosis of conservatism , and asserts not only the right , but the duty of the Greek community to preserve itself from the irritating probing of Socrates .
Everywhere on the Right the " open society " is condemned , and a coerced morality affirmed .
God is supposed to be put back into government .
Free speech is treated with suspicion and distrust , and the military are hailed as the greatest patriots , and conscription strongly upheld .
Western imperialism is trumpeted as the proper way to deal with backward peoples , and pilgrimages are made to Franco 's Spain for inspiration in governmental forms .
And , at every side , reason is denigrated , and faith in tradition and custom held up as the proper path for man .
It is true that most modern conservatives do not , like their forebears , wish to destroy the industrial system and revert to small farms and happy handicraftsmen — although there is a strong strain of even this idea in contemporary conservatism .
But , basically , the current conservatives are supremely indifferent to a free - market economy ; they do not blanch at the vast economic distortions imposed by arms contracts or at crippling restrictions on foreign trade , and they could not tolerate a budget cut that would reduce America 's military posture in the world .
In fact , such leading conservatives as Ernest van den Haag and Willmoore Kendall have been frankly Keynesian in economics .
In the end , all must be subordinated to the state ; as William F. Buckley has affirmed : " Where reconciliation of an individual 's and the government 's interests cannot be achieved , the interests of the government shall be given exclusive consideration . "
One observer of the conservative movement has commented , " How 's that for laissez - faire ? " Indeed .
Above all , the modern conservative program reduces to dragooning the American people , under the control of the current American version of Throne and Altar , into lockstep uniformity and a closed society dedicated to the overriding end of destroying communism , even at the expense of nuclear annihilation .
What of the old libertarian segment of the Right ?
Largely they have been submerged in the transformation of the right wing , generally because they have not had articulate spokesmen explaining to them the nature and magnitude of what has taken place .
They have largely been bemused by the pervasive idea that there is , in some strong sense , a joint " conservative - libertarian movement , " and that no matter how much conservatives may diverge from liberty , they are the libertarian 's natural allies — at the same end of the spectrum , and at the polar opposite from socialism .
But this idea suffers from the " cultural lag " that we have observed .
The Old Right may have been the natural ally of the laissez - faire libertarian , but this is not at all true of the new .
The libertarian needs , perhaps most of all , to be informed by history , and to realize that conservatism was always the polar opposite of classical liberalism .
Socialism , in contrast , was not the polar opposite of either , but rather , in my view , a muddled and irrationally contradictory mixture of both liberalism and conservatism .
For socialism was essentially a movement to come to terms with the industrial revolution , to try to achieve liberal ends by the use of collectivistic , conservative means .
It tried to achieve the ideals of peace , freedom , and a progressing standard of living by using the collectivist , organicist , hierarchical means of conservatism as adapted to industrial society .
As a middle - of - the - road doctrine , it is easy for socialism , once it abandoned the liberal ideals of peace and freedom , to shift completely to the conservative pole in the many varying forms of " national socialism . "
Mr. Frank S. Meyer , the leading proponent of a fused " conservative - libertarian movement , " has called upon us to ignore the 19th century , " heir to the disruption of the French Revolution , " and to go back beyond " the parochial disputes of the 19th century . "
Such a course would indeed be convenient for Meyer 's thesis , as it would sweep away the whole meaning of the liberal and conservative movements .
For the point is that both liberalism and conservatism ( and socialism as well ) found their form and their doctrine precisely in the 19th century , as a result of the struggles between the old order and the new .
It is precisely by focusing on the history of the 19th century that we learn of the true origins of the various " isms " of our day , as well as the illogical and mythical nature of the attempted " conservative - libertarian " fusion .
There are some signs , indeed , that from various sides , thinkers are beginning to apprehend the dissolution of the old forms , the obsolescence of the old " left " and " right " stereotypes in American politics , and the invalidity of a fusion of libertarians with an old conservatism redivivus .
Libertarians are beginning to protest ; in the pages of New Individualist Review , the outstanding student journal of the Right , Ronald Hamowy , one of its editors in chief , has , in a well - known article , bitterly attacked the conservative philosophy and politics of Buckley and National Review .
Dean Benjamin Rogge of Wabash College has contributed a thoughtful critique of the new conservatism , and Howard Buffett has called for an end to conscription .
But New Individualist Review was basically founded in commitment to the conservative - libertarian mythos , and it clearly suffers from being mired in this inner contradiction .
Robert LeFevre , head of the libertarian Freedom School , in a trenchant leaflet , Those Who Protest , has pointed out and attacked the transformation of the right wing .
And from a different direction , the noted critic Edmund Wilson has now raised his powerful voice to protest both The Cold War and the Income Tax .
Perhaps indeed , the country is ripe for a fundamental ideological realignment .

The bear population has grown in Kashmir in recent times
A bear killed two militants after discovering them in its den in Indian - administered Kashmir , police say .
Two other militants escaped , one of them badly wounded , after the attack in Kulgam district , south of Srinagar .
The militants had assault rifles but were taken by surprise - police found the remains of pudding they had made to eat when the bear attacked .
It is thought to be the first such incident since Muslim separatists took up arms against Indian rule in 1989 .
Bodies found
The militants had made their hideout in a cave which was actually the bear 's den , said police officer Farooq Ahmed .
The dead have been identified as Mohammad Amin alias Qaiser , and Bashir Ahmed alias Saifullah .
News of the attack emerged when their injured comrade went to a nearby village for treatment .
" Word spread in the village that Qaiser had been killed by the bear , " another police officer said .
A joint party of the police and army personnel went into the forest and collected the bodies of the two militants .
Police say they also recovered two Kalashnikov assault rifles and some ammunition from the hideout .
Animal attacks
Wildlife experts say the conflict in Kashmir has actually resulted in an increase in the population of bears and leopards .
Following the outbreak of the insurgency people had to hand in their weapons to police - which put a halt to poaching .
As a result , there has been a greater incidence of man-animal conflict , say experts .
There have been many reports of bears and leopards killing or mauling humans in different parts of the Kashmir valley in recent years .
Three years ago , residents of Mandora village near the southern town of Tral , beat a black bear to death which had strayed into the village .
The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday 15 November 2009
We reported below that the Kalahari desert in Namibia was under threat from the expansion of uranium mining .
The Kalahari covers eastern Namibia , Botswana and northern South Africa .
The new mining projects currently planned in Namibia are further west in the Namib desert , in the area of the Namib - Naukluft National Park .
The hidden cost of Britain 's new generation of nuclear power could be the destruction of the Kalahari desert in Namibia and millions of tonnes of extra greenhouse gas emissions a year , the Observer has discovered .=
The desert , with its towering sand dunes and spectacular lunar - like landscapes , is at the centre of an international uranium rush led by Rössing Uranium , a subsidiary of the British mining giant Rio Tinto , and the French state - owned company , Areva , which part - manages the nuclear complex at Sellafield and wants to build others in Britain .
Tomorrow , Ed Miliband , the energy secretary , will release a batch of plans covering every aspect of Britain 's strategy to replace its ageing nuclear power stations .
The documents are expected to set out the government 's case on the need for nuclear power , based on the demand for secure , low - carbon energy supplies , the suitable sites and designs for new reactors , and how the decommissioning and safe storage of radioactive waste can be guaranteed .
It is not expected to consider the source of the fuel needed for the new reactors .
But Rössing is expanding its existing giant mine – which already provides nearly 8 % of the world 's uranium – into the Namib - Naukluft national park .
Areva has leased hundreds of square kilometres of the desert near Trekkopje , where it plans to build one of the world 's largest uranium mines .
At least 20 other mining companies from the UK , Canada , Russia , China , Japan , South Korea and elsewhere have also been given licences to explore thousands of square kilometres of the national park and its surrounds , and six new mines , several of which would be in the park , are at the development stage .
Namibia has some of the planet 's richest uranium deposits and expects to become the third largest uranium producer and largest exporter within five years .
The mines are all expected to be in open pits up to 200 metres below the desert sands .
With their waste heaps , acid plants and giant slurry ponds , they will extend over hundreds of square kilometres .
" Large areas of the desert will be inevitably devastated , " says Bertchen Kohrs , director of the Namibian environment group Earthlife .
" They will do immense damage .
We fear that there will be major contamination of the ground water supplies . "
Britain 's claims that a new generation of nuclear power will be low - carbon are also dented by the Namibian government 's plans to build a coal - fired power station to provide electricity for the mines .
This will use more than 2.4 m tonnes of coal a year from South Africa , and could produce more than 10 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions a year .
The UK has justified its planned expansion of nuclear power partly on the basis that it provides low - emission energy .
However , the energy used in drilling , blasting , excavating , separating and transporting the uranium to Britain are not taken into account .
Documents seen by the Observer suggest the mines would initially consume about 53 million cubic metres of water a year , more than 75 % of the water presently supplied by the Namibian state water company .
The water will need to be pumped more than 56 km to the mines from the coast .
The proposed expansion of the uranium mining would create mountains of waste radioactive sand .
But an Areva spokesman said : " Our post - mining decommissioning plan will ensure that most of the Trekkopje mining area will return to its former wilderness state .
The technical process applied to extract the ore will not cause any pollution to the underground water .
The desalination plant will be powered by electricity produced from different sources , including non-CO 2 - emitting sources such as hydroelectricity . "
Rio Tinto said it was addressing the carbon emissions of the mining operations .
" Rössing has a greenhouse gas management plan to minimise emissions through improved energy efficiency , " said a spokesman .
The demands of global warming and energy security will increase in intensity in the future , and many nations are turning to nuclear power for the solution : more than 450 new nuclear reactors are currently planned around the world .
As a result , the outlook for uranium demand remains strong , as does the economic future of the Rössing mine .

Previous | Next Surrogate Father Posted at : 2009-10-20 12:39:28 From
Me to ************@***********.org :
Hello ,
I saw your ad looking for surrogate mothers , and was wondering if you had any openings for a surrogate father .
I am willing to sacrifice my body for families who cannot have a child .
I would get the sperm intended for the surrogate mother inserted into my balls , and then impregnate the surrogate mother through passoniate intercourse , to assure that the baby is conceived in a more natural environment .
Nobody wants a freak petri dish baby as their child .
I saw that compensation was $ 25,000 for the mother .
Since I am doing all of the hard work , however , I am asking for $ 50,000 as compensation .
Also , the surrogate mother must fit the following criteria :
- 18 to 24 years old
- Brunette or Blonde ( no redheads )
- Not too short , but not taller than me because that is just weird
- Breast size of C cup or larger
- Not fat
- She must shave " down there "
- STD free ( although chlamydia is okay because I already have that )
I look forward to hearing from you .
If possible , please send a list of potential surrogate mothers for me to knock up , and include pictures .
I will get back to you with who I want to impregnate first .
Thanks ,
Mike
From Mary ********* to Me :
Mike ,
There is no " surrogate father " program .
Sorry .
Mary *********
From Me to Mary *********:
Mary ,
Surely there are some fathers who would want this .
Just ask your clients if they would be interested in my services .
I am sure you will get a positive response .
I forgot to mention that any potential surrogate mothers you have for me must be willing to do anal .
Thanks ,
Mike
From Mary ********* to Me :
What is wrong with you ?
Let me be very clear : there will never be a surrogate father program .
One can't simply get another 's sperm placed in their " balls . "
Frankly , your demands are disgusting and you are making a mockery of our program .
Do not contact me again .
From Me to Mary *********:
Oh , come on .
What demands were disgusting ?
The anal sex ?
Studies show that women are 75 % more likely to get pregnant if they take it in the ass first .
Believe me , this is not about the sex for me .
I just want to help our country 's most precious resource : our children .
They are our future , you know .
You hate children , do n't you ?
By refusing my services , you may as well be working at an abortion clinic .
Please reconsider ,
Mike Previous | Next Share Showing comments 1 - 25 .

From the app's creator :
iSinglePayer , an iPhone application that advocates for single - payer health care reform was rejected from the App Store by Apple because it is " politically charged . "
The application displays charts and bullet points about single - payer health care systems , and it allows users to call members of congress .
iSinglePayer even calculates your local congressperson using GPS , and displays the amount of money donated to each congressperson from the health sector .
The application was submitted on August 21 and rejected on September 26 , more than five weeks after it was submitted .
Most applications take 10 - 14 days to approve .
The rejection was made over the phone by a representative from Apple .
The representative explained that the application was " politically charged " and was rejected for this reason .
Apple informed Floatopian ( which is pretty much just me ) that iSinglePayer was rejected in part because it was the product of a lone developer .
There are applications developed for particular political candidates , like the official Obama application , but since those have the official support of a politician they are acceptable .
When a single developer wants to voice his opinions , Apple censors it .
Obligatory apologies for brevity , but this one just pegged my dumb - o- meter , and it 's already inspired a physician backlash , from the Mad as Hell docs that ebgill wrote of this morning :
Leaving Chicago on our way to Toledo .
Ca n't believe the black out of Single Payer on all levels .
The dark clouds thicken as we head closer to corporate occupied territory .
Please go to your nearest Apple store and tie a white ribbon on it .
They have censored our movement and shown a new side to their business .
Think different indeed .

Casual games are n’t just for the “ casual gamer ” anymore .
And it ’s difficult to ignore when classic titles like Bomberman , Mega Man and Frogger have re-entered the stage with help from the Apple iPhone ; they ’ve exploded , blasted , and even hopped straight onto the palm of your hand .
It ’s like your childhood all over again , save for the blowing of the cartridge and angry hurls of the controller .
And as this resurgence continues , one can’t help but wonder : why are more and more publishers beginning to create a large presence in the casual games department ?
Enter Jon Kromrey , the General Manager of the Apple division at Namco Networks .
Prior to his position at this company , he has worked at Apple , Eidos Interactive , iPlay , Namco Hometek , and several other companies — his roles primarily engaged in productions .

“ It ’s popular and it appeals to carriers , ” answers Kromrey .
But he does n’t simply aim to resurrect old favorites in hopes of hitting an established audience .
Namco Networks has plans for “ brand new things ” and games that are “ newly licensed . ”
Many of the employees at Namco Networks have history at Apple and EA , further adding quality to casual games that are sometimes ridiculed by a more core audience .
Professionals with experience at console publishers are n’t afraid to get their feet wet in the casual market .
Why is this ?
Because the casual market is rapidly growing .
Because creating an iPhone application is significantly less expensive and is sometimes more effective than creating a full - scale console game .
And most importantly — because more than 21 million people own an iPhone .
“ It ’s like watching the stock market .
You move when the market moves , ” says Kromrey .
He has mentioned once before that Apple ’s mobile platform represents a “ gold rush ” that ca n’t be missed .
Several thousand iPhone apps are submitted every week .
The sales channels are open and it ’s time to supply the demand , especially when almost everyone is willing to play .
Mr. Kromrey was kind enough to reveal a new game being released on the iPhone .
Worst Case Scenario is an iPhone game that takes after the book of the same title .
Players will be put into a tough situation ( for example , being encountered by a mountain lion ) , and will then be given choices of what action to take .
You gain points depending on how rational your choices are .
The game is essentially a much more interactive version of the book , and would appeal not only to fans of the already - established brand , but also to those who are fans of Darwinism .
Casual ?
Yes .
Exclusively for “ casual ” gamers ?
Not at all .
Unfortunately , I had a very limited amount of time with the game ( I ’m talking about close to 2 - 3 minutes ) , and am unable to give you my full - fledged take on it .
In fact , I ca n’t even give you a screen shot .
However , if you ’d like to learn more about it , it seems that the game is already a part of Namco Networks ’ mobile division .
Lastly , to answer a reader ’s question — yes , Kromrey is well aware that Soulcalibur >
Tekken .
This is because Kromrey had actually worked on the game .
He provided no official comment on such games appearing on the iPhone , but he did mention that there are many problems that arise when trying to develop those titles .
On a flat touch screen , it ’s difficult to get the perfect controls , and even more difficult to do a move that requires a quick movement .
He was kind enough to throw us a bone , however , claiming , “ I think it ’s just a matter of time . ”
While some gamers are adamant on playing only the action - packed , smoothest - looking , million - dollar budget games with no less than a hundred billion pixels per frame , casual games appear to be taking it back to the basics .
And when iPhone apps and PC downloads are available at a fraction of the cost — what ’s there to argue ?
If you ever find yourself in the forests of Ecuador , you may have the good fortune of spotting a club - winged manakin .
The closest the rest of us will probably ever get will be to watch this video .
But do n't just watch it .
Listen .
If you said to yourself , " Hold on , is that bird singing with its wings ? " the answer is yes .
As I wrote in this 2005 article in the New York Times , ornithologists have long known that a few species of manakins can make sounds with their wings .
The sounds are produced by the males , as part of their courtship displays .
Some make firecracker pops , and some make whooshing sounds .
Darwin pointed to the sounds of manakin wings as evidence of just how much sexual selection could transform male animals as females were attracted to some mates over others .
But no one had any idea how manakins could make noises with feathers until Kimberly Bostwick of Cornell and her colleagues tackled the question .
Bostwick took a high - speed camera into the jungle to film club - winged manakins .
It turns out the birds flap their wings 100 times a second , far faster than typical birds .
Later , she closely examined museum specimens .
Club - winged manakins have one peculiar wing feather with a stiff , curved tip , right next to one with a series of ridges .
Bostwick and her colleagues proposed that curved tips raked across the ridges on the neighboring feather like a spoon pulled across a washboard , producing the bird 's 1500 - cycle - per - second sound .
Biologists are quite familiar with this way of making sound -- but in crickets and other insects .
Typically , they draw their legs across ridges on their exoskeleton , making their bodies resonate in a process called stridulation .
Bostwick and her colleagues were proposing , for the first time , that a vertebrate could stridulate , too .
Since Bostwick published her first paper on the birds , she 's continued to study them to test her hypothesis .
In a paper just published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , she and her colleagues report a new experiment in which they looked at the physics of the manakin feathers .
They clamped the feathers in a device known as a vibration mini- shaker , and then - - well , as you can guess -- shook them .
The scientists bounded lasers off the feathers to track their wiggles as the mini- shaker vibrated faster and faster .
They used the device first to measure the special spoon - and - washboard pair of feathers .
Then they measured how other feathers responded , and then , finally , they studied a set of ordinary and spoon - and - washboard feathers joined together on a ligament .
The scientists found that the spoon - and - washboard feathers resonated at about 1500 cycles , just as Bostwick had predicted back in 2005 .
The unmodified feathers on other parts of the wing , however , showed no such response when the scientists shook them one by one .
But when they shook the spoon - and - washboard feathers together with seven neighboring wing feathers , the entire set resonated strongly at 1500 cycles .
As you can see in this video , the club - winged manakin moves its entire wings upward before flapping .
Bostwick proposes that the spoon - and - washboard feathers create a 1500 - cycle sound , which the entire wing amplifies .
This special kind of stridulation is not totally unique -- the Australian whistling moth whistles by clicking castanet - like organs together , causing its entire wings to resonate .
What is unique , however , is the evolution of feathers into such a sophisticated sound system .
Brody Mullins and T.W. Farnam report on money and politics .
Washington ’s single biggest lobbying group has grown a whole lot bigger .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent a record a record $ 34.7 million to lobby the government in July , August and September , according to a hefty lobbying disclosure report filed today .
That ’s more than $ 300,000 a day .
The Chamber ’s expenditures on lobbying were five times more than it spent on lobbying in the previous three months – and 68 % more than the then - record $ 20.6 million it spent in the same period last year .
Tita Freeman , a Chamber spokeswoman , said the group has spent so much on lobbying because “ Congress has taken on the most complex and significant issues that our country faces ” including health care , climate change and new regulations on Wall Street .
“ We felt we needed to get our voice heard , ” she said .
By comparison , UPS reported spending $ 4.4 million on lobbying during the third - quarter , General Dynamics reported $ 2.5 million and Koch Industries reported $ 2.1 million .
Forget the Audit : Just Go Ahead & Abolish the Federal Reserve By Jim Traficant ON MARCH 17 , 1993 , I addressed the House of Representatives in one of the many “ budget ” debates .
Over the past 16 years , many publications and books have reprinted my speech .
They viewed my speech as being on target .
Researchers have written to me regarding the speech , confused because it was printed in two areas of the Congressional Record .
My floor remarks were brief , but I inserted the entire speech into the “ extension of remarks ” section of the record .
Nevertheless , the speech stands today as prophetic .
America is bankrupt , and it ’s growing worse by the day .
The U.S. government was technically dissolved by the “ Emergency Banking Act ” of March 9 , 1933 .
THAT ’S A FACT .
If you have any doubt , just look around .
Foreclosures and unemployment run rampant .
The dollar is dropping so low it could fit under a closed door with a top hat on , yet every day the mainstream media is trying to convince us that the recession is over .
Who ’s kidding whom ?
If you take Social Security and Medicare out of our economy , it ’s a full - blown depression — a total belly - up depression .
The real rub emanates from the fact that the “ trustees ” who preside over U.S. bankruptcy are the international bankers , via the United Nations , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
I proclaim that all U.S. offices , officials and departments are now operating within a de facto status in name only under “ Emergency War Power . ”
Our constitutional form of government was technically dissolved and replaced by a so - called “ democracy , ” a government in actuality being a socialist - communist order under a new governor for America .
You must be thinking that I ’ve lost my marbles by now — I do n’t blame you .
But , here come the facts .
This chicanery occurred when authority was transferred and placed in the Office of the Secretary of Treasury under the governor of the International Monetary Fund .
[ Public Law 94 -564 ] .
In essence , the dollar was changed from a “ promise to pay a dollar in silver or gold ” to a “ federal reserve note . ”
Now think about it : the dollar became a “ promise , ” not “ money . ”
The U.S. dollar is a debt instrument , nothing more than another debt obligation of the American people .
And where is this obligation to be paid ?
You probably guessed it , to the Federal Reserve Bank .
Let ’s tell it like it is .
Federal Reserve notes are literally unsigned checks written on a closed account .
It ’s nothing more than inflatable paper creating more debt through inflation every time our currency is devalued .
Truth is , inflation is actually another tax ; invisible , never seen , but a tax just the same .
I do n’t know about you , but I always thought that a “ contract ” under common law is only valid if it involves an exchange of some “ good and valuable consideration . ”
If that ’s not enough to frost your pumpkins , check this out :
The Federal Reserve System is a sovereign power structure separate and distinct from the U.S. government .
It is in fact , a private corporation .
We , the people of these United States , owe this private corporation consisting of international bankers a mountain of debt .
The collateral on this debt is our very own homes and properties .
We the people are nothing more than tenants and sharecroppers , renting our own property from the Federal Reserve Bank .
Most Americans are mortgaged to the hilt with few or no assets , working harder and profiting less , constantly in debt to a private corporation they know little or nothing about .
BEAM ME UP .
This has gone on way too long — WAKE UP AMERICA .
This is nothing more than economic slavery to a bunch of international fat cats .
Our Constitution has been turned upside down , violated and discarded like toilet paper .
Unbelievable .
It ’s not rocket science folks — CONGRESS SHALL COIN MONEY , so mandates the Constitution .
It ’s very clear to me : the Federal Reserve System should be abolished , not just audited so the politicians can feel good , but abolished .
Enough is enough .
In closing I say “ audit this . ”
Next week — AIPAC .
You do n’t want to miss it .

( Issue # 46 , November 16 , 2009 )
This is a story about a project which found 40 million children who did n't officially exist .
A campaign that , over four years and across three continents and 32 countries , has helped to protect hundreds of thousands of children in danger of being trafficked , and girls as young as 12 being forced into illegal marriages – and it is now also saving untold numbers of unborn girls from being aborted because they are the " wrong sex " .
It is that very rare thing : a global good news story .
It is a mission to give millions of children in the developing world something that is taken for granted in Britain : the registration of their birth and , with it , an official existence .
Before the campaign – mounted by the international children 's charity Plan – there were parts of the world where registration was rare .
In Cambodia , for instance , as late as 2005 96 per cent of the population went unregistered .
Without registration , there can be no birth certificate , no identity card , no passport , no proof of age or parentage .
Thus , millions are at increased risk of being press - ganged as child soldiers or prostitutes , of not being returned to their families if liberated , of having only limited access to healthcare and education , and being deprived of their legal rights .
The problem , Plan realised some years ago , was a cause of immense human misery , and so it launched the Count Every Child scheme .
Its ambition was the registration at birth of every baby in the world .
In a report published tomorrow , Plan tells the remarkable story of how it registered 40 m citizens .
In some countries , it has transformed registration rates , and pressured governments to waive the costs of logging a birth .
The result is that a further 153 million people are now eligible for free registration .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yet the task remains colossal .
According to Unicef , 51 m children born every year do not officially exist .
In some rural communities in Asia , Africa and Latin America , more than 90 per cent of children are not registered at birth .
In a conference tomorrow in London , Desmond Tutu and the Slumdog Millionaire actor Anil Kapoor will appeal to governments and non-governmental organisations to learn from , and repeat , Plan 's unprecedented success .
Why is registration so low ?
A lack of awareness among parents and communities , a fear of persecution through identification , no money , poor public transport and illiteracy all work together to stop parents registering their children .
And poorly trained registrars and inadequate registration systems are widespread .
There are an estimated 300,000 child soldiers fighting wars around the world .
While a birth certificate cannot prevent a child from being kidnapped and forced to fight , it is a vital tool in efforts to reunite rescued children with their families .
In Uganda , where the birth registration system collapsed , children rescued from the Lord 's Resistance Army often wait months while officials try to track down their villages and families .
And prosecutions against abductors will only succeed if there is proof that the alleged child soldiers were children when recruited .
One lawyer in the Philippines said 50 per cent of cases involving forced prostitution and child labour fail because a child does not have proof of age or identity .
Children can be trafficked within their own country or across borders and continents to work as domestic slaves , prostitutes or in cannabis factories .
In 2002 , Suborna , a seven - year - old from Bangladesh , was kidnapped and trafficked into India but was abandoned near a police checkpoint as her kidnappers fled .
She was taken in by a village leader but had no idea where she was from .
A local magistrate organised a radio announcement which her family heard , and her father travelled to India to collect her .
But the magistrate refused to release Suborna until he produced her birth certificate , which thankfully he had in Bangladesh .
Without this , Suborna may never have returned to her family .
A child who is arrested may be prosecuted as an adult if there is no proof of age .
A Vietnamese " woman " caught working in a brothel in Europe is likely to be deported as a criminal , whereas a 16 - year - old will be treated as a victim of kidnap , trafficking and forced labour , repatriated to her family or helped to seek asylum .

murder and rape .
But the country 's Birth Registration
Act , which came into force in 2006 mainly as a result of the campaign , has meant that 40 per cent of Bangladeshis have received a birth certificate , and another 30 per cent have been registered .
Workers focused on children living on the edges of society and helped more than 5 m , including 28,000 street children in Dhaka , to acquire official identities .
It is almost impossible for an unregistered adult to work legally , so they are forced to take low - paid , hazardous jobs or become involved in crime .
They may be unable to get a bank account or apply for a loan or benefits .
They may be unable to vote ; they will never pay tax .
A missing child becomes a lost adult .
Awawou , 18 , lives in a small village in East Mono , Togo .
Her father died shortly after her birth and her illiterate mother did not know about birth registration .
Because she was unregistered Awawou was turned down by the local school .
Though her grandmother finally convinced the headmaster to let her attend , she was unable to sit her final primary school exams and so could not continue her education ; the late birth registration fee in this west African country is nearly £ 7 , which her family could not afford .
Awawou has spent several years working in order to save enough money and has finally sat her exams .
She hopes to become a dressmaker .
So what did Plan do ?
It mobilised workers , volunteers , celebrities , communities and governments , using text messages , radio and TV advertising campaigns , and mobile registration trucks to change attitudes and beliefs , improve awareness , reduce costs and cut the distance people have to travel .
Simple stuff , but it worked .
When Plan started work in Cambodia less than 5 per cent of people were registered because , under the Pol Pot regime , many Cambodians destroyed their identity papers to try to avoid persecution .
But by working with whole villages to overcome these entrenched fears , by training officials , and undertaking a 10 - month mobile registration programme , an astounding 56 per cent of Cambodians now have a birth certificate and another 40 per cent are registered awaiting a certificate .
The abortion of female foetuses still occurs in countries such as India and China where boys are preferred for cultural or economic reasons .
This has distorted the gender balance in some areas ; in the Indian state of Bihar there are six girls for every 10 boys .
A pilot project in four Indian states monitors every pregnant woman until she gives birth and registers the child .
It will now be replicated by Unicef across four more states .
Identity documents are often destroyed or lost as people try to escape war or natural disaster .
After the Asian tsunami it was common for several traumatised parents to try to claim the same toddler from refugee camps , according to Nadya Kassam from Plan .
Matching up relatives with children who were trying to cope with the tsunami's devastation took months .
Plan has since provided plastic folders and laminated birth certificates for communities prone to natural disasters or war , such as Indonesia , Sri Lanka and Vietnam .
Pakistan :
How politicians and mullahs got the word out
Safdar Raza , 43 , from Islamabad , co-ordinated the universal birth registration campaign in northern Pakistan
" Even though in some parts of Pakistan birth registration has been common for a century , in the vast region of Malakand in the North - West Frontier province ( NWF ) , registration was at 0 per cent when we started .
Even if parents wanted to register , it was a big hassle .
People would have to travel 70 miles and pay 100 rupees ( 72 p ) , a lot of money here .
We started by training registrars – 3,400 across Pakistan and 987 locally .
We got the mullahs to make announcements about the importance of birth registration during Friday prayers , and we had the Prime Minister and other officials making announcements on the radio and TV , telling people that the government was waiving the fee for a year .
We then set up mobile registration units – Jeeps which could get to rural areas – and the registrars went with loudspeakers , encouraging people to come out .
Illiteracy is a big problem , so we would help people fill in the forms .
Between 2004 and 2008 we registered 1.7 million children in the NWF , including 500,000 in Malakand .
Nearly half of the children in the NWF now have a birth certificate ; the fee has been halved for ever .
Having no birth certificate has serious repercussions .
I heard of one man who divorced his wife and then claimed he was n't the father of his daughter .
Without a birth certificate this child will be treated as illegitimate and will not have access to education or marriage . "
Unity keeps growing in every respect ; not least our user community .
The Unity Forums get more and more users and we welcome them all !
Some of our users have expressed concern that the higher volume of posts will make the forums less valuable .
Specifically , they are concerned about the growing stream of new users who are thirsty for basic Unity knowledge and ask basic questions that have maybe been asked and answered many times before .
We understand the concern , and we want to support a more efficient way of asking questions and getting answers .
This is why we have launched UnityAnswers .
UnityAnswers is our new community site for asking questions and getting answers about Unity .
To quote the UnityAnswers FAQ :
UnityAnswers is a place for asking questions and finding answers – all about Unity !
UnityAnswers co-exist with the Unity Forums , but they have different functions : UnityAnswers is a place for questions that can be answered !
Avoid asking questions here that are subjective , argumentative , or require extended discussion .
Avoid asking questions here that are subjective , argumentative , or require extended discussion .
Unity Forums is a place for discussions , opinions , showing off your work , getting feedback , and general community chatter .
Why is UnityAnswers better than the forums for getting answers to questions ?
Because we ’ve seen it work on Stack Overflow .
It allows for people to vote on answers , making the best ones float to the top .
You can vote up good questions and helpful answers so they float to the top , while off - topic questions and less helpful answers are listed lower .
No more golden tips buried on page 5 of a thread !
The person who asks a question can also mark a specific answer as the accepted answer .
It ’s easier to find existing questions and answers .
The search function is actually good .
A great feature is that when you want to post a new question , you will be shown a list of possibly related existing questions as soon as you start typing your question title .
Maybe the question has already been asked before and you can just go see that one .
If an existing question is the same as you were having , be sure to vote it up !
If it has an answer that is also helpful to you , vote that answer up as well .
People who are more trusted by the community get more power !
Besides making the best questions and answers float up , the voting system also grants reputation points to you whenever other people vote up your questions or answers .
Reputation you can interpret as “ how much does the community trust you ” .
The more reputation points you get , the more things you are allowed to do .
( See the FAQ for details . )
At the high end of this reputation spectrum there is little difference between users with high reputation and moderators .
That is very much intentional .
We do n’t run UnityAnswers .
The community does .
What does this mean for the Unity Forums ?
The Unity Forums will co-exist with UnityAnswers .
The forums are great for discussions and chat , so we ’ll keep them all .
Some of the forums will be completely unaffected , such as Announcements , Collaboration , Gossip , and Showcase .
However , for some of the forums , we hope that the use pattern will change .
The forums Unity Support , Scripting , UnityGUI , Multiplayer Networking , iPhone Development , ShaderLab , and External Tools are primarily about questions and answers , so we hope that a large chunk of the volume in those will move to UnityAnswers instead .
Here ’s what you can do to help :
Use UnityAnswers !
If you have questions , ask them there instead of on the forums .
If you do n’t have questions , you can still help the community by browsing UnityAnswers regularly and see if there are any questions you can answer ( which will also earn you reputation ) .
Direct others to UnityAnswers !
If you see a question in the forum and you know the answer , rather than answering the question directly in the forum , try to answer it at UnityAnswers and link to there .
If a similar question already exists at UnityAnswers , just link to that .
( The search works nicely ! )
If it ’s already answered , great !
You do n’t have to .
If not , you can post your answer there .
Otherwise you can just create the question there – you can even copy the question from the forum directly .
After that , you can answer the question yourself , which is perfectly ok .
We know this is a bit more work short - term , but think of the long - term benefits !
Your answer will be much easier to find at UnityAnswers than in the forums .
It wo n’t be buried and never found again after a few months .
UnityAnswers is still very new and we ’re in the process of getting properly used to it , but we already like it quite a bit and we hope you will too !
To login , you can use any OpenID provider , or use your forum account .
On the login page , just click on the Unity logo .
JORDAN JELEV
E VERY SO OFTEN , THE mail carrier arrives with another bottle of wine , another gift from a client for a job well done .
Jordan Jelev opens the box , unwraps the wine , and studies the label .
The wine label is his canvas , a place where he transforms his design and lettering into hand - crafted works of art .
Jelev , a designer from Bulgaria , has earned a reputation for his excellent wine labels — his nickname is The Labelmaker — but his work goes beyond labels .
Lately , he has been experimenting with different approaches , different tools , and different styles .
Making letters has become his work , his play , his obsession , his passion .
The free bottles of wine are n’t bad , either .
“ Yes , I am a dedicated wine drinker , though I consider myself a total amateur in this field , ” Jelev says in an email , adding his usual at the end .
The fact that Jordan Jelev is making letters at all is something of an upset .
He graduated with an Economics degree and was preparing for a career as an accountant or bookkeeper .
He probably would n’t have discovered lettering had his father and wife not given him a set of automatic pens and some pen nibs as a surprise gift .
“ I do not know how it happened — seriously .
It just happened , ” Jelev says .
“ I think I will have to kill myself if I had to work according to my education … a bookkeeper , for example .
Funny — could not stand it . ”
We communicated via e-mail over the past few months for this Q & A .
How would you describe your fascination with letterform ?
For me , letters are maybe one of the most interesting things and phenomenons in the world .
I mean it because I see it everyday in my work and in my life .
It ’s a real miracle to express yourself with writing …to make a long , long swash when you are happy and a short , sharp stroke if you are
angry .
Calligraphy gives you a true chance to be what you want to be , to be yourself , to free your emotions , and your senses .
And if it is really good , people can read it .
You ’ve received a lot of attention for your work on wine bottles .
How ’d you get involved and what do you like about that medium ?
It all began some 13 years ago .
I started working for www.factor-r.net and the studio already had some wine clients I started with .
Then , I made my own style of how to make labels and packages and the
number of clients grew bigger and bigger .
Of course , there is no need to say that a large part of my wine labels is based on calligraphy , or sometimes my whole label is totally hand - crafted .
The calligraphy itself makes my labels more distinguished , more recognizable .
It is really hard to find one that uses custom lettering in the 21st Century — instead of a large amount of digital fonts .
Anyway , I am addicted to calligraphy .
It gives life , color and emotion to my work .
It all looks different , and here , in my country , almost everyone knows it is done by me .
How did you make the switch from Economics to design and lettering ?
Well this happens here really often — you can see a doctor driving a cab , or an engineer selling tomatoes .
My case is not exactly like those I mention above …
Here is the situation :
After finishing my service at the Navy in March of 1996 , I had three things of importance :
1. I got my discipline in the Army .
2. I wanted to get a good education .
3 . I already had the experience of graphic design and pre-press while doing everything around the Navy newspaper Morski Dnevnik
So having 1,2,3 on my mind , I decided that an Economics degree will be good for me in the future , and on the other hand , I was totally convinced I would have to both study and work .
I started working at Zograph Studio from 1996 to 1998 — there I had my experience with pre-press , graphic design , typography , some different machines like several imagesetters , etc .
And while being a student in Economics , I began to realize I had some extra powers as a graphic designer and even pre-presser .
In fact , the truth is that I am popular as a graphic designer , but I have remarkable experience in the pre-press field and in offset - and flexo - printing that I keep a secret , though some of my colleagues know it .
Your secret is out .
Yes .
They use me as an adviser on some difficult projects .
So I saw that my skills are in graphic design and I started developing them .
Now , I do not even know where my diploma is .
I think it is somewhere in a drawer at my office , but I do not think I would try to find it .
Was your family disappointed you did n’t stick with Economics ?
Nobody was disappointed , because it was quite obvious I had a lot to show in the field of design and less as an accountant .
So nobody got disappointed and nobody ever thought to give me directions in my life — I have made a choice and I followed it on my own .
So as a designer , you are self - taught ?
Yes , completely self - taught .
What is Bulgaria like for design ?
That is a long conversation .
We should make a separate one for this question exclusively .
I wish there was a better design climate here and because of some regional exceptions here , I do believe the situation will change in the near future .
Where did you look for design inspiration ?
Well , I started to look at what others do .
In 2000 , there was almost nothing to inspire me , except my friend Dimitar Traychev .
In fact he is an inspiration for a whole generation in Bulgaria , I think … but that ’s a long story too .
He is a very interesting person !
You are also following in the footsteps of Luca Pacioli , right ?
Luca Pacioli was the father of double - entry accounting , but in fact , he was an artist .
He even designed his own typeface .
So I am not an exception — seems there is some strange liaison between
Economics , calligraphy and design .
You ’re learning more new techniques and styles and pushing yourself in different mediums .
Why is that important to you ?
I think I would never stop learning more and more .
For me , that is the only way to find myself , my mood , my emotions — it is something like fitness , but not for your muscles , but for your soul .
I ’ve always had some crazy ideas , some of them already seen , but I think I have far more to learn from now on .
Your work has been evolving , from Blackletter to Islamic calligraphy .
Can you explain the connection ?
Yes , I mix them … there is a close relationship between those two writing styles .
I think the origins of Blackletter are in the Islamic culture .
I do believe this is true .
I am a Blackletter addict .
This inspires me really a lot — every letter is a unique logo .
I can write Blackletter every day .
This love of mine led me to follow Islamic calligraphy , Persian especially … and I found for myself the relationships between gothics , Islamic writing , and those artistic strokes we can find in graffiti…it is all same thing , same culture ,
same vision , spread over several centuries of history .
Who are some of the calligraphers who have inspired you ?
There are two great guys that give me a lot of inspiration every time I look at their works —
Hassan Massoudy and Julien Breton .
I love their work and I am learning from them — it ’s like trying to play
something from Mozart , Beethoven , etc. , but in calligraphy .
I am trying to get to their level and style and from this state , to generate my own calligraphy .
You ’ve been experimenting a lot with rice paper .
What attracted you to
this texture , and how has that been working out ?
Well here , the most interesting things are :
1 . The ink stays really wet on the paper , and makes small ink spots on it , which basically forms the texture inside the letters .
2 . You can use a backlight to make your calligraphy glow , which I found is really interesting and really simple to do .
Just put a lamp behind it and everything changes .
Can you explain Asemic calligraphy for those who might not know what that is ?
Asemic calligraphy is a group in Flickr I came upon a few months ago and I loved this name .
Asemic stands for means nothing — strokes , letters , swashes , moods , gestures — it is just calligraphy that means nothing and could mean anything .
What different tools and ink that you use for your different types of calligraphy ?
I do not use so many tools as it possibly looks .
I use a thick paper nib , or a wood nib for the wide strokes .
I often use bayonette nibs , copperplate nibs , oblique pen holder …. what else , automatic pens ,
coit pens…and a pilot parallel pen thanks to my friend Maxim Ivanov .
And I sometimes use some strange tools like pipette , chopsticks , and many others .
I have recently started working with acrylic ink for airbrush of Pebeo — Julien Breton advised me so .
But I mostly use Windsor and Newtone inks
and Talens Ecoline .
Recently , you collaborated on a typeface with FontFabric .
Yes .
It is a strange Blackletter type called Grant .
But this is only the beginning .
We want to start two more projects — the Kaloyan Typeset and another Blackletter type that is still unnamed .
You got a Wacom tablet in late 2008 .
What can you tell us about the
results digitally vs. the results with ink on paper ?
I think both can not be compared .
They both do calligraphy , but the result , the feeling , the style — everything is totally different .
In digital , you have software , wires , some strange tools , plastic
surface , digital simulation pressure levels etc…and a digital print finally .
What are some of your goals for the near future ?
Well , there many goals , in fact a lifetime would not be enough for me to make everything , so I stay with only 3 - 4 of them .
1. Maybe I will concentrate some efforts in type design .
2. Maybe I will try to approach some wineries in USA and Australia .
3 . Maybe I will continue mixing my style in calligraphy between digital and traditional .
4 . And of course I will look after my kids ( two daughters ) and wife .
What are 5 things people do n’t know about you ?
1. I read a Latin dictionary in my bathroom .
2 . I read a wine encyclopedia in my second - floor bathroom .
3 . I am afraid of heights .
4 . I love to use my 4 - stroke engine Honda lawnmower .
5 . I hate to walk barefoot .

About Humans +
Gears
Welcome to the official homepage of the OverClocked ReMix Site Project , Humans and Gears .
The album is an arrangement of the soundtrack for the classic RPG Xenogears .
Many artists from the video game arrangement community have come together to create this album .
The original soundtrack is by legendary composer Yasunori Mitsuda .
With impeccable work ethic and a sense for melody and texture he created one of the most emotional soundtracks of all time .
Humans and Gears was a lengthy undertaking .
The project began in the summer of 2006 .
Many Xenogears arrangement albums have been released in the past .
The albums tries to re-envision the soundtrack in a new yet familiar way .
We set out to create two unique albums in one .
The first album features songs with a focus on natural elements and a " Human " touch .
The second album is dark in tone and electronic in texture , symbolising the fear and destruction of " Gears . "
Artists were given complete creative freedom to express and reimagine the game in a new sonic format .
We hope the listeners relive part of the amazing story and music that is Xenogears through this album .
Thank you to all of the artists for your hard work and relentless dedication towards completion of this wonderful project .
Welcome to Humans and Gears , and enjoy the journey ... again !
Kian Abouhossein at J.P. Morgan delivers some excellent insight into the Dubai crisis .
The wealthy UAE will be able to easily bail out Dubai if need be , this time .
It just might not be so optimistic to do so in the future .
We are less concerned for global banks about Dubai World ’s direct $ 59bn outstanding debt exposure with $ 4.3 bn due to mature in Dec - 09 and a further $ 4.9bn in 1Q10 , considering “ only ” $ 13bn of syndicated loans across global banking sector based on Dealogic data .
Assuming a 10 % “ hold ” strategy , the most exposed banks would be RBS with $ 0.23bn , DB and CS with $ 0.17 bn each .
...
The view from our MENA team is that this event reflects cash flow challenges rather than refinancing ability .
They believe that obligations on Dubai World and its property unit Nakheel PJSC are likely to be fulfilled at the new May 2010 earliest repayment date , and that Dubai should be eventually be able to fulfill its debt obligations maturing in the short - term ( $ 4bn in Dec - 09 , relating to Dubai World , and $ 9 to $ 10 in 2010 ) with continued Abu Dhabi support .
Abu Dhabi is strong financially with fiscal and current account surpluses , ~$ 150bn in FX reserves and a ~ $ 300 bn sovereign wealth fund .
However it seems that Abu Dhabi will no longer be happy to underwrite all debt , and rather will differentiate more strongly between supporting Dubai 's strategically important assets ( such as DEWA , and Dubai Ports ) , and the non strategic assets – hence the concurrent timing of the Dubai World debt restructure and the Abu Dhabi underwritten government of Dubai debt raising .
Here 's one rough measure of relative bank exposure to Dubai , based on Dubai World syndicated loans since 2007 .
Overall , JP Morgan believes the exposures are relatively small compared with the major banks involved .
Here 's probably a better estimate of relative exposure , by loans made to the UAE as a whole .
The amount of direct loan exposure to Dubai specifically , within this UAE - wide figure , are apparently very difficult to know .
Conclusions for some of the major banks exposed :
...
Overall we would argue the UAE direct loan exposure risk is to some extent over - discounted within global banks except for some selective banks .
In terms of spillover effect there is a larger concern for IBs considering mark - to - market risk exposure as well as IB revenue exposure to EM , in our view .
Current events considered support of our preference for quality credit exposed banks over IBs as discussed in our report “ Switching preference from IBs to Credit banks on regulatory changes ” 9 Sept 09 .
Our top picks remain : SocGen , Unicredit , BBVA , DnBNor , NBG and HSBC .

Peng et al ; Optical : NASA / STScI )
EVER since Arthur Eddington travelled to the island of Príncipe off Africa to measure starlight bending around the sun during a 1919 eclipse , evidence for Einstein ’s theory of general relativity has only become stronger .
Could it now be that starlight from distant galaxies is illuminating cracks in the theory ’s foundation ?
Everything from the concept of the black hole to GPS timing owes a debt to the theory of general relativity , which describes how gravity arises from the geometry of space and time .

Be afraid .
Do n't be very afraid .
Be a little afraid , in the way perhaps you were when you first saw The Exorcist , unable to look at the screen but cosseted by the knowledge that once the closing credits rolled , the terror would pass with no residual damage done .
Be that tiny bit afraid , please , and then lick your lips in gleeful anticipation that along with that delicious frisson of fear will come mirth and merriment beyond imagining .
For her name is Sarah Palin and she 's running for President .
Yup , she 's started .
More than two years before the first primary , Alaska 's very own Cretina d'Evil has left the starting stalls already .
Any lingering doubt that her campaign for the Republican nomination is under way evaporated this week , with the revelation that on Sunday she carved time from her frantic book - signing and publicity tour to go to North Carolina for scripture and Sabbath din-dins with Billy Graham .
In the photo , she strokes the ancient preacher 's right fist while her toddler Trig nestles on her lap , gazing at the 91 - year - old presumably thinking : " I 've no idea who you are , old timer , but if you can get the crazy lady who calls herself Mommy into the White House , you 're all right with me . "
Even with his red phone to heaven , Billy can't do that .
No power in this world or the next , one hopes and prays , could .
If you asked Jesus , he'd chuckle sardonically and say that , while he could do you some loaves and fishes , and at a pinch even a Lazarus , that one is beyond his pay grade .
" I 'd ask Dad , " Christ might add , " but He 'd only come over all Captain Mainwaring and call me a stupid boy . "
So determinedly divisive a figure is the former Governor , so beset by suspicions of ethical dodginess , so ill qualified by intellect and temperament , so blinkered in her world view , and so shallow and self - serving in her every pre-scripted word and deed , that there must be more chance of the late Son of Sam taking the electoral college .
To those queuing for hours in the freezing cold for her signature on Going Rogue , the mixture of whiny score - settling , half - truths , inventions and nauseating religiosity that constitutes newly published memoir , it looks different .
To them and untold millions like them , she is a domestic political goddess , their reflection and representative in the big game .
This is why , albeit in a drastically weak ante post field , she is the clear favourite to head the ticket in 2112 .
" Like it or not , " wrote Matthew Dowd , who knows a thing or two having helped Karl Rove got Dubya relected in 2004 , " she has a shot " .
All she will need , he explains in yesterday 's Washington Post , is to turn out a Republican base already in her pocket , to the horror of the Grand Old Party establishment , and win the early primaries Unstoppable momentum would then be hers .
That base has form here , having picked the exceedingly right - wing and sensationally unelectable Barry Goldwater in 1964 .
It is the loose equivalent of the Conservative membership ( technically , the nutters in the country ) which in 2001 glanced at Iain Duncan Smith and saw in him their Saviour .
To these gin 'n ' Jag ostriches , heads burrowing into the sand in the search for that elusive time portal back to 1955 , the fact that their party had just suffered a second landslide defeat because it was too insular , unpleasant and plain thick meant zilch .
If William Hague 's campaign medicine had made the country sicker than ever , they deduced , what finer remedy than to double the dosage ?
Watching the Republicans precisely replicating this strategy is an almost daily delight to me , as also too ( to borrow from Tina Fey 's Palin parody ) for Barack Obama .
The vista of the GOP sinking deeper into the deranged clutches of Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck and Palin herself offers priceless reassurance while the Prez 's popularity is sinking itself .
If they continue on their present trajectories , in fact , the approval ratings of Palin and Obama will meet somewhere in the mid-40s very shortly .
Not that they need the encouragement , but to the rednecks of the South and the come - over - say - hi - to - my - wife - and - Ma - and - sister - cos - she 's - dyin ' - to - meet y'all in the Appalachians , this must look like an oasis shimmering in the electoral distance .
That it has to be a mirage – that the reasons they worship her are the same reasons she could not carry any swing state with a sizeable percentage of Hispanic , black or college - educated voters – is beyond their concern or understanding , or both .
These are the folks whose racist displacement activity is to affect the belief that Obama was born in Kenya , and buy wholesale her claim that universal health care means " death panels " .
Eighth wits at best , and vicious ones at that – only in hearing an echo of themselves in Palin do they show a keen grasp of reality .
As others have pointed out – and if you 've turned to this page for an original thought , are you insane ?
– it is her status as the apotheosis of reality television that goes furthest in explaining her popularity .
What is she , after all , if not the classic girl - next - door , plucked from obscurity ( by John McCain ) and turned into an ersatz superstar overnight thanks to a decent rendition of someone else 's lyrics ( that barnstorming Convention speech ) .
Like every canny X Factor contender , only to the nth degree , she sates the cravings of editors and their readers for tales of family triumph and tragedy , sex and sleaze .
The good news here is that , while telegenic appeal and a knack for producing passable cover versions might give a contestant a shot at building a glittering career , it is never enough to maintain one .
It can provide a couple of No.1s and sell pantomime tickets to the faithful who had your phone vote number on speed dial .
But to last as a proper headline act takes more than a cute face , homespun verities , and incessant coverage in tabloids and supermarket magazines .
Sarah Palin has an alarmingly good chance of reaching the final two , but if ever she finds herself in a live debate with Obama , the lack of a real voice of her own and a shred of talent for more than slyly mirroring archaic prejudice will surely be terminally exposed .
If not ... if by some monstrous miracle she were to win , the sight of several billions projectile vomiting pea green puke like Linda Blair in The Exorcist will be something to behold .
So be afraid , but not too afraid , and stand by for the most surreal , extended and hilarious political melodrama in the history of this planet .
Belfast Telegraph
Underground Racing has released their 1500 hp Lamborghini Gallardo Twin Turbo that has an amazing sound in the video when under full throttle .
This beast was built for a client named Jonah , and it has to be one of the best tuning jobs performed in a while .
Dubbed the TTG , it produces a mind blowing 1500 horsepower to the wheels .
That is an incredible number , and when factoring a 25 percent drivetrain loss , it most likely shows numbers around 1875 hp to the crank !
Boosted at 30 psi , the Lamborghini Gallardo runs on VP C16 racing fuel , which is a step up from the previous Underground Racing Lamborhini Murcielago LP640 , which accomplished 1300 rear wheel horsepower .
Built with a six - speed transmission , Jonah was able to accomplish a sub - ten second quarter mile time with a trap speed over 160 mph .
However , Underground Racing made sure everyone knows Jonah had not been to the track in over 10 years , so he had to be somewhat rusty .
A professional driver could definitely pull less than 10 seconds in the car , and probably break the 9 second mark in this remarkable Lamborghini Gallardo Twin Turbo .

US : Michigan school districts in turmoil over education cuts
By Lawrence Porter
26 November 2009
The recent education cuts by Michigan ’s Democratic governor Jennifer Granholm and the state legislature have thrown virtually every school district in the state into crisis , and many into opposition , as hundreds of millions of dollars have been eliminated from the districts and from vitally needed social programs .
The crowd at the West Bloomfield High School rally
In late September the state cut $ 165 per pupil in preparation for the budget that was due October 1 .
Two weeks later , Granholm slashed an additional $ 127 per student , for a total of $ 292 per student in every Michigan school district , forcing districts that had already allocated their resources to make additional cuts .
Along with the second round of cuts , Granholm took away an additional $ 51.7 million from 39 districts considered to be more affluent , but also reeling under the budgetary assault .
The decision to cut the money from the higher - funded districts was an attempt by Granholm to pit districts with different incomes against one another .
While some wealthier districts , such as Bloomfield Hills north of Detroit , receive 50 percent more funding than Detroit itself , there are relatively slight differences in the funding for the majority of districts .
The arcane method of funding education in America is based on the home property values , not social needs , and is palpably unequal .
Detroit , which receives $ 7,660 per student , along with Hamtramck and Lincoln Park , which receive $ 7,316 and $ 7,310 , respectively , were exempted from the additional cuts , while Dearborn ( $ 8,802 ) and West Bloomfield ( $ 9,116 ) were included .
The gaps between these various districts are not great ; however , the different treatment is useful politically in dividing Detroit from the suburban districts surrounding it .
In reality , all of these areas are grossly underfunded .
Michigan has 1.67 million students in the K - 12 education system .
Adding the initial $ 487.4 million in per-student cuts and the $ 51.7 million from better - off districts produces a total of $ 539.1 million in education cuts , or an average of $ 317 per pupil throughout the state .
Next year ’s assault on the education budget may well be worse .
Democrat Andy Dillon , the state House Speaker , said in a recent interview that $ 700 million to $ 1 billion in cuts could be expected next year .
On November 10 , 1,500 parents and students attended a rally in Lansing , Michigan ’s capital , to oppose the cuts and demand the restoration of funding .
The rally was called by a newly formed organization called SOS , for Save Our Schools .
SOS , which bills itself as a non-governmental organization , advances policies strikingly similar to those proposed by Gov. Granholm and functions largely at this point as a pressure group on the Republicans in the state legislature .
A position paper , distributed by the group , calls for implementing “ a strategic combination of tax increases , spending cuts , and reforms . ”
Numerous other rallies have been held throughout the state , including in Dearborn and at Wayne State University in Detroit ( see WSWS report ) , to protest the state government ’s cuts in education .
On Tuesday , an officially - sponsored rally took place at West Bloomfield High School , organized by the West Bloomfield Education Foundation .
The district , in suburban Detroit , is one of the 39 subject to the additional cuts .
West Bloomfield is losing $ 551 per student , the equivalent of $ 3.8 million this year alone .
Whatever the intentions of many in attendance , the gathering did not represent any challenge to the savage cuts and the corporate stranglehold over the economy .
The express goal of the rally was to raise money from parents to replace the funds cut by the state budget , not to demand the cuts be restored .
Attending the rally were Democratic and Republican politicians , including Rep. Gary Peters , a Democrat , and Republican Mike Bouchard , seeking to become the Republican candidate for governor in 2010 .
Both the Democrats and Republicans in Michigan have supported the cuts .
West Bloomfield is a relatively affluent district , where the average household income is $ 87,740 .
The aim of the rally organizers is to collect $ 2 million to overcome the gap in funding .
They are asking contributors to make a minimum pledge of $ 1 a day .
In any event , many families in the district , facing layoffs and salary cuts , cannot afford the extra payment .
“ They do this year after year , ” stated one parent leaving the West Bloomfield event .
“ Before , it was for things like sports equipment or other items the school needed .
Now they want us to replace the cuts .
It does n’t end . ”
Renee Judkins , son Jason Chilton , daughter and another woman
“ I am recovering from cancer , ” explained Renée Judkins , in attendance with her daughter and son .
“ I have no money to give .
It seems like the wealthy people control everything .
Why are we the ones who are being asked to sacrifice ? ”
“ The special needs program is always facing the threat of cuts , ” continued Renée .
“ Last year they cut transportation for Head Start .
They always seem to go after the neediest kids first . ”
Jason Chilton , Renée ’s son , concurred .
“ My sister is 9 years old , in the 4th grade , ” stated Jason .
“ I do n’t want to think what will happen if we do n’t have these special needs programs . ”
“ When I went to West Bloomfield High School they had one of the leading programs in the state for special needs .
I am very concerned about the kids who need extra faculty .
If they do n’t get the support , these kids will not be able to have the kind of programs that will allow them to have a normal life . ”
“ I was a part of the special needs program .
I know from experience the kind of skills these kids can get . ”
Adrienne Wise and daughter
Adrienne Wise , at the meeting with her daughter , told the WSWS , “ I think these cuts are devastating to the infrastructure of the school system .
We have enough challenges already getting a quality education .
If they carry out more cuts they will make it even more difficult .
This will not end . ”
When asked what she thought about the proposal of parents to give money to the school she said , “ There are many families who can give , but there are many who cannot because they are struggling to pay their mortgages , utilities and other bills .
Many people have lost their jobs and are making difficult decisions on where to cut expenses . ”
“ I see this every day in my neighborhood , in my community .
Michigan has the highest unemployment rate in the country right now , and we have n’t seen the end of it .
This is impacting not only the schools but the infrastructure . ”
The crisis in education today is an expression of the deep crisis of the profit system affecting every layer of society and aspect of life .
There are abundant resources to fund high - quality education for all .
The US government has made $ 23 trillion available to bail out the banking system , and now the Obama administration is planning to spend a minimum of $ 35 billion for additional troops in Afghanistan .
Opposition to the savage budget cuts must be organized on the basis of an independent political movement of the working class , against both the Democrats and Republicans , on the basis of a socialist program for reorienting society ’s priorities .
World 's rarest duck gets second chance after conservationists hatch eight eggs in captivity
Conservationists were today celebrating the first successful steps in an attempt to save the world 's rarest duck from extinction .
Fewer than 20 Madagascar pochard are believed to be living on just one lake in the wild .
The critically endangered duck is so rare that it was declared extinct in the late 1990s until scientists found a few of the birds by chance during a trip to Madagascar in 2006 .
Extinct : Conservationists have successfully hatched eight eggs of the Madagascar pochard ( above ) , taking the duck 's population to fewer than 28
To stop the beautiful cinnamon - coloured diving duck slipping permanently into extinction a team of bird specialists devised a conservation plan .
They were hoping to collect some of the pochards ' eggs , incubate them and raise the ducklings via a conservation breeding programme .
But an emergency rescue plan was mounted ahead of schedule after a visit in July revealed the situation was worse than feared - with just six females seen and evidence that young had died when only a few weeks old .
Last month the team embarked on a journey to the isolated and difficult to reach lake in northern Madagascar where the birds had been seen .
Luckily the team returned with a clutch of eggs of which eight hatched into ducklings .
The tiny ducks are now being hand reared in captivity , at a site in Madagascar .
It is hoped that the conservation programme will result in enough ducks being born in captivity that sustainable numbers can one day be released back into their original habitat .
The programme was run by Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust , the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust ( WWT ) , The Peregrine Fund and the Government of Madagascar .
Peter Cranswick from WWT said : ' This is conservation at the cutting edge .
' The urgency of the situation has meant a great deal of invention and improvisation - but next year simply may have been too late .
Safely bringing birds into captivity marks the start of a 20 or 30 - year conservation project that will also help restore wetlands across the region . '
The ducklings are reported to be doing very well , and the team are now attempting to secure two more clutches from the wild over the next few weeks .
Peter Cranswick added : ' There was no question we needed to act to save the Madagascar pochard from extinction .
' Its decline is due to human activity and only we have the power to reverse that . '

The two leaders were all smiles after their joint news conference
It should not come as a surprise that President Obama has been dancing delicately and deftly around the issues of Tibet and human rights while on his visit to China .
Who after all would kick sand in their banker 's face ?
China now holds reserves of $ 2.3 trillion .
It owns more US debt than anyone else .
China 's savings sustain the US economy for better or worse .
It is the financial equivalent of assured mutual destruction .
The Chinese underwrite America 's lavish lifestyle .
Their family silver is kept in dollars .
One can not live without the other .
But you can see why Barack Obama has been at pains to be a most courteous guest .
Before the trip , he obliged his hosts by not seeing the Dalai Lama when the Tibetan spiritual leader was visiting Washington .
The word Taiwan has not even been whispered .
Human rights are down the menu of public grievances .
Obama even chimed in with President Hu Jintao by refusing to take even a single question from the press at a " news conference " in Beijing .
Perhaps he was trying to avoid the inevitable grilling over Afghanistan or health care that follows him around the globe like a stubborn shadow .
I can see his annoyance .
But I remember how previous presidents fielded difficult questions from abrasive reporters - and answered back with relish - while standing next to Chinese leaders .
The ability of the regime to behave less like a nanny with a truncheon could determine the future of the world 's most populous nation .

Freedom of the press is , after all , one of the few things that the US still has over the people who make their washing machines , assemble their computers , sell them their toys and lend them their mortgage money .
I can also see why the Chinese hate being lectured by America on human rights .
The lingering existence of Guantanamo Bay and memories of Abu Ghraib have eroded the moral high ground like a swarm of termites , however insistently Obama has banned the use of torture .
But something else has changed in the chemistry of the world 's most important bilateral relationship .
America is now more in awe of China than vice versa .
Afghanistan and Iraq have shown the limits of US military power .
We are no longer impressed , as we once were , by million - dollar smart bombs if crude but deadly IEDs planted in drinks cans can kill or injure American soldiers on a daily basis .
The stonewalling , sandbagging and petty in - fighting on Capitol Hill have shown the limits of democracy in the world 's greatest democracy .
And the Great Recession has shown the limits of America 's economic clout .
Expansion v decay
We are limping towards a jobless recovery .
A year ago , China saw millions of people laid off from the factories of Guandong and Fujian .
Now they are posting more than 8 % growth , reaping the benefits of a whopping stimulus package that even dwarfs America's , while taking dramatic steps to encourage their own citizens to consume .
Meanwhile , they have established closer ties with countries like Brazil and Peru in what used to be called America 's backyard .
Their factories and engineers are seen all over Africa with the same mercantilist zeal once displayed by the East India Company .
And although they vie with America to be the world 's biggest polluter they are also aggressive about embracing green technology .
The moment of greatest danger will come when China 's Internet savvy , I - phone - wielding , BMW - driving , condo- owning , well travelled middle class wants to be treated like adults and the regime continues to talk down to them like children
According to the New York Times , an astonishing 86 % of the population believe the country is heading in the right direction .
In the US , that figure languishes at 37 % .
In Europe and America , we are managing decay .
In China , they are managing expansion .
Oh and did I mention the number of billionaires ?
China now boasts 130 , still behind America 's 349 but multiplying at a much faster rate .
There are some obvious reasons for this high - octane growth .
When two thirds of the population have never owned a car or a washing machine , the economy has a long way to go before it reaches saturation .
Most Chinese people have low if any expectations of how wealthy they should be .
The only sense of entitlement is confined to the Communist nomenklatura .
But China 's leaders are well aware of the political dynamite produced by high level corruption .
The worst abuses end with the firing squad .
On the whole , Chinese people are prepared to make enormous personal sacrifices in order to see the next generation flourish .
I remember meeting an engineer at the tip of southern China who had left his family in Hohhot in Inner Mongolia 1,500 miles ( 2,400 km ) away to make a living .
He was desperately homesick .
He returned home once a year , but it did not even occur to him to ditch the job .
China 's Achilles ' heel Resilience is linked with a willingness to take risks .
I also remember my Chinese cameraman in Hong Kong who had lost a fortune during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 .
The minute the stock prices were low enough , he borrowed more money , piled it back into the market , made a fortune and repaid his debts .
What you see in China today is a curious combination of breathless expansion and boundless optimism , wrapped in national pride , combined with the patience produced by 5,000 years of continuous history .
America at its best has the energy and the optimism .
It does not lack in patriotism .
But it also labours under the need for instant gratification .
China 's astonishing rise has one Achilles ' heel .
Its expansion rests upon the Faustian pact between the people and their rulers : we will be politically obedient as long as you allow us to make a mint and spend it .
The moment of greatest danger will come when China 's Internet savvy , iPhone - wielding , BMW - driving , condo- owning , well travelled middle class wants to be treated like adults and the regime continues to talk down to them like children .
The ability of the regime to behave less like a nanny with a truncheon could determine the future of the world 's most populous nation .

What better way to find some of the hidden meanings behind the trophies , then letting God of War III Design Director , Todd Papy , explain it for you :
Other than all the visual improvements that we added to the God of War Collection , the most exciting part for me was the opportunity to go back and add in full trophy support for both games .
Not only will the trophies hopefully be an enjoyable way to check your progress through the game , but they will also give the hard - core God of War fans some serious additional bragging rights .
And on a more personal level , the trophies were a really great opportunity for us to share some of our stories and inside jokes from God of War and God of War II .
One of the trophies that I was really happy to finally be able get out there was “ Speed of Jason McDonald . ”
At the end of making God of War , the combat designers were doing speed runs of the game , and soon enough , friendly wagers started springing up around the office to see who could post the best time .
Jason McDonald , currently a Sr. Combat Designer on God of War III , blew them all away .
He still has , a couple God of War games later , the two dollars in winnings tapped proudly to his computer monitor .
Something very similar happened when we started testing the God of War II trophy “ 15 Min Fight Scene . ”
The fight outside the Loom Chamber is one of the more polarizing moments in the game .
A lot of people really enjoyed the long marathon battle , while other ’s thought it was maybe too tough of a challenge .
This fun vs. frustration became even clearer when the office stopped working on God of War III one afternoon to get together and watch as team member after team member tried to get through the fight in record time .
Judging by the cheering that occurred when the aforementioned Jason McDonald was knocked out of the lead spot , I would say fun won the day .
Another challenging spot that we wanted to highlight with the “ You Got the Touch ! ” trophy was the Spiked Column in Hades from God of War .
After playtesting repeatedly , David Jaffe asked me to tone down the difficulty and make it easier for the final shipped game .
Ironically , even after all that , it wound up being one of the most talked about sections , and not always for the best reasons .
I think one of the problems is that a lot of people try to blast their way through and get it over with as fast as possible .
That ’s a sure fire way to get Kratos sliced up .
The trick was always taking your time to think about what your next move was going to be .
Throw in a couple deep breaths , and I think a lot of people will be able to make it through without taking damage and earn the trophy .

The Inside Scoop : Does SIZE Matter ?
0 SHARES Share
When presented with this question , women often give very different answers — depending on who ’s doing the asking .
To an anxious lover , she will naturally be inclined to insist that it does n’t matter in the least .
But when gossiping with the girls , she may have another opinion altogether .
Which is the truth ?
The simplest answer is that size does matter , but not nearly as much as men think .
I would say that it matters more in the abstract than in actuality .
In the course of writing erotica for women I ’ve had the opportunity to do quite a lot of research on women ’s sexual fantasies .
Within this multi-faceted realm of women ’s most secret and intense desires , I ’ve discovered that penis size is rather insignificant .
Although it does come up from time to time , it ’s rarely a critical factor in the overall fantasy .
There ’s almost always a more significant dynamic at work , which generally materializes in the form of a behavior rather than a physical attribute .
For example , if a woman ’s fantasy is to be dominated , it will be the acts of domination ( ie. , being tied up , spanked , etc. ) that fuel her excitement .
As an aside to the behaviors that excite them , many women will embellish their sexual fantasies with remarkably vivid details , one of which might feature a large penis , but this aspect of the fantasy represents the proverbial icing on the cake , and is not necessarily an element that is required to make the fantasy work for her .
As she becomes more and more aroused , she will become even more focused on the sexual behaviors above anything else .
This is where it gets interesting .
When it comes to physical appearance — size , shape , etc. — women are much more concerned ( some might even say obsessed ) with their own bodies than they are with those of their partner .
Did you know , for example , that a prevalent feature in many female fantasies — more prevalent than penis size — is for her to imagine herself to be physically different than she is ?
It ’s true .
All this time , while you ’ve been worrying that she ’s fantasizing about George Clooney she was probably conjuring an image more like Angelina Jolie .
Understanding this can give men an amazing advantage .
There is , in my opinion , a critical difference between men and women when it comes to enjoying sex : men ( generally speaking ) need little more than to see or imagine something sexy ( a sexual image or idea ) , whereas women need to feel sexy .
The more you think about this concept the more sense it makes , and the less confusing female behavior becomes .
Women need to feel sexy .
The problem , of course , is that 99 % of the women out there do n’t feel sexy most of the time .
This is n’t necessarily male fault .
It seems that every aspect of our media is working overtime to prove that women — women as they actually are , that is — are , in fact , the antithesis of sexy .
The various media have their reasons .
The sex industry strives to create images that out - sex the real thing in order to get men to buy what they ’re selling .
The beauty industry does the same thing to women in an effort to sell them their products .
And everyone in between , it seems , is trying to get in on the action , capitalizing on this very negative approach to selling their stuff .
They tirelessly reiterate the common theme that there is something better out there : something better that men can be enjoying and something better that women can be .
Since women need to feel sexy in order to enjoy the sexual experience , and since most women do n’t , a sexual void has been created .
I believe this is why so many women began incorporating a sexier image of themselves into their sexual fantasies .
The images they conjure up are eerily similar to the female stereotypes in the media .
Meeting this standard is crucial for some women .
It helps them feel ‘ sexy ’ enough to engage in their fantasies , to visualize themselves participating in the sexual behaviors that turn them on .
And when a woman fantasizes , the sex can be tremendously more enjoyable for both .
There is little or no need for a man to feel threatened by a woman ’s fantasies .
Odds are that , if he ’s in there , he ’ll make his appearance pretty much as he is ; because it ’s not him who she ’s convinced is n’t good enough , but her .
And it would n’t matter anyway because his libido will allow him to enjoy sex even if he does n’t particularly feel like an Adonis .
But a woman ’s sexuality is n’t as resistant , and I truly believe that the women who ca n’t feel sexy no matter what they do make up the largest portion of the purported 70 % of women suffering with the “ sexual dysfunction ” of having no sex drive whatsoever .
For a woman who does n’t feel sexy , the act of having sex can actually seem like a chore .
There are things men can do to help , and I intend to discuss these things in much more detail in future articles , but for the subject at hand , which is penis size , the point is that women are preoccupied with much bigger issues .
The man who is going to save the world is an ordinary - looking man .
He 's average in height , with an average face .
He has blue eyes and sandy hair .
He wears eyeglasses .
He 's forty - eight years old .
He looks like the kind of guy you 'd see buffing his car in the driveway or shopping for a new grill at Sears , a classic all - American Homo suburbanus , but in fact he is a former officer of the United States Navy with a Ph.D. in a fiendishly complicated type of engineering .
He is low - key and unassuming , with a quiet midwestern sense of humor .
He loves to surf and ski and cook and drink martinis and host large groups of people for long meals , spreading newspapers across the table to catch flying scraps of crab .
The man who is going to save the world leads high school field trips .
He attends an Episcopal church where the priest is a woman .
When he had a bigger house , he took in a series of foster children while they waited for adoption , eleven in all .
He volunteers with a charity that teaches surfing to autistic children .
One morning I watched him standing in the warm Carolina surf for hours , catching the kids as they fell off their surfboards .
They went out scared and came back quivering with joy .
The man who is going to save the world is also a damn good father , a tendency that is at the heart of this world - saving business .
His oldest child is an adorable high school senior named Zatha who is friendly and fearless , eager and full of questions , senior - class president , first - place winner in the statewide cross-country competition two years in a row .
There 's a glimpse of his parenting skills in the " racebook " he 's using to encourage his son , Hans :
Team time trial , August 3 , 2009 , Monday .
The word Go was stated .
The students took off , boys and girls .
Kevin took the lead and you got behind him .
Many thought , " Rookie mistake .
Hans will fade , " but Hans did n't slow down .
His shadow continued to haunt Kevin all the way around the three - lap course .
You had a time of 19:05 .
This is amazing , Hans .
So a quote and a question :
" Effort and courage is not enough without purpose and direction . " — JFK
Do you want to be number one this year and this season ?
If so , please contact Dad for secret training and coaching .

Dad
Eric Loewen talks the very same way when he is explaining patiently how he intends to save the world .
The problem with saving the world is that change has no constituency .
There is always a constituency for staying the same , but change is a risk .
So change needs , as Loewen says , a " secret coach . "
The next thing you should know is that Loewen 's miracle technology is not some airy concept .
It cost billions of dollars to develop .
Some of the biggest companies in America spent ten years refining it under the close supervision of the U. S. government — before the program was shuttered and abandoned in a hasty political decision that makes Who Killed the Electric Car ? look like a promotional film for General Motors .
Next , you must also consider the magnitude of the problem he 's solving : a looming series of biblical disasters that include global warming , mass starvation , financial collapse , resource wars , and a long - term energy crisis that 's much more desperate than most of us realize .
Barring any spectacular new discoveries , assuming current trends in population and economic growth prevail , all the conventional oil in the world will be gone in about forty years .
We can get maybe ten more if we suck dry oil sands and shale .
We have enough natural gas to last about fifty years , enough coal to last between 150 and 300 years .
But these fuels carry a heavy price .
The emissions of coal plants alone carry , along with massive amounts of CO 2 , thousands of pounds of beryllium , manganese , selenium , lead , arsenic , and cadmium .
They are 180 times more radioactive than the U. S. government 's permissible level for the emissions of nuclear power plants .
If we were to burn enough coal to survive , the result would be acid rain and acidifying oceans and pollution that kills fifty thousand Americans each year through diseases like asthma , bronchitis , and emphysema .
Which brings us to global warming .
Most scientists now believe that the tipping point for global disaster is a CO 2 level of 450 parts per million .
We are now at just over 380 ppm and could pass 500 ppm in thirty years — in which case , in the words of Dr. James Hansen , the NASA scientist whose grim climate predictions have been coming true for the last thirty years , " We will hand our children a planet that has entered a long , chaotic , transient period with climate changes out of their control , as the planet heads inexorably toward an ice - free state . "
There are skeptics , of course , some of them quite distinguished , and a legitimate debate about just how bad things could get .
But the bet is all or nothing , and an alarming number of the " cautious " are the same people who said cigarettes do n't cause cancer , seat belts are a waste of money , and evolution is a hoax .
So what do we do ?
That 's where this man comes in , because under most scenarios , solar and wind will never provide much more than 20 percent of our energy needs .
Clean coal is a fiction , cap and trade ineffectual , and conservation almost as useless as Dick Cheney said it was — if we cut back on oil use by 10 percent , we will buy ourselves another four years .
Hydropower provides only 2.5 percent , and we 've already dammed up as many rivers as we are likely to dam .
There 's promise in biofuels , but at this point , all biofuels combined provide less than 2 percent of our energy needs , and we 've already devoted more than a quarter of our annual corn crop to ethanol production .
And nuclear power — which has the virtue of emitting no CO 2 whatsoever — generates deadly nuclear waste that lasts forever and seems impossible to safely store .
Which leaves just one solution .
From room to room , he sells the solution .
The man who is going to save the world is giving a very speedy speech to the chamber of commerce of the town of Wilmington , North Carolina :
" Here 's one of the problems Secretary Chu has running the Department of Energy :
He has a lot of excess nuclear weapons that have a lot of plutonium that he has to figure out what to do with .
He also has the problem of used nuclear fuel that is being stored in sites that are filling up .
Then there 's the problem of how we can generate enough clean power to satisfy the needs of the world .
And the solution is ... "
Here he is briefing Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee :
" So what is nuclear waste ?
It 's still uranium !
Right ?
It 's 95 percent uranium .
It 's still usable .
But we 've got these evil things called transuranics , which is 1 percent of the total and 99 percent of the headache ... "
And here he is in a small office outside Wilmington , scribbling formulas and figures on a whiteboard :
" ... And that is my fuel .
The problem becomes the solution . "
He starts drawing little squiggles on the whiteboard , trying to explain how the miracle technology actually burns nuclear waste , neatly solving the biggest problem associated with nuclear power .
I have no idea what he 's talking about .
" Let 's go to the baseball field .
The pitcher throws a very fast fastball .
What is the probability of the guy hitting it ? "
" Bad ? "
" Bad .
So if I have a fast neutron , like these transuranics , the probability of achieving fission goes down .
So the reason why we slow it down in a water reactor is , it gives us a higher probability of causing a fission .
That allows us to start up this sort of reactor with only 3 percent of the fissile material .
But with fast neutrons , I get more neutrons per fission . "
Transuranics are highly radioactive elements like plutonium , typically regarded not as sources of energy but for their capacity to vaporize cities .
" But if I build a different kind of reactor that uses liquid sodium instead of water to slow things down , I can have a higher neutron speed and that stuff becomes a fuel .
You just mix it in the crucible , put in the transuranics , put in some uranium , put in some zirconium , and you cast it into thin rods .
That technology 's been developed , it 's easy to do , and you do it in a room about this size . "
The miracle solution goes by different names : the sodium fast reactor , the integral fast reactor , the liquid - metal - cooled reactor .
It burns nuclear waste , emits no CO 2 , and shuts itself down in an accident .
We have enough fuel to power the whole world for tens of thousands of years .
It will end global warming , and even if global warming is just another paranoid Armageddon fantasy , it will save us from the dying oceans and starvation and resource wars that are inevitable as the world 's energy supply dwindles .
It will unleash new industries and revitalize America 's manufacturing industry .
Although he came late to the cause , Loewen has been preparing for it all his life .
Raised in a Colorado mining town , he was studying science on a ski scholarship when he detoured into the Navy after his girlfriend dumped him , and he got selected for a program in nuclear engineering .
Fast - forward five years and we find him standing watch on the U. S. S. Long Beach , the first surface ship in the nuclear navy .
He is cruising the Persian Gulf , where Iranians just fired on an oil tanker flying a U. S. flag .
Now a pair of Iranian warplanes are heading his way .
What am I doing here ?
he thought .
I do n't want to die in a stupid Iranian attack .
I want to change the world for the better .
I want to build nuclear reactors .
So he left the Navy and went back to graduate school , which led to a job at the National Laboratories in Idaho , a vast complex financed by the federal government and dedicated to futuristic technology .
He began working on a fast reactor that used lead as a coolant .
For seven years he labored , writing scholarly articles , raising his family , taking in foster children , skiing the glorious Idaho powder .
But he could n't solve the problems of lead - cooled reactors .
They had a nasty tendency to corrode .
Then he got two lucky breaks .
First , he took a year 's sabbatical and went to work in the office of Senator Chuck Hagel , where he helped push through groundbreaking global - warming legislation .
That exercised his organizing skills and deepened his sense of alarm about the environmental crisis .
Then he attended an Esquire magazine event and met an executive from General Electric .
In April 2006 , GE hired him and handed him a giant file labeled " Compendium of S - PRISM Information . "
It was a revelation .
" I was like , Wow , why did n't we build this ? "
Thomas Porostocky
A month after plunging into the file , Loewen began meeting with officials from the U. S. Department of Energy and other veterans of the project , from the original project manager to the man who built the test reactor 's electromagnetic pump .
" He looked at me as a new greenhorn guy , a month on the job , and said , ' If you 're serious about building this , go save that pump .
And oh , by the way , they 're knocking the building down in three months . ' "
Gradually , he put the story together .
The first glimmer of the fast - reactor concept began at the federal government 's Argonne National Laboratory in 1951 , when the sodium - cooled Experimental Breeder Reactor No. 1 powered four lightbulbs and proved that nuclear power was a real thing .
In 1965 , Argonne put into service Experimental Breeder Reactor No. 2 , a demonstration project that ran successfully for thirty years .
In 1971 , Richard Nixon launched the Clinch River Breeder Reactor Project , putting together thousands of government and industry scientists in an effort to come up with a commercial prototype , but after twelve years , a mixture of technical problems , procurement scandals , and the relentless opposition of environmentalists finally led the Senate to kill it .
Then GE started rethinking things .
One of Clinch River 's problems was light - water envy .
They were trying to power huge turbines that put out 1,000 megawatts .
" So [ GE ] sat down and said , You know what , we 're pretty good at making washing machines and jet engines in a factory and replicating them .
Why do n't we make a sodium - cooled reactor that 's factory - built , modular , with passive safety and replicate that , instead of trying to scale up ? "
Passive safety meant that it would shut itself off automatically instead of melting down .
Replicability meant the reactor vessel could n't be more than twenty feet in diameter , because that 's the biggest you can ship down a rail line .
So they would gang reactor modules together to power a single turbine .
They named it the Power Reactor , Innovative Small Module , or PRISM .
At the time , it was a renegade idea .
So what if PRISM could be mass - produced , plopped right next to every coal plant in the world , and hooked straight to their existing electric turbines just as fast as American steelworkers could crank them out ?
It was already so hard to get nuclear plants built , big seemed to be better .
But the Department of Energy gave the project a green light , and GE put together a team that included giant companies like Westinghouse and Bechtel .
They simplified it , made it safer , ran tests and reviews , and by 1986 , proved the passive safety concept on Experimental Breeder Reactor No. 2 .
The design posed less of a proliferation risk than regular light - water reactors .
By 1992 , after spending $ 1 billion , they were ready to build a prototype .
Then Bill Clinton came into office and killed it .
Maybe it was the lingering legacy of Three Mile Island , or Chernobyl , and the fear of proliferation .
But by 2006 , everything had changed .
The consensus on global warming was rising , wars in the Middle East exposed the vulnerability of our oil supply , influential environmentalists like Patrick Moore and Stewart Brand began switching sides , and Republicans — who have always been more friendly to nuclear power — held sway in Washington .
President Bush announced the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership , an ambitious research effort that linked twenty - one countries to " close the nuclear fuel cycle " and solve the waste problem .
Soon afterward , the Department of Energy gave Loewen the green light .
It was time to dust off the PRISM .
Writing by himself at first , he started a " Design Control Document " that covered everything from the technical design to the business plan .
Scavenging help wherever he could and sweetening the deal with surfing lessons , he hired an outside firm to do the 3 - D modeling and got a twenty - year - old engineering intern to redesign the reactor vessel in a year of eighty - hour weeks .
Meanwhile , as America 's Secret Coach , he used his political savvy and personal charm to spread the excitement : inviting engineering students to workshops , giving lectures at the American Nuclear Society , flying to Vermont to spend a day pitching the lieutenant governor on an experimental PRISM reactor for the state university .
With a millionaire Silicon Valley inventor named Steve Kirsch , who joined the cause after a fatal diagnosis convinced him to spend his last days saving the planet , Loewen traveled to Washington to pitch PRISM on Capitol Hill .
Kirsch told me he first learned about the fast - reactor concept from a newsletter written by Dr. Hansen , the hero of An Inconvenient Truth .
" I was intrigued because from Hansen 's description , it sounded like we must be nuts for not pursuing this .
If you discovered a machine that turned lead into gold , you 'd think the government would exploit the machine for the good of the country . "
Now the clock is ticking down .
Shortly after taking office , President Obama stopped work on the proposed nuclear - waste storage facility at Yucca Mountain and put the brakes on the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership .
Of the $ 39 billion in stimulus money given to the Department of Energy , not a single dollar went to nuclear .
On the positive side , Energy Secretary Steven Chu has begun assembling a " blue ribbon " commission to study the energy alternatives and make a conceptual leap into the future — all of which turns up the dial on Loewen 's sense of urgency .
If he can find a way to sway Chu and Obama , to make them see that fast reactors are the only scalable answer to global warming , the world can still be saved .
" To me the answer is simple , " he says .
" We have the solution .
We do n't need to study it anymore .
And it's an American solution .
It would revive our industrial spirit .
Let 's do it . "
In this world full of critics , where fear and anxiety feed on ragged scraps of misinformation and nuclear power taps a mother lode of metaphysical angst , we overlook the facts .
For example , at least forty - one workers have died in the production of modern wind turbines , but in sixty - one years commercial nuclear power has n't killed a single man or woman in the United States .
Even the disaster at Chernobyl killed just fifty - six people , and that was completely the fault of epic communist incompetence .
But much of the environmental movement continues to hate nuclear power as an article of faith , and armchair scientists point to the difficulties of the fast nuclear plants in Russia and Japan , and the infinite armies of inertia simply avert their eyes .
To all these , Loewen 's answer is a tour of the U. S. S. North Carolina , a World War II battleship anchored near downtown Wilmington .
First stop , the engine room , two big turbines and a screw painted the same green color as a high school boiler room .
On to the rudder , with old - fashioned hydraulic arms that look like a giant bicycle wheel .
To the combat information center where they plotted trajectories on what looks like a giant fuse box , to the navigation room where the dead - reckoning log still lies .
Then he goes out onto the bridge , where he remembers the day he grabbed his binoculars and ran out to see the Iranian missiles coming to annihilate him .
Why ?
" Because I wanted to see my fate , " he says .
The point is , PRISM is n't half as complicated — and they built a fleet of these battleships overnight .
Now it 's a fleet of nuclear reactors Loewen sees .
" That 's how I answer the naysayers who say we can't build this till 2040 , " he says .

Streetfilms : Blumenauer Bikes New York City
Rep. Earl Blumenauer ( D - OR ) is one of Capitol Hill ’s strongest voices for walking , biking and transit .
Soon after arriving in Congress in 1996 , he started the Congressional Bike Caucus , now more than 160 members strong , and he ’s the founding chairman of the House ’s new " Livable Communities Task Force , " which he announced two weeks ago here on Streetsblog .
Blumenauer ’s bike commute to the Capitol has become as much a personal hallmark as his predilection for bowties .
So when he came to New York City this weekend to stump for a progressive federal transportation bill , the congressman did n’t pass up the chance to tour the city ’s evolving bike infrastructure with Paul Steely White and Noah Budnick of Transportation Alternatives .
Clarence Eckerson and his camera were there too , of course .
Watch this Streetfilm to hear Blumenauer ’s thoughts on the big federal transportation bill , the emergence of a national movement for safe biking and walking , and the difference between protected bike lanes and regular old Class 2 facilities .
Then ask yourself :
When will we get to see a lawmaker from New York City walk , bike , or ride the bus with Clarence ?
( CNN ) --
After scouring northern Colorado by foot and air , frantically chasing a Mylar balloon for miles and repeatedly interviewing his big brother , authorities ended the search for 6 - year - old Falcon Heene where it began -- at his house .
6 - year - old Falcon
Heene says he was hiding in a box in the attic while authorities were searching for him .
He was in a box .
In the attic .
The whole time .
" I played with my toys and took a nap , " Falcon told a group of reporters outside his home Thursday afternoon .
" He says he was hiding in the attic , " said Falcon 's father , meteorologist Richard Heene , clutching his son .
" He says it 's because I yelled at him . "
" I 'm sorry I yelled at him , " added Heene , tearfully hugging the boy .
In a later interview with CNN's " Larry King Live , " Falcon said he heard his parents call for him from the garage .
When asked by his father on - air why he did n't respond , the boy replied , " You guys said we did this for the show . "
When the father was pressed by Wolf Blitzer , who was filling in for King , to explain what his son meant , he became uncomfortable , finally saying he was " appalled " by the questions , and then adding that Falcon was likely referring to all the media coverage .
Watch the Heenes talk about the ordeal on CNN's Larry King Live »
Authorities said they believe the case was genuine .
The situation grabbed the nation 's attention early Thursday afternoon , after authorities reported that the experimental helium balloon was set adrift with the 6 - year - old apparently riding in it .
Heene said the family was in the early stages of working on the balloon -- a " 3D low - altitude vehicle " -- when the contraption and the boy went missing .
His brother had said he watched Falcon get into the balloon before he untied the tethers , setting it free .
Heene later said Falcon was videotaped getting into the vessel by his brother , but " obviously he got out . "
Once it was untethered , the saucer - like craft flew eastward from the Heenes ' neighborhood , though officials could n't immediately confirm how fast it was going .
Watch the balloon float thousands of feet over Colorado »
Authorities said the silver balloon , 20 - feet long and 5 - feet high , at times reached 7,000 feet above the ground while adrift .
It was found more than 90 minutes later in a field near Colorado Springs .
The story took a turn when ABC said that Falcon 's parents , science enthusiasts Richard and Mayumi Heene , were featured on the 100th episode of ABC 's prime - time program " Wife Swap " in March 2009 .
According to the network 's Web site , the Heene family " devote (s ) their time to scientific experiments that include looking for extraterrestrials and building a research - gathering flying saucer to send into the eye of the storm . "
Richard Heene is a meteorologist and former television weatherman who has submitted to CNN iReports accounts of his sons helping him chase Hurricane Gustav , among other contributions .

Rescuers from several counties followed the saucer - like vessel until it made a soft landing some 90 miles away .
Officials rushed to the scene of the landing , smacking the metallic balloon until it deflated .
They looked inside -- no Falcon .
At that point , there were two possibilities : Either Falcon never got in the balloon , or he fell out .
Authorities began to fear the worst after reports surfaced that a box possibly carrying Falcon may have fallen off the balloon .
A Weld County Sheriff 's deputy had said he saw an object fall off the balloon somewhere over Platteville , Colorado , which is in the search area .
There was no box attached when the balloon landed at 1:35 p.m .
See map of balloon 's trip »
The widespread worries prompted the Colorado Air National Guard to deploy a UH 60 Black Hawk helicopter , with plans to launch a second one equipped with night vision if necessary .
The search , which initially focused on Weld County , covered " the entire flight plan , from the Fort Collins area down to the Denver International Airport area , " Col. Mark Riccardi said .
But a little while later , Falcon turned up at home .
Larimer County Sheriff James
Alderden said it 's not uncommon for children to seek cover when they realize they 're the subject of a massive search .
" They hide because they think they are in trouble , " he said .
" What was confusing was the eyewitness who said [ Falcon ] climbed into the apparatus , which was not the case , " Alderden said , referring to the boy 's brother .
The sheriff said the brother was interviewed several times by investigators and that he was consistent with his story .
Marc Friedland , the family 's next - door neighbor , said he saw Richard Heene working on the giant Mylar balloon in the backyard .

" Basically , the whole family was out there and they were working with it , " he said .
" When I came back is when I found out that the event happened . "
He said the aircraft was intended to hover around 20 feet in the air and was not intended to carry people .
" Obviously , something went wrong with that . "
Friedland described his neighbors as " a great family . "
" They 're unusual , yes , of course .
He 's sort of a scientist - slash - inventor .
They 're storm chasers -- they go after tornadoes , hurricanes , things like that , " he said .
" He 's a great kid , " Friedland said of Falcon .
" We see him a lot and they come over and they 're always friendly . "

Icebergs Moving To New Zealand
At least 100 icebergs are moving in towards New Zealand prompting shipping warnings which are rare events .
Some of the icebergs are measuring up to 200 meters ( 650 feet ) wide .
According to satellite photography , the icebergs already passed the Auckland Islands and are just 450 kilometers ( 280 miles ) away from the South Island of New Zealand .
Australian Antarctic Division glaciologist Neal Young told AFP that all of the icebergs came from just one massive ice block that broke away from the Antarctic due to rising sea and air temperatures which is an effect of global warming .
The original ice block supposedly measured about 30 square kilometers ( 11.6 square miles ) .
New Zealand issued the navigational warnings for the area .
The last time icebergs went near the country was in 2006 when a number of icebergs floated within 25 kilometers of the coastline .
It is still possible that the current set may not go very near South Island .
Young indicated that as long as the temperature keeps on rising , more icebergs will float in the area .
LESSONS IN TANK TACTICS
Two examples of the use of tanks in conjunction with infantry and artillery were analyzed in an article which was published recently in Red Star .
In one example the reasons for heavy casualties are indicated while the other example illustrates how a mission may be accomplished with minimum losses .
A translation of the Red Star article follows :
* * *
The speed of forward movement of tanks on the battlefield is one of the basic questions of tank tactics .
It is the tendency of the commander who has tanks at his disposal to make use of their mobility to increase the general speed of the unit .
This policy conforms completely with modern tactics and should be followed as often as possible .
However it is necessary to take into consideration all the conditions under which the tanks will have to operate .
A tank maneuver must be well - prepared and it must receive all - around support .
A few examples from actual combat experience may help to make this point clear .
A detachment composed of tanks , artillery and motorized infantry was ordered to exploit the success of troops who had thrown the enemy back from his main defense line .
Specifically , the detachment 's mission was to attack and advance 12 to 15 miles to the enemy 's rear and capture a village , thereby cutting the route of the enemy 's retreat .
The detachment started on its mission at dawn .
The tank regiment , in march column formation , was in front .
The commander of the regiment was told that security and reconnaissance units would operate along his route .
Information concerning the enemy was very meager .
All that was known was that our [ the Russian ] units , having driven the enemy back from a certain line of defense , were pursuing them in a south - westerly direction .
The tank regiment moved at high speed , preceded at a distance of approximately a mile by an advance group of four tanks .
When these tanks reached Hill 212.8 they were fired on from the left flank and were forced to withdraw behind the hill .
The commander of the regiment believed that a reconnaissance detachment was operating somewhere in advance of the regiment , but he did not meet it .
Later it became known that the reconnaissance and security parties had not been sent out ; they had been forgotten in the general rush .
The commander of the regiment then decided to leave most of the tanks concealed north of Hill 212.8 and reconnoiter the enemy positions in combat .
This was done with the help of one tank company . *
As soon as the attacking forces passed by the hill , they were met with flank and cross fire ; also they were bombed heavily from the air .
Some tanks reached Hill 221.3 but the company was soon compelled to withdraw .
However reconnaissance data which was obtained made it possible not only to determine the general character of the enemy 's defense but also the location of his artillery .
In the vicinity of Hill 221.3 , in different places , there were 13 guns and 7 self - propelled mounts which kept Hill 212.8 and the whole field south of it under fire .
In addition , five German tanks were located .
Without the support of artillery it would be difficult to break through such a barrier by a frontal tank attack .
About half an hour would be needed to bring the artillery and infantry up to Hill 212.8 and to open fire against the enemy .
Since the enemy defense to the right was not so strong , our tanks could pass around Hill 212.8 and by following the ravine could gain Hill 221.3 without much interference and then be in the rear of the enemy 's artillery positions .
However , the commander of the main Russian detachment did not consider it necessary to spend time in coordinating his forces .
Without waiting for the artillery and the mortars ( only one battery arrived at the position in time ) the commander ordered all the tanks to attack .
The tanks moved forward , deployed in a line .
As soon as they came up over the hill , the Germans opened intensive fire .
To pass through the fire zone the Russian tanks moved forward at full speed and reached Hill 221.3 in a comparatively short time .
The enemy wavered and then began to withdraw .
A certain tactical advantage had been gained , but at the cost of unnecessary losses .
Several of the Russian tanks had been disabled thereby restricting the possibilities of exploiting the advantage .
It may be said that this battle was characteristic in the sense of providing for a given high speed in the forward movement of tanks .
The commander was right in trying to keep up the high speed of forward movement of the tanks , for the situation demanded it : but he made a mistake in hurriedly throwing his tanks against a strongly fortified antitank position .
In such situations it is necessary to provide for the constant forward movement of tanks , not only to demand it .
The mistakes of the commander of the main detachment were as follows :
(1) He did not provide for proper reconnaissance during the offensive , with the result that the encounter with the enemy was unexpected .
(2) When the enemy 's defense system and fire power had been determined , the commander hurried unnecessarily to attack with his tanks without the support of the artillery , of which there was sufficient quantity , but which had not been drawn up in time .
(3) The commander paid too much attention to the fast forward movement of the tanks and forgot about the organization of the battle .
Unfortunately , situations like this one above may still be found .
There still are commanders who continue to urge on the tanks , at the same time forgetting the elementary principles of combat organization and the fact that time spent preparation will always be compensated tenfold .
In reviewing the battle we see that it would have taken only a half hour to organize the cooperation of tanks , infantry and artillery .
This would have helped not only to deliver a telling blow on the enemy ; it would also have provided the conditions for a quick and deep movement toward the objective .
There was unnecessary haste in throwing the tanks into the zone of the heaviest antitank fire .
This restricted their maneuvers and caused unnecessary losses .
In combat there are times , of course , when it is necessary to rush forward without taking into consideration many circumstances .
However , in ninety cases out of a hundred , it is possible to find the time and means to provide for a high rate of forward movement without unnecessary loss .
The best method for saving time is thorough preparation of the operation and its quick execution .
This method is more to the point than an undiscriminating push which is sure to end in a sudden halt .
Some of the finest operations that have been carried out by our troops were characterized by thorough preparation and swift action .
On another occasion this regiment succeeded in carrying out an attack at a relatively high rate of speed .
Here is a brief description of this situation and the terrain .
In the direction of the enemy ran a railroad track , along which , according to the initial plan , the Russian tanks were to attack and move forward to a certain village .
There was a highway at the left of the railroad track .
In front of the village there were several small wooded areas .
Still nearer was an elongated hill which cut the highway and extended as far as the railroad track .
Having concealed his tanks behind the hill , the commander learned by observation that the Germans had several antitank guns along the road .
Also signs of the enemy were noted on the outskirts of the wooded area in front of the village which was to be attacked .
The commander of the regiment was convinced that the movement of tanks along the railroad line would be difficult since the banks of the railway - cut were very steep and there were deep , narrow channels on either side of the track .
He decided to send the tanks along the highway , where the terrain was most favorable .
The infantry was to follow the railroad line , maintaining fire liaison with the tanks .
The plan was to neutralize the German antitank guns , which were placed along the highway , by a sudden attack .
Results were soon realized .
The tanks rushed at full speed into the antitank gun positions and smashed the guns , the crews of which had scattered .
Without lessening speed , the tanks broke into the woods and exterminated a number of Germans there .
Most of those Germans were having their dinner when the tanks appeared and so the enemy troops were unable to reach their guns in time to fight a defensive action .
The tanks then passed around the right side of the woods and headed for the village but they were compelled to stop by swampy terrain ( see fig . 2 ) .
This gave the enemy an opportunity to bring artillery into action and open fire on the approaches to the village .
Instead of forcing his way forward , the commander withdrew his tanks to a shelter behind the woods and remained there , awaiting the arrival of his infantry .
Then both infantry and tanks , in close cooperation , attacked the village and drove the Germans out .
Thus the objective was achieved .
In the first example presented in this article , the high rate of speed of the tanks did not reduce their losses , while in the second example the tanks not only succeeded in maintaining a high rate of speed but also they achieved success without loss .
The reason for this was that in the first battle , suddenness of action was lacking , and also ( because of the commander 's haste ) the tanks could not maneuver although the situation called for maneuvering .
In the second battle the tank commander had ample time to prepare the attack well and to choose the most favorable direction .
Although this took time , the results were excellent .
The commander estimated the situation correctly in general although it might have been practicable to have sought a different route when the tanks reached the swamp .
The element of surprise had run its course ; further movement had to be based on close cooperation with the infantry .
This was skillfully achieved , and at the same time the general tempo of the attack was not lost .
After taking the village , the tank unit pushed right on .
In conclusion it may be said that at all times the commander estimated the situation correctly , acting neither too slowly or too hastily .
Well - thought - out organization during every phase of the attack produces high speed in the forward movement of tanks , no matter under what conditions they may be operating .

Washington ( CNN ) --
Two people without invitations crashed President Obama 's first White House state dinner , the U.S. Secret Service said Wednesday .
The Secret Service confirmed a Washington Post report that the couple who crashed Tuesday night 's dinner were Tareq and Michaele Salahi .
The Post described the couple as polo- playing socialites from northern Virginia .
A Secret Service checkpoint " did not follow proper procedures " to determine if the two were on the guest list for the dinner , said Edwin M. Donovan , a Secret Service special agent , in a statement .
Playing down any security threat , Donovan 's statement said : " It is important to note that these individuals went through magnetometers and other levels of security , as did all guests attending the dinner . "
The incident represents a security breach for the White House at the Obama administration 's biggest social event to date .
More than 300 guests , including Cabinet members , diplomats and Hollywood celebrities , attended the dinner in honor of visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .
" The Secret Service has tasked our Office of Professional Responsibility with conducting a comprehensive review of the incident , " Donovan 's statement said .
Video footage of the dinner showed the couple walking past journalists into the event .
On Wednesday , Michaele Salahi's Facebook page included photos of the couple at the dinner , including two pictures with Vice President Joe Biden and another with Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , who was identified on the page as " Ron " Emanuel .
The couple 's names did not appear on the guest list distributed Tuesday by the White House .
In an e-mail to CNN , Mahogany Jones , who identified herself as a publicist for the Salahis , said the couple had " full clearance to attend the state dinner . "
Fran Townsend , a homeland security adviser to former President George W. Bush , said the incident likely involved a breakdown at the " perimeter " security for the event , which is the first checkpoint that guests encounter .
Lying to the Secret Service could bring a felony charge , Townsend said .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday said the nation will not have a " real market - based financial system until it 's safe to let a financial firm fail . "
Bernanke , who also said the country must devise an alternative to the government bailout of a financial firm considered too large to let fail .
The Fed chief made his comments in a question - and - answer period following an address on the economy .
For quite some time I have had a pet peeve about the make - up of the Oiler roster .
Too many young unproven guys , too many old expensive guys , and nowhere near enough prime - of - career guys .
I wrote this and this on the subject last April , noting the gaping hole in the middle of the age spectrum .
What has changed so far in 2009 - 10 ?
Let 's look at the forwards .
So far this season Oilers have already used 19 (! ) of them .
I have divided them into 5 groups , by hockey age ( as of Feb 1 , 2010 , as defined by Hockey - reference.com ) :
Entry level ( age 20 - 22 ) : Cogliano , Gagner , O'Marra
Developing ( age 23 -25 ) : Brulé , Jacques , McDonald , Nilsson , O'Sullivan , Potulny , Reddox , Stone , Stortini
Prime ( age 26 - 28 ) : Hemsky , Penner
Late prime ( age 29 -31 ) : Comrie , Horcoff , MacIntyre
Veterans ( age 32-34 ) : Moreau , Pisani
If that seems like a lot of developing players , it is .
Let 's check out the distribution by number of players , number of GP given those players , and percentage of ice time .
Age #fwds % fwds %GP %TOI 20 - 22 3 15.8 % 17.5 % 17.3 % 23-25 9 47.4 % 43.8 % 39.8 % 26-28 2 10.5 % 15.3 % 19.5 % 29-31 3 15.8 % 13.4 % 14.6 % 32-34 2 10.5 % 10.0 % 8.8 %
( The same categories are represented by the blue , red , and green lines respectively in the graph up top .
Sorry for its poor quality , although it 's much better if you click to view it in full size .
New and improved ! )
Pat Quinn has ridden his prime time horses -- both of them -- pretty much as hard as he can .
Still , for every minute one of them spends on the ice , younger players have received nearly 3 minutes .
So what have all these developing players done with said ice time ?
Results after the jump ...
Age G/ GP P/GP +-/GP G/60 P/60 +-/60 20-22 0.14 0.45 -0.08 0.58 1.82 -0.07 23-25 0.16 0.40 - 0.23 0.73 1.77 - 1.07 26-28 0.45 1.06 +0.36 1.41 3.34 +1.16 29-31 0.23 0.44 - 0.20 0.86 1.64 - 1.12 32-34 0.13 0.22 -0.07 0.57 1.00 - 0.29
No surprise to see Penner and Hemsky with massively greater production on a per -game basis .
Even parsed on a per-minute basis their goals and points output is roughly double all of their teammates .
No adjustments have been made to account for powerplay time , which obviously will favour those players .
That said , the starkest contrast of all can be seen in the plus / minus columns , where the prime timers have been awesome while all other groups have bled goals against .
This is particularly noticeable in the age 23 - 25 bracket , where several still - not - ready - for - prime - time players have posted some underwhelming numbers at both ends of the rink : Robert Nilsson , 1 goal , - 12 ; J.F. Jacques , 2 goals , - 9 ; Patrick O'Sullivan , 4 goals , - 11 .
Ouch , ouch , and more ouch .
I 'm not for a moment suggesting that if the Oilers added a couple more players in their prime years they would produce on the level of Dustin Penner and Ales Hemsky .
I do , however , think the team would benefit from having something resembling a " cluster " of players around those peak years .
It was a problem identified last year , and one that was hardly solved with the addition of Mike Comrie .
Without getting into a statistical breakdown on the blueline , it is readily apparent that the Oilers have another big split in the experience levels of their players .
Of the 8 players with 10 + GP , four of them are currently age 26 or younger ( Gilbert turns 27 in January ) , and the other four age 33 or older .
Only 29 - year - old Dean Arsene ( 2 GP ) fills the void in between those two groups .
And in goal it's more of the same , where the choice is between old and breaking down or young and inexperienced .
On the roster as a whole , the Oilers have already used 31 players in 2009 - 10 .
Just 5 of those players -- Penner , Horcoff , Comrie , Arsene , and the departed Steve MacIntyre for goodness sake -- are currently between the ages of 27 - 32 .
Early results suggest it is not a recipe for success .
The bill coming out of Senate Finance is far from perfect , but they finished up last night with some key improvements adopted that mean some of the worst elements have been softened , and some of the worst Republican amendments were fought off .
There 's still some ugly there , though , for Harkin , Reid , and Baucus to deal with as the bills are merged , and when it eventually comes to the floor .
Probably the most significant improvement on affordability came last night when Schumer and Snowe successfully lowered the " Max Tax " .
The bill still has an individual mandate , but the penalties have been reduced .
Coming into the day ’s debate , the bill would have penalized families as much as $ 1,900 for going uninsured — a provision that drew sharp criticism from Sen.
Olympia Snowe , the Maine Republican being courted by Democrats as a possible supporter of the final bill .
“ I just do n’t understand , ” Snowe said , “ why there ’s this impetus to punish people . ”
Snowe struck a deal with Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) to delay all penalties for one year , then phase them in over a five - year span — two years longer than Schumer ’s original proposal .
Heeding a criticism of Sen. John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) , the Schumer / Snowe compromise also eliminated the possibility that folks might be slapped with criminal charges for failing to get coverage .
The proposal would also waive the individual mandate in cases when the cheapest available plan costs more than 8 percent of an individual ’s income — a softening of the original Baucus bill , which set the threshold at 10 percent .
Those exempt from the individual mandate would qualify for catastrophic coverage known as “ young invincibles ” plans .
The Schumer / Snowe amendment passed 22 to 1 , with only Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) voting against the measure .
That 's an improvement , but having mandates for anyone without a public option is still unacceptable .
And the bill still does n't have a public option .
In another affordability related amendment , they raised the thresholds at which high - cost insurance plans would be subject to an excise tax , a penalty that could have primarily hit employers with workers in high - risk jobs , like Sen .
Rockefeller 's coal miners .
The very valid fear was that the employers would pass the costs on to employees .
Wyden 's Free Choice
Act , which would be the beginning of chipping away at the employer - based syste had a very frosty reception on the panel last night .
The Act would allow both employers and employees greater participation in the exchange , opening it up essentially to everyone .
Coupled with a public option , the FCA could significantly enhance both choice and competition .
The proposal was too radical for the committee , and Baucus ruled it out of order .
Two of the more egregious Republican efforts were also defeated .
On Wednesday , they defeated in a 10 - 13 vote a Hatch amendment that would " bar any insurer receiving federal funds from covering abortion , unless women used their own money to buy auxiliary policies covering the procedure . "
The effort could have ended private insurance coverage of abortion -- any insurance provider that had subsidized participants would have to create those " auxiliary " policies to sell to women , and would have to have onerous accounting practices to prove that there was a firewall between their programs .
Conrad voted with the Republicans on this one , Snowe with the Democrats .
In their ongoing hate fest against brown people , Republicans last night pushed Kyl 's effort to force legal immigrants to endure a five year waiting perioed before they could participate in the exchange program -- i.e. , make them ineligible for subsidies -- for five years .
That one failed 13 - 10 on a strict party line vote .
Here 's one of the uglier ones they passed , and in basic secrecy , that would give states increasing flexibility to drop Medicaid patients , starting next year .
The original bill would have prohibited such dropped coverage , instead requiring states to maintain current levels of Medicaid eligibility until state insurance exchanges are up and running , which is expected to occur by the start of 2013 .
But several lawmakers argued that some states simply can’t afford to keep eligibility levels steady that long because ( 1 ) tax revenues are down amid the recession , ( 2 ) Medicaid enrollment is up , also because of the recession and ( 3 ) billions of dollars in extra federal funding provided by the economic stimulus bill will run dry at the start of 2011 — leaving a two year gap when enrollment would remain high but federal help would decrease .
The result , these lawmakers said , would be a bursting of already squeezed state budgets .
The Grassley / Snowe amendment , passed without public discussion and on a voice vote , allows states to start dropping non-pregnant , non-disabled adult earning above a 133 % of poverty threshold .
So if this amendment is preserved , from 2010 until 2013 when the exchange starts , we 're likely to see more uninsured Americans in some of the most economically challenged states .
As David notes , they are scheduled to meet today , but as they were up into the very wee hours this morning , they 'll likely not .
They will meet sometime next week to vote on reporting the bill out .
After that , assuming that Rockefeller , Cantwell , and Wyden feel their primary objections have been met and vote for it , it 's on to the merging process , where hopefully Senator Harkin will be able to prevail on a strong public option .
Fort Lauderdale , Florida ( CNN ) --
Three teens who allegedly set a 15 - year - old friend ablaze were charged Monday as adults , and with attempted murder , prosecutors said .
The state attorney 's office in Broward County , Florida , identified the three youths as Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent , age 15 , and Jesus Mendez , age 16 .
They are charged with one count each of attempted murder in the second degree in the October attack .
Two other boys also were taken into custody in the incident but prosecutors did not file charges against them , said Maria Schneider , assistant state attorney in charge of the county 's juvenile unit .
She emphasized that the investigation is continuing .
" This is a very active , ongoing investigation , " Schneider said .
" As additional information becomes available , then we have the option to revisit our filing decision . "
The two -- ages 13 and 15 -- were charged earlier in juvenile court with aggravated battery .
The three charged Monday as adults likely will be arraigned next week , according to prosecutors , who said the other two teens were being released from custody .
A lawyer representing Denver Jarvis said she does not think her client should be charged as an adult .
" The juvenile system is designed to deal with children criminally charged .
Broward county has chosen to ignore the juvenile system , " attorney Valerie Small Williams told CNN .
" My client has no criminal history other than a misdemeanor trespass .
I 'm pretty disappointed , " Williams said .
The victim , Michael Brewer remains in critical condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami , Florida , with burns over 65 percent of his body .
Brewer 's mother declined to comment on the charges , a hospital spokesman said .
Brewer is heavily sedated and a ventilator helping him breathe does not allow him to speak .
Bandages cover his open wounds , and the bandages must be changed daily in a painstaking four - hour process .
" People get sick real fast .
They get better slowly , and right now with him we 're getting a tiny bit better every day , " said Dr. Nicholas Namias , medical director of the burn center at Jackson Memorial Hospital .
Brewer has not been able to speak with police since his desperate fight for life began on October 12 , when five teenage friends allegedly doused him with rubbing alcohol and set him on fire .
The attack occurred after Brewer reported to police that one of them stole his father 's bicycle .
Police say the bicycle was stolen because Brewer did not pay one of the boys $ 40 for a video game .
According to police , witnesses said the teens called Brewer " a snitch " as they poured alcohol over him , and one of them used a lighter to set him on fire .
Last week , the mother of two of the alleged attackers issued a public apology to Brewer .
Sherry Jarvis , the mother of Denver Jarvis , who was charged Monday , and the 13 - year - old , said she prays for Brewer 's recovery .
" This is a horrible incident that should have never occurred , " said Sherry Jarvis .
" And we pray for Michael 's recovery every day -- that he gets stronger , which we know , in our hearts , that he will , " she said .
The Jarvis family has gotten death threats , according to the family , and an attorney for the 13 - year - old -- who was released from juvenile custody Monday night -- said " he 'll be headed out of the area . "
" He 's not going to be going home .
He 'll be staying with relatives out of the area , " attorney Stephen Melnick told CNN .
Dr. Namias said in an interview that burns of the magnitude suffered by Brewer are hard for most people to imagine .
" What I tell families when we meet in the family room at the start -- I have to explain to them this is really a big deal , this is not just a little skin condition , " he told CNN .
" His life and your family 's life have now changed forever . "
Namias says that Brewer has two things on his side -- his youth , and the fact that his hands and face are not burned , which can be physically and emotionally scarring .
" Our expectation is survival , and we would be devastated if he did n't .
But I do n't think that we would be surprised if he didn't , " Namias said .
Adobe is kicking off its Adobe MAX developer conference by announcing that version 10.1 of its Flash Player will run on mobile and embedded devices just as it does on the desktop .
The culmination of its Open Screen Project launched last year , the update to the rather ubiquitous browser plugin will finally synchronize the Flash experience on all platforms with the exception of arguably one of the most successful smartphones : Apple 's iPhone .
Previously , Adobe offered Flash Lite for some mobile operating systems , which was essentially an older version of Flash optimized for the lower - power processors in cell phones and other mobile devices .
Adobe announced the Open Screen Project last year in an attempt to bring a single , ubiquitous platform for developers to deliver rich media applications to desktops and mobile devices without requiring separate development .
Flash Player 10.1 attempts to provide a single runtime that should run identically on a Palm Pre , for instance , as it does on a Dell Mini or a Mac Pro .
It will be optimized for netbooks and so - called " smartbooks " in addition to smartphone platforms , and will utilize GPU acceleration whenever possible .
Flash Lite will still be available for lower - end devices .
The Open Screen Project has been hard at work coming up with a single version of the Flash Player , porting Flash and the AIR runtime to the ARM architecture , commonly used in most high - end smartphones .
Adobe has also partnered with a number of partners in the Open Screen Project .
The company announced today that RIM is joining the project and will collaborate with Adobe to bring Flash Player 10.1 to its BlackBerry operating system .
Adobe said that betas of Flash Player 10.1 will available for Windows Mobile and Palm 's webOS later this year , and expects betas for Google Android and SymbianOS to be ready in early 2010 .
Though it 's not surprising , absent from the flurry of announcements for smartphone platforms is any mention of Apple 's iPhone .
Apple has resisted Adobe 's efforts to provide a version of Flash that runs on the iPhone OS , and has made numerous efforts to develop or adopt technologies that offer open alternatives to Flash , such as HTML5 audio and video support , advanced CSS3 transformations and animations , and HTTP Live Streaming .
Though Google has openly supported many of the open alternatives to Flash as well , it has also joined the some 50 companies participating in the Open Screen Project .
With Apple appearing to be the sole remaining holdout in the mobile space , it seems that it may be more and more difficult for Apple to ignore Flash , especially if it becomes popular on other mobile platforms .
Should the Open Screen Project succeed as Adobe plans , however , it may also mean that open alternatives to Flash are relegated to also - ran status .
At times , even hearing your own name can make no sense .
“ James Dwyer . ”
The decal on the wall of the plane showed in little pictures how to open the emergency exit .
Yank the lever .
Fling the door open .
Then get out .
It was after 2 o’clock last Sunday , five hours since my daughter and I had arrived at La Guardia for a short trip to Columbus , Ohio .
A mechanical problem had hung up the flight .
In the next moment , it seemed that we would not be leaving New York even after all that time .
“ James Dwyer , ” the voice said again .
“ That ’s me . ”
Two men in vests stood in the aisle .
Maybe I was getting upgraded ?
“ You have to get off the plane , sir , ” one of them said .
“ Get your things . ”
My daughter , Catherine , a high school senior , was a few rows up .
She spotted me in the aisle and immediately got her backpack .
Within the hour , tours would be getting under way at a college in Ohio that she was seriously considering , and where we had intended to spend the night .
ok , so maybe it ’s not exactly the cat ’s meow …
Two IBM project leaders are arguing about the results of the Blue Matter experiments .
The critics seem to have the upper hand , scientifically speaking .
While the blogosphere and news agencies have been discussing IBM ’s claim of simulating the brainpower of a cat cortex and some of us have been discussing its potential use in artificial intelligence development , Dr. Henry Markram , the lead of a similar project backed by the same company , read the press release and went into a nuclear meltdown of blistering fury around the web .
According to his rebuttals , the Blue Matter team is just playing around with brute computing force and their claims are nothing but self - aggrandizing hype .
Is this a simple case of sour grapes ?
Well , the write - up at Fast Company included a link to a paper describing the setup behind the simulation in enough detail to see what was really being simulated and how , and as it turns out , the closest Blue Matter came to matching anything like a cat ’s brain was solely in the realm of analogies .
Rather than create a feline cortex or a reasonable emulation of one , the Blue Matter team created a statistical model of how neurons would act in a hypothetical brain and fired grids of neurons as fast as they could to get simulated readings of the noise produced in the process .
There were few specific structures or pathways of an actual cortex .
It was all about trying to create an efficient way for dealing with highly intensive computing on a very large scale .
The logic behind how the simulation would work is detailed in the intro of Section 3 , which deals not with how to accurately simulate the pathways of an actual cortex , but scalability issues in updating the status of a digital neuron on a tightly controlled cycle and digital synapses on an event - driven basis .
When neurons fire , they ’re updated twice ( on pre and post synaptic events ) .
As the neurons cycle , the synapses are updated through an architecture which lowers the cost of computing these events ( how resource intensive the process of updating the synapse statuses will be ) in a largely unspecified way .
Then , in Section 4 , we get some hint of structure as the paper mentions three types of neurons connected in loops .
However , we ’re only taking about a few loops in which neurons should fire rather than entire structures being reproduced and exposed to a stimulus supposedly mimicking signals from visual objects or sounds .
In the actual simulations , the sheets of neuron loops are fed arbitrary signals which just fire through their cycle .
This is still pretty cool stuff because the team is creating a tiny snapshot of how neurons in the brain fire under several algorithms .
But without an entire , carefully charted and modeled brain , all we ’re getting is just a teeny glimpse at how neural nodes go through their firing cycle according to a statistical model .
We ’re not getting a true sense of what happens in a feline brain when a cat sees an object or hears a sound .
The vast majority of what we would need to simulate that is absent .
And yet , because Modha ’s team created tens of thousands of sheets of these simple loops which amount to 1.6 billion neurons and 8.87 trillion synapses in total , they use this straight - line multiplications to claim that their simulation effectively exceeds the scale of a cat ’s cortex and lays the groundwork for even bigger models and ultimately , cognitive computing .
I really do n’t think that ’s how it works .
Their simulations do n’t actually compute anything or produce more than just a simulated EEG made by clouds of digital neurons as they fire through their loops .
There was no actual computing being done by those neurons , no result , no actual decision making , no response to the stimuli we would consider more meaningful than the completion of a circuit .
However , the whole purpose of a brain is its ability to make decisions .
Brainpower is n’t just the firing of neurons en masse .
It ’s how we deal with the world around us and solve complex tasks .
All that the Blue Matter experiments proved is that a supercomputer really can summon the brute computing force to run a scaled up loop through its paces .
As Modha notes in the intro to Section 5 , the simulation is missing all the intricate details of a cortex and the connections are based on a best estimate , which offers even more evidence to Markram ’s charges that simulations run by the Blue Matter team are n’t even in the same building as real feline brains , much less in the same sentence without the word “ not ” present .
The leap between firing a lot of neurons and computerized cognition is vast , and Blue Matter has barely inched in the cognitive direction , even with this much trumpeted experiment .
The misconception was made even worse when several gadget and tech blogs started referring to the results of the experiment as cat brain simulations and representing them as a potential development in bringing AI to life , since the point of this research is to make computers that can perform cognitive tasks .
And while we ca n’t blame Modha and the Blue Brain team for bloggers extrapolating the initial hype , we should note that their big claims are pretty daring exaggerations of their accomplishments .
To call their simulations a significant step in creating models able to emulate the brain ’s abilities is a little like calling your moped a potential precursor to a hyper - car that can go toe to toe with a Bugatti Veyron because you ’ve been able to tie a lot of mopeds together and you ’ve calculated that their combined velocity adds up to 250 mph .

Nature reports from three laboratories scrutinizing the pandemic flu virus .
As the world mobilizes against the H1N1 flu pandemic , researchers are working to answer pressing questions about the virus .
Brendan Maher visited pathologists at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who are looking at how the virus kills , and a New York laboratory that is testing how it spreads .
Declan Butler spent time at a French biosafety level - 4 facility where researchers are working out the chances that the pandemic virus will reassort with the H5N1 avian flu virus .
1 . How does it kill ?
There are five sets of eyepieces on the microscope , and Sherif Zaki is looking down one of them .
Looking down the other four are members of the team he leads at the infectious - disease pathology branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in Atlanta , Georgia .
Other researchers trained in epidemiology , microbiology and electron microscopy watch a large , flat - screen monitor at the end of the narrow conference room that shows an image projected from the microscope .
Dianna Blau , an epidemiologist , reveals the source of the tissue : an 11 - year - old girl who died in September , probably from H1N1 influenza .
The team had already detected viral RNA in the girl 's samples .
But observing the presence of the H1N1 virus , especially in this tissue from deep down in the lungs , provides a more accurate and detailed diagnosis .
The tissue seems messy , and is flooded with blue - stained Staphylococcus aureus .
Zaki scans back and forth across the slide , seeking the hint of red staining that would indicate the presence of antibodies bound to the H1N1 virus .
He finds it on one slide , where a red blob indicates a profusion of virus being released from a rupturing cell .
They mark her as positive .
“ H1N1 looks like avian flu on steroids . ” Sherif Zaki
Zaki's lab holds these ' sign out ' meetings every afternoon , examining autopsy and other tissues that have been sent to the CDC from doctors and medical examiners around the world to find , confirm or rule out any number of diseases .
Since April , their case load has doubled thanks to H1N1 .
So far , the group has received samples from more than 300 suspect cases , and it has confirmed swine flu in more than a third of them .
In addition to providing a diagnosis , the group 's analyses are helping to build up a picture of how the virus kills .
Pathological studies can show what tissues are affected and to what extent , adding detail to the worldwide monitoring and surveillance efforts .
The profile emerging is of a distinctive virus .
Although seasonal flu tends to infect just the cells high in the upper airway , H1N1 penetrates down into the terminal air sacs called alveoli .
" This is not an area of the lung where you would usually see seasonal flu , " Zaki says .
He has seen such behaviour before , though — in the few samples of lung tissue he has examined from humans killed by the H5N1 avian flu virus .
But the virus is much more prevalent in the tissues from the severe H1N1 cases he has examined — " like avian flu on steroids " as Zaki puts it .
Zaki says that his observations fit well with recent research looking at the mechanism of infection .
A group led by Mikhail Matrosovich at Philipps University Marburg in Germany and Ten Feizi at Imperial College London studied sialyl glycans , glycoproteins that the flu virus binds to in order to gain entry to human cells1 .
Although seasonal strains of H1N1 bind mostly to versions of the glycoproteins known as α2 - 6 , the researchers found that the new pandemic H1N1 can also bind to a version called α2 - 3 , which is found in greater proportion in the lower respiratory tract .
Co-infection is common with pandemic H1N1 , at least in those who have died .
Zaki's group has observed infection with bacteria such as S. aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae in about a third of the fatal swine - flu cases it has examined .
In the rest , the virus seems to be lethal on its own .
Zaki slots onto the microscope stage a slide from a 38 - year - old male who died without bacterial co-infection .
This one is filled with the red staining ; also the walls of the alveoli are ruptured and blood cells and fluid fill the spaces normally reserved for gas exchange .
Scar - like pink ribbons , called hyaline membranes , arc through the tissue .
Pathologists call this state ' diffuse alveolar damage ' , and it tells them that the man had respiratory distress syndrome .
" It 's very difficult to treat a patient once they get to this state , " Zaki says .
He points out that the man was obese and had a history of hypertension and heart problems .
Some 90 % of the cases his team has reviewed have had some underlying medical condition .
Zaki says that they plan to publish some of their observations soon , and he has been sharing them with others at the CDC and with the public - health community at large .
Although pathology can't predict what the virus will do in the future , it can help to identify those most at risk of severe disease .
" We 've really learned a lot with the lab pathology , " says Anne Schuchat , director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases .
" Both the prominence of the pneumonia in some infections and bacterial co-infection have important clinical implications , " she says , explaining that pathology results have led the CDC to recommend pneumococcal vaccination for people in at - risk groups .
At the end of the sign - out meeting , Zaki walks back to his office through a quiet lab ; the technicians have gone home for the day and the machines used to prepare and stain slides are silent .
Six fresh case studies in purple folders sit in a neat row along one of the lab benches ready for processing and examination .
They contain slides or tissue embedded in paraffin : one still has lumps of formalin - soaked flesh sitting in a plastic specimen jar .
As the flu season ramps up , Zaki says , he suspects the number of flu cases will increase dramatically .
Still , his lab sees only a small slice of what 's happening worldwide .
" We 're looking at the tip of the iceberg in terms of these cases , " he says .
It 's a grim job , reading the tales of the dead , but he adds " that information is important for the living " .

2 . How does it spread ?
In a cramped locker room high above the streets of upper Manhattan , laboratory personnel take a visiting journalist into the emerging pathogens facility , an enhanced biosafety level 3 ( BSL - 3 ) laboratory on the New York campus of Mount Sinai School of Medicine .
The suiting - up procedure is complicated .
Rubber - soled booties must be tucked under a jumpsuit to ensure that spilled fluids do n't drip into them .
Purple latex gloves are layered underneath green ones ; the different colours are used to ensure that rips in the outer layer are visible .
Black N95 face masks pinch off the nostrils , forcing the wearer to breathe noisily through his or her mouth .
The staff call them Darth Vader masks .
They also wear papery mesh scrubs and white ' bunny suit ' coveralls made from the material used to insulate houses .
Biosafety officer Philip Hauck quotes Dante as he prepares to go in : " Abandon all hope ye who enter here . "
In another preparatory room , they add heavy , belted , battery - powered air filters with a hose that hooks into the back of a white head - covering .
Once it 's adjusted , air begins rushing up over the face , puffing up the suit .
The positive pressure in the suit , combined with the negative air pressure in the lab , ensures that the flow of air will carry any airborne pathogens away from the body .
This is the procedure that researchers at Mount Sinai go through every day to carry out their animal studies on deadly pathogens .
Since May , pandemic H1N1 has been one of those pathogens .
As the pandemic was emerging , John Steel and Anice Lowen secured strains of novel H1N1 from California and the Netherlands , and made plans to include them in their work modelling the transmission of influenza in guinea pigs .
BSL - 3 facilities are not required to work with H1N1 , but Steel and Lowen 's institutional review boards wanted the work to be carried out under the most stringent conditions on site .
Many labs use ferrets to model the transmission and pathology of human viruses , but the animals can be difficult to work with .
Peter Palese , the head of microbiology at Mount Sinai , came up with the idea to work with guinea pigs a few years ago after reading an article published after the 1918 influenza pandemic , in which researchers in New Mexico noted that the infection had killed off a number of laboratory guinea pigs2 .
He convinced Lowen and Steel , assistant professors in his lab , to test whether the creatures would transmit human influenza .
They did .
In 2006 , the group showed that the guinea pigs pass the virus between them with about the same efficiency as humans3 , and the researchers still use them as a model of transmission even though their animals , purchased from a lab supplier , do not show symptoms or die from the disease .
The first thing the researchers did with the samples of pandemic H1N1 was to compare its transmissibility with that of seasonal flu .
They squirted about 10,000 infectious H1N1 particles up the noses of four guinea pigs and , a day later , placed these animals in cages next to uninfected animals , separated by wire - mesh walls that allow respiratory droplets to pass through .
Within five days all the exposed animals tested positive for the virus .
The team 's paper , published last month in the Journal of Virology , suggests that the H1N1 swine flu virus transmits just as efficiently as seasonal flu4 .
This is contrary to some work on transmission done at the start of the pandemic5 but mirrors real - world data showing that H1N1 spreads rapidly .
" The pandemic sort of scooped us , " says Lowen .
Palese 's group also found that previous exposure to the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of seasonal influenza limits the ability of exposed animals to become infected with the pandemic H1N1 , which supports the idea that a seasonal flu infection or vaccine might offer some cross-protection against swine flu .
Inside the facility are the huge steel ferret cages that Steel and Lowen have adapted for their guinea - pig work so that two animals can fit inside each .
They are now planning new experiments , hoping to find the sequences within the genome that enable the virus to transmit so well between humans compared with other swine - adapted influenza strains .
They may create reassortments of the virus and then test how well they are transmitted by the guinea pigs .
The results might aid in surveillance efforts aimed at identifying other strains from animals that could make the leap to humans .
Everything that goes into the BSL - 3 lab must be decontaminated before coming out .
This involves spraying down the bodysuit with ethanol , carefully peeling it off and then leaving the facility by way of a shower room .
A pen and notepad wo n't survive the caustic chemical dunk by the exit , so the pages are scanned and put onto a CD that can be sprayed down .
Outside again on the Manhattan streets , H1N1 could be encountered in any cough or sneeze .
Without all the protective gear , one feels rather vulnerable .

3 . What could it turn into ?
A deadly line - up of viruses is locked up in the computer - controlled safes at the Jean Mérieux / INSERM biosecurity level four ( BSL - 4 ) facility in Lyon , France , including Ebola , Nipah , Lassa , Hendra and Marburg .
And in the next few weeks , scientists working there are planning to manufacture a new resident .
They hope to test whether the highly transmissible pandemic H1N1 virus could reassort with its deadlier cousin , the H5N1 avian flu , to make a virus with the worst properties of both .
Classed as a national high - security facility , the laboratory is a three - storey shoebox made from armoured glass , perched above a biology research centre of INSERM , the national biomedical agency .
The edifice is built to withstand earthquakes , bullets and explosives .
It is also smack in the city centre , its entrance just metres from mothers pushing prams along the pavement on avenue Tony Garnier .
Suited up : extensive precautionary measures have to be followed in biosafety level - 4 labs .
P. LATRON / INSERM
The lab itself is surrounded by empty corridors and a spartan decor of steel staircases , trusses , raised walkways and ventilation pipes .
The air hums from the air - ultrafiltration and other support machinery that take up entire floors above and below .
Under negative air pressure to stop viruses escaping in the event of a breach , the lab is split into three zones , with the airstream flowing towards the ' hottest ' exposure risk zone , the animal house at the back .
When the current H1N1 pandemic began in April , priority lab time here was allocated to Bruno Lina , a virologist and flu researcher at the CNRS , France 's basic - research agency , who works at the University of Claude Bernard Lyon - 1 . Pandemic H1N1 influenza is not itself a BSL - 4 agent — a BSL - 2 facility is adequate .
But in France , the health ministry classes viral reassortment experiments of the sort Lina is performing as requiring BSL - 4 precautions .
The ability to predict which reassortments might take place , and what type of flu viruses might result , could be key to predicting the behaviour of this and future pandemics .
The eight genes in the influenza virus 's segmented genome are easily swapped between strains .
But to be viable , new gene combinations must also be able to work together to package themselves into a virus particle .
Viruses within a subtype tend to reassort with one another more easily and generate more viable reassortants than do those from different subtypes .
Over the summer , Lina 's team has been using the BSL - 4 facility to investigate the likelihood that pandemic H1N1 will acquire resistance to the front - line antiviral drug oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) through reassortment , and how easily these reassortants might spread .
Resistance can emerge by spontaneous mutation , but given that seasonal H1N1 is already resistant to the drug and spreads easily , reassortment is perhaps the most likely way that pandemic H1N1 will acquire resistance — especially as seasonal H1NI and pandemic H1N1 are the same subtype .
Since the start of the pandemic , Tamiflu - resistant strains have sporadically appeared in several countries but none has yet gained a foothold .
That they have n't arisen more often or spread more easily may be because there is little seasonal H1N1 circulating , as pandemic H1N1 is outcompeting it — a large number of co-infections are needed for transmissible reassortants to arise .
In his work , Lina co-cultured the two H1N1 viruses in a cell line .
He is now testing how pathogenic the reassortants are in mice , before using ferrets to test their capacity to spread .
The biggest hazard that the scientists face in the lab is a bite or a scratch from an infected animal , so all manipulations are done on animals that have been anaesthetized remotely .
Lina is also preparing to submit a protocol to the facility 's scientific board seeking the green light to try to reassort pandemic H1N1 and the H5N1 avian flu virus .
" It 's controversial research , but it is basic science that needs to be done , " says Lina .
H5N1 has killed more than half of the people it has infected since it resurged in 2003 , but has rarely spread from one person to another .
H1N1 , on the other hand , seems to be as transmissible as seasonal flu , but mild in most people , if severe in some .
The aim of Lina 's proposal is to find out the probability of a reassortant arising that combines the lethality of H5N1 with the transmissibility of H1N1 .
“ It 's controversial research , but it is basic science that needs to be done . ”
Bruno Lina
In particular , Lina is searching for putative molecular controls of the virus 's segmented genome that may determine why some reassortants can package the virus and others can't .
" We do n't know which regions in H5N1 are responsible for that control , " says Lina .
That could have benefits for disease surveillance , he says .
If researchers know the key genetic regions that facilitate reassortment , surveillance efforts could watch out for H5N1 or H1N1 viruses with changes in those regions , ones that might be on the verge of dangerous reassortments .
Lina will use reverse genetics to generate a soup of reassortants , test whether any are viable , and if they are , assess their virulence and transmissibility .
Because H1N1 and H5N1 are different subtypes , Lina does not expect them to swap genes easily .
In 2005 , he tried to reassort H5N1 with seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses , without success .
" After a year we only had three reassortants , and none was fit , " recalls Lina , " they just do n't reassort well . "
The experiments that Lina 's team is carrying out in the BSL - 4 lab are n't technically novel or difficult in themselves .
But the encumbrance of the safety procedures for getting in and out of the high - security lab make even the most straightforward procedures complicated , says Lina .
Looking through the bulletproof window , one can see why .
As the researchers move around the lab , they connect and disconnect their blindingly white spacesuits from some 60 yellow air hoses dangling from the ceiling .
The hands of the researchers snipping away at tissue samples are wrapped in multiple layers of gloves to avoid accidental pricks .
" It 's like trying to do surgery wearing boxing gloves , " says Hervé Raoul , director of the facility .
Before researchers can even begin to work in the lab , they must pass a three - week training course .
It 's only after a further 200 hours of practice that they are given any real autonomy in the lab , and they are never allowed inside alone .
Users are limited to working a maximum of one four - hour shift a day , so that they are less likely to make mistakes .
They are also encouraged to share any concerns about the behaviour of colleagues , or whether they themselves are going through a difficult patch , which might cause distraction and accidents .
Before Lina 's experiments get approved , the facility 's external scientific board will need to be convinced of the public - health justification , that the science is top - notch and that the experiments can be done safely , says Raoul .
It will also need to be approved by government regulatory agencies .
If all goes well , he could have his authorization in weeks , Lina says .

Ingraham : Pelosi did everything but " sell her own body " on health vote
Conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham -- who , as far as I recall , was n't at Saturday night 's health care vote in the House -- seems to have discovered a heretofore unrevealed Nancy Pelosi lobbying tactic .
Speaking on FOX , Ingraham announced that the speaker did everything but " sell her own body " to win the 220 - to - 215 vote .

DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Dubai World has refused to offload assets at fire - sale prices to repay obligations , forcing it to seek a debt standstill , a newspaper report on Sunday quoted an unnamed source at the government - controlled firm as saying .
Stocks from Tokyo to New York have been haunted by concern that banks were exposed to state companies in Dubai , though world leaders expressed confidence in the global economic recovery on Friday despite the fears .
“ The group absolutely refused in the last few months to sell a number of good investment and property assets at low prices , ” al - Ittihad newspaper said , quoting a source at Dubai World , the holding company at the center of Dubai ’s debt crisis .
Last Wednesday , the government of Dubai asked to delay payment on billions of dollars of debt issued by conglomerate Dubai World and its main property subsidiary Nakheel , as it restructured the Dubai World group .
The restructuring is expected to focus on property and foreign investments which have been worst hit by the economic crisis , the source said .
“ Asset sales should be commercially fair to meet the group long - term strategic goals , beyond the immediate economic pressures , ” the source added .
Brook plays a Women 's Institute member who appears nude for charity Posters promoting a play starring actress Kelly Brook have had to be changed because buns covering her breasts were deemed to be too small .
The posters for Calendar Girls featured a nude photograph of the star holding iced buns up to her chest .
Transport for London ( TfL ) demanded the buns be enlarged before allowing the poster to be used in Tube stations .
The play 's producer David Pugh said : " We 've found ourselves in the world of censorship , we 're in 1960s Russia . "
Brook plays the role of Celia in the West End play , which tells the story of Women 's Institute members who decide to bare all for a charity calendar .
The original calendar sold 800,000 copies worldwide .
The story inspired the 2003 film on which the stage play is based .
Mr Pugh said he found TfL 's decision " incredible " and said similar shots of cast members Jerry Hall and Gaynor Faye were used in previous posters .
I do n't know what the buns would be in bra sizes but we 've gone four sizes up
Producer David Pugh
" Someone is sitting in a dark room somewhere peering at any sort of nudity , " he said .
" The whole truth of the story that I 'm doing is about this group of ordinary women who did something extraordinary .
I 'm replicating what they did . "
Mr Pugh added : " They said we were trying to titillate Tube travellers , I thought it was a joke .
" I do n't know what the buns would be in bra sizes but we 've gone four sizes up . "
A TfL spokesman said : " We worked with the advertiser to ensure that the advert complied with our policy .
" We will be carrying an amended version of the advert on the Tube network . "
Fittingly , one of the most memorable lines in both the film and play is uttered by Chris , the driving force behind the calendar , as preparations are made for the naked photo - shoot .
" We 're going to need considerably bigger buns . "

What it is
Buzzword warning : VR environment for stationary cycling .
More usefully described , this project uses a head - mounted - display that has sensors for detection of orientation so that the user can be placed into a Google StreetView scene and can look around freely .
For movement through the map , an exercise bike used to estimate forward movement using a simple reed switch that counts the number of revolutions of the wheel .
Pragmatically explained , it means that I do n't have to sit in the darkness or stare at my garage door while I 'm huffing away .
Hopefully once this is done , I 'll be able to spend a few nights a week pedalling away downstairs and work my way across the US or Australia over the course of the year .
The irony of this project is , well , while it 's supposed to help me entain myself while using the exercise bike , the project itself has been keeping me from exercising .
Oh well .
It is also a project that I would be thrilled if someone took the idea and made a decent implementation out of it .
Make it user focused and reliable and I 'll be the first to use it .
What it is n't
Stable .
Finished .
Easy to use .
This was just borne out of a desire to scratch an itch .
At this point , this itch has been scratched , however , as released project , I 'd say that it 's incomplete .
Unfortunately , this project is n't for someone who is n't versed in linux , javascript , perl , and some arduino / electronics .

Since people ask why I do n't go lift the garage door
In the summer I was doing real road riding that totaled 200 km a week .
I love this form of transportation : it 's at your own schedule , do n't have to fight with transit , no guilt and I find it therapeutic .
For some time leading into the fall , I was using both my main bike for commutes and my wife 's bike on the trainer for spinning , which helped me keep a higher revolution rate for extended periods on flat stretches .
NB .
I have problems walking after using the trainer , it 's a proper workout .
It also helped , I could tell that there was an improvement in my cruising speed .
Weather 's not so pleasant now with it raining most of the time and dark .
I also have to change clothing after every ride and my shoes are soaked through after the first ride .
I keep an extra pair of shoes at the office but have to return to the yucky wet pair the ride home .
Round trip is 2 hours that takes up times of prime productivity for me .
I 'd rather ride at around 9 and burn myself out for the evening .
If the researchers are correct , I do n't need to go hard for a length of time , short periods of activity that add to a similar amount of time will have a similar beneficial effect for the body .
So this project helps me take away these excuses for not going out when it 's too annoying to do so .
It also has a really cool educational component .
I 'm still getting into shape but if I travel through the continent with this thing , it gives me not only a goal but an appreciation for how wide and varied this continent is .
Think of it : I will have personally turned that wheel over 5000 kms at about 2 meters per revolution and spent the time looking at what every state along the way has to offer for view and ecology .
All from the road , of course , but the south - western portions of BC are a rainforest with tall cedars and dense underbrush , you can see that from the roads , once I get out to the prairies or desert , it changes .
Leaders ' likely ' to go to summit
By Richard Black
Environment correspondent , BBC News website , Barcelona
Climate protesters say politicians are failing to show the right leadership
At least 40 world leaders are likely to attend December 's UN climate summit in a bid to secure a new global treaty .
Some observers say only intervention from heads of state and government can close the deal , given the gulf between industrialised and developing nations .
Others maintain the harsh words bandied here at the final preparatory meeting amount to no more than posturing .
The UN 's top climate official said firm US targets for reducing emissions were necessary for a deal .
" I believe the US can commit to a number [ at the summit ] in Copenhagen , " said Yvo de Boer , executive secretary of the UN climate convention ( UNFCCC ) .
" There was a number in Mr Obama 's campaign , there are numbers in the legislation [ going through Congress ] - so I believe it 's perfectly possible for the US to sign up to a specific pledge . "
' Fair share ' US legislation setting caps on emissions is under discussion in the Senate , and unlikely to be finalised this year .
Quizzed by reporters as to whether the US would bring an emissions target to Copenhagen , its delegation chief here , Jonathan Pershing , said it was possible but a decision had not yet been taken .
" The science demands urgent action , and the US is committed to our fair share , " he said .
" Developed countries including the US must put numbers forward ; developing countries except the least developed countries must [ also ] make commitments . "
The Copenhagen summit is supposed to conclude the two - year process that began at the Bali summit two years ago of formulating a treaty to supplant the Kyoto Protocol .
Demonstrators in Copenhagen called for carbon emissions to be cut
The absence of a US target is the most glaring hole in the draft treaty 's complex tapestry that weaves together concerns over reducing emissions from rich countries , reducing the rate of emissions growth in more prosperous developing nations , and providing financial assistance to the developing world .
Developing countries have regularly accused the West - and the US in particular - of failing to live up to its international obligations .
" It seems that developed countries have been negotiating with their economic interests at heart rather than [ the world 's ] environmental interests , " said Angelina Navarro Llanos , head of the Bolivian delegation .
But Mr Pershing insisted that developing countries were also to blame for the apparent impasse that earlier in the week brought a walkout from African delegations .
" Developing countries want a legal deal that applies to us but not to them , " he said .
The rancour evident during the week has led some observers to conclude there is no chance of achieving a legally binding deal in Copenhagen .
Many people close to the talks - including Mr de Boer - have played down the chances of tying up a full treaty this year , and there are suggestions it could take a further full year to conclude .
' Political posturing '
But others said the picture was not as dark as it seemed , and that last - minute policy revelations and compromises were still likely .
" There 's a fair degree of political posturing , " said Kumi Naidoo , chair of the activist coalition tcktcktck .
" [ But ] some of the negotiators from developed countries have come to the conclusion that they 're not going to deliver what was promised in Bali , and there 's a lowering of expectations going on . "
Most developed countries set out targets for reducing their emissions well before this meeting convened - and they add up to a lot less than the 40 % ( from 1990 levels by 2020 ) that developing nations are demanding .
On the face of it , this is an unbridgeable divide ; but other delegates suggested the G77 / China bloc of developing countries would probably settle for about 30 % provided other elements of a package - such as plentiful finance - were also on offer .
All countries have been urged to take part and negotiate Mr de Boer said the Danish conference hosts had a list of 40 heads of state or government intending to attend - though it is not known whether US President Barack Obama is among them .
Some delegates suggested only political engagement at this level could turn the current situation into a new binding agreement .
Most of the negotiating here has taken place in small groups tackling specific issues ; and it is clear that progress has been uneven .
Negotiations towards an agreement on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation ( Redd ) were progressing well , delegates said , with a good chance of agreeing something in Copenhagen that could see money begin to flow into forest protection next year .
Mr de Boer cited the transfer of clean technology from the industrialised to the developing world as another area where progress has been made .
But other areas of negotiation - notably on raising money to help poor countries adapt to climate impacts , and on commitments to reduce emissions - have clearly been more difficult .
There is still disagreement too over the legal form of a new agreement at or after Copenhagen - whether it should take the form of an extension to the Kyoto Protocol , which Mr de Boer noted was the only legal agreement in existence that had curbed carbon emissions , or another legal entity .
Elements of the draft treaty remain in the form of " non-papers " , delegates said - documents that do not carry the weight of a formal negotiating text .
Delegates will convene in the Danish capital on 7 December for two weeks of negotiations ; although the introduction of key elements is likely to be withheld until the final few days .

The first ion beam entering point 2 of the LHC , just before the ALICE detector ( 23 October 2009 )
During the last weekend ( 23 - 25 October ) particles have once again entered the LHC after the one - year break that followed the incident of September 2008 .
Friday afternoon a first beam of ions entered the LHC clockwise beam pipe through the TI2 transfer line .
The beam was successfully guided through the ALICE detector until point 3 where it was dumped .
The particles did not travel along the whole circumference of the LHC .
During the late evening on Friday , the first beam of protons also entered the LHC clockwise ring and travelled until point 3 .
In the afternoon of Saturday , protons travelled from the SPS through the TI8 transfer line and the LHCb experiment , until point 7 where they were dumped .
All settings and parameters showed a perfect functioning of the machine , which is preparing for its first circulating beam in the coming weeks .
CERN is preparing the Large Hadron Collider for a restart in 2009 .
The first circulating beam of the year is likely to be injected in mid-November .
This will be followed by a short period of collisions at the injection energy of 450GeV per beam and a ramp in energy to 3.5TeV per beam .
Following this , LHC physics will begin with collisions at this energy .
The time from first injection to first high - energy collisions will be at least four weeks .
However , the complexity of scheduling coupled with inevitable glitches in a machine of this complexity could lead to this process taking longer .
The first high energy collisions will most likely occur at a date after mid-December 2009 .

Can the U.S. government secretly subpoena the IP address of every visitor to a political website ?
No , but that did n't stop it from trying .
In a report released today , EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston tells the story of a bogus federal subpoena issued to independent news site Indymedia.us , and how the site fought back with EFF ’s help .
Declan McCullagh at CBSNews.com also has the story .
The report describes how , earlier this year , U.S. attorneys issued a federal grand jury subpoena to Indymedia .us administrator Kristina Clair demanding “ all IP traffic to and from www.indymedia.us " for a particular date , potentially identifying every person who visited any news story on the Indymedia site .
As the report explains , this overbroad demand for internet records not only violated federal privacy law but also violated Clair ’s First Amendment rights , by ordering her not to disclose the existence of the subpoena without a U.S. attorney ’s permission .
Because Indymedia follows EFF ’s Best Practices for Online Service Providers and does not keep historical IP logs , there was no information for Indymedia to hand over , and the government withdrew the subpoena .
However , as the report describes , that was n’t the end of the tale : Ms. Clair wanted EFF to be able to tell the story of the subpoena and shine a light on the government ’s illegal demand , yet the subpoena ordered silence .
Under pressure from EFF , the government admitted that the subpoena ’s gag order had no legal basis , and ultimately chose not to go to court to try to force Ms. Clair ’s silence despite earlier threats to do so .
This story is an an important example of how government abuses breed in secrecy , and an argument for Congress to step in and require meaningful reporting about how the government uses its surveillance authorities .
How often does the government attempt such illegal fishing expeditions through internet data ?
How many online service providers have received similarly bogus demands , and handed over how much data , violating how many internet users ’ privacy ?
How many of those subpoena recipients have been intimidated into silence by unconstitutional gag orders ?
We do n’t know .
And until Congress exerts stronger oversight , we ca n’t know , except in those occasional instances where a brave online service provider steps up , pushes back , and tells the world .
We encourage other online service providers to follow the example of Indymedia.us and Kristina Clair by standing up for their users ' rights when the government secretly overreaches .
If you 're an ISP , a web host , an email provider , an app developer , a Web 2.0 start - up or any other kind of online service provider and you receive a government demand for your users ' data , please call a lawyer .
If you do n't have a lawyer , call EFF .
Researchers in the USA have discovered a potential new function for anti-epileptic drugs in treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's disease .
The study , published in BioMed Central 's open access journal Molecular Neurodegeneration , found that neurons in the brain were protected after treatment with T - type calcium - channel blockers , which are commonly used to treat epilepsy .
Calcium signaling pathways play a vital role in the survival of neurons in the brain .
As age increases , calcium homeostasis can be disrupted in the brain , which may lead to cognitive and functional decline .
It therefore raises the possibility that chemicals able to modulate calcium homeostasis could protect neurons .
Jianxin Bao and colleagues , from Washington University , Missouri , USA , were one of the first teams to explore the possible protective effects of blockers for T - type calcium channels .
The mechanisms for neuroprotection by these antiepileptic drugs were previously unknown .
Bao's team established cell culture models to directly test whether these drugs could preserve neurons in long - and short - term cultures in vitro .
They found that neurons showed an increase in viability after treatment with either L - type or T - type calcium channel inhibitors .
Furthermore , neurons in the long - term and short - term cultures were protected , respectively , by L - type and T - type calcium channel blockers , suggesting that more than one calcium - signaling mechanism exists to regulate long - and short - term neuron survival .
There are presently no effective medications for age - related neurodegeneration .
Bao said " Our data provides implications for the use of this family of anti-epileptic drugs in developing new treatments for neuronal injury , and for the need of further studies of the use of such drugs in age - related neurodegenerative disorders . "

BBC Question
Time notes from October 22 show - as it appeared on Daily Mail website Photograph : BBC
Let 's play spot the difference .
The top image is a set of instructions that members of the Question Time audience were given before filming last Thursday .
And below that is a version of it that appeared in the Daily Mail and on its website on Saturday .
Have you noticed what 's changed ?
Funnily enough , the Mail used its version to support its claim that the BBC was " stage managing " an onslaught against BNP leader Nick Griffin during the programme .
The Mail 's story was headlined " Anatomy of an Ambush " and the caption to its altered leaflet , said that profiles on the sheet were " starting with Nick Griffin " .
But the original document in fact started with a profile of cabinet minister Jack Straw , the most senior of the panellists .
The doctoring is so badly done that Griffin 's biographical details appear twice , once in their original slot second to last on the sheet and then pasted into the top slot in place of Jack Straw .
The Mail also fails to mention the vital fact that the " crib sheet " goes out to all Question Time audiences every week and always asks them for " short , sharp and provocative questions " .
Monkey wonders if those in the Mail 's Derry Street glass atrium might be throwing stones when it comes to accusing the BBC of " stage managing " .
And might the Mail 's extensive pot-boiling be prompted by the fact that one of the questions on Question Time – seen by 8 million viewers – was about Jan Moir 's crass column about Stephen Gately ?
Surely not .
De-centralize the State !
No one can be expected to see it all .
No one can be expected to see how far we ’ve come in such a short amount of time , but one can be expected to see the direction we are going in .
Wealthy white male privilege is being challenged .
We ’ve been challenging it for years , decades , centuries … and one should expect we will continue to challenge it .
Now , what does this mean ?
Grab your remote control and switch on your television .
Most likely the news shows you see will be about wealthy white male rule .
If not , then about wealthy white rule .
If not , then about wealthy rule .
Or maybe they ’ll avoid the topic altogether , which just tells you something about the nature of the channel you ’re watching .
We ’re challenging each and every property of that description — wealth , race , and sex — and replacing it with the idea that neither of those deserve the kind of privilege afforded it by our society today .
This is a thoroughly dangerous idea , for the group of individuals which fit that description have been in the driver ’s seat of our civilization for as long as any of us can remember .
They ’ve responded violently in order to suppress any dissent .
High - power water hoses and white hoods come to mind .
But those actions have only backfired .
It has only served to whittle away at their legitimacy in the public mind .
So they have to pretend that they ’re not in control .
That ’s how they maintain it now .
But we ’re smarter than that .
They try to drug us with soma ; plant seeds of escapism in our minds .
It ’s tantamount to a burglar waving a chew toy to distract a guard dog whose hair is standing up on his back and whose teeth and gums are showing .
We ’re not going to let their entertainment distract us .
We ’re not going to let them convince us they ’re not still in charge .
It ’s not hard to see that they are .
So , the challenge now is to detect their chew toys , and to re-focus our eyes on the burglar in the house .
What is he doing now ?
Waging wars for oil , natural gas pipelines and poppies ?
You bet .
Cheering the fastest drop in “ labor costs ” since 1948 ?
You bet .
The veins of the poor are still open and the rich are still sucking every ounce of blood they can from them .
They pit the poor against the poor for the benefit of the rich through concepts like terrorism .
What did they call the Cuban or Brazilian peasants who revolted against enslavement and sugar monoculture ?
Terrorists or communists , I suppose .
Then they commenced to hunt them down and decapitate them , or cut pregnant women ’s bellies open , or skewer their children on their bayonets only to return to the wealthy white male / s who had ordered it with bags of severed ears as proof that they did what they were told .
They followed the orders .
No doubt that soldier had a hard time making ends meet himself .
Enough .
We need to take our eyes off the things that are keeping us distracted and finally recognize the truly radical nature of the doctrine that all humans are created equal and that political legitimacy is truly dependent upon the consent of the governed .
And manufactured consent is no consent at all .
To see the arch of history is to see a continual progression toward the de-centralization of illegitimate power .
Whatever takes us even further in this direction should be seen as a positive development .
As a writer for the upcoming political documentary Dear America : From Patriotism to Participation , I see the arch of history like never before .
Illegitimate authority has taken some hard hits to the face thus far .
What we have is a woozy opponent .
We should n’t let his erratic dancing in the ring fool us into thinking he ’s still the all - powerful opponent he was when we began this fight .
And we must snap out of the hypnosis he has put us in and realize that we are — this generation is — still locked in a fight with this entity .
Our tag team partners ( the generations before us ) threw punches that were hard and true .
A few more blows , and he could be on the mat , down for the count , forever .
The National Initiative for Democracy represents the hardest , most accurate and true punch we can possibly throw at this point .
A law - making populace — rather than a vulnerable group of his law - making buddies — neutralizes what flimsy power of his remains .
That is why I beg that you see things in the larger perspective , see the National Initiative as it relates to the rest of history , overcome the mentality that benefits them most , and contribute to the making of an explanatory documentary about the National Initiative for Democracy .
Whether or not we pass it into law or not does n’t matter so much .
This documentary seeks to explain to people the arch of history — that we are still battling this illegitimate authority — and that ’s something that could overflow into all other areas of life , and possibly spur the greatest mass movement in the history of humanity ; the final overthrow of wealthy white male privilege .
We ’re going to do this fucking thing .
I want to hit him so hard , but I need you .
Please , help us in this effort .
Go to our website and there you can read more about this documentary and contribute .
Freedom is defined as “ participation in power ” .
So , ask yourself , are you free ?
Wake up , slave .
Escape .
This week marks the twenty - year anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , an event which helped end the Cold War .
It ushered in the end of an era for science fiction , too .
Advertisement
The Cold War affected science fiction during some of its most important and formative years .
SF books published during the Cold War reflected that period 's politics as well as its rapidly - advancing technologies .
Here is a short history of the relationship between the Cold War and science fiction .
The Global Standoff
The end of one war signaled the beginning of another .
The atomic bombs that were detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States Air Force marked the beginnings of a massive change in the way warfare would be conducted .
While the power of atomic weaponry had become a major , visible aspect of the tensions that sprang up between the US and USSR , a major development that helped to deliver those tensions was the introduction of rockets that could be used on the battlefield .
Examining the issue further , one cannot help but point to the very industrial nature that warfare had undertaken .
The Second World War saw numerous countries turn their economy over to continuing to fight .
Advertisement
One of the earliest works of fiction to predict this style of warfare was H.G. Wells ' 1933 novel , The Shape of Things to Come , which the author called a ' future history ' .
In it , Wells not only predicted the upcoming Second World War , but also the introduction of submarine - launched ballistic missiles , and , despite a discovery that was years away , the introduction of nuclear warheads .
The industrial nature of war that helped characterize World War II is an element of the Cold War .
Following the collapse of the Axis forces in Europe and the Pacific , both the United States and Russia found themselves with large standing militaries , with an industrial base to help support them .
Indeed , this foundation prompted American President Dwight D. Eisenhower , in 1959 , to warn against a looming military - industrial complex , as he feared that it might lead the United States into future confrontations .
While World War II did not see the widespread use of rocket warfare , ( just scattered attacks against England and Allied - held European countries at the very end of the war ) , the use of rockets in combat was half a century old .
In the late 1800s , and through to the early years of the 20th century , notable rocket pioneers such as Kontantin Tsiolkovsky , Robert Goddard and Herman Oberth , were all inspired by Jules Verne 's book , From The Earth To The Moon , depicting rocket travel as a means to reach our nearest neighbor in space .

With the seeds of rocket travel , and its possibilities , planted in the minds of numerous scientists , the Second World War brought forth a favorable time for scientific endeavor , especially when it could be connected to military hardware .
The German military developed the World 's first ballistic missile and would later put the first jet plane into service , technologies that were later swept up into the Soviet and American arsenals in the years right after the war .
In 1949 , the Soviet Union detonated its first atomic warhead , and the race for superior delivery systems began , beginning an age of rocket warfare and first strike scenarios .
Part of the arms race between the world 's two major superpowers was the quest to develop bigger and better rockets , a pursuit which would later merge into the space agencies from both countries , accomplishing what had been up to that point , science fiction - the first human in space , the first space walk and the first man on the Moon .
While this was a scenario predicted by Verne in his book , no author had captured the possibilities of space because of this race better than Arthur C. Clarke , whose short story , " The Sentinel , " and later novel , 2001 : A Space Odyssey , showed a near future that saw space habitats , permanent lunar colonization and exploration further into the solar system .
While these developments have ultimately not been accomplished in the same way that Clarke 's book 's title might suggest , it was a work that clearly took the space race for inspiration .

The threat of nuclear destruction was a prevalent one in science fiction , and the 1986 publication of Alan Moore 's landmark comic , Watchmen , demonstrates the continued tension between the two countries .
Easily , the best example of this in the book is in the character of Dr. Manhattan ( who 's creation is linked to the very weapon that threatens the world ) , and his use by the United States as a deterrent in and of himself .
As military power is an extension of a nation 's politics , the opposition to communism was embodied in the nuclear standoff , used by both countries as a means to further their international ambitions .
The Opposition to Communism
The global struggle that became the Cold War was not just embodied in the warheads that each country maintained ; it was in the economic and philosophical makeup of both countries .
From the roots of communism with Karl Marx 's 1848 book , The Communist Manifesto came a new way of thinking about labor relations that in essence , threatened the capitalistic structure upon which the United States rested .
The roots of communism were well established in the world by the 1940s , when Robert Heinlein wrote his short story , " The Roads Must Roll . "
In this short story , Heinlein presents a world where class struggle is very much a part of the life , and shows an organized workforce that rises as a result of inequalities .
This is paralleled by a very real fear in the United States of such an up rise , and as a result , throughout the Cold War , there was a heightened sense of awareness of communist sympathizers within the United States .

Indeed , another author at the time , George Orwell , penned his short novel Animal Farm just a handful of years later in 1945 .
The book looks at another aspect of Communism , one that closely mirrored its author 's own politics - one who was sympathetic towards socialist - style governments , but highly critical of the turns that some of these nations underwent , namely Soviet Russia under Joseph Stalin .
Over the course of the story , two pigs , Snowball and Napoleon , take over their farm by inspiring their fellow farm animals to revolt and drive away the farmer , setting up a communist style government in his place - as what happened in Soviet Russia , the leaders gain power and form a dictatorship , creating a society where " All animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others . "
And obviously , Orwell 's 1984 takes an even more withering view of Communism .
Another Science Fiction work that takes the opposition against communism to heart is Madeleine L'Engle 's wonderful novel A Wrinkle in Time .
Midway through the book , the children arrive on the planet Camazotz , where the populace is controlled by a singular intelligence .
Upon their arrival , they come across a village where everybody acts in harmony , as one .
Further examination shows that the society is heavily regimented and controlled by the CENTRAL Central Intelligence Center , and by IT .
I remember reading this story and coming away with this chapter most relevant in my mind , and saw allegory here as a great fear of the United States - an overpowering authority that is prevalent in every part of a person 's life .
Indeed , Soviet Russia had put together a massive totalitarian regime that held the country in an iron grip for decades , one that seemed very reminiscent of from the scenes of this remarkable book .
Indeed , this is why the threat of nuclear war had been put into place , and why the stakes were so high .

The End of the World
Possibly the most enduring memory in the American public of the Cold War is that of a lesson that many school children learned during this time .
You 've most likely already guessed it - duck and cover , hiding under one 's desk in a sort of nuclear - attack drill that was most feared by the American public , and most likely , the Soviet public as well .
With the introduction of nuclear warheads at the end of the Second World War , the lines of war had shifted beyond the front lines of any war - to the American public , and the economic policies of both the United States and Russia only encouraged a shift from conventional military forces to strategic and deterrent based weapons .

While the world 's worst fears never came to pass , the idea of nuclear annihilation was certainly ripe for the science fiction genre .
A particularly memorable story by Ray Bradbury demonstrates the outcome of such a way , and carries itself easily without the use of any characters whatsoever - a sure possibility in the event that humanity was wiped from the planet .
The focus of this story , " There Will Come Soft Rains , " part of Bradbury 's Martian Chronicles , demonstrates that while humanity might become technologically adept - seen through a fully automated house that carries on its duties even without its inhabitants , who seem to have been killed or driven off after a nuclear war .
" There Will Come Soft Rains " acts as a cautionary tale from the 1950s , and indeed , carries with it messages relevant even through to today .
Alas , Babylon , by Pat Frank , is a book that was very easy to relate to current events at the time of publication - Frank talks about the Korean War in the story .
Published in 1959 , this book is an early post - apocalyptic take on the world , and over the course of the story , demonstrates the style of warfare that had become commonplace , one of strategy , where both opponents circle one another , looking for a weakness to exploit .
The bombs fall against the United States , and the story of the survivors is the ultimate commentary , a questioning look at whether such risks to human civilization are needed or really matter in the long run , as one character notes : " We won it .
We really clobbered them , not that it matters . "

Another powerful tale that looks to a world after the bombs fall is Walter Miller Jr. 's A Canticle For Leibowitz , and witnesses the rebuilding of society in the aftermath of a nuclear war that devastated the world .
An order of monks of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz take it upon themselves to preserve scientific knowledge , and the book looks to the rise and fall of society once again - a theme that is common in Science Fiction , form Isaac Asimov 's Foundation to Ron Moore 's Battlestar Galactica ( interestingly , both also look to the collapse of civilization ) .
Certainly , with even a fraction of the weapons buildup over the course of the war able to completely destroy the planet , the idea of society 's total collapse and destruction certainly was not as farfetched as some might think .
The advent , risk and fear of global destruction is one that carries with it an enormous amount of weight and certainly carries with it plenty of stories and possibilities for both science fiction writers , historians , political science junkies and philosophers .
Science fiction stories such as There Will Come Soft Rains , Alas Babylon and A Canticle for Leibowitz are in a unique position to examine some of the more farfetched , but relevant themes that allowed people to look at the subject in any number of possibilities and outcomes .

The Aftermath
Still , with the threat of global destruction , there is certainly room for the stories that demonstrate what would happen in a world without the destruction of humanity .
Certainly , one of the finest works to look to this is Childhood 's End , by Sir Arthur C. Clarke , which sees the end of global conflict with the appearance of a number of alien ships over the skies of numerous cities around the world , frightening the world into peace , and allowing for a global age of prosperity .
To some extent , this is a brilliant take on the idea of global defense , as it removes the responsibility of global destruction from humanity , yet at the same time , removes the need for offensive capabilities from them .
This is still an idea borne out of science fiction , as nuclear warheads continue to make up a significant part of a deterrent based arsenal .
Just because the United States and Soviet Union never went to war to end civilization , it does n't necessarily mean that that possibility is forever banished from the realm of possibility .
Advertisement
Still , while that is the case , there is one final aspect of the nuclear arsenal that is examined in a 2003 short story by Charles Sheffield , ( his last ) , The Waste Land , a detective story that centers around one of the side - effects of a nuclear arsenal , the nuclear waste that would take thousands of years to be rendered inert .
In this story , the lead character , Jeff King , investigates a man who 's been burned from a rapid exposure to radiation , far more than he should have .
The events of the story tells of a new technology that is designed to eliminate the effects of radiation by rapidly speeding up the half - lives of the material in the area , ultimately killing the man who invented it , receiving a lethal dose of radiation , but revealing a means to rid the world of a problem that will last for lifetimes to come .
While the Cold War has effectively been over for twenty years with the fall of the Berlin Wall , the immediate geopolitical threat that came about because of it has collapsed .
The world no longer struggles back and forth with an epic battle that pits communism against capitalism , democracy verses totalitarianism , but the science fiction that it inspired lives on in the pages of libraries , personal or otherwise , showing that possible conflicts and technologies that threatened the world .
While one wall fell , symbolizing the end of an era , another era , one with as many dangers and influenced by the one before it , has arisen , one that will undoubtedly inspire a comparable number of stories to teach and entertain us .

And when the moderate silent majorities take ownership of their own futures , we win .
When they wo n’t , when we want them to compromise more than they do , we lose .
The locals sense they have us over a barrel , so they exploit our naïve goodwill and presence to loot their countries and to defeat their internal foes .
That ’s how I see Afghanistan today .
I see no moderate spark .
I see our secretary of state pleading with President Hamid Karzai to re-do an election that he blatantly stole .
I also see us begging Israelis to stop building more crazy settlements or Palestinians to come to negotiations .
It is time to stop subsidizing their nonsense .
Let them all start paying retail for their extremism , not wholesale .
Then you ’ll see movement .
What if we shrink our presence in Afghanistan ?
Wo n’t Al Qaeda return , the Taliban be energized and Pakistan collapse ?
Maybe .
Maybe not .
This gets to my second principle :
In the Middle East , all politics  everything that matters  happens the morning after the morning after .
Be patient .
Yes , the morning after we shrink down in Afghanistan , the Taliban will celebrate , Pakistan will quake and bin Laden will issue an exultant video .
And the morning after the morning after , the Taliban factions will start fighting each other , the Pakistani Army will have to destroy their Taliban , or be destroyed by them , Afghanistan ’s warlords will carve up the country , and , if bin Laden comes out of his cave , he ’ll get zapped by a drone .
My last guiding principle :
We are the world .
A strong , healthy and self - confident America is what holds the world together and on a decent path .
A weak America would be a disaster for us and the world .
China , Russia and Al Qaeda all love the idea of America doing a long , slow bleed in Afghanistan .
I do n’t .
The U.S. military has given its assessment .
It said that stabilizing Afghanistan and removing it as a threat requires rebuilding that whole country .
Unfortunately , that is a 20 - year project at best , and we ca n’t afford it .
So our political leadership needs to insist on a strategy that will get the most security for less money and less presence .
We simply do n’t have the surplus we had when we started the war on terrorism after 9/11  and we desperately need nation - building at home .
We have to be smarter .
Let ’s finish Iraq , because a decent outcome there really could positively impact the whole Arab - Muslim world , and limit our exposure elsewhere .
Iraq matters .
Yes , shrinking down in Afghanistan will create new threats , but expanding there will , too .
I ’d rather deal with the new threats with a stronger America .
On January 29 , 2001 , just nine days after taking office , Dick Cheney created The National Energy Policy Development Group , commonly known as the Cheney Energy Task Force .
The task force was charged with the critically important task of designing America 's national energy policy .
Although the group 's efforts would directly impact the entire nation , the new Vice President refused to divulge the names of its members or their specific activities , claiming the Executive Branch 's right to confidentiality .
To challenge Cheney 's claims of privacy and acquire the names and activities of the task force members , the Sierra Club and Judicial Watch filed Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuits , but the courts denied their initial requests and subsequent appeals .
On July 18 , 2007 , the Washington Post revealed the names of members of the task force , which included executives of major conglomerates Enron , Exxon , ConocoPhillips , Chevron , the National Mining Association , and more .
Cheney 's refusal to divulge the identities of the members of his task force was the earliest indication of the absolute power America 's 46th Vice President presumed .
His refusal demonstrated the covert nature of his Vice Presidency and his belief that transparency was not a requirement of the Executive Branch .
The policies and practices predicated upon Cheney 's presumption of confidentiality remained constant for the full eight years of his Vice Presidency .
They ushered in the era of the Bush / Cheney Imperial Presidency that exercised sweeping authority , bypassed established law , and caused widespread concern amongst scholars and average citizens for the future of our democracy .
On August 27 , 2004 , future Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman wrote the following criticism of Mr. Cheney 's pursuit of privacy and power :
" Mr. Cheney 's determination to keep his secrets probably reflects more than an effort to avoid bad publicity .
It 's also a matter of principle , based on the administration 's deep belief that it has the right to act as it pleases , and that the public has no right to know what it 's doing .
As Linda Greenhouse recently pointed out in The New York Times , the legal arguments the administration is making for the secrecy of the energy task force are " strikingly similar " to those it makes for its right to detain , without trial , anyone it deems an enemy combatant .
In both cases , as Ms. Greenhouse puts it , the administration has put forward " a vision of presidential power . . . as far - reaching as any the court has seen . "
From January of 2001 right through today , Dick Cheney has committed unconstrained , and as yet unprosecuted offenses , that include circumventing the Constitution , sanctioning unlawful torture , contributing to the outing of a CIA agent , concealing information from Congress , and lying the nation into war .
The tragedy of Cheney 's unrestrained lawlessness is further compounded by his unprecedented authority to preside over economic and foreign policies so calamitous that they drove this nation financially , militarily and morally into the ground .
Despite his constant international and domestic catastrophes , for his first six years in office Cheney 's crimes were supported by an ideological Republican legislative majority and a weak Democratic minority , both of whom succumbed to Bush and Cheney 's Unitary Executive .
After the 2006 election , when Democrats took control of both Houses , Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to abide by her Constitutional duty to investigate Bush and Cheney 's crimes .
Irrespective of public clamor for backbone and accountability , the Democratic majority rolled over for Bush and Cheney .
They financed their plunder and allowed America to decay from within .
Structural chasms in bridges , roadways , pipelines , and schools were matched by ideological chasms over religion , economics , politics and war .
As Americans battled each other , Bush and Cheney bombed and tortured on , comforted by knowing there would be no repercussion .
For a full eight years , they wreaked havoc on America and the world , and today , post administration , both men remain free .
Bush and Cheney understand that they 're vulnerable to prosecution .
Bush , for the most part , has stayed out of the limelight , though he 's recently become more visible , perhaps inspired by Cheney 's success at using THE BIG TOOL - the media - for protection .
Since the beginning of the Obama presidency , Cheney has used the media full on .
He 's commandeered its major outlets , newspapers , cable and network TV , and the most caustic outlet of all , talk radio , to attack the very sources he knows could bring him down - the President and Attorney General .
Cheney 's best defense is his mass media offense and he knows exactly how to use it .
Dick Cheney has used the complicit American media , his most powerful anti-prosecution tool , to near Machiavellian perfection .
He understands implicitly that American media employs no ethical standards that would prevent it from promoting him despite the atrocities he has caused .
Regardless of his catastrophic failures , the shameless complicit media freely provides Cheney the platform to attack the President and Attorney General and advance his standing as their fiercest political critic .
Because of this granted visibility to pummel Obama and Holder , Cheney is more able to establish himself as a victim of partisanship should Obama and Holder try to charge him for his crimes .
Through widely broadcast speeches , like the one below of Cheney bashing Obama on Afghanistan , the complicit media is helping to immunize Cheney - and it 's doing so knowingly .
It 's baiting for ratings and justice be damned !
Cheney 's transparent media offensive places him squarely , frequently and loudly in the public eye attacking Obama and Holder , and setting the stage for an adversarial relationship from which he can claim that he 's their target .
He 's banking on the theory of American exceptionalism to keep his contrived " adversaries " from taking him down .
American exceptionalism implies that America as a nation is superior to the rest of the world .
In lesser nations , political rivals are targeted and imprisoned .
Exceptionalism presumes that superior America , with its highly evolved democracy , would never do the same .
Exceptionalism presumes that political targeting only happens in undeveloped and undemocratic nations led by unsavory leaders ; Mugabe of Zimbabwe , Museveni of Uganda , Nkrumah of Ghana , Putin of Russia , have all imprisoned their opponents .
Cheney 's calculus has determined that American exceptionalism would prevent America 's leaders from publicly engaging in tactics they condemn - like imprisoning political opponents .
Last week , Cheney 's Machiavellian strategy reached a whole new level when his daughter Liz raised his status from political adversary to political opponent by floating the prospect of candidate Cheney in 2012 .
Brilliant !
Behold Dick 's calculating progeny doing his bidding on Fox TV :
What better protection from legal worries than planting the notion of a presidential run , elevating Cheney from harsh critic to political rival .
It 's the epitome of legal immunity in exceptionalist USA .
Of course , there 's little probability that Cheney would actually run .
His approval ratings are dismal and he battles for breath whenever he speaks .
But this is media manipulation - not political reality .
Truth rarely imposes itself on TV .
Then there 's the blogosphere , and the Keep America Safe website , created by scions Liz Cheney and Bill Kristol to propagandize for Cheney .
The Cheney cabal is in full media combat when it comes to protecting Dick Cheney .

After a long two days of legislative battle , the House Judiciary Committee just finished its second day of debate on Chairman Conyers ' PATRIOT reform bill , HR 3845 ( see our wrap - up of the first day ) .
Thanks in no small part to those of you who used our action alert , the Committee rejected almost all amendments that would have weakened the bill 's reforms and voted to recommend the bill to the House floor by a vote of 16 to 10 .
Even better , the Committee kept going after it was finished with PATRIOT to consider Representative Nadler 's State Secret Protection Act ( HR 984 ) , which would reform the state secrets privilege that the government has repeatedly used to try and throw EFF 's warrantless wiretapping cases out of court .
After an impassioned defense by Mr. Nadler , who described how the government has used the privilege like a " magic incantation " to cover - up wrongdoing and warned that state secrecy " is the greatest threat to liberty at present , " the bill passed with even better numbers than the PATRIOT bill , 18 to 12 !
It was , to say the least , a busy couple of days in the House Judiciary Committee .
If you want the entire blow - by - blow of both day 's meetings , check out our Twitter stream at @EFF .
Admittedly , the PATRIOT bill is n't all we had hoped for — as we described yesterday , it 's been weakened in a number of ways due to quiet pressure from the Obama Administration — but it passed through the Committee with most of its major reforms intact , and it is a substantial improvement over the PATRIOT bill approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee last month .
Meanwhile , the state secrets reform bill made it through the committee without being watered down at all , with only a few technical changes .
Thanks and congratulations to the representatives and activists that worked so hard to make that happen .
Eyes now turn to the Senate , where the Senate Judiciary Committee 's PATRIOT Bill ( S. 1692 ) will soon land on the floor , and to the House Intelligence Committee , which will soon be marking - up its own competing PATRIOT bill with much fewer reforms ( HR 3969 ) .
So , the war is far from over .
But two important battles were won today .
Russia was tonight coming to terms with its most deadly terrorist attack in years after investigators confirmed that a powerful improvised bomb caused Friday 's devastating train crash in which at least 26 people , including several top government officials , were killed .
The head of Russia 's FSB counter - terrorism agency , Alexander Bortnikov , said the bomb , hidden on the railway line between Moscow and St Petersburg , contained the equivalent of 7kg ( 15.4lb ) of TNT .
Officers had found " elements of an explosive device " , he said .
Today two huge cranes lifted up wreckage at the crash site as workers searched for the missing .
Officials said 18 people were still unaccounted for .
Nearly 100 people injured in the crash were being treated in hospitals .
Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , called for calm amid speculation the explosion could be the start of a new campaign by Chechen extremists .
" We need there to be no chaos , because the situation is tense as it is , " he told Russian TV .
The luxury Nevsky Express was carrying 682 passengers and 29 crew from Moscow to Russia 's second city St Petersburg .
It was derailed at 9.34 pm on Friday , close to the village of Uglovka , 250 miles north west of Moscow .
Yesterday witnesses described how they heard a " tremendous crash " as the train derailed .
" At exactly 9.30 pm , 15 minutes after we had passed Bologoye [ in the Tver region ] , we heard an almighty slap , " survivor Boris Gruzd told radio station Ekho Moskvy .
" It seemed to me as if we had lost a wheel or smashed through some kind of obstacle .
I did n't hear any explosion . "
Gruzd said the train driver braked severely .
The passengers then spent 30 minutes unaware that the last three wagons of the 14 - carriage train had flown off the rails .
" The first wagon was 1.5 - 2 kms away from the rest of the train .
The second had completely flipped over .
The third had come off the rails , but was near the main part of the train and was still standing vertically .
As far as I know nobody from this wagon was seriously hurt . "
Passenger Igor Pechnikov described being in the second of the three derailed cars .
" A trembling began , and the carriage jolted violently to the left .
I flew through half of the carriage , " he said .
Gruzd said that the passengers immediately began collecting warm clothes and mattresses to help the injured .
But he said it was extremely difficult to reach people trapped in the mangled carriages – with rescuers peering into the gloom and using flashlights .
So far investigators have not said who they believe planted the homemade bomb .
In the days before the crash villagers reported seeing a suspicious individual .
" As far as theories go … our main version is that this was an explosion of an unknown device , by unknown individuals .
Put simply , it was an act of terror , " Vladimir Yakunin , Russia 's railways minister , said yesterday .
Yakunin said the incident was " analogous " to another derailment on the same line three years ago , also involving the Nevsky Express , in which 19 people were injured .
Russian prosecutors blamed that derailment on Chechen rebels , who have been fighting an on - off war against the Russian state for two decades .
According to Ekho Moskvy , a radical neo -Nazi group opposed to migrants from the former Soviet republics of central Asia has claimed responsibility for Friday 's crash , which paralysed train travel yesterday and delayed 27,000 passengers .
Other nationalist groups later denied the report .
There seems little doubt that the Kremlin will point the finger of blame at Islamist insurgents currently waging a guerrilla campaign across the north Caucasus .
Rebel fighters have carried out numerous attacks in recent months , including suicide bombings , in their apparent attempt to establish an Islamic caliphate .
Russian prosecutors said they believed Pavel Kosolapov , an ex-solider and former associate of the late Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev , masterminded the previous derailment .
Kosolapov is currently on the run .
Prosecutors have arrested two residents of Ingushetia and charged them with helping carry out the 2006 attack .
Yesterday , investigators said they had discovered a 3ft crater beneath the rails where the bomb had gone off .
Reuters , however , said that its reporters at the scene had been unable to find it .
Earlier , Russian news agencies had quoted transport officials as saying the cause may have been an electrical fault .
Russia has a poor record of serious accidents caused by Soviet - era infrastructure .
Among the named dead so far were several senior Kremlin bureaucrats , including Boris Yevstratikov , the head of Russia 's Federal Reserve Agency , and Lyudmila Mukhina , a deputy head in the Federal Fishing Agency .
A former St Petersburg senator , Sergei Tarasov , also died .

Cathy
Young defends men's rights groups in Reason , and her article 's subhead reads , " Feminism should be about equality for males , too . "
So should it ?
Advertisement
Young takes aim at Kathryn Joyce 's Double X article about men's rights groups , which we wrote about a couple of weeks ago .
Young argues that these groups are not misogynistic , but that they are merely challenging " the conventional feminist view of domestic violence - as almost invariably involving female victims and male batterers . "
She argues in favor of sociologist Murray Straus 's research into female - initiated violence — though she does acknowledge that women are twice as likely as men to get hurt in a domestic dispute , and three times as likely to fear their partners — and argues that feminists exaggerate the impact of abuse .
Young writes ,
Whatever minor successes men's groups may have achieved , the reality is that public policy on domestic violence in the U.S. is heavily dominated by feminist advocacy groups .
For the most part , these groups embrace a rigid orthodoxy that treats domestic violence as male terrorism against women , rooted in patriarchal power and intended to enforce it .
They also have a record of making grotesquely exaggerated , thoroughly debunked claims about an epidemic of violence against women - for instance , that battering causes more hospital visits by women every year than car accidents , muggings , and cancer combined .

According to Young , men's groups exist in response to real bias against men — she says , " federal assistance is denied to programs that offer joint counseling to couples in which there is domestic violence , and court - mandated treatment for violent men downplays drug and alcohol abuse ( since it 's all about the patriarchy ) . "
And she winds up her piece by quoting philosopher Janet Radcliffe Richards : " No feminist whose concern for women stems from a concern for justice in general can ever legitimately allow her only interest to be the advantage of women . "
Leaving aside domestic violence for a moment , this statement is actually a complicated one .
On the one hand , no real feminist wants to be like the straw feminists
Young and others set up — hateful harridans who use lies to further their own selfish ends .
But on the other , should n't feminism be at least mostly about women 's rights ?
Do n't men have their own movement — that is , all of Western history ?
It 's easy to answer yes to these questions , and some of the time , I believe that answer .
But I also think that feminism should set out to change all damaging gender stereotypes , including stereotypes about men .
The patriarchy — obviously the only thing my simplistic feminist ass cares about — affects everybody , and though it often benefits men , it also fucks them up .
And what 's more , it fucks them up in ways that are bad for women .
It tells them they need to be sexual aggressors , contributing to rape culture .
It tells them they suck at child - rearing and emotional connection in general , which damages their relationships and sticks women with disproportionate familial burdens .
And it tells them they need to be big and strong and ready to fight , which makes them both more likely to commit domestic violence and less likely to report it if it happens to them .

All these problems are worth fixing , and feminists — who are experienced at fighting gender stereotyping , and who care about many of the ills created by a rigid social view of masculinity — are well - equipped to help fix them .
But we 're not going to feel like it if people cast us as the enemy .
I 'm unlikely to reconsider my view of men's rights groups if writers like Young use them as a peg to insult the supposedly sorry " state of feminism " or to posit some powerful anti-male gynocracy that 's promulgating lies about abuse .
In fact , Young does such a crappy job of negotiating disputes between the sexes that I 'd like to go around her and speak to dudes directly :
Hi guys .
I am a feminist .
I am not an evil bitch who wants to beat you up and take your money .
I am your sister , your daughter , your neighbor , your co-worker , and your friend .
I support your right to have emotions , to be an involved dad , to feel physically and emotionally safe in your relationships , to hold any job you want regardless of whether it's " masculine , " and , if you want , to marry another man .
I get that life is hard for you too sometimes , and I want to help you .
But only if you meet me halfway .

OCEANSIDE , CA – 29OCTOBER09 – In Oceanside , Carlsbad , Del Mar and north San Diego County , immigrant day laborers wait by the side of the road , hoping a contractor will stop and offer them work .
Alberto Juarez Martinez slings his jacket over his shoulder while he waits .
His hands show the effect of a lifetime of manual work , plus arthritis suffered as a child in Zapata , Zacatecas .
The hands of Beto , a migrant from Uruachi , Chihuahua , also show the effect of a lifetime of manual work .
Juan Castillo , a migrant from Tehuacan , Puebla , waits with his friends in the parking lot of a market they ’ve nicknamed La Gallinita , because of the rooster on the roof of the building .
Police in north county towns have now started cruising by day labor sites in plainclothes , pretending to be contractors offering workers jobs , and then citing them and turning them over to immigration agents , even those with green cards Many community organizations are protesting this practice .
Francisco Villa operates a lunch truck that visits the areas where migrant day laborers live on hillsides and under trees .
Villa hands out leaflets advising workers of their rights and letting them know that they can find help from California Rural Legal Assistance .
Across the street from Villa ’s truck , Zaragosa Brito and Andres Roman Diaz , two migrants from Arcelia , Guerrero , sit next to a fence where workers look for day labor , or get rides to the fields for farm work .
The men sleep out in the open in the field behind the fence , and have worked on a local strawberry ranch , Rancho Diablo , for many years .
A few miles away , farm workers harvest marjoram and basil at Herb Thyme Farms in Oceanside .
Harvesting marjoram means using a short knife that requires workers to work bent over double .
Years of this labor can cause permanent damage to the spine .
One possible future for migrant farm laborers is visible in a crew of workers picking tomatoes on the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base .
These are H2 - A guest workers , recruited in Mexico by grower Harry Singh .
On the base , the workers are hidden in the rows behind a barbed wire fence , and outside labor organizers or legal advisors can’t gain access .
At the end of the day , these guest workers are taken to a labor camp on Singh ’s ranch , where access is also restricted in order to keep them isolated from the surrounding community .
H2 - A guest workers can’t leave their jobs without being deported back to Mexico .
They fear that if they protest or even speak with legal aid , they wo n’t be hired the following season .
Singh used to be the only California grower importing H2 - A workers , but now there are several .
The number is growing .
MILLBURN , N.J. ( The Street ) -- Every October for the past three years , I have presented my list of the worst - run companies in the U.S.
It is time to unveil 2009 's list of ignominious public corporations , but first , let 's turn back the clock and see how past honorees have fared :
2006 Inductees
Alcoa
( AA ) - Get Report
: The company and its stock have floundered the past few years , suffering from the lack of aluminum demand and the concurrent decline in aluminum prices .
The best decision that management has made in recent history was to raise $ 1.3 billion in March through a series of common stock and convertible debt offerings .
The Cash for Clunkers program may have helped boost some short - term auto production , and demand from
Boeing
( BA ) - Get Report
for its 787 Dreamliner is beginning to get off the ground .
Other than that , the revenue side of Alcoa 's business model remains constrained .
Alcoa is still alive and may survive , but it still has a whole host of operational and management issues to overcome .
Alcatel - Lucent
( ALU )
: This telecommunications company was never able to rejuvenate itself after the tech and telecom bust nearly a decade ago .
Alcatel has cleaned up its balance sheet and is managing to survive to some extent , but it is still on the endangered company list .
Cablevision
( CVC )
: The Dolan family has managed to destroy shareholder value while increasing its own wealth for many years .
Cablevision is saddled with debt and has negative book value , yet the company has managed to collect a series of prime properties .
The New York Knicks , a Cablevision asset , are a long - term laughingstock of the NBA and will have to sign Lebron James to save the franchise .
But Cablevision has managed to endure a global debt crisis and deep recession , so while the company is poorly managed , it appears to be a survivor .
Janus Capital
( JNS )
: Once an investment management maverick in the 1990s , Janus is now an also - ran to the likes of
Blackrock
( BLK ) - Get Report
,
Franklin Resources
( BEN ) - Get Report
and
T. Rowe Price
( TROW ) - Get Report
.
Pier One
( PIR ) - Get Report
: Pier One has not generated positive earnings in years .
When the whole world was trading down during a recession , everyone seemed to miss Pier One along the highways .
What is saving this company is a lack of any significant amount of debt .
Sharper Image
: Filed for bankruptcy .
2007 Inductees
Palm
( PALM ) : Palm has had its up and downs .
Right now it's on a roll , thanks to the smartphone boom -- that is to say , relative to itself .
Compared with
Apple
( AAPL ) - Get Report
and
Research In Motion
( RIMM ) , Palm is rather insignificant .
Time will be the true test for the company , but for now it has a reprieve .
Circuit City
: Filed for bankruptcy .
Charter Communications
: Filed for bankruptcy .
Six Flags
: Filed for bankruptcy .
Washington Mutual
: Declared insolvent and seized by the FDIC , Washington Mutual is now a part of
JPMorgan's
( JPM ) - Get Report
retail banking unit .
2008 Inductees
Macy's
( M ) - Get Report
: Of all the companies on my list , Macy's is the most likely to turn itself around .
After biting off too much in acquisitions and expanding too much , the retailer is carrying a significant amount of debt .
Macy's is caught in the squeeze between the discount retailers such as
Wal - Mart
( WMT ) - Get Report
and the luxury retailers such as
Nordstrom
( JWN ) - Get Report
.
Macy's is still a poorly managed company , but I see some glimmers of hope .
General Motors
: Filed for bankruptcy .
Time Warner
( TWX )
: The publishing business stinks , AOL was the worst acquisition of all time , and the balance sheet is a horror .
While Time Warner has been able to pare back debt , goodwill is still sitting on the balance sheet like a festering sore .
The latest installment of the Harry Potter series was a disappointment compared with its predecessors .
Management still has its hands full , and I am still not sure that it's the right management to lead Time Warner out of the wilderness .
Now , on to this year 's list .
My Criteria
While not all the companies on my list suffer from all of the following problems , they meet at least one or more of these negative characteristics , making them lousy investments and potentially excellent short sales .
Poor financial condition :
Heavy debt loads , large amounts of goodwill and poor cash flow are common among poorly run companies .
As a result , their balance sheets are in lousy shape .
The inability to shore up balance sheets could spell further danger in the future .
" Second banana syndrome " :
Some of the companies on my list are not what would you refer to as " best of breed . "
Most of them are in an industry or sector that has at least one more - dominant competitor .
After all , why swill beer when you can sip champagne ?
Ineffective management : Successful companies will have management teams that not only innovate but also can perform during times of stress .
In fact , innovation does not simply mean introducing a single " cool " product , as Sharper Image did with the Ionic Breeze Air Purifier .
Effective innovation and management are about being able to transform a company into a provider of a well - balanced and diversified line of products .
Strategic mistakes :
This can take many forms .
One of the most damaging mistakes is a large acquisition that turns out to be costly .
Take Washington Mutual , for example .
The company acquired Providian , a subprime - type credit card issuer , for $ 6.5 billion in 2006 .
Class of 2009
May I have the envelope ?
Here are the latest companies to be added to the Worst Run Company Club for 2009 .
Advance Micro Devices
( AMD ) - Get Report
: AMD is the quintessential second banana to semiconductor monolith
Intel
( INTC ) - Get Report
.
Whether times are good or times are bad , one thing is certain : AMD will likely post an annual earnings loss .
The company is also operating under the strain of a huge amount of net debt .
Finally , it seems as if the entire smartphone boom has left AMD behind in the dust , and the company still resides in a desktop business model mentality .
Sirius XM Radio
( SIRI ) - Get Report
: That this company has n't made my list in the past is a major oversight on my part .
Sirius XM -- the merger of two poorly managed and capitalized companies , Sirisu and XM -- is a classic case of a great product ( satellite radio ) coupled with a bad business model .
The company is burdened with more than $ 3 billion in long - term debt and $ 4.5 billion of intangibles and goodwill .
The strategy of giving large deals to big - name stars such as Howard Stern and Chris " Mad Dog " Russo does n't really seem to have paid off .
Management relied heavily on the automobile industry to spur sales , and we know how successful that has been .
Perhaps government - sponsored cash for transistor radio program could help Sirius survive .
Its date with destiny will be in bankruptcy court .
Jamba Juice
( JMBA ) - Get Report
: My readers might wonder why I have never placed a restaurant company on my list of worst - managed companies .
Perhaps now the time is right .
I warned the subscribers of my newsletter ,
The LakeView Restaurant & Food Chain Report
, about Jamba back in January .
Unfortunately , it has had a lousy track record since coming public in June 2005 at $ 8 per share .
As is usual with these " fad " companies , early success was short - lived .
The problem with Jamba is its lack of a full menu .
Other than a few baked goods , it only serves juice and juice blends .
That is not enough menu diversification to attract diners and generate growth .
I would not recommend bellying up to the Jamba juice bar .

Economics and knowledge
by F. A. VON HAYEK
The ambiguity of the title of this paper is not accidental .
Its main subject is of course the role which assumptions and propositions about the knowledge possessed by the different members of society play in economic analysis .
But this is by no means unconnected with the other question which might be discussed under the same title , the question to what extent formal economic analysis conveys any knowledge about what happens in the real world .
Indeed my main contention will be that the tautologies , of which formal equilibrium analysis in economics essentially consists , can be turned into propositions which tell us anything about causation in the real world only in so far as we are able to fill those formal propositions with definite statements about how knowledge is acquired and communicated .
In short I shall contend that the empirical element in economic theory — the only part which is concerned , not merely with implications but with causes and effects , and which leads therefore to conclusions which , at any rate in principle , are capable of verification
— consists of propositions about the acquisition of knowledge .
Perhaps I should begin by reminding you of the interesting fact that in quite a number of the more recent attempts made in different fields to push theoretical investigation beyond the limits of traditional equilibrium analysis , the answer has soon proved to turn on one question which , if not identical with mine , is at least part of it , namely the question of foresight .
I think the field where ,
as one would expect , the discussion of the assumptions concerning foresight first attracted wider attention was the theory of risk .
The stimulus which was exercised in this connection by the work of Professor F. H. Knight may yet prove to have a profound influence far beyond its special field .
Not much later the assumptions to be made concerning foresight proved to be of fundamental importance for the solution of the puzzles of the theory of imperfect competition , the questions of duopoly and oligopoly .
And since then it has become more and more obvious that in the treatment of the more ‘ dynamic ’ questions of money and industrial fluctuations the assumptions to be made about foresight and ‘ anticipations ’ play an equally central role , and that in particular the concepts which were taken over into these fields from pure - equilibrium analysis , like those of an equilibrium rate of interest , could be properly defined only in terms of assumptions concerning foresight .
The situation seems here to be that before we can explain why people commit mistakes , we must first explain why they should ever be right .
In general it seems that we have come to a point where we all realize that the concept of equilibrium itself can be made definite and clear only in terms of assumptions concerning foresight , although we may not yet all agree what exactly these essential assumptions are .
This question will occupy me later in this paper .
At the moment I am only concerned to show that at the present juncture , whether we want to define the boundaries of economic statics or whether we want to go beyond it , we cannot escape the vexed problem of the exact position which assumptions about foresight are to have in our reasoning .
Can this be merely an accident ?
As I have already suggested , the reason for this seems to me to be that we have to deal here only with a special aspect of a much wider question which we ought to have faced at a much earlier point .
Questions essentially similar to those mentioned arise in fact as soon as we try to apply the system of tautologies – those series of
propositions which are necessarily true because they are merely transformations of the assumptions from which we start , and which constitute the main content of equilibrium analysis
– to the situation of a society consisting of several independent persons .
I have long felt that the concept of equilibrium itself and the methods which we employ in pure analysis , have a clear meaning only when confined to the analysis of the action of a single person , and that we are really passing into a different sphere and silently introducing a new element of altogether different character when we apply it to the explanation of the interactions of a number of different individuals .
I am certain there are many who regard with impatience and distrust the whole tendency , which is inherent in all modern equilibrium analysis , to turn economics into a branch of pure logic , a set of self - evident propositions which , like mathematics or geometry , are subject to no other test but internal consistency .
But it seems that if only this process is carried far enough it carries its own remedy with it .
In distilling from our reasoning about the facts of economic life those parts which are truly
a priori , we not only isolate one element of our reasoning as a sort of pure logic of choice in all its purity , but we also isolate , and emphasize the importance of , another element which has been too much neglected .
My criticism of the recent tendencies to make economic theory more and more formal is not that they have gone too far , but that they have not yet been carried far enough to complete the isolation of this branch of logic and to restore to its rightful place the
investigation of causal processes , using formal economic theory as a tool in the same way as mathematics .
II
But before I can prove my contention that the tautological propositions of pure - equilibrium analysis as such are not directly applicable to the explanation of social relations , I must first show that the concept of equilibrium
has a clear meaning if applied to the actions of a single individual , and what this meaning is .
Against my contention it might be argued that it is precisely here that the concept of equilibrium is of no significance , because , if one wanted to apply it , all one could say would be that an isolated person was always in equilibrium .
But this last statement , although a truism , shows nothing but the way in which the concept of equilibrium is typically misused .
What is relevant is not whether a person as such is or is not in equilibrium , but which of his actions stand in equilibrium relationships to each other .
All propositions of equilibrium analysis , such as the proposition that relative values will correspond to relative costs , or that a person will equalize the marginal returns of any one factor in its different uses , are propositions about the relations between actions .
Actions of a person can be said to be in equilibrium in so far as they can be understood as part of one plan .
Only if this is the case , only if all these actions have been decided upon at one and the same moment , and in consideration of the same set of circumstances , have our statements about their interconnections , which we deduce from our assumptions about the knowledge and the preferences of the person , any application .
It is important to remember that the so - called ‘ data ’ , from which we set out in this sort of analysis , are ( apart from his tastes ) all facts given to the person in question , the things as they are known to ( or believed by ) him to exist , and not in any sense objective facts .
It is only because of this that the propositions we deduce are necessarily
a priori valid , and that we preserve the consistency of the argument .
The two main conclusions from these considerations are ,
firstly , that since equilibrium relations exist between the successive actions of a person only in so far as they are part of the execution of the same plan , any change in the relevant knowledge of the person , that is , any change which leads him to alter his plan , disrupts the equilibrium relation between his actions taken before and those taken after the change in his knowledge .
In other words , the equilibrium relationship comprises only his actions during the period during which his anticipations prove correct .
Secondly , that since equilibrium is a relationship between actions , and since the actions of one person must necessarily take place successively in time , it is obvious that the passage of time is essential to give the concept of equilibrium any meaning .
This deserves mention since many economists appear to have been unable to find a place for time in equilibrium analysis and consequently have suggested that equilibrium must be conceived as timeless .
This seems to me to be a meaningless statement .
III
Now , in spite of what I have said before about the doubtful meaning of equilibrium analysis in this sense if applied to the conditions of a competitive society , I do not of course want to deny that the concept was originally introduced precisely to describe the idea of some sort of balance between the actions of different individuals .
All I have argued so far is that the sense in which we use the concept of equilibrium to describe the inter - dependence of the different actions of one person does not immediately admit of application to the relations between actions of different people .
The question really is what use we make of it when we speak of equilibrium with reference to a competitive system .
The first answer which would seem to follow from our approach is that equilibrium in this connection exists if the actions of all members of the society over a period are all executions of their respective individual plans on which each decided at the beginning of the period .
But when we inquire further what
exactly this implies , it appears that this answer raises more difficulties than it solves .
There is no special difficulty about the concept of an isolated person ( or a group of persons directed by one of them ) acting over a period according to a preconceived plan .
In this case the execution of the plan need not satisfy any special criteria in order to be conceivable .
It may of course be based on wrong assumptions concerning the external facts and on this account may have to be changed .
But there will always be a conceivable set of external events which would make it possible for the plan to be executed as originally conceived .
The situation is , however , different with the plans determined upon simultaneously but independently by a number of persons .
In the first instance , in order that all these plans can be carried out , it is necessary for them to be based on the expectation of the same set of external events , since , if different people were to base their plans on conflicting expectations , no set of external events could make the execution of all these plans possible .
And , secondly , in a society based on exchange their plans will to a considerable extent refer to actions which require corresponding actions on the part of other individuals .
This means that the plans of different individuals must in a special sense be compatible if it is to be even conceivable that they will be able to carry all of them out .
Or , to put the same thing in different words , since some of the ‘ data ’ on which any one person will base his plans will be the expectation that other people will act in a particular way , it is essential for the compatibility of the different plans that the plans
of the one contain exactly those actions which form the data for the plans of the other .
In the traditional treatment of equilibrium analysis part of this difficulty is apparently avoided by the assumption that the data , in the form of demand schedules representing individual tastes and technical facts , will be equally given to all individuals and that their acting on the same premises will somehow lead to their plans becoming adapted to each other .
That this does not really overcome the difficulty created by the fact that one person ’s decisions are the other person ’s data , and that it involves to some degree circular reasoning , has often been pointed out .
What , however , seems so far to have escaped notice is that this whole procedure involves a confusion of a much more general character , of which the point just mentioned is just a special instance , and which is due to an equivocation of the term ‘ datum ’ .
The data which now are supposed to be objective facts and the same for all people are evidently no longer the same thing as the data which formed the starting point for the tautological transformations of the pure logic of choice .
There ‘ data ’ meant all facts , and only the facts , which were present in the mind of the acting person , and only this subjective interpretation of the term datum made those propositions necessary truths .
‘ Datum ’ meant given , known , to the person under consideration .
But in the transition from the analysis of the action of an individual to the analysis of the situation in a society the concept has undergone an insidious change of meaning .
IV
The confusion about the concept of a datum is at the bottom of so many of our difficulties in this field that it is necessary to consider it in somewhat more detail .
Datum means of course something given , but the question which is left open , and which in the social sciences is capable of two different answers , is to whom the facts are supposed to be given .
Economists appear subconsciously always to have been somewhat uneasy about this point , and to have reassured themselves against the feeling that they did not
quite know to whom the facts were given by underlining the fact that they
were given – even by using such pleonastic expressions as ‘ given data ’ .
But this does not solve the question whether the facts referred to are supposed to be given to the observing economist , or to the persons whose actions he wants to explain , and if to the latter , whether it is assumed that the same facts are known to all the different persons in the system , or whether the ‘ data ’ for the different persons may be different .
There seems to be no possible doubt that these two concepts of ‘ data ’ , on the one hand in the sense of the objective real facts , as the observing economist is supposed to know them , and on the other in the subjective sense , as things known to the persons whose behaviour we try to explain , are really fundamentally different and ought to be kept carefully apart .
And , as we shall see , the question why the data in the subjective sense of the term should ever come to correspond to the objective data is one of the main problems we have to answer .
The usefulness of the distinction becomes immediately apparent when we apply it to the question of what we can mean by the concept of a society being at any one moment in a state of equilibrium .
There are evidently two senses in which it can be said that the subjective data , given to the different persons , and the individual plans , which necessarily follow from them , are in agreement .
We may merely mean that these plans are mutually compatible and that there is consequently a conceivable set of external events which will allow all people to carry out their plans and not cause any disappointments .
If this mutual compatibility of intentions were not given , and if in consequence no set of external events could satisfy all expectations , we could clearly say that this is not a state of equilibrium .
We have a situation where a revision of the plans on the part of at least some people is inevitable , or , to use a phrase which in the past has had a rather vague meaning , but which seems to fit this case perfectly , where endogenous disturbances are inevitable .
There is , however , still the other question of whether the individual subjective sets of data correspond to the objective data , and whether in consequence the expectations on which plans were
based are borne out by the facts .
If correspondence between data in this sense were required for equilibrium it would never be possible to decide otherwise than
ex post , at the end of the period for which people have planned , whether at the beginning the society has been in equilibrium .
It seems to be more in conformity with established usage to say in such a case that the equilibrium , as defined in the first sense , may be disturbed by an unforeseen development of the ( objective ) data , and to describe this as an exogenous disturbance .
In fact it seems hardly possible to attach any definite meaning to the much - used concept of a change in the ( objective ) data unless we distinguish between external developments in conformity with , and those different from , general expectations , and define as a ‘ change ’ any divergence of the actual from the expected development , irrespective of whether it means a ‘ change ’ in some absolute sense .
Surely if the alternations of the seasons suddenly ceased and the weather remained constant from a certain day onward , this would represent a change of data in our sense , that is a change relative to expectations , although in an absolute sense it would not represent a change but rather an absence of change .
But all this means that we can speak of a change in data only if equilibrium in the first sense exists , that is , if expectations coincide .
If they conflicted , any development of the external facts might bear out somebody ’s expectations and disappoint those of others , and there would be no possibility of deciding what was a change in the objective data .
V
For a society then we
can speak of a
state of equilibrium at a point of time – but it means only that compatibility exists between the different plans which the individuals composing it have made for action in time .
And equilibrium will continue , once it exists , so long as the external data correspond to the common expectations of all the members of the society .
The continuance of a state of equilibrium in this sense is then not dependent on the objective data being constant in an absolute sense , and is not necessarily
confined to a stationary process .
Equilibrium analysis becomes in principle applicable to a progressive society and to those intertemporal price relationships which have given us so much trouble in recent times .
These considerations seem to throw considerable light on the relationship between equilibrium and foresight , which has been somewhat hotly debated in recent times .
It appears that the concept of equilibrium merely means that the foresight of the different members of the society is in a special sense correct .
It must be correct in the sense that every person ’s plan is based on the expectation of just those actions of other people which those other people intend to perform , and that all these plans are based on the expectation of the same set of external facts , so that under certain conditions nobody will have any reason to change his plans .
Correct foresight is then not , as it has sometimes been understood , a precondition which must exist in order that equilibrium may be arrived at .
It is rather the defining characteristic of a state of equilibrium .
Nor need foresight for this purpose be perfect in the sense that it need extend into the indefinite future , or that everybody must foresee everything correctly .
We should
rather say that equilibrium will last so long as the anticipations prove correct , and that they need to be correct only on those points which are relevant for the decisions of the individuals .
But on this question of what relevant foresight or knowledge more later .
Before I proceed further I should probably stop for a moment to illustrate by a concrete example what I have just said about the meaning of a state of equilibrium and how it can be disturbed .
Consider the preparations which will be going on at any moment for the production of houses .
Brickmakers , plumbers and others will all be producing materials which in each case will correspond to a certain quantity of houses for which just this quantity of the particular material will be required .
Similarly we may conceive of prospective buyers as accumulating savings which will enable them at certain dates to buy definite quantities of houses .
If all these activities represent preparations for the production ( and acquisition ) of the same amount of houses we can say that there is equilibrium between them in the sense that all the people engaged in them may find that they can carry out their plans .
This need not be so , because other circumstances which are not part of their plan of action may turn out to be different from what they expected .
Part of the materials may be destroyed by an accident , weather conditions may make building impossible , or an invention may alter the proportions in which the different factors are wanted .
This is what we call a change in the ( objective ) data ,
which disturbs the equilibrium which has existed .
But if the different plans were from the beginning incompatible , it is inevitable that somebody ’s plans will be upset and have to be altered , and that in consequence the whole complex of actions over the period will not show those characteristics which apply if all the actions of each individual can be understood as part of a single individual plan he has made at the beginning .
VI
When in all this I emphasize the distinction between mere intercompatibility of the individual plans
and the correspondence between them and the actual external facts or objective data , I do not of course mean to suggest that the subjective inter-agreement is not in some way brought about by the external facts .
There would of course be no reason why the subjective data of different people should ever correspond unless they were due to the experience of the same objective facts .
But the point is that pure - equilibrium analysis is not concerned with the way in which this correspondence is brought about .
In the description of an existing state of equilibrium which it provides , it is simply assumed that the subjective data coincide with the objective facts .
The equilibrium relationships cannot be deduced merely from the objective facts , since the analysis of what people will do can only start from what is known to them .
Nor can equilibrium analysis start merely
from a given set of subjective data , since the subjective data of different people would be either compatible or incompatible , that is , they would already determine whether equilibrium did or did not exist .
We shall not get much further here unless we ask for the reasons for our concern with the admittedly fictitious state of equilibrium .
Whatever may occasionally have been said by over - pure economists , there seems to be no possible doubt that the only justification for this is the supposed existence of a tendency towards equilibrium .
It is only with this assertion that economics ceases to be an exercise in pure logic and becomes an empirical science ; and it is to economics as an empirical science that we must now turn .
In the light of our analysis of the meaning of a state of equilibrium it should be easy to say what is the real content of the assertion that a tendency towards equilibrium exists .
It can hardly mean anything but that under certain conditions the knowledge and intentions of the different members of society are supposed to come more and more into agreement , or , to put the same thing in less general and less exact but more concrete terms , that the expectations of the people and particularly of the entrepreneurs will become more and more correct .
In this form the assertion of the existence of a tendency towards equilibrium is clearly an empirical proposition , that is , an assertion about what happens in the real world which ought , at least in principle , to be capable of verification .
And it gives our somewhat abstract statement a rather plausible common - sense meaning .
The only trouble is that we are still pretty much in the dark about 1 ) the
conditions under which this tendency is supposed to exist , and 2 ) the nature of the
process by which individual knowledge is changed .
VII
In the usual presentations of equilibrium analysis it is generally made to appear as if these questions of how the equilibrium comes about were solved .
But if we look closer it soon becomes evident that these apparent demonstrations amount to no more than the
apparent proof of what is already assumed .
The device generally adopted for this purpose is the assumption of a perfect market where every event becomes known instantaneously to every member .
It is necessary to remember here that the perfect market which is required to satisfy the assumptions of equilibrium analysis must not be confined to the markets of all the individual commodities ; the whole economic system must be assumed to be one perfect market in which everybody knows everything .
The assumption of a perfect market then means nothing less than that all the members of the community , even if they are not supposed to be strictly omniscient , are at least supposed to know automatically all that is relevant for their decisions .
It seems that that skeleton in our cupboard , the ‘ economic man ’ , whom we have exorcised with prayer and fasting , has returned through the back door in the form of a quasi- omniscient individual .
The statement that , if people know everything , they are in equilibrium is true simply because that is how we define equilibrium .
The assumption of a perfect market in this sense is just another way of saying that equilibrium exists , but does not get us any nearer an explanation of when and how such a state will come about .
It is clear that if we want to make the assertion that under certain conditions people will approach that state we must explain by what process they will acquire the necessary knowledge .
Of course any assumption about the actual acquisition of knowledge in the course of this process will also be of a hypothetical character .
But this does not mean that all such assumptions are equally justified .
We have to deal here with assumptions about causation , so that what we assume must not only be regarded as possible ( which is certainly not the case if we just regard people as omniscient ) but must also be regarded as likely to be true , and it must be possible , at least in principle , to demonstrate that it is true in particular cases .
The essential point here is that it is these apparently subsidiary hypotheses or assumptions that people do learn from experience , and about how they acquire knowledge , which constitute the empirical content of our propositions about what happens in the real world .
They usually appear disguised and incomplete as a description of the type of market to which our proposition refers ; but this is only one , though perhaps the most important , aspect of the more general problem of how knowledge is acquired and communicated .
The important thing of which economists frequently do not seem to be aware is that the nature of these hypotheses is in many respects rather different from the more general assumptions from which the Pure Logic of Choice starts .
The main differences seem to me to be two .
Firstly , the assumptions from which the Pure Logic of Choice starts are facts which we know to be common to all human thought .
They may be regarded as axioms which define or delimit the field within which we are able to understand or mentally to reconstruct the processes of thought of other people .
They are therefore universally applicable to the field in which we are interested – although of course where
in concreto the limits of this field are is an empirical question .
They refer to a type of human action ( what we commonly call rational , or even merely conscious , as distinguished from instinctive action ) rather than to the particular conditions under which this action is undertaken .
But the assumptions or hypotheses , which we have to introduce when we want to explain the social processes , concern the relation of the thought of an individual to the outside world , the question to what extent and how his hypotheses must necessarily run in terms of assertions about causal connections , about how experience creates knowledge .
Secondly , while in the field of the Pure Logic of Choice our analysis can be made exhaustive , that is , while we can here develop a formal apparatus which covers all conceivable situations , the supplementary hypotheses must of necessity be selective , that is , we must select from the infinite variety of possible situations such ideal types as for some reason we regard as specially
relevant to conditions in the real world .
Of course we could also develop a separate science , the subject matter of which was
per definitionem confined to a ‘ perfect market ’ or some similarly defined object , just as the Logic of Choice applies only to persons who have to allot limited means among a variety of ends .
And for the field so defined our propositions would again become
a priori true .
But for such a procedure we should lack the justification which consists in the assumption that the situation in the real world is similar to what we assume it to be .
VIII
I must now turn to the question of what the concrete hypotheses are concerning the conditions under which people are supposed to acquire the relevant knowledge and the process by which they are supposed to acquire it .
If it were at all clear what the hypotheses usually employed in this respect were , we should have to scrutinize them in two respects : we should have to investigate whether they were necessary and sufficient to explain a movement towards equilibrium , and we should have to show to what extent they were borne out by reality .
But I am afraid I am now getting to a stage where it becomes exceedingly difficult to say what exactly are the assumptions on the basis of which we assert that there will be a tendency towards equilibrium , and to claim that our analysis has an application to the real world .
I cannot pretend that I have as yet got much further on this point .
Consequently all I can do is to ask a number of questions to which we shall have to find an answer if we want to be clear about the significance of our argument .
The only condition , about the necessity of which for the establishment of an equilibrium economists seem to be fairly
agreed , is the ‘ constancy of the data ’ .
But after what we have seen about the vagueness of the concept of ‘ datum ’ we shall suspect , and rightly , that this does not get us much further .
Even if we assume – as we probably must – that here the term is used in its objective sense ( which includes , it will be remembered , the preferences of the different individuals ) it is by no means clear that this is either required or sufficient in order that people shall actually acquire the necessary knowledge , or that it was meant as a statement of the conditions under which they will do so .
It is rather significant that at any rate some authors
feel it necessary to add ‘ perfect knowledge ’ as an additional and separate condition .
And indeed we shall see that constancy of the objective data is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition .
That it cannot be a necessary condition follows from the facts , firstly , that nobody would want to interpret it in the absolute sense that nothing must ever happen in the world , and , secondly , that , as we have seen , as soon as we want to include changes which occur periodically or perhaps even changes which proceed at a constant rate , the only way in which we can define constancy is with reference to expectations .
All that this condition amounts to then is that there must be some discernible regularity in the world which makes it possible to predict events correctly .
But while this is clearly not sufficient to prove that people will learn to foresee events correctly , the same is true to a hardly less degree even about constancy of data in an absolute sense .
For any one individual , constancy of the data does in no way mean constancy of all the facts independent of himself , since , of course , only the tastes and not the actions of the other people can in this sense be assumed to be constant .
And as all those other people will change their decisions as they gain experience about the external facts and other people ’s action , there is no reason why these processes of successive changes should ever come to an end .
These difficulties are well known
and I only mention them here to remind you how little we actually know about the conditions under which an equilibrium will ever be reached .
But
I do not propose to follow this line of approach further , though not because this question of the empirical probability that people will learn ( that is , that their subjective data will come to correspond with each other and with the objective facts ) is lacking in unsolved and highly interesting problems .
The reason is rather that there seems to me to be another and more fruitful way of approach to the central problem .
IX
The questions I have just discussed concerning the conditions under which people are likely to acquire the necessary knowledge , and the process by which they will acquire it , has at least received some attention in past discussions .
But there is a further question which seems to me to be at least equally important , but which appears to have received no attention at all , and that is how much knowledge and what sort of knowledge the different individuals must possess in order that we may be able to speak of equilibrium .
It is clear that if the concept is to have any empirical significance it cannot presuppose that everybody knows everything .
I have already had to use the undefined term ‘ relevant knowledge ’ , that is , the knowledge which is relevant to a particular person .
But what is this relevant knowledge ?
It can hardly mean simply the knowledge which actually influenced his actions , because his decisions might have been different not only if , for instance , the knowledge he possessed had been correct instead of incorrect , but also if he had possessed knowledge about altogether different fields .
Clearly there is here a problem of the
Division of Knowledge which is quite analogous to , and at least as important as , the problem of the division of labour .
But while the latter has been one of the main subjects of investigation ever since the beginning of our science , the former has been as completely neglected , although it seems to me to be the really central problem of economics as a social science .
The problem which we pretend
solve is how the spontaneous interaction of a number of people , each possessing only bits of knowledge , brings about a state of affaris in which prices correspond to costs , etc. , and which could be brought about by deliberate direction only by somebody who possessed the combined knowledge of all those individuals .
And experience shows us that something of this sort does happen , since the empirical observation that prices do tend to correspond to costs was the beginning of our science .
But in our analysis , instead of showing what bits of information the different persons must possess in order to bring about that result , we fall in effect back on the assumption that everybody knows everything and so evade any real solution of the problem .
Before , however , we can proceed further , to consider this division of knowledge among different persons , it is necessary to become more specific about the sort of knowledge which is relevant in this connection .
It has become customary among economists to stress only the need of knowledge of prices , apparently because – as a consequence of the confusions between objective and subjective data – the complete knowledge of the objective facts was taken for granted .
In recent times even the knowledge of current prices has been taken so much for granted that the only connection in which the question of knowledge has been regarded as problematic has been the anticipation of future prices .
But , as I have already indicated at the beginning , price expectations and even the knowledge of current prices are only a very small section of the problem of knowledge as I see it .
The wider aspect of the problem of knowledge with which I am concerned is the knowledge of the basic fact of how the different commodities can be obtained and used ,
and under what conditions they are actually obtained and used , that is , the general
question of why the subjective data to the different persons correspond to the objective facts .
Our problem of knowledge here is just the existence of this correspondence which in much of current equilibrium analysis is simply assumed to exist , but which we have to explain if we want to show why the propositions , which are necessarily true about the attitude of a person towards things which he believes to have certain properties , should come to be true of the actions of society with regard to things which either do posses these properties , or which , for some reason we shall have to explain , are commonly believed by the members of society to possess these properties .
But to revert to the special problem I have been discussing , the amount of knowledge different individuals must possess in order that equilibrium may prevail ( or the ‘ relevent ’ knowledge they must possess ) , we shall get nearer to an answer if we remember how it can become apparent either that equilibrium did not exist or that it is being distrubed .
We have seen that the equilibrium connections will be severed if any person changes his plans , either because his tastes change ( which does not concern us here ) or because new facts become known to him .
But there are evidently two different ways in which he may learn of new facts which make him change his plans , which for our purposes are of altogether different significance .
He may learn of the new facts as it were by accident , that is in a way which is not a necessary consequence of his attempt to execute his original plan , or it may be inevitable that in the course of his attempt he will find that the fact are
different from what he expected .
It is obvious that , in order that he may proceed according to plan , his knowledge needs to be correct only on the points on which it will necessarily be confirmed or corrected in the course of the execution of the plan .
But he may have no knowledge of things which , if he possessed it , would certainly affect his plan .
The conclusion then which we must draw is that the relevant knowledge which he must possess in order that equilibrium may prevail is the knowledge which he is bound to acquire in view of the position in which he originally is , and the plans which he then makes .
It is certainly not all the knowledge which , if he acquired it by accident , would be useful to him , and lead to a change in his plan .
And we may therefore very well have a position of equilibrium only because some people have no chance of learning about facts which , if they knew them , would induce them to alter their plans .
Or , in other words , it is only relative to the knowledge which a person is bound to acquire in the course of the carrying out of his original plan and its successive alterations that an equilibrium is likely to be reached .
While such a position represents in one sense a position of equilibrium , it is however clear that it is not an equilibrium in the special sense in which equilibrium is regarded as a sort of optimum position .
In order that the results of the combination of individual bits of knowledge should be comparable to the results of direction by an omniscient dictator , firther conditions must apparently be introduced .
And while it seems quite clear that it is possible to define the amount of knowledge which individuals must possess in order that this result should be obtained , I know of no real attempt in this direction .
One conditions would probably be that each of the alternative use of any sort of resources is known to the owner of some such resources actually used for another purpose and that in this way all the different uses of these resources are
connected , either directly or indirectly .
But I mention this condition only as an instance of how it will in most cases be sufficient that in each field is a certain margin of people who possess among them all the relevant knowledge .
To elaborate this further would be an interesting and a very important task , but a task that would far exceed the limits of this paper .
But although what I have said on this point has been largely in the form of a criticism , I do not want to appear unduly despondent about what we have already achieved in this field .
Even if we have jumped over an essential link in our argument , I still believe that by what is implicit in its reasoning , economics has come nearer than any other social science to an answer to that central question of all social sciences , how the combination of fragments of knowledge existing in different minds can bring about results which , if they were to be brought about deliberately , would require a knowledge on the part of the directing mind which no single person can possess .
To show that in this sense the spontaneous actions of individuals will under conditions which we can define bring about a distribution of resources which can be understood as if it were made according to a single plan , although nobody has planned it , seems to me indeed an answer to the problem which has sometimes been metaphorically described as that of the ‘ social mind ’ .
But we must not be surprised that such
claims on our part have usually been rejected by sociologists , since we have not based them on the right grounds .
There is only one more point in this connection which I should like to mention .
This is that if the tendency towards equilibrium , which we have reason to believe to exist on empirical grounds , is only towards an equilibrium relative to that knowledge which people will acquire in the course of their economic activity , and if any other change of knowledge must be regarded as a ‘ change in the data ’ in the usual sense of the term , which falls outside the sphere of equilibrium analysis , this would mean that equilibrium analysis can really tell us nothing about the significance of such changes in knowledge , and would go far to account for the fact that pure analysis seems to have so extraordinarily little to say about institutions , such as the press , the purpose of which is to communicate knowledge .
And it might even explain why the pre-occupation with pure analysis should so frequently create a peculiar blindness to the role played in real life by such institutions as advertising .
X
With these rather desultory remarks on topics which would deserve much more careful examination I must conclude my survey of these problems .
There are only one or two further remarks which I want to add .
One is that , in stressing the nature of the empirical propositions of which we must make use if the formal apparatus of equilibrium analysis is to serve for an explanation of the real world , and in emphasizing that the propositions about how people will learn , which are relevant in this connection , are of a fundamentally different nature from those of formal analysis , I do not mean to suggest that there opens here and how a wide field for empirical research .
I very much doubt whether such investigation would teach us anything new .
The important point is rather that we should become clear about what the questions of fact are on which the applicability of our argument to the real world depends , or , to put the same thing in other words , at what point our argument ,
when it is applied to phenomena of the real world , becomes subject to verification .
The second point is that I do not want of course to suggest that the sort of problems I have been discussing were foreign to the arguments of the economists of the older generations .
The only objection that can be made against them is that they have so mixed up the two sorts of propositions , the
a priori and the empirical , of which every realistic economist makes constant use , that it is frequently quite impossible to see what sort of validity they claimed for a particular statement .
More recent work has been freer from this fault – but only at the price of leaving more and more obscure what sort of relevance their arguments had to the phenomena of the real world .
All I have tried to do has been to find the way back to the common - sense meaning of our analysis , of which , I am afraid , we are apt to lose sight as our analysis becomes more elaborate .
You may even feel that most of what I have said has been commonplace .
But from time to time it is probably necessary to detach oneself from the technicalities of the argument and to ask quite naïvely what it is all about .
If I have only shown that in some respects the answer to this question is not only not obvious , but that occasionally we do not even quite know what it is , I have succeeded in my purpose .

BRIDGEPORT , Conn .-- Grieving residents of the P.T. Barnum Apartments , the state 's largest public housing complex , angered and outraged by the recent death of a neighbor and the hazardous conditions they are forced to live in , are raising their voices -- and turning a tragedy into an opportunity to air their grievances .
The P.T. Barnum Apartments were built in 1951 as a 484 - unit , 22 - building complex for low - income families .
A typical P.T. unit consists of a sunken first - floor apartment with a two - story apartment above that .
For decades , the P.T. apartments have housed some of the state 's most impoverished residents .
Over the years , the buildings have been remodeled to accommodate a current residential population of 1,080 , mostly people of color .
The latest update was made in 1992 , when interior fire doors and fire escapes were removed .
On November 13 , firefighters found the bodies of 22 - year - old Tiana Black , her 5 - year - old son Nyshon and 4 - year - old twin daughters Nyasija and Tyasjia in their P.T. apartment .
They were upstairs , presumably asleep , when a fire started in the early morning hours in their kitchen .
Firefighters found sooty handprints in a trail on the walls leading from the third floor bedrooms to the downstairs door -- an eerie mark left by the family 's attempt to exit their apartment .
Their bodies were found just inside the door of the second - floor exit , where they apparently succumbed to smoke inhalation .
What makes this tragedy even more horrific is that the only exit in the two - story apartment is on the second floor .
If there were fire escapes on the third floor , the family might still be alive .
Shockingly , the apartment egresses are within the legal fire code and the Bridgeport Housing Authority ( BHA ) is defending its position .
The city claims that residents in these apartments do have another exit on the third floor -- if they were to climb out onto a small roof overhang .
Hardly a safety exit , the portion of the roof officials are referring to is about three - and - a - half feet wide and is pitched forward , about 20 feet above a dirt - and - concrete ground .
Parents with babies in tow , children and elderly residents would certainly be put in harm 's way by crawling out a small window and crowding onto a small section of roof more than two stories above the ground .
HUNDREDS OF angry residents and supporters packed into a BHA Board of Commissioners meeting on November 16 to demand changes to their apartment complex .
Many expressed their anger and fear that they could end up in the same position as Tiana Black 's family .
Camille Sneed , a young mother and resident of P.T. , said , " I 'm in a household with five kids .
I can't grab them all and jump out the window .
Somebody said we 're supposed to sit on the roof -- that 's not happening .
Something needs to be done immediately . "
Another resident voiced his concern about waiting a month for a repair to his door that did n't open .
" We had to go through the window to exit .
I just thank God that my family was never put in that position where there was a fire , because we would have perished . "
City officials were present to answer questions .
Bridgeport Mayor Bill Finch said in regard to the apartment complex , " These are big changes we have to make .
These children and this mother will not have died in vain . "
However , Finch also said that he does n't " have a magic wand " to resolve the issues , a comment which seems to ignore the urgency of living in unsafe housing .
He also said that he would try to find funding in the budget .
BHA Executive Director Nicholas Calace was also at the meeting , although he was less assured that the city would find the funding for building improvements .
His stopgap plan to improve the safety of residents at P.T. is to implement fire - safety training , which , as a stand - alone measure , is an insult to residents .
Calace 's disregard for the tenant safety was clearly expressed when he said , " They do n't want to hear it , but this place is built to code . "
Tell that to 11 - year - old resident Emony Hamilton , who showed that she knew more about safety than Calace when she said , " We want all the little children to be safe .
We do n't want to throw them out the window . "
Calace 's idea of safety does just that .
The death of this family points to the utter disregard that working - class people and disproportionate numbers of working - class people of color face in the lack of decent and affordable housing today .
Close to 60 percent of Bridgeport renters can't afford the rent charged for a two - bedroom apartment .
At the same time , Bridgeport has the highest rate of home foreclosure in Connecticut , with many homes sitting vacant .
It 's not just low - income families that are in this predicament , since the fallout of the real estate market and the massive layoffs that accompanied the economic downturn there has been a 33 percent increase in the number of families on the waiting list for public housing .
Magic wands do n't build fire escapes or safe housing , and if the residents of P.T. are to avoid another tragedy they can't wait until Mayor Finch finds funding .
With city and state purse strings tight , they are going to have organize to put pressure on the city to demand that they have safe housing .
Cities and states are spending near - record amounts to retain their expensive cadres of Washington lobbyists , even as the worst economic recession in a generation prompts layoffs , mounting deficits and falling property - tax revenues .
States and localities are on track to spend a combined $ 83.1 million in taxpayer money this year on Washington lobbyists , the second straight recession year to top the previously unbroached $ 80 million barrier , according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
By comparison , officials spent less than half that much - $ 38.5 million - lobbying Washington in 2001 .
Lobbying expenditures by states and localities rose by 118 percent from 2001 to 2008 , compared with a 101 percent increase among all sectors of the economy that lobbied Washington over the same period , according to the data .
For the first six months of 2009 , the center reports , local governments spent almost $ 41.6 million on such lobbying .
During the first half of 2009 , Miami - Dade County spent $ 410,000 on Washington lobbyists at the same time it confronted a reported $ 444 million deficit .
The Florida county is just one of 73 localities , states or territories to spend $ 100,000 or more on lobbyists so far this year to push their agendas in Washington , according to data from the watchdog group .
“ Even though the economy has been as rotten as it has , the municipal , county , state and territorial governments of the country are just about on pace to equal the lobbying expenditures that they put forth last year , ” said Dave Levinthal , a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics .
It ’s unclear whether governors , county executives , mayors and other public officials continue paying lobbyists in spite of or because of the recession , Mr. Levinthal said .
Critics decry the use of scarce tax dollars on lobbyists , arguing that the funds could be used to reduce taxes or improve public safety and social services .
Supporters say the recession makes lobbying even more important , with local jurisdictions facing tough competition for federal aid .
“ When state and local lobbyists chase federal dollars , taxpayers are always the ones who get trapped in the cycle , ” said Pete Sepp , vice president of policy for the National Taxpayers Union .
“ The lower - level governments say they ’re only fighting for their fair share of a pot of money , but when that pot of money gets emptied , Washington makes the pot bigger the next time around because of the demand , which in turn only encourages states and localities to hire more lobbyists , ” Mr. Sepp said .
“ In essence , ” he added , “ states , counties and cities are simply kicking fiscal problems brought on by their own overspending upstairs to Washington , D.C. , which is itself overspending to bail out other public and private entities . ”
Officials in Miami - Dade see things differently , saying they have received tens of millions of dollars in federal funding for much - needed river dredging , explosive - detection devices and “ neighborhood stabilization . ”
Miami - Dade officials credit lobbyists with helping them secure federal funding of more than $ 130 million for three projects in the past several years .
“ We ’ve obviously gotten a lot of bang for the buck , ” said Joe Rasco , director of intergovernmental affairs for the county .
Without lobbyists , he said , the county would have a tougher time securing money from Washington , though he said work by the county ’s congressional delegation is important as well .
Miami -Dade ranks behind only Pennsylvania and Puerto Rico in Washington lobbying expenditures so far this year , according to the Center for Responsive Politics , which analyzed governmental and quasi - governmental lobbying expenditures to come up with the rankings .
Miami -Dade retained several lobbying firms this year , paying the firms from $ 30,000 to $ 180,000 each , according to public records .
Senate filings show that the county has lobbied for dozens of issues including veterans - service funding , a dredging project in Miami Harbor and Medicaid legislation .
The county spent $ 890,000 last year compared with $ 1.3 million in 2004 , records show .
Pennsylvania has spent $ 540,000 so far this year , while Puerto Rico topped the list with $ 610,000 , according to disclosures .
A spokesman for Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell , a Democrat , declined to comment for this article .
Puerto Rico officials say they ’re in a unique situation because they have no voting members in Congress .
Despite its ranking as the top spender , Puerto Rico has cut back on lobbying in recent years .
It spent just more than $ 2 million last year compared with more than $ 5 million in 1999 .
“ Puerto Ricans receive much less federal funding per capita than their fellow Americans on the mainland , ” said Ken Oliver , a spokesman for the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration in Washington .
Mr. Oliver said Puerto Rico ’s lobbying efforts have helped secure $ 263 million in federal aid for public housing , $ 174 million for transportation and $ 2.3 million for public health facilities so far this year .
Other big spenders include Los Angeles County , which spent $ 380,000 through June 30 ; Riverside County , Calif. , which as spent $ 300,000 ; and San Diego County and Michigan ’s Wayne County , which have spent $ 230,000 apiece so far this year , according to records .
Some smaller cities and states surpassed larger ones in Washington lobbying fees this year .
Nevada spent $ 230,000 and Indiana spent $ 167,000 , while the nation ’s most populous state , California , paid $ 125,000 for lobbying in Washington .
Anchorage has paid $ 185,000 to have lobbyists represent the interests of the Alaskan city ’s 279,243 residents in Washington , while Houston , with a population of more than 2 million people , has spent $ 120,000 so far this year .
The District of Columbia spent $ 80,000 last year compared with $ 300,000 in 2005 .
Baltimore spent nearly $ 200,000 last year , down from nearly $ 300,000 in 2005 .
Neither Maryland nor Virginia reported any lobbying fees , while Fairfax County spent $ 60,000 during the first half of this year , after spending $ 120,000 last year .

The announcement that Ricky Gervais will host next year 's Golden Globe award ceremony – the first time they have had a single MC , rather than rolling presenters , since 1995 – is a triumphant homecoming of sorts .
It was victory there that marked The Office 's and Gervais 's own coming - out onto the world entertainment stage , and set the template for the irreverent approach to award ceremonies in which he has delighted ever since .
In 2004 , when The Office was nominated for a Golden Globe for best comedy series and Gervais nominated for best TV comedy actor , the nods were unexpected : for all its recognition in the UK , the series was hardly user - friendly by US TV standards and had only been seen on the niche channel BBC America .
Expectations were accordingly low : in the DVD featurette about the cast and crew 's trip to Los Angeles for the awards , Gervais is seen insisting ahead of time that they have " no chance " , which seemed reasonable enough given that the competition included Will & Grace , Arrested Development and Sex and the City .
They won both categories but did indeed present an unusual sight on a stage dominated by Hollywood icons : leads Martin Freeman and Lucy Davis flanked by pudgy Gervais , lanky Stephen Merchant and producer Ash Atalla , a diminutive Asian chap in a wheelchair .
If Gervais felt out of his depth , he did n't show it .
" I 'm not from these parts , " he smirked at the largely baffled audience .
" I 'm from a little place called England .
We used to run the world before you . "
Any whisper of conspicuous humility , Hollywood - style , went out the window when he picked up his second , individual gong .
" Two !
Bookends .
Excellent .
You need the set . "
Since then , Gervais has missed few opportunities to use his American awards – he also won Emmys in 2006 and 2007 – as sticks to beat their British counterparts .
When Merchant won the Best Comedy Actor award for his role in Extras at the 2006 British Comedy Awards , Gervais butted into the ceremony via satellite link from New York to congratulate his collaborator on what must seem like an honour .
" Not to me , " he added .
" I 've won American ones .
But to people in that room , this is probably the highlight of their career …
Enjoy the night there with the cream of British comedy .
I 'm off to have dinner with Jerry Seinfeld and Ben Stiller .
That 's true . "
A couple of years later , he again appeared via video link at the Comedy Awards , accepting an award by shrugging that to go in person would be " beneath me , to be honest .
I 've won Golden Globes and Emmys . "
Not that Gervais has shown much inclination to take US award ceremonies much more seriously since becoming a staple over there .
Presenting a gong at this year 's Emmys , he ribbed the audience by noting that " the thing about the Oscars and the Golden Globes [ is ] they 've got film stars there with their jawlines and chiselled looks , making me feel bad .
In this room – I 'm not being funny – I 'm probably above average . "
He also emphasised his happiness to make industry in - jokes , making a quip about syndication practices then commenting that it was a " joke just for the 5000 people in this room , not for the 5000 people watching at home . "
He has also made great play of the debt Steve Carell supposedly owes him for starring in the US version of The Office .
At the 2007 Emmys , Gervais won the award for lead actor in a comedy series for Extras .
In his absence , Carell , who had also been nominated , bounded on stage with conspicuous joy to accept the gong instead .
The following year , Gervais , presenting an award , milked the bit to great applause when he confronted Carell and , eventually , retrieved the award .
It was during that exchange that Gervais hit on what , one presumes , award - show organisers like about him .
" I 've gone off - road , " he giggled .
" Everyone 's getting nervous now , there 's nothing on the autocue , I could do anything .
This is live . "
He also seemed to go " off- road " at this year 's Globes , when he referred from the stage to Kate Winslet 's cameo some years before in Extras .
Playing herself , she appeared in a fictitious Second World War movie on the assumption that it would lead to award - season glory .
" Well done , Winslet , I told you , " Gervais said from the stage at the Beverly Hilton , where she had won a Best Actress Globe for her part as a former Nazi camp guard in The Reader .
" Do a Holocaust movie and the awards come .
Did n't I ? Trouble is with Holocaust films , there 's never any gag reel on the DVDs … "
When Gervais takes to the stage next year , then , he 'll be on familiar ground , expected to dish up a little risqué humour without derailing proceedings .
Here 's hoping he rewards those expectations .
After their victory in 2004 , Stephen Merchant noted of the Golden Globe that " it 's such a badly designed award … it looks like something you 'd win at a judo tournament . "
Gervais countered that " it is good for shoving up your arse . "
Even from an unconventional host , that might be a bit much .
Josh Anderson for The New York Times
The Issue
It is election day , and here in New York we are voting for mayor , or , more accurately , not voting .
The campaign of the current mayor , Michael Bloomberg , has predicted that fewer than a third of registered voters will make it to the polls .
Responding to our country ’s typically low turnouts , some groups strive to get people to vote , not for anyone in particular , but as an expression of civic virtue ( vote for the candidate of your choice , but vote ) .
Should we support nonpartisan efforts to get people to fulfill this putative duty of citizenship ?
The Argument
We should not .
It is a fine thing to rally support for a person or a policy you esteem .
It is reasonable to urge your neighbors to be informed about issues that affect your community .
But it is irresponsible to encourage the unaware to put their ignorance into action so aimlessly .
“ Just vote ” does n’t express civic virtue ; it ’s sentimentality .
You might as well urge the unpracticed to use power tools or Rollerblade .
Simultaneously .
At least they ’d injure only themselves .
We are indeed an ignorant people .
A 2008 survey found that only 18 percent of Americans could name all three of the following : the U.S. secretary of state , the British prime minister and the party that controls the U.S. House of Representatives .
A 2009 study revealed that only about half of adults know how long it takes the earth to orbit the sun .
Healthcare , the big issue of the day ?
Thirty - nine percent of Americans want government to “ stay out of Medicare . ”
And then there ’s bison awareness .
The Wildlife Conservation Society asked 2,000 Americans more than 50 questions about bison .
Apparently we are stunningly uneducated about bison affairs .
Even more disturbing is that 2,000 Americans were willing to answer 50 questions about bison : talk about too much free time .
In our defense , politics is a complicated business , and few of us have the time or training or inclination to become sophisticated about all that we are asked to vote on .
In other eras and other places , we assigned that task to a political party , affiliating ourselves with one that reflected our values and advanced our interests , choosing for example to vote Labor or Conservative .
But what does it mean to vote Democratic when that party includes both Ben Nelson and Barney Frank ?
There ’s such a thing as too big a tent , one so vast and shapeless that it no longer encompasses a shared sense of the public good .
In any case , voting is not an ethical obligation .
Nor is it required by American law ; voting is something citizens may do , not something we must , like pay taxes and attend school and , at various times in our history , perform military service .
Many democracies have tried compulsory voting .
Belgium , for example , introduced such a requirement as early as 1892 , Argentina in 1914 .
Some later rescinded these measures , and where they remain they are not always vigorously enforced .
One rationale for regarding voting as a duty is that to confer legitimacy on laws and leaders requires a broad expression of the public will .
If merely a third of registered voters participate in today ’s mayoral election , and just over half of them vote for , say , Michael Bloomberg , he ’ll gain office with the formal endorsement of only one - sixth of the electorate .
Factor in potentially eligible voters who did not register and that number gets smaller .
It shrinks further when you include non-citizens and New Yorkers too young to vote .
The mayor is apt to be reelected by fewer than 10 percent of us .
Some democracy .
But while that outcome may be unsettling , it does not follow that voting is an ethical duty .
What sort of legitimacy is gained by shoving a voter into a booth where he finds no candidate he genuinely wants to support ?
National efforts like MTV’s Rock the Vote are particularly idiotic ( and not just because of that network ’s determination to include the word “ rock ” in its every pronouncement , a sort of verbal MSG , to sprinkle on a little pseudo - hipness ) .
A nonpartisan voter drive encourages people to vote who may well vote against you .
Are n’t psychiatrists dismayed when a patient acts self - destructively ?
More accurately , Rock the Vote and its ilk would be idiotic if they were effective .
Happily , these endeavors are unlikely to alter the outcome of an election .
A nonpartisan push is apt to rally Republicans as well as Democrats , liberals as well as conservatives , who will vote in the same proportions as those already inclined to go to the polls .
The net result : nothing , save for the warm glow of civic virtue that comes from bullying your neighbors into pulling a lever , any lever .
This is not to argue against partisan efforts to get out the vote .
It is admirable to work for the good of your family , your neighbors , your nation .
Sometimes the way to do that is to vote in support of a particular candidate or ballot measure .
When , for example , toxic air threatens your children , or a loopy cult aims to take over your local school board , and the ballot offers meaningful recourse , then voting rises to the level of a moral duty .
That is , in certain situations ethics compels you not merely to vote but to vote a particular way .
In such cases , the important consideration is not whether to fire a pistol , but in what direction .

Brazil 's President Lula ' Father of the Poor ' Has Triggered Economic Miracle
Brazil is seen as an economic success story and its people revere President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva like a star .
He is on a mission to turn the country into one of the world 's five biggest economies through reforms , giant infrastructure projects and by tapping vast oil reserves .
But he faces hurdles .
For more on this video visit U.N. Watch :
Thank you , Mr. President .
I am the former commander of the British forces in Afghanistan .
I served with NATO and the United Nations ; commanded troops in Northern Ireland , Bosnia and Macedonia ; and participated in the Gulf War .
I spent considerable time in Iraq since the 2003 invasion , and worked on international terrorism for the UK Government ’s Joint Intelligence Committee .
Mr. President , based on my knowledge and experience , I can say this : During Operation Cast Lead , the Israeli Defence Forces did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any other army in the history of warfare .
Israel did so while facing an enemy that deliberately positioned its military capability behind the human shield of the civilian population .
Hamas , like Hizballah , are expert at driving the media agenda .
Both will always have people ready to give interviews condemning Israeli forces for war crimes .
They are adept at staging and distorting incidents .
The IDF faces a challenge that we British do not have to face to the same extent .
It is the automatic , Pavlovian presumption by many in the international media , and international human rights groups , that the IDF are in the wrong , that they are abusing human rights .
The truth is that the IDF took extraordinary measures to give Gaza civilians notice of targeted areas , dropping over 2 million leaflets , and making over 100,000 phone calls .
Many missions that could have taken out Hamas military capability were aborted to prevent civilian casualties .
During the conflict , the IDF allowed huge amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza .
To deliver aid virtually into your enemy ’s hands is , to the military tactician , normally quite unthinkable .
But the IDF took on those risks .
Despite all of this , of course innocent civilians were killed .
War is chaos and full of mistakes .
There have been mistakes by the British , American and other forces in Afghanistan and in Iraq , many of which can be put down to human error .
But mistakes are not war crimes .
More than anything , the civilian casualties were a consequence of Hamas ’ way of fighting .
Hamas deliberately tried to sacrifice their own civilians .
Mr. President , Israel had no choice apart from defending its people , to stop Hamas from attacking them with rockets .
And I say this again : the IDF did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any other army in the history of warfare .
Thank you , Mr. President .
The Commission wants the UK to do more to protect privacy The UK government has been accused of failing to protect citizens ' privacy by the European Commission .
It said the government should have done more to guarantee online privacy when trials of a controversial ad - serving system were carried out in 2006 .
The Commission said it had now started the second phase of legal action over the trials .
If the UK fails to answer the criticism satisfactorily , it faces being taken to the European court .
" People 's privacy and the integrity of their personal data in the digital world is not only an important matter , it is a fundamental right , protected by European law , " said Viviane Reding , EU telecoms commissioner .
Law change
The Commission started the legal action following trials of the Phorm ad - serving system on BT 's network in 2006 and 2007 .
Although the UK government was happy with the way that the trial was run , critics said BT 's customers who were unwittingly enrolled in it should have had the chance to opt out .
Brussels said this showed that UK laws , particularly The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act , did not do enough to protect data about the e-mails and web browsing habits of citizens .
" I therefore call on the UK authorities to change their national laws to ensure that British citizens fully benefit from the safeguards set out in EU law concerning confidentiality of electronic communications , " said Ms Reding .
The Commission has sent a letter containing its opinion to the UK which now has two months to respond .
If the Commission is unsatisfied with the response it could take the case to an EU court and perhaps force a change in UK law .
In response a Home Office spokesperson said : " We are firmly committed to protecting users ' privacy and data .
We are considering the Commission 's letter and will respond in due course . "

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
This is the second installment in a series of health - care columns by Fortune 's Shawn Tully .
Unlike the House bill that fills 1,100 pages , my proposed health - care plan can be expressed in four simple bullet points .
The marketplace , with more than 100 million consumers writing their own checks , will take care of the rest .
1. Eliminate the tax break for employer health plans .
About two in three Americans get health coverage through their employer .
On the surface , the system appears to work well : Most people like their plans .
The deductibles and co-pays are usually low , and they do n't have to worry about shopping for insurance .
But the employer plans also carry a heavy cost that 's hidden from the employee .
Workers do n't realize it , but they 're sacrificing a big part of their pay because their company is providing coverage .
The employer is often offering extremely rich , expensive plans .
That sounds good , until you realize that you 're losing thousands of dollars in take - home pay , or tens of thousands , in exchange for coverage that you 'd never buy if you had that money in your paycheck .
The goal of a free - market plan is to channel the cash companies now spend to cover their employees back to the workers who really pay for it .
That puts consumers in charge .
Once in command , those consumers would typically receive bigger paychecks , and have plenty left over after buying perfectly serviceable insurance , chiefly for the unexpected illnesses that are extremely costly to treat .
They would also pay for a lot more medical expenses out of their own pocket with the extra cash .
That 's a good thing , since it would encourage Americans to shop for best prices and highest quality .
In other words , they would behave like normal consumers , a practice the current system discourages , and the Obama plan would discourage even more .
So why do we have a system where employers , not employees , usually purchase health care ?
During World War II , strict wage controls prevented companies from attracting scarce workers by offering higher pay .
So in 1943 , Congress granted employers the right to offer tax - free health benefits in lieu of extra cash in their paychecks .
Until then , Americans were buying policies with their own after - tax dollars .
But the law transformed the system , and distorted the marketplace : Suddenly , companies could buy insurance for employees at a far lower cost than they could buy it for themselves , via a big tax subsidy .
The goal now is to hand both the cash companies spend on health care , and the subsidy as well , back to consumers .
Here 's how the current system works , and a blueprint for fixing it .
If an employee earns $ 110,000 a year , and the employer pays $ 9,000 towards the employee 's $ 12,000 insurance plan , the worker only gets taxed on the $ 110,000 salary .
The extra $ 9,000 is , in effect , tax - free income .
Say the company dropped its plan and gave the employee $ 9,000 in extra pay .
He or she would pocket just $ 6,000 after taxes .
So companies can buy 50 % more health care for employee than the employees could buy if they got the money directly .
Of course , the government is making up the difference with a $ 3,000 subsidy .
That money is n't free either .
The health - care exclusion is the biggest tax break in the U.S. budget , even bigger than mortgage interest .
It lowers revenues , and hence raises taxes , by $ 300 billion a year .
So here 's the best solution .
Let 's repeal the employer exclusion .
In our example , the employer would give its workers the money it now spends on health care in extra pay -- in this case , the $ 9,000 .
Why ?
Because in a competitive labor market , companies need to provide the same total compensation or risk losing employees to rivals .
That 's just basic economics , and it would still happen even with today 's high unemployment rate .
Now , the employee has an extra $ 6,000 to pay for health care .
That 's the first part of the solution .
Part two is to restore the subsidy , but this time give it directly to consumers .
The government would collect an extra $ 300 billion in taxes .
It could grant $ 2,500 a year to individuals , and $ 5,000 to families from that pot without raising taxes or increasing the deficit .
So a family would have an extra $ 11,000 to spend on health care .
So which plans would families purchase ?
That 's impossible to predict with certainty .
Many may choose expensive plans that cost as much as the ones their companies provide -- in our example a $ 12,000 policy .
But given the choice , millions more Americans could go for far less expensive , high - deductible policies that cover the big - ticket essentials such as a stroke or heart attack .
That 's the way insurance is supposed to work -- not as an open - ended benefit , but as protection against unforeseen , catastrophic events .
If your house burns down , the insurance company pays .
If you wash the windows or fix the screens , you pay .
Let 's return to our example .
A high - deductible family policy in Pennsylvania or Kentucky costs around $ 5,500 .
The employee would then have $ 5,500 left over to cover routine tests and physician visits .
That would unleash the power of the American consumer in an epic way .
Then , we 'd see if the laws of supply and demand really work in health care .
2. Deregulate the three big inflators of health - care costs
The Obama plan would take three regulations that vastly inflate costs on the state level , and enshrine them into federal law .
It 's young Americans who suffer most today from these laws and would suffer more under Obamacare .
As we 'll see , in many states they 're already forced to pay far more than their actual cost , a major reason so many of the healthy twenty - and thirtysomethings have dropped their insurance .
Under Obamacare , they'd be forced under threat of heavy fines to pay what amounts to a big tax to pay for other people 's care , chiefly that of older Americans .
The first of these regulations is the " standard benefits package . "
Twenty states -- including Maryland , Colorado , California , Florida , and New York -- require that dozens of specific benefits be covered in any insurance plan .
A typical list encompasses hearing aids , chiropractic services , obesity treatments , autism care , and drug - abuse therapy .
The Obama plan , for example , would require coverage for dependents until the age of 26 .
Many of these benefits are in the state plans not because they 're essential to basic care , but because they 're promoted by powerful lobbying groups .
Obama wants to mandate these plans for all Americans .
He then plans to heavily subsidize them .
These mandated , rich packages are a major cause of health - care inflation in many states .
Eliminating them would allow consumers to pick among a vast variety of plans .
The second cost - raising regulation is " community rating . "
Under strict community rating , providers are forced to charge the same premiums for all patients , no matter what their actual costs .
The restrictions are extremely strong in nine states , including New York , New Jersey , Massachusetts , Vermont , Colorado , and Oregon .
But young people cost far less to insure than older Americans for a simple reason :
They require far less care .
Yet in community - rating states , workers in their 20s are forced to pay close to , if not the same , premiums as people in their 50s and 60s whose medical expenses are three to four times larger .
For the young , the problem is magnified by standard benefits packages , since they drive up the average cost of all policies in the state .
And if any group wants basic policies ( rather than extremely comprehensive , rich ones ) , it 's young Americans .
As a result , community rating has pushed millions of young people out of the insurance market .
The third damaging regulation is called " guaranteed issue . "
It requires that insurers accept anyone who applies , including patients with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and cancer .
Once again , the laws undermine the whole concept of insurance .
" The carriers want to insure you for insurable events -- stroke , heart attack , or an unexpected illness , " John Sheils of the Lewin Group , a health - care consulting and research firm .
" What they worry about is patients who go to see their doctor , learn they have diabetes , and enroll to have the provider pay for their care . "
A major problem with guaranteed issue is that , once again , it punishes the young and healthy .
If a lot of patients suffering from diabetes and heart conditions enroll in the plan , the average cost rises steeply .
Once again , in states like New York , New Jersey , and Vermont , everyone has to pay the same , or nearly the same premiums .
That 's not such a problem for older people because they 'll still pay less than what they really cost .
But it 's a burden on the healthy population , and especially the young .
To be sure , America must help diabetes patients pay for their expensive care , and we 'll tell you how in a minute .
But the costs should n't be inordinately born by young Americans just starting their careers at relatively low salaries .
The Obama plan would make all three of these big inflators the law of the land .
The free - market solution is to let freedom ring by eliminating all three restrictions .
Here 's an elegant solution :
Allow consumers to buy insurance across state lines -- a freedom that 's now banned and would stay banned under Obamacare .
Today , a 25 - year - old in New York pays six times as much for coverage as someone the same age in Kentucky .
If the restriction on nationwide shopping were abolished , New Yorkers could buy their policies at a fraction of the current cost in Illinois or Pennsylvania .
Business would flow to the least - regulated , lowest - cost markets .
That would be a big victory for deregulation .
3. Protect people with pre-existing conditions
Creating a true national market is essential to my proposal .
But the free - market solution will work only if it overcomes a huge obstacle : protecting people with pre-existing conditions .
The numbers are hard to get , but a good estimate is that several million Americans suffer from cancer , diabetes , or another chronic illness .
Many of them are now insured by their employers .
Those companies do n't charge them any more for insurance than they do their younger colleagues .
Remember , under my proposal , employers will drop their plans and put the money they now spend on health care into their workers ' paychecks .
So let 's take a middle - income worker with diabetes .
Today , in New York State , he or she would be covered , because the patient could enroll in a plan required to take all comers and could not be charged any more than a healthy 30 - year - old .
But once consumers can shop across state borders , the young people who subsidized those with pre-existing conditions will flee to low - cost plans offered in other states .
Community rating would disappear .
In theory , the diabetes sufferer would face a huge increase in premiums .
America can't allow that to happen .
It 's clear that to make a mostly free - market plan work , those with chronic illnesses need to be protected .
Fortunately , the template is already in place .
About 30 states , usually those without requirements for community rating or guaranteed issue , have high - risk pools that automatically enroll people with pre-existing conditions .
Their premiums generally can't exceed 150 % of the average plan within the state , even though the patients may actually cost far more .
The full costs of the high - risk pools are covered from state income - and sales - tax revenues .
Under a free - market plan , states that do n't now have high - risk pools would create them , modeled after the models that work best .
The problem posed by pre-existing conditions would be temporary .
As consumers start spending their own money on coverage , the market would explode with creative insurance plans .
It 's likely that carriers will offer plans like the ones in Europe that offer coverage for as much as 40 or 50 years .
Under those policies , in exchange for making essentially a lifetime commitment to the insurer , the consumer pays a specified schedule of rates that can not be changed .
4 . Do n't forget the supply side
Many elements of this free - market model are included in two excellent plans .
One is Sen. John McCain 's proposal as a candidate .
But McCain did n't take on the problem of pre-existing conditions that 's a linchpin of any reform package .
Today , the best solution is the one proposed by a group of Congressmen , including Paul Ryan , a Wisconsin Republican .
It would include most of the elements I 've recommended .
But what the Ryan plan misses -- as did the McCain platform -- is the importance of reforming laws that limit the supply of medical services .
Indeed , giving health - care consumers control over their own money -- the money employers now spend for them -- would create a true market where bargain prices and high quality should reign .
That 's " should . "
But deregulating the demand side is n't enough .
Health care is rife with more monopolistic restrictions than any other industry : certificate - of - need laws that restrict the number of hospitals in states from California to New York , medical - licensing restrictions that prevent nurses and other practitioners from providing basic care , and limitations on the number of physician specialists .
Believe it or not , it has practically become gospel in medical circles that shrinking the doctor supply is a way to save money .
At best , it 's extremely dubious economics to think that shrinking the supply of anything can reduce costs !
Deregulating the supply side is n't even part of the health - care debate at the moment , yet it 's crucial to our free - market model .
The Obama plan does nothing to ease these restrictions and , in fact , is offering the providers more monopolistic protections to support the plan .

A dispute between Russia and Ukraine in January cut supplies to Europe
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said Ukraine might be having problems paying for gas , raising new concerns over European supplies .
Mr Putin said the European Union had not yet given Ukraine the money it had promised to help provide stable supplies of Russian gas to Europe .
He also blamed Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko for blocking payment .
In January , many countries were left short of gas because of a payment dispute between Moscow and Kiev .
' Blocking funds '
" It appears we are again having problems with payments for our energy supplies , which is extremely regrettable .
The EU has still not provided Ukraine with the money it has promised for that purpose , " Mr Putin said .
" European leaders are referring us to the European Commission , while the European Commission leadership are evading discussing the issue with us . "
But Mr Putin said that despite the lack of funding from the EU , Ukraine still had plenty of cash to pay its gas bills .
Referring to the country 's large gold and foreign currency reserves , he said : " According to the Ukrainian Prime Minister [ Yulia Tymoshenko ] , Yushchenko is obstructing normal co-operation between the central bank and the Ukrainian government and is blocking the transfer of relevant funds . "
In August , the EU and international lending institutions agreed a $ 1.7bn ( £ 1bn at the time ) loan deal to help secure European gas supplies .
This was specifically designed to ensure that the disruptions to supplies that occurred earlier in the year were not repeated .
Mr Putin 's comments have raised concerns that disruptions may happen again .
Russia provides about a quarter of the gas consumed in the EU and 80 % of that is piped through Ukraine .
Unions blame France Telecom 's drive for efficiency French Labour Minister Xavier Darcos is to meet the head of the country 's main telecommunications company to discuss a number of suicides among its staff .
Twenty - three employees of France Telecom have killed themselves since the beginning of 2008 .
Unions blame tough management methods at the multinational , which was privatised in 1998 .
But France Telecom says the rate of suicides is statistically not unusual for a company with a 100,000 workforce .
According to the World Health Organization , France had an annual suicide rate of 26.4 for 100,000 men in 2008 .
The rate for women was 9.2 suicides per 100,000 .
The latest suicide occurred on Friday , when a 32 - year - old woman leapt to her death at a France Telecom office in Paris .
On Wednesday , a 49 - year - old man in Troyes , east of Paris , plunged a knife into his own stomach during a meeting in which he had been told he was being transferred .
He is being treated in hospital .
Counselling Mr Darcos is to meet France Telecom chief executive Didier Lombard early next week , a spokesman for the labour ministry announced on Saturday .
Minister Xavier Darcos is wading into the row over suicides
The unions say a never - ending drive for efficiency is causing emotional havoc in the workforce - especially among older employees recruited when France Telecom was part of the public sector .
Since privatisation in 1998 some 40,000 jobs have gone , and unions say there is pressure on many employees either to leave or to accept new working conditions .
The management of France Telecom denies that there has been a sudden increase in the suicide rate .
It points out that in the year 2000 there were 28 suicides in the company - a figure which it says is statistically not unusual .
France Telecom says most suicides are prompted by personal , not professional , causes .
However , a BBC correspondent in Paris says the firm concedes that the cultural and organisational changes required by the move from French public monopoly to a competitive multinational were bound to cause stress .
After the latest cases it has promised to hire more counselling staff and to suspend internal job transfers pending new talks with the unions .

The Logic of Google Ads
When should you buy ads ?
Let ’s assume your goal is for people to click on the ads and give you money .
( Reasons this may not be true : persuasion , brand - building , budget - maximizing . )
The return from a block of ads is thus revenue - marginal_costs - ad_costs .
Ads are an investment like any other ; you keep buying them until your return on investment ( revenue - marginal_costs / ad_costs ) equals your cost of capital ( usually the interest rate ) .
For simplicity , we ’ll assume your marginal cost is zero .
( My marginal cost is almost always zero , so this does n’t strike me as too unrealistic . )
So how do you estimate revenue ?
You can track how much money people who click on your ad give you , but this has two flaws .
First , customers often give you more money over time .
Maybe they buy level one of your video game when they click on the ad , but then they may buy levels two and three the next day after they beat level one .
The future is always in the future , so revenue - per - user numbers may be too small .
Second , they might have given you money anyway .
Your video game ads probably run on video game review sites , where readers might buy your game just from the review , even if you had n’t bought an ad .
So your revenue numbers may be too big .
But these problems are n’t so serious .
In the first case , the worst that happens is you do n’t buy as many ads as you should .
In the second , you do n’t actually lose money , it ’s just that some extra profit you could have kept has gone into ads .
Let ’s turn to the ad seller .
They probably want to maximize how much they charge per ad impression ( CPM ) .
( Reasons this may not be true : unseemly ads . )
A good way to do this is to hold an auction .
It ’s impractical to have everyone bid live , so Google auctions work like eBay auctions : you enter the maximum you ’re willing to pay and get charged just enough to beat the other bidders .
( One can think of this as a computer - simulated auction where everyone keeps bidding up the price by pennies until they hit the maximum they ’re willing to spend . )
But what are you bidding on ?
Ad sellers want to maximize revenue per impression , but ad buyers want to maximize profit per expense .
In an ideal world , ad sellers auction off impressions ( this is what Google Ad Manager does ) while ad buyers bid per dollar of profit ( entering their cost of capital ) .
Determining how much profit you make from an ad is hard .
Can we just trust you ?
Let ’s say you make $ 2 in profit per 1000 impressions and everyone else makes $ 1 .
Now you can lie and say you make $ 1 in profit and then pay twice as much per profit - dollar .
Now you pay the same amount as before , but you win all the profit - dollar auctions .
Now that ’s not wrong — you ’re clearly making more money than the other bidders , so you should win — but your bid is n’t cost - per - profit anymore , it ’s cost - per - impression .
What if you paid based on revenue ?
Verifying revenue is difficult , but Google could do it if everyone was using Google Checkout .
( If you sent some of your users to a non-Google Checkout system , Google could catch you and fine you . )
Google offers nicer ads to Checkout users , but they still do n’t have much market share , making this system impractical at present .
Some search engines apparently had cost - per-action ( CPA ) auctions , where you paid based on how many people actually bought things .
I have no idea how they made that work , since lying about how many people took an action seems really profitable and easy .
Maybe that ’s why no one does this anymore .
That just leaves cost - per - click ( CPC ) .
Cost - per - click seems ideal , since it ’s verifiable by both the ad seller ( who uses a redirect link to track clicks ) and the ad buyer ( who sees the users show up on their page ) .
It ’s a nice half - way point between buyer and seller .
So the ad seller holds an auction for CPC and multiplies CPC by click - thru - rate ( CTR ) to calculate CPM .
They shows the highest CPM ads , charging each the bidder below them ’s CPC , times their relative CTRs .
( In reality , Google does n’t just use CTR ; they also factor in the relevance of the ad and the quality of the page it goes to . )
And , voila : we ’ve derived the basics of an online ad system .
This works out great for the ad seller — they maximize CPM , just like they wanted — but the ad buyer is still stuck converting their ROI into CPC .
The ad buyer , recall , wants to increase their spending on ads ( now determined to be CPC ) until their return on investment equals their cost of capital .
It seems like this should be pretty easy , and indeed Google does provide tools to calculate ROI , but apparently not to optimize it .
What they do provide is a tool to optimize your cost - per-action .
Does anyone know why this is ?
It seems like an automatic ROI optimizer would lead many people to spend more money on ads .
It ’s hard to believe Google is leaving all that money on the table .
But Google does intelligently optimize the ads themselves .
The variance in click - thru rates between different ads is huge — it ’s not uncommon to see two very similar ads , but one gets ten times as many clicks as the others .
Google lets you put in as many ads as you like and automatically rotates them , showing ads with better CTRs more often .
So far we ’ve just had a single ad seller .
In the real world , lots of people want to sell ads and lots of people want to buy them .
How do you match them up ?
One option is make the buyer choose .
This is how Google Search works :
Google holds an auction for each search query and buyers pick which ones they want to compete in .
Another is to group related websites together and run ads evenly across all of them .
This is how most smaller ad networks work .
And then there ’s AdSense .
AdSense scans a page for relevant keywords , then runs the Google Search ads that won auctions for those keywords .
Google also knows a lot about ad viewers .
By tracking what web pages you visit , they know what topics you ’re interested in .
I ’m apparently interested in Unix , the environment , elections , government , and social science , so Google prefers to show ads on those subjects to me .
But there ’s another way to think about ad matching : as a giant optimization problem .
Which combinations of user , ad placement , and advertisement optimize click - thru rates ( or , ultimately , ROI ) ?
For each of these , there are lots of variables .
For each user , you know their history , geographical location , computer ( browser , operating system , screen size ) , ISP , etc .
For each ad placement , you know time of day , hosting website , page content , etc .
And for each ad , there are numerous possible variations in phrasing and design that can be tested , as mentioned before .
The possible combinations are infinite .
You ca n’t test all of them , so you need to come up with ones that are plausible .
You can look at which combinations worked in the past : has this ad done significantly better in some cities than others , or at some times than others ?
And you can look for patterns across ads : do ads that do well on CNN also do well on MSNBC ?
These hypotheses can then be tested and , if they work , you start running ads more there .
Netflix claims they ’ve made millions from slight improvements in their movie recommendations .
1
When they offered a prize for more , researchers found thousands of tiny patterns and came up with all sorts of innovative algorithms to try to get an edge .
After 32 months , researchers doubled the algorithm ’s effectiveness .
Imagine how much more is at stake for Google .
Last year , they received $ 21 billion in ad revenue , of which 60 % was apparently profit .
Even tiny improvements would be worth the highest salaries — a 0.004 % improvement would make $ 500,000 .
Doubling it would create unspeakable wealth .
Yet Google has no contest for improving ad click - thru rates .
Indeed , press reports suggest they do n’t even have an internal team working on it .
The AdWords user - interface ( recently redesigned from jaw - droppingly wretched to just wretched ) would seem to suggest they do n’t do this kind of optimization at all .
Their blog asks people to optimize things manually .
No doubt there are some things humans ( even ad purchase reps ) can do better than computers , but surely there ’s a lot more they can do together — with humans giving the machine additional hints and hypotheses to test .
But there does n’t seem to be anything like that .
It ’s hard to believe this is true .
It ’s hard to believe this can last .
Google ’s chief economist claims that Google ’s sewn up the ad market by being better than everyone else .
What if you made an ad network that was better than Google ?
Right now Google takes a 20 % cut of every auction price .
What if you were willing to take just 10 % ?
You could give ad sellers a slightly higher CPM — they ’d gladly run your ads when they paid more and Google ’s the rest of the time .
Then you can offer ad buyers a slightly lower CPC .
As long as the money people made was more than the cost of setting things up , they ’d switch .
I ’m actually not sure why this has n’t happened .
Now imagine that you were a genius CS student who could come up with a better ad optimization algorithm .
Your system would have a higher overall CTR , since it presented users with better ads .
This means that , again , you can pay higher CPMs ( since more people click per impression ) .
And you can redirect some of the money you would spend on higher CPMs into lower CPCs , to attract advertisers .
But to develop the algorithms and do the optimization you need the data .
Lots of it — lots of users , lots of advertisers , lots of ad spots .
No startup will ever have that ; it ’s only left to Google ( or whichever giant eventually replaces them ) .
I ’m not normally one to be too concerned about improving Google ’s bottom line ( they seem to be doing alright ) , but as an ad buyer I ’m frustrated I have to do this work myself .
I ’d rather solve the problem for everyone .
And if Google wants to pay me for that , I certainly would n’t mind .

Force India boss Vijay Mallya says his team has exceeded its own expectations this season , and is now aiming to be solidly in the midfield next year .
The Silverstone - based squad had not scored any points before this year , but a strong second half of the season has seen Force India emerge as a contender for points and even for podium finishes in some races .
Mallya says Force India can be very proud of its achievements this year , and is optimistic his team can keep its momentum going and be closer to the front in 2010 .
" At the start of the year , we wanted points but I also wanted to show a genuine improvement in every area of the company , " said Mallya .
" We have learned from the mistakes of last season and have really tightened up processes , procedures and working practices , which has ultimately helped us to score points and be proud of our achievements .
" I would say this year has even exceeded our expectations as we have secured a podium , pole and fastest lap .
We can be really proud of this .
" All the same we have had opportunities we have n't been able to make the most of , for example Interlagos , Suzuka and Monza .
This slightly mutes the satisfaction , but it does give a lot of cause for optimism - if we can get into a similar position next year and follow through all the chances we could be solid midfield in both championships . "
Mallya is also hopeful his team will have a strong final race of the season in Abu Dhabi this weekend , where he is aiming to make up for the disappointment of the Brazilian Grand Prix , where he reckons Adrian Sutil could have finished on the podium .
" Brazil was a missed opportunity to score points .
Adrian was in a prime position to get some decent points , perhaps even a podium , but it was not to be , " Mallya added .
" But the Abu Dhabi aero configuration is roughly similar to Brazil and Valencia , and even though we can't expect rain , we can expect a reasonable level of performance in qualifying that should put us in a good position for the race .
" We could technically move up a position in the championship as we 're just 13 points behind Renault , but it will be tough so we need to consolidate what we have already .
" Toro Rosso have been looking very strong in recent races so it 's a matter of personal pride to keep them behind .
Ninth place in the championship is one position higher than last year and we need that improvement to validate all the progress we 've made this year . "
The ex-wife of " balloon dad " Richard Heene breaks her silence in an exclusive first interview on Nancy Grace
HLN Monday 8 pm ET
Washington ( CNN ) --
The wife of a Colorado father at the center of the " balloon boy " saga told authorities that the giant helium balloon was specifically created for a hoax to draw media attention , according to court documents released Friday .
Mayumi Heene told Larimer County investigators that she and her husband , Richard Heene , knew that their 6 - year - old son , Falcon , was hiding at their Fort Collins home the entire time , even as police and military scrambled to search for the boy , according to the documents .
The admission by Mayumi Heene was made October 17 , just two days after the balloon was released , according to the documents .
The Heenes initially told authorities that they believed their child had flown away on the balloon , and when the balloon landed without him , they expressed concern that he may have fallen out of the device .
The couple hatched the plan about two weeks before the incident and " instructed their three children to lie to authorities as well as the media regarding this hoax , " according to the documents .
Their motive ?
To " make the Heene family more marketable for future media interests . "
Calls to David Lane , Richard Heene 's attorney , and Lee Christian , Mayumi Heene 's attorney , were not immediately returned Friday .
Richard and Mayumi Heene are each facing a number of local charges , including conspiracy , contributing to the delinquency of a minor and attempting to influence a public servant , Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said Sunday .
Lane has said that the sheriff was overreaching and that the family deserve the presumption of innocence .
The Federal Aviation Administration is also investigating the incident .
Richard and Mayumi Heene met in a Hollywood acting school and pursued fame for their family in the world of reality TV , Alderden has said .
The Heenes have appeared on the ABC program " Wife Swap . " Richard
Heene also chases storms , brings his family along and takes videos .
TLC , which produces the show " Jon & Kate Plus 8 , " said the Heenes had " approached us months ago " about a possible show , " and we passed . "
Al cierre del tercer trimestre de 2009 , las ganancias del Banco Nacional de México ( Banamex ) , aumentaron 115.8 % respecto al mismo periodo del año anterior .
De acuerdo con el estado de resultados del segundo grupo financiero más importante del país medido por sus activos , la utilidad neta respecto a julio - septiembre del año pasado , pasó de 2,367 millones de pesos a 5,108 millones de pesos .
Respecto al Grupo Financiero Banamex las ganancias aumentaron 101.8 % al pasar de 3,123 millones de pesos a 6,301 millones .
Estos resultados derivan de una importante disminución de sus reservas crediticias y una mayor caída en sus gastos por intereses , lo que dio como resultado mayores ingresos .
Al respecto , el director general del banco , Enrique Zorrilla Fullaondo , dijo que estos resultados reflejan el dinamismo en los distintos segmentos , como lo son el empresarial , especialmente en el circuito de la pequeña y mediana empresa , y vivienda .
En este sentido , el saldo de la cartera de crédito vigente a actividad empresarial o comercial respecto a septiembre del año previo creció 31.5 % al pasar de 103,140 millones de pesos a 135,644 millones .
Mientras que la cartera de crédito vigente a la vivienda sumó a septiembre de este año 37,052 millones de pesos , lo que implicó un incremento de 27.4 % respecto a los 29,073 millones de pesos del mismo periodo de 2008 .
Publicidad
En tanto que , la cartera de crédito vigente al consumo registró una caída de 12.7 % al pasar de 99,050 millones de pesos a 86,436 millones .
No obstante , " se sigue privilegiando la fortaleza del banco y no con el objeto de vernos fuertes , sino con el objeto de cara a nuestros clientes , transitar por esta crisis " , manifestó Zorrilla Fullaondo .
Además , destacó , el banco sigue con los programas de reestructuración de tarjetas de crédito , en donde se siguen colocación de nuevos plásticos aunque actualmente " es más una cuestión de demanda y ahí hay lecciones aprendidas importantes " .
Así que , " los números van en línea con lo que queremos , una cercanía muy clara con nuestra clientela y un dinamismos " , subrayó .
De enero a septiembre de este año , las estimaciones preventivas para riesgos crediticios sumaron 3,032 millones de pesos , lo que significó una disminución de 58.9 % , respecto a los 7,375 millones de pesos reportados en el mismo periodo de 2008 .
En el mismo lapso de comparación , los gastos por intereses - que es lo que se paga por captar - se redujeron 33.5 % al pasar de 9,601 millones de pesos a 6,384 millones de pesos .
Esta disminución , mayor a la de 9.0 % observada en los ingresos por intereses - que es lo que se cobra por prestar - al ascender a 19,745 millones de pesos , permitió que el margen financiero reportara un crecimiento de 10.4 % con 13,361 millones de pesos .
De ahí que los ingresos totales de la operación registraron un incremento de 35.3 % al pasar de 10,698 millones de pesos a 14 , 479 millones de pesos .
Los ingresos por comisiones y tarifas cobradas se ubicaron en 4,087 millones de pesos , lo que implicó una disminución de 6.8 % si se compara con los 4,386 millones de pesos de julio - septiembre del año pasado .

This year ,
The Gap specifically mentions Christmas in its ads :
Yet that 's still not good enough for the American Family Association , an organization that will boycott any outfit that they find to be either too pro-gay or too " anti-Christmas . "
This year , these rabid social conservatives have built their entire " war on Xmas " campaign around the false idea that Gap is n't showing enough respect to tinsel - trimmed trees :
AFA is calling for a limited two - month boycott of Gap , Old Navy and Banana Republic , the three stores owned by San Francisco - based Gap Inc. , over the company ’s censorship of the word " Christmas . "
The boycott is part of our ongoing campaign to encourage businesses , communities and individuals to put Christ back in Christmas .
The boycott runs from November 1 through Christmas Day .
Boycott Gap , Old Navy and Banana Republic this Christmas [ AFA ]
It 's ridiculous , no matter what .
But as you can tell from the above TV spot , it 's also an outright lie !
Christmas gets a specific shout out !
What , because it has to share space with other celebrations that Gap 's customer base may honor with dollar$ , does that offend the AFA ?
The mistletoe - laden myopia is simply unreal !
Ugh , it 's making us more nauseous than year - old eggnog .
So go to our friend Joe .
My .
God if you care to learn more about the AFA 's childish endeavor : AFA Expands " Christmas " Hit List [ J.M.G ]
Your thoughts
Adding the Gap to their boycott on the occasion of this advertisement proves ( yet again ) the AFA 's bigotry .
The only reason to boycott a company that explicitly mentions Christmas in its holiday advertising for being " anti-Christmas " is because the ad also references Hanukkah and Kwanzaa .
As if we needed any more evidence to prove that the christianist religious right does n't believe in religious freedom ( or only wants it to apply to them ) .

What they want is for Gap to not mention those other holidays as well .
The others are not real .
And that " Holiday Cheer " at the end is icing on the cake for these people .
They really are a freak show , which is why their list gets so much attention .

The Gap equated Christmas with " whatever you Wannukah " .

" Equated , " TK ?
After listing holidays , and specifically mentioning Christmas , they supported doing " whatever you wannukah . "
Since when are we against that ?

The US House of Representatives condemned Tuesday the UN Goldstone report as unfairly accusing Israel of committing war crimes in its 22 - day war against Palestinian militants in Gaza .
By a margin of 344- 36 , lawmakers approved a non-binding resolution that calls the report “ irredeemably biased and unworthy of further consideration or legitimacy . ”
The symbolic measure also urges President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton “ to strongly and unequivocally oppose ” any discussion of the report or action on its findings in any international setting .

The Obama administration has already condemned the report , which was expected to go to the UN General Assembly on Wednesday , as unhelpful to its efforts to revive stalled Middle East peace talks .
“ I think the UN report is unbalanced , and unfair , and inaccurate , ” said Democratic House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer .
“ It ’s unfortunate that the United Nations deals with Israel , in my opinion , in a totally biased and unbalanced way .
And it is the only country in the world , Israel , that has a special focus by the United Nations , ” he added .
“ I have been to Gaza and I have read in its entirety the Goldstone report and I will tell you he says many things , that though unpleasant , are true , and must not be obstructed , ” countered Democratic Representative Brian Baird .
Baird bolstered his speech against the resolution with photographs of dead Palestinian children and Israeli children seeking shelter during a suspected Palestinian rocket attack .
ADVERTISEMENT
The resolution , crafted by Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , expressed support for the Obama administration ’s condemnation of the report and urges opposition to its findings in any international forum .
“ The Goldstone Report illustrates the anti-freedom , anti-Israel bias which deeply pervades the UN system , and it does not deserve consideration or legitimacy from responsible nations , ” she said after the vote .
“ Even in the fog of war , it is clear that Israel took every reasonable measure to minimize the risk of civilian casualties .
It is clear that Israel had every right and duty to defend its citizens from the onslaught of rocket and mortar attacks from Hamas and other militants in Gaza , ” she said .

Named after former South African judge Richard Goldstone , who headed the inquiry committee , the UN report accuses Israel and Hamas militants of war crimes during the 22 - day conflict that flared up in late December 2008 and ended in January , leaving some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead .
Goldstone recommended that Israel and the Islamist movement Hamas — which rules the tiny Palestinian coastal enclave — face possible prosecution in The Hague if they fail to conduct credible investigations within six months .
ADVERTISEMENT
Hoyer said rocket fire from Palestinian fighters in Gaza had placed Israel in “ an unfortunate position ” and stressed that Israel “ is as careful a government as there is in terms of prosecuting its own defense ” officials .
On Monday , Human Rights
Watch urged lawmakers not to back the resolution , said the Goldstone report “ presents an opportunity to pursue justice for the victims in Gaza and Israel . ”
“ Instead of denouncing the report , the US Congress should urge Israel and Hamas to break the cycle of abuse and impunity , which for too long has fueled hatred and hindered efforts at peace , ” said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch .
The right ’s embrace of Hoffman is a double - barreled suicide for the G.O.P .
On Saturday , the battered Scozzafava suspended her campaign , further scrambling the race .
It ’s still conceivable that the Democratic candidate could capture a seat the Republicans should own .
But it ’s even better for Democrats if Hoffman wins .
Punch - drunk with this triumph , the right will redouble its support of primary challengers to 2010 G.O.P. candidates they regard as impure .
That ’s bad news for even a Republican as conservative as Kay Bailey Hutchison , whose primary opponent in the Texas governor ’s race , the incumbent Rick Perry , floated the possibility of secession at a teabagger rally in April and hastily endorsed Hoffman on Thursday .
The more rightists who win G.O.P. primaries , the greater the Democrats ’ prospects next year .
But the electoral math is less interesting than the pathology of this movement .
Its antecedent can be found in the early 1960s , when radical - right hysteria carried some of the same traits we ’re seeing now : seething rage , fear of minorities , maniacal contempt for government , and a Freudian tendency to mimic the excesses of political foes .

Let ’s say it again — Rich was faking his basic facts in this damaging column ( published on December 16 , 1997 ) .
Two days earlier , his own New York Times had reported an interview with Love Story author Erich Segal — the only interview Segal gave on this fatuous topic .
In this interview , Segal said that Gore had been one of the models for his book ’s main character .
( Segal knew Gore when Gore was in college . )
In fact , in the interview ( reported by Melinda Henneberger ) , Segal agreed with every word Gore said on the meaningless topic .
But so what ?
Rich just knew what Gore had been doing in his fleeting remarks on this topic — remarks Gore had made to a pair of reporters .
Mind - reading brilliantly , Rich clued us in .
Gore had been “ bragging ” and “ boasting , ” Rich said .
Gore had “ inflated his past ” in his comments ; and Gore had done this in an “ effort to overcompensate for his public stiffness by casting himself as the role model . ”
Uh-oh !
As noted , Segal had already told the Times that Gore had been one of two role models .
But Frankly , Rich had a better story , a story the brilliant pundit loved — and so he went ahead and told it .

" The GOP leadership 's backing of Ms. Scozzafava was a slap in the face to Tea Party activists , town hall protesters , and conservatives across the country .
The Washington GOP establishment 's abandonment of fiscal responsibility led directly to the election of Barack Obama as President and Nancy Pelosi as Speaker .
The American people see the GOP leadership and establishment every bit as much a part of the problem as the Democrats .
" Doug Hoffman and NY - 23 is an earthquake in American politics , and is the first of many challenges to establishment Republicans that we will see for the 2010 elections and beyond .
The stupid decision by Republican leaders to pour $ 900,000 into the NY - 23rd race against a conservative has unleashed a fury that will lead to new GOP leadership .
" Conservatives anger at Washington - establishment Republicans will cost the national committees tens of millions of dollars as conservative money will start flowing directly to the Tea Parties and their candidates .
his
Hell
true
talk - like - JFK - but - act - like -W
yes !
The bizarre race in New York 's 23rd congressional district has engendered some equally bizarre commentary .
In case you missed the news , here is a brief recap : The 23rd district is rural , near the Canadian border , and has been safely Republican for ages .
Needing a candidate to fill the vacant seat , a local Republican committee picked one Dede Scozzafava , a state assemblywoman with a conservative voting record .
But it was not conservative enough on below - the - waist issues to please the tea - baggers , who decided to make a national example of Dede .
After a wrenching intra-party fight , they " putsched " Scozzafava out , replacing her with one Doug Hoffman .
He 's a know - nothing carpetbagger , but he does n't like gay marriage -- and that stance suffices to fetch him the Michele Bachmann / Glen Beck / Michelle Malkin stamp of approval .
To columnist Frank Rich of the NYT , this battle came as wonderful news .
In a surreal column , Rich wrote : Rich writes as though that outbreak of pathology led to the Republican party 's destruction .
In fact , " fear of minorities " -- along with plenty of anti-government rhetoric , paranoia and inchoate rage -- pushed the south into the Republican camp , resulting in the Nixon presidency , the Reagan revolution , and the decades - long dominance of libertarian economics .
Rage , unreason and appeals to race are strategies that , at least on the right .
( 2008 proved that such tactics also skew left . )
The truly annoying aspect of this column is the fact that Rich himself , an alleged Democrat , is an old hand at intra-party bitch - fighting .
BDBlue at Corrente links to this Bob Somerby column from 2006 , which in turn provides links to many previous Daily Howler posts about Rich , who was one of the main mainstream trashers of Al Gore .
Somerby reminds us that it was Rich who invented the " Love Story " canard , which helped to create the utterly unfair media perception of Gore as a serial yarn - spinner .
As you may recall , Gore was accused of lying when he said that he was the model for the protagonist of that book and film .
Rich calls Beck and Bachmann " Stalinists " for trashing the GOP nominee in a hitherto obscure sector of upstate New York .
Yet in the late 1990s , Rich himself tried to do unto Gore as Stalin did unto Trotsky :
Theof the ice pick , the sickeningas it sinks into the back of the head .
Love means never having to say you 're a bourgeois deviationist .
Let 's return to the basic point of Rich 's column .
Have suicidal crazies overtaken the Republican Party ?
And if so , is that athing from the standpoint of Democrats ?
Taking an anti-Obama stance in 2008 placed me on some strange mailing lists .
A couple of days ago , I received a mass emailing from Richard Viguerie , theof the tea bagger movement :
What mainstream pundits fail to realize is that the two - party system has , in essence , digitized American politics .
Everything comes down to ones and zeroes , on or off , Republican or Democrat .
If Obama and Pelosi fail -- which they probably will -- Americans will turn again to the Republicans , because there 's no place else to go .
Viguerie is making sure that when the conservative re-ascent occurs , conservatives will be the ones ascending .
He is branding teabag pols as rebels -- a good strategy , since many Americans are feeling mighty rebellious .
He is also re-branding the Dubya crowd as liberals - in - disguise , which is both awful history and great marketing .
Is Viguerie crazy ?
Like the proverbial fox .
Is he suicidal ?
No .
Is his movement helpful to Dems , as Rich claims ?
no .
Should liberals -- liberals -- mimic his tactics ?
Should we have an intra-party insurgency staged by Democrats who despise Obama 'sshtick ?
HellIf Rich can maintain his mainstream cred after taking a rhetorical ice pick to Al Gore , then I have every right to use similar weaponry on Obama and the Obots .
Patrick Andrade for The New York Times
Representative Anthony D. Weiner , Democrat of New York , a fierce champion in Congress of a single - payer health system that would be fully run by the government , said Friday that he had agreed not to insist on a vote on that issue , in an effort to help Democratic leaders pass their plan .
Previously , Mr. Weiner had obtained a commitment from Speaker Nancy Pelosi to allow a vote on a proposal to create a single - payer system like the one used by Canada and many countries in Europe , including England , France and Spain .
Single - payer supporters form a large bloc among liberal Democrats , although there has not been enough broader backing to make the idea politically viable .
So Mr. Weiner ’s proposal would almost certainly have been defeated , although it would have enabled those liberal Democrats to demonstrate their continuing support for a single - payer system .
But as House Democratic leaders struggle to round up the votes they need to pass their health care legislation , Mr. Weiner said in an interview that it was clear that forcing a vote on the single - payer issue would be counterproductive and could endanger support for the bill at a critical juncture .
Mr. Weiner ’s decision to sacrifice the measure also signaled that Democratic leaders may be struggling even harder behind the scenes than they have acknowledged to win votes for the health care legislation .
Another sign was a decision to postpone a visit by President Obama to Capitol Hill until Saturday , allowing his personal appeal to have maximum impact on lawmakers as close to the actual vote as possible .
The Democrats ’ legislation , which is supported by Mr. Obama , relies on continuing the existing system of mostly employer - sponsored health benefits .
The bill seeks to cover 36 million uninsured Americans by expanding Medicaid , the state - federal insurance program for the poor , and by providing government subsidies to moderate - income Americans to help them buy insurance .
The subsidies could be used for government - approved private health plans or for a new government - run insurance plan — the so - called public option — that would complete with private insurers .
“ I feel very strongly that the employer - based model is not the way to go and single - payer is the better way , ” Mr. Weiner said in an interview .
“ But I never wanted it to be the situation where we literally let the perfect be the enemy of the good . ”
He added , “ As disappointed as I am , the higher imperative , I think , is making sure that the big bill got passed . ”
While Mr. Weiner said he recognized that his decision would disappoint legions of single - payer advocates , he said the danger to the larger bill was too great .
Forcing a vote on single - payer could be particularly problematic for lawmakers who represent districts that split heavily between liberal and more moderate or conservative voters .
A vote against the single - payer issue would anger constituents on the left , while emboldening opponents on the right , making it more difficult to support the larger bill .
Avoiding a vote on the issue , in turn , could allow centrist Democrats to take a tough vote in favor of the larger bill .
Mr. Weiner said that the debate around the public option had helped the cause of single - payer supporters .
“ There ’s an old saying in the single - payer movement , God supports the single payer , just not now , ” he said .
“ I think that the public option debate has to some degree advanced the cause of single payer because , in fact , both the proponents and opponents of the public option are in a way stipulating to the point that government - run health care would be more efficient and would be chosen by citizens if it were offered . ”
Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders had long ago taken the single - payer issue off the table , saying that it would be too destabilizing to completely change the nation ’s health care system .
Adopting a single - payer program would require a sweeping overhaul of the tax code , as well as of the compensation and benefits packages of virtually every employer in the United States .
“ There is some disappointment , ” Mr. Weiner said .
“ And I would be lying to you if I said I was n’t disappointed . ”
Mark Webber has a precious opportunity to convert his first pole position into his first win – thanks in part to Sebastian Vettel failing to complete an extra lap in qualifying .
With four KERS cars in the top nine positions and rain threatening , we could be in for an exciting race tomorrow .
Let ’s take a look at how it may pan out .
The start
Brawn and Red Bull have locked out the top four places on the grid .
But it ’s the two drivers who are trailing their team mates on the front row – Mark Webber and Rubens Barrichello .
Barrichello has made two particularly poor starts this year – at Melbourne and Istanbul – and will need to get off the line smartly to be sure of beating his team mate into turn one .
Starting from row two , Jenson Button and Sebastian Vettel could find themselves falling prey to either of the McLarens on row three , both of which have KERS .
Lewis Hamilton made a particularly good start here two years ago – before he was hit by one of the BMWs – can he repeat that this year ad make a nuisance of himself for the championship leaders ?
With the similarly KERS - powered Ferraris eighth and ninth , the run into the tight first corner ( complete with a devilish new bump thanks to a tunnel built under the track ) could be quite spectacular .
Although the Nurburgring does n’t suffer from the clean / dirty side of the grid phenomenon as much as less - used tracks to , it can still make a difference .
In this afternoon ’s GP2 race Lucas di Grassi , who started third on the grid , was able to overtake second - placed Roldan Rodriguez at the start .
That ’s potentially good news for the likes of Button ( third ) and Hamilton ( fifth ) .
Of course all this presumes a dry start to the race – if the expected rain comes we could see a much more unpredictable start .
Rain is expected to reach the circuit around lunch time tomorrow , but rather than the deluge of 2007 it is expected to be more like the occasional showers we saw today .
The KERS cars will have less of an advantage on a slippery track .
The strategy
The fuel weights published after qualifying revealed both Red Bull drivers are on the same fuel load .
But this seems not to have been intentional – Vettel has claimed he intended to do one more lap in qualifying – reducing his fuel load further and potentially moving him up the grid – but ran out of time .
That may have cost him dear .
Lewis Hamilton ’s light fuel load increases the chance of him making some trouble for Sebastian Vettel at the start .
And the Ferrari duo will be especially keen to clear Adrian Sutil ’s heavily - fuelled Force India .
The German driver successfully out - qualified the two F60s despite having a heavier fuel load , thanks in part to Ferrari running out of fresh super - soft tyres in the final part of qualifying .
Whatever strategies the teams may have in mind are likely to go out the window if we get the kind of mixed weather conditions we saw in the middle part of qualifying .
One crucial thing we cannot tell is which drivers have gone for a compromise set - up on their cars which might help them in wet weather .
But however the weather pans out we look likely to have a more entertaining race tomorrow than last time out .
Who do you think will win ?

The U.S. military is strongly considering a near - total ban on Twitter , Facebook , and all other social networking sites throughout the Department of Defense , multiple sources within the armed forces tell Danger Room .
It 's the latest twist in the Defense Department 's tangled relationship with so - called " Web 2.0 " sites .
But while earlier social media blockades have been thrown up over bandwidth and secrecy concerns , this fresh ban stems from fears that Facebook and the like make it far too easy for hackers and cybercrooks to gain access to the military 's networks .
Last week , U.S. Strategic Command issued a " warning order " to the rest of the military , asking for feedback on a social media ban on the NIPRNet , the Defense 's Department 's unclassified network .
( Naturally , access is already denied on the secret and top secret nets . )
" The mechanisms for social networking were never designed for security and filtering .
They make it way too easy for people with bad intentions to push malicious code to unsuspecting users .
It 's just a fact of life , " says a source at Stratcom , which is responsible for securing the military 's " global information grid . "
Last month , for instance , well - known venture capitalist Guy Kawasaki's Twitter account was hijacked , and used to spread a sex video come - on to his 139,000 followers .
Those following the link were asked to install a software update .
The application was , in fact , a Trojan , which allowed hackers to take over a user 's machine .
Similarly , one variant of the nasty Koobface worm searches a PC to find a Facebook cookie .
Then the malware program uses that information to gain access to the user 's Facebook account .
Once it 's in , Koobface spreads messages to online friends , enticing them to download viruses and Trojans .
" People are much more trusting of a message from a friend or colleague on a social network than they are of an e-mail , because they 're used to e-mails being forged , " says Graham Cluley , a senior consultant with the network security firm Sophos .
That 's ironic , he adds , because " social networks are n't really doing enough to stop these things .
With GMail or Hotmail or a military e-mail account , messages are scanned for spam and viruses .
Social networks are n't doing that scanning .
They are n't checking if a link posted to a wall is malicious or spammy .
They 're just letting it through . "
Officially , " the concept of allowing access to social networking sites ( SNS ) on the Department of Defense .mil networks is currently under review at this time , " a Stratcom spokesperson e-mails Danger Room .
" It would be premature to comment on the outcome of the review . "
But unofficially , the ban is all - but - certain , military officers and civilian employees say .
Many are upset , because after years keeping the social networks at arms ' length , the armed services appeared to be finally embracing the Web 2.0 sites .
The Army recently ordered all U.S. bases to provide access to Facebook .
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has 4,000 followers on Twitter .
The Department of Defense is getting ready to unveil a new home page , packed with social media tools .
" We fought so hard for this , " says one Army source .
" This is a huge step backwards . "
Under Stratcom 's plan , units that have to regularly communicate with the civilian world , like media relations and recruiting , may be given " dirty computers " – machines that are connecting only to the public internet , and not to the military 's private networks .
The rest of the Defense Department would be cut off from the social media sites , despite protests from inside the Pentagon .
People started working with these social networks " before we got a handle on how to use them in the context of the Department of Defense , " a Stratcom source says .
" Now , they 're just too big of a headache . "

FORT HOOD , Texas  Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan , the Army psychiatrist who allegedly went on a murderous shooting spree here Thursday , confessed to his local mosque elder months ago that he was conflicted between his devotion to Islam and his allegiance to the U.S. military .
" If soldiers come to me and have problems fighting other Muslims , what do I tell them ? "
Osman Danquah , co-founder of the Islamic Community of Greater Killeen , said Hasan asked him in August .
' FRESH START ': Suspect had trouble elsewhere POST TRAGEDY : FBI will re-enact massacre VICTIMS : Families say soldiers heard yelling , then gunfire Hasan also asked about soldiers changing their minds after joining the military and inquired about other members of the congregation , Danquah said .
His line of questioning sounded so disjointed , however , that Danquah said Saturday he suspected Hasan might be a federal agent trying to infiltrate the mosque .
" I told him , ' There 's something wrong with you , and if you 're here to gather information , we 're not here to do anything against the government .
We 're here to worship , ' " Danquah said .
In his radio address Saturday President Obama asked for patience while officials piece together what happened .
" We can not fully know what leads a man to do such a thing , " Obama said .
" But what we do know is that our thoughts are with every one of the men and women who were injured at Fort Hood .
Our thoughts are with all the families who 've lost a loved one in this national tragedy . "
On Tuesday , the president and first lady will travel to Fort Hood for a memorial service .
On Thursday , Hasan jumped on a desk and hollered " Allahu Akbar ! " —
God is great ! — inside Fort Hood 's Soldier Readiness
Center before firing at soldiers and civilians gathered there , military and hospital officials said .
Twelve soldiers and one civilian were killed and 30 others were wounded , some seriously , Fort Hood spokesman Col .
John Rossi said .
Authorities are calling it the deadliest shooting spree ever inside an American military installation .
Hasan used a pair of non-military - issued handguns purchased locally to fire more than 100 rounds inside the center before being shot and subdued by two Fort Hood Police officers , Rossi said .
Hasan was transferred Friday to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio , about 150 miles southwest of Fort Hood .
He was alive but unable to speak , he said .
" It 's a kick in the gut , no doubt , " Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Casey told reporters after arriving Friday at Fort Hood .
Doctors on Saturday detailed how soldiers wounded in the rampage continued to mend .
Of the 10 brought to Scott and White Memorial Hospital , four have been released and one may go home Saturday , said Roy Smythe , head of surgery at the hospital .
Four of the six victims in intensive care have been moved out of that unit and into regular patient rooms , he said .
Rehabilitation to repair the limbs and torsos torn by bullets may be a long road , Smythe said at at a press conference Saturday that included Texas Gov. Rick Perry and other state officials .
" There 's a possibility that some of these patients will be affected physically the rest of their lives and there 's a good chance that they 'll have psychological damage the rest of their lives , " Smythe said .
Perry said he visited the wounded patients and their families , telling them that he and people across the state are wishing them a speedy recovery .
Perry earlier also visited with Fort Hood Police Sgt. Kimberly Munley , who is credited with shooting Hasan and ending his massacre .
Munley is recovering at another hospital from gunshot wounds received in the exchange with Hasan .
" I told them there are 24 million Texans praying for them and wishing them well , " Perry said and praised Munley as a " classic public servant . "
Perry said Thursday 's incident still cast a pall over the community .
" It 's been almost two days now since this tragic event and I do n't think anything 's happened to dull our feelings about this incident , " he said .
State Rep. Sid Miller added : " Last Thursday was one of the darkest hours and darkest days I 've seen here at Fort Hood .
We will study it and make sure something like this never happens again . "
On Friday , soldiers and their families gathered in prayer vigils and counseling sessions , grappling with how one of their own could create such a calamity .
Hundreds of soldiers and their families gathered Friday night at a football field on Fort Hood to light candles , sing hymns and say prayers for the victims of the attack .
Staff Sgt. Eric Mullins , 25 , of the 1st Calvary , said he had been in the readiness center where the attack occurred just last week .
" Feels like it 's not real yet , " said Mullins , who attended the vigil with his wife , Trisha , and 2 - year - old daughter , Lily .
" It 's crazy for soldiers to do this to other soldiers . "
Earlier that day , in another corner of the Army post , 13 flag - draped coffins containing the slain victims were rolled , one by one , into the belly of a C - 17 plane in a solemn tradition known as a " ramp ceremony , " said Rossi , the Fort Hood spokesman .
About 300 soldiers in dress uniforms gathered to see them off , including one of the wounded soldiers who had been shot in the leg , he said .
" It 's important to observe this tradition , " Rossi said .
This is a town that 's used to sudden death :
More than 500 servicemen and women based at Fort Hood , a sprawling 340 - square - mile installation , have died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But having soldiers die at home from repeated gunshots from another soldier is numbing , said Dena McClain , a Fort Hood resident whose husband , Richard , is currently in Iraq with the Army 's 1st Calvary Division .
" If you 're at home , you want to feel safe , " McClain said .
" And now , suddenly , you 're not . "
Doctors and surgeons at Metroplex Adventist Hospital in Killeen , where Fort Hood is located , treated seven of the shooting victims , including one who was pronounced dead on arrival .
Doctors scrambled to mend legs , arms , chests and heads shredded by gunshot wounds .
One soldier , hit by several gunshots , kept yelling , " Call my wife ! "
One woman was brought in , untouched by gunshots , but pale as a bed sheet and unable to stop shaking , hospital officials said .
Over and over , she asked : " Why ? " Kelly Matlock , an anesthesiologist , treated four of the patients , all of them soldiers .
" It was like someone shot someone in your family , " she said .
" It was very personal . "

Baking cookies in your oven is fine and all , but if you want to turn out some tasty cookies in a very short time , consider turning to your trusty waffle iron .
Turns out you 're only 90 seconds away from crispy , chewy , cookie - goodness .
Photo by Fine Living & Martha Stewart
Although your oven will still have its place for making large batches of cookies , using your waffle iron can bake up a cookie in just 90 seconds .
It 's the perfect solution for previously prepared dough when you just need a quick sugar fix instead of an entire pan hanging around the house to tempt you .

It 's a simple process of heating your waffle iron ( no matter what shape or size it might be ) on high and coating it with a non -stick spray .
Using a small cookie scoop or tablespoon , spoon batter into each section of your waffle iron .
This will ensure even baking and that all your cookies will finish at the same time .
All that 's left is to remove them from the heat and chow down !
We ran across the idea on food weblog The Kitchn , and after a little more searching found two tested and approved recipes to try your hand at — one from Martha Stewart and the other from recipe weblog Fine Cooking .
If you 'd like to see the process in action , you can head over to Martha Stewart for a short video ( with a slow load time ) to see them made before you go all MacGyver meets Cookie Monster on your own .
If you 've tried this method before , let 's hear how it worked out for you in the comments .

Perhaps these are transporters that deliver the souls of those who do n’t make it to their great reward .

This past weekend the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops instructed pastors at parishes across the country to distribute material urging Catholics to oppose the health reform bills making their way through Congress for allowing public funding of abortions .
Priests were to insert the Bishops Conference pdf leaflets and letters into parish news bulletins , distribute them at church doors or place them in pews .
They were also directed to read a statement at mass to reinforce the message .
The Conference of bishops reportedly sent the orders out last Thursday , the same day Speaker Nancy Pelosi presented the mammoth 2,000 - page House reform bill to lawmakers and the public .
The material explains that the Catholic Church supports reform that will “ protect the life and dignity of all people from the moment of conception until natural death . ”

CNSNews reports that the Catholic Church has a “ major stake ” in the legislation :
A little over 100 million Americans are treated through Catholic hospitals and health centers .
There are 624 Catholic hospitals in America .
Also , 11 of the nation ’s 40 largest health care systems are Catholic , such as Ascension Health , Catholic Health Initatives and Trinity Health .
As observers have pointed out , however , the bishops ’ position seems to be oddly anti-government .
The Church has never opposed any private health insurance policies that provide abortion benefits .
It has never urged a boycott of particular insurance companies for offering abortion benefits .
Aetna , Blue Cross , Cigna , United Healthcare– all the major private insurers provide for abortion services in their policies .
All policy holders are paying into the provider network and subsidizing all its services .
The strong stance by the Bishops led one CNSNews commenter to ask why priests are being directed to mouth Republican Party talking points .
Republican politics comes to the pulpit of The Mass .
How sweet .
The Mass becomes politicized .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Consumers spent significantly less at the start of the holiday season this weekend , dimming hopes for a retail comeback that would help propel the economy early in 2010 .
While shoppers turned out in force as early as Thanksgiving Day on Thursday , many said they had zeroed in on highly discounted items , would buy only what they needed and would walk out of a store if they did not find a good deal .
“ Shoppers proved this weekend that they were willing to open their wallets for a bargain , ” said National Retail Federation Chief Executive Tracy Mullin in a statement on Sunday .
Retail chains “ know they have their work cut out for them to keep people coming back through Christmas . ”
Consumers said they will have spent nearly 8 percent less on average , or about $ 343 per person , over the weekend that includes Thanksgiving , Black Friday and runs through Sunday , according to the NRF .
Traffic to stores and websites rose to 195 million people from 172 million in 2008 , but shoppers were focused on buying low - priced items , like $ 10 toys and $ 9 books , the NRF said .
The NRF has forecast a 1 percent decline in holiday sales this year , which would mark an unprecedented drop for two straight years after a global financial crisis erupted in 2008 .
Total retail sales edged up just 0.5 percent to $ 10.66 billion on Black Friday , which is often the single - busiest day of the holiday shopping season , ShopperTrak said on Saturday .
Online retailers , however , enjoyed an 11 percent jump in Black Friday spending to $ 595 million , with Amazon.com and Wal - Mart Stores Inc ’s Walmart.com enjoying the biggest surges in traffic , according to comScore .
Retailers had warned investors they would take a conservative view of holiday sales and have cut inventory and reduced expenses to compensate .
" You 're clearly down on a two - year run rate , " said Bill Taubman of mall operator Taubman Centers Inc .
But he added , " margins are going to be extremely good because ( retailers ) have been careful about what they bought . "

DEPARTMENT STORES ATTRACT
Shoppers interviewed across the country by Reuters over the weekend said they were lured by bargains , but would stick to pared - down budgets .
“ If they do n’t have rebates and sales before Christmas , I do n’t think people are going to go back shopping after Black Friday , ” said Joel Wincowski , a higher education consultant shopping at a Best Buy store in Plattsburgh , New York .
He bought an Xbox 360 game console for $ 299 .

“ We ’re going to cut back on everybody , even the kids . ”
Discount chains like Walmart , department stores and higher - end chains like Saks Inc seemed to have lured more spending and avoided steep discounts , retail consultants and executives said on Sunday .
“ The market has had a negative bias toward the state of consumer spending , ” said Bill Dreher , senior analyst at Deutsche Bank .
“ We continue to believe that there are pockets of strength with discount retailing doing very well , with select luxury retailers doing very well , like Nordstrom and Saks , which have brought down their price points . ”

Specialty apparel chains , however , may face another tough year as they relied on heavy promotions to draw shoppers .
“ Going through the mall on Friday , the stores that had not been doing as well -- AnnTaylor , Limited , Gap -- were very aggressively promoting , ” said Jeff Edelman , director of retail and consumer advisory services at RSM McGladrey .
Edelman expects holiday sales to be flat this year , but he said he expected profits for most retailers to be higher .
The NRF said shoppers ’ destination of choice appeared to be department stores , with nearly half of holiday shoppers visiting at least one .
A little more than 43 percent of shoppers said they went to a discount retailer this weekend .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
The scientists anticipate their " LithoParticles " will have significant applications in photonics , optical communications and other areas .
Chemists and physicists have succeeded in getting custom - shaped microparticles to interact and self - assemble in a controlled way in a liquid crystal .
The research , federally funded by the National Science Foundation , appears in the Nov. 20 edition of the journal Science .
" We 're learning the rules about how these lithographic particles self - assemble , " said Thomas G. Mason , a UCLA professor of chemistry and physics and a member of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA .
" This method may enable us to cause them to assemble in desired configurations . "
The scientists anticipate that their " LithoParticles , " which are made of solid polymeric materials , will have significant technological and scientific uses .
" We 're examining how pairs of particles interact and come to attach together , " Mason said .
" If we can get the particles to interact in certain controlled ways , we can build larger - scale assemblies that may have applications in photonics , optical communication networks and a variety of other areas . "
Mason and his colleagues — lead author Clayton Lapointe , a postdoctoral scholar at UCLA , formerly at the University of Colorado at Boulder , and Ivan Smalyukh , an assistant professor of physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder — used an optical microscope to study the attractions between the particles , which they custom designed in various shapes , including triangles , squares and pentagons .
The particles are too small to see with the unaided eye but are quite clear with the instrument .
" This is a very complex material that we have created , " said Mason , whose research is at the intersection of chemistry , physics , engineering and biology .
" We have made lithographic particles dispersed in a liquid crystal , and the molecular constituents are aligned . "
Particles of different shapes interact in different ways , Lapointe , Mason and Smalyukh report .
Those with an odd number of sides , such as triangles and pentagons , interact differently than particles shaped like squares .
" In this environment , the particles have different kinds of interactions that depend on their shapes , " Mason said .
" We have shown in a systematic way how by changing the number of sides of the particles in a controlled way , we can characterize the differences in their interactions . "
The scientists added materials to the liquid crystal to get the particles to attract .
They produced the geometric particles using the same method Mason and his UCLA used to design and mass - produce billions of fluorescent microscale particles in the shapes of all 26 letters of the alphabet , as well as geometric shapes , such as triangles , crosses and doughnuts , in 2007 .
Now they have watched the particles interact .
In another paper , UCLA postdoctoral scholar Kun Zhao and Mason report discovering new states of matter in two dimensions .
Their research , which appears in the Nov. 13 edition of the journal Physical Review Letters , focused on a two - dimensional surface with pentagon - shaped particles that were free to move on this surface .
Zhao and Mason studied the structures as they increased the area fraction of the pentagons in the confined two - dimensional plane .
They used a lithographic technique to make the particles and studied them in water on a flat glass surface .

Cell phones are almost as common as pocket change these days .
It seems nearly everyone , including an increasing number of children , carries a cell phone wherever they go .
Cell phones are now so popular and convenient that they are surpassing landlines as the primary form of telecommunication for many people .
Health Risks
In 2008 , for the first time , Americans are expected to spend more on cell phones than on landlines , according to the U.S. Labor Department .
We not only love our cell phones , we use them : Americans racked up more than a trillion cell phone minutes in the first half of 2007 alone .
Yet , as cell phone use continues to grow , so does concern about the possible health risks of prolonged exposure to cell phone radiation .
Cell Phones and Cancer
Wireless cell phones transmit signals via radio frequency ( RF ) , the same kind of low - frequency radiation used in microwave ovens and AM / FM radios .
Scientists have known for years that large doses of high - frequency radiation — the kind used in X - rays — causes cancer , but less is understood about the risks of low - frequency radiation .
Studies on the health risks of cell phone use have produced mixed results , but scientists and medical experts warn that people should not assume no risk exists .
Cell phones have been widely available for only the past 10 years or so , but tumors may take twice that long to develop .
Since cell phones have n’t been around very long , scientists have n’t been able to assess the effects of long - term cell phone use or to study the effects of low - frequency radiation on growing children .
Most studies have focused on people who have been using cell phones for three to five years , but some studies have indicated that using a cell phone an hour a day for 10 years or more can significantly increase the risk of developing a rare brain tumor .
What Makes Cell Phones Dangerous
M​ost RF from cell phones comes from the antenna , which sends signals to the nearest base station .
The farther the cell phone is from the nearest base station , the more radiation it requires to send the signal and make the connection .
As a result , scientists theorize that the health risks from cell phone radiation would be greater for people who live and work where base stations are farther away or fewer in number — and research is beginning to support that theory .
In December 2007 , Israeli researchers reported in the American Journal of Epidemiology that long - term cell phone users who live in rural areas face a " consistently elevated risk " of developing tumors in the parotid gland compared with users who live in urban or suburban locations .
The parotid gland is a salivary gland located just below a person ’s ear .
And in January 2008 , the French Health Ministry issued a warning against excessive cell phone use , especially by children , despite the lack of conclusive scientific evidence linking cell phone use with cancer or other serious health effects .
In a public statement , the ministry said : " As the hypothesis of a risk cannot be entirely excluded , precaution is justified . "
How to Protect Yourself From Cell Phone Radiation
“ Precaution ” seems to be the approach recommended by an increasing number of scientists , medical experts , and public health agencies , from the French Health Ministry to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
General recommendations to minimize the potential health risks include talking on cell phones only when necessary and using a hands - free device to keep the cell phone away from your head .
If you ’re concerned about your exposure to cell phone radiation , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) requires manufacturers to report the relative amount of RF absorbed into a user ’s head ( known as the specific absorption rate , or SAR ) from every type of cell phone on the market today .
To learn more about SAR and to check the specific absorption rate for your phone , check the FCC website .

Do you think ideas do n't matter , that what people believe about themselves and their world has no real consequence ?
If so , the following will not bug you in the slightest .
A new BBC poll [ reported November 2009 ] finds that only 11 percent of people questioned around the world — and 29,000 people were asked their opinions — think that free - market capitalism is a good thing .
The rest believe in more government regulation .
Only a small percentage of the world 's population believes that capitalism works well and that more regulation will reduce efficiency .
One quarter of those asked said that capitalism is " fatally flawed . "
In France , 43 % believe this .
In Mexico , it is 38 % .
A majority believes that government should rob the rich to give money to poor countries .
In only one country , Turkey , did a majority say that less government is better .
It gets even worse .
While most Europeans and Americans think it was a good thing for the Soviet Union to disintegrate , people in India , Indonesia , Ukraine , Pakistan , Russia , and Egypt mostly think it was a bad thing .
Yes , you read that right : millions freed from socialist slavery — bad thing .
That news must lift the heart of every would - be despot the world over .
And it comes as something of a shock twenty years after the collapse of socialism in Russia and Eastern Europe revealed what this system had created : backward societies with citizens who lived short and miserable lives .
Then there is the China case , a country rescued from bloody barbarism under communism and transformed into a modern and prosperous country by capitalism .
What can we learn ?
Far from not having learned anything , people have largely forgotten the experience and have developed a love for the ancient fairy tale that all things can be fixed through collectivism and central planning .
As to those who would despair at this poll , consider that it might have been much worse were it not for the efforts of a relative handful of intellectuals who have fought against socialist theory for more than a century .
It might have been 99 % in support of socialist tyranny .
So there is no sense in saying that these intellectual efforts are wasted .
Ideas also have a life of their own .
They can lie in wait for decades or centuries and then one day , the whole of history turns on a dime .
Especially these days , no effort goes to waste .
Publications and essays , or any form of education , is immortalized , ready for the taking by a desperate world .
As for the opinion poll , we have no idea just how intensely these views are held or even what they mean .
What , for example , is capitalism ?
Do people even know ?
Michael Moore does n't know , else he would n't be calling bailouts for elite , Fed - connected financial firms a form of capitalism .
Many other people reduce the term capitalism to " the system of economics in the United States . "
It is no more complicated than that .
This is despite the reality that the United States has a comprehensive planning apparatus in place that is directly responsible for all our current economic troubles .
Now , let 's take this further .
Among the many people around the world who do not like the US empire , many believe they do n't like capitalism either .
If the US economy drags the world down into recession , that is a prime example of capitalism 's failure .
Even more preposterous , if you did n't like George W. Bush , his ways , and his cronies , and Obama is something of a relief , then you do n't like capitalism and you do like socialism .
Another point of view misunderstands the idea of capitalism itself .
It is not about creating economic structures that benefit capital at the expense of labor or culture or religion .
It is about a system that protects the rights of everyone and serves the common good .
Capitalism is just the name that happened to be identified with this system .
If you want to call freedom a banana , fine , what matters is not words but ideas .
I do know that none of these messed - up definitions of capitalism follow .
You know this too .
But for the world at large , serious ideological analytics are not the animating force of daily life .
Many people attach themselves to vague slogans .
Further , as Rothbard has forcefully argued , free - market capitalism serves no more than a symbolic purpose for the Republican Party and for conservatives .
Economic liberty is the utopia that they keep promising to bring us , pending the higher priority of blowing up foreign peoples , jailing political dissidents , crushing the left wing on campus , and routing the Democrats .
Once all of this is done , they say , then they will get to the instituting of a free - market economic system .
Of course , that day never arrives , and it is not supposed to .
Capitalism serves the Republicans the way Communism served Stalin : a symbolic distraction to keep you hoping , voting , and coughing up money .
All of which leaves true capitalism — a product of the voluntary society and the sum total of all the exchanges and cooperative acts of people all over the world — with few actual intellectual defenders .
They are growing , but the educational work we need to do is daunting , and we are facing the most powerful forces in the world .
There is nothing new in this .
In the history of the world , freedom is the exception , not the rule .
It must be fought for anew in every generation .
Its enemies are everywhere , but the leading enemy is ignorance .
For this reason , the main weapon we have at our disposal is education .
Education includes explaining that socialism is an unworkable idea .
There is nothing better than Ludwig von Mises 's 1922 book Socialism , a comprehensive presentation of the fallacy of the socialist idea .
Another essential work is the Black Book of Communism .
Here we have a wake - up call that shows that the dream of socialism is actually a bloody nightmare .
Then there is the issue of the positive case for capitalism .
One can do no better than Mises 's own Human Action , which is not likely to ever be surpassed as a treatise on the free economy .
True , it is not for everyone .
And that 's fine .
There are many primers out there too .
The fashion for socialism and the opposition to capitalism should alarm every lover of freedom the world over .
We have our jobs cut out for us , but with numbers this bad , it is not difficult to make a difference .
Every blow you can land for free markets helps protect freedom from its enemies .
Martin Ford , software CEO and author of a new ( bad ) book on how automation may destroy our economy , is right about one thing :
Among people who work in the field of computer technology , it is fairly routine to speculate about the likelihood that computers will someday approach , or possibly even exceed , human beings in general capability and intelligence . …
While technologists are actively thinking about , and writing books about , intelligent machines , the idea that technology will ever truly replace a large fraction of the human workforce and lead to permanent , structural unemployment is , for the majority of economists , almost unthinkable .
For mainstream economists , at least in the long run , technological advancement always leads to more prosperity and more jobs .
Yes , techies agree on the long term plausibility of machines doing almost all jobs at a cost below human subsistence wages , thereby gaining almost all income , while economists ignore this scenario .
E.g. , Tyler Cowen :
In the longer run … computers will free up lots of human labor — but in the meantime it will have drastic implications for income redistribution , across both individuals and across economic sectors .
…
Robin Hanson believes we are headed back toward a Malthusian equilibrium ; in contrast I believe that machines will never outcompete humans across the board .
Arnold Kling agreed :
I agree that Singularians are far too optimistic about artificial intelligence .
It is a variation of the “ fatal conceit ” problem .
Most of human intelligence is tacit knowledge , consisting of elaborate metaphors that are originally acquired from sensory experience .
Artificial intelligence is an attempt to arrive at the same point through top - down design .
…
Computers and robots will be economically significant but not paradigm - shifting .
Economists should listen more to techies on what techs will be feasible at what costs , but techies should also listen more to economists on the social implications of tech costs .
Alas , just as economists prefer to rely on their intuitive folk tech forecasts , techies prefer to rely instead on their intuitive folk economics .
E.g. , Martin Ford ’s misguided intuitions :
At some point … machines will be able to do the jobs of a large percentage of the “ average ” people in our population , and these people will not be able to find new jobs . …
This tremendous selection of products , and also services , which we now take for granted , is unprecedented in human history .
…
All these products owe their existence to the mass market .
… When a business creates products or services at high volume , it realizes economies of scale , and that , of course , results in lower prices .
In addition , however , high volume production also makes it possible for the business to adopt statistical quality control techniques and to improve overall consistency and precision in the production process . …
As jobs are eliminated , … some of this wealth is then transferred to the owners .
…
The distribution of income [ becomes ] more concentrated . …
The demand for the mass market products that drive our economy depend much more on the number of potential customers than on the wealth of any particular customer .
You are not going to be able to sell 40 cell phones to one person , no matter how wealthy they are .
…
Continuing to save money as automation slowly eliminates some of their remaining workers , this is not enough to make up for the reduction in sales . …
If … a slave ( or automation - based ) economy is destined to undergo continuing decline , how is it that the slave states were able to maintain stability for so long ?
The answer lies in the fact that the South was primarily an export economy . …
Once full automation penetrates the job market to a substantial degree , an economy driven by mass - market production must ultimately go into decline .
The reason for this is simply that , when we consider the market as a whole , the people who rely on jobs for their income are the same individuals who buy the products produced .
…
Making a few people richer will not make up for losing a large number of potential customers .
Ford ’s mass - market theory of production is nothing like standard economic theory .
Sure high income inequality might be ethically bad , and threaten political instability , but it does not at all threaten economic collapse – producers can focus on giving the rich what they want , and innovation and growth is just as feasible for elite products as for mass products .
When I informed Ford than an economist ( me ) had taken his tech assumption seriously , he was not moved :
My immediate reaction to this is that economic growth at any level — let alone of an order of magnitude beyond what we are accustomed to — is fundamentally incompatible with wages that are falling dramatically for the vast majority of workers . …
If wages fall dramatically , then consumption must likewise fall because the majority of personal consumption is supported by wage income .
…
Hanson … seems to be saying that if consumers have an ownership interest in the economy of the future , then the resulting investment income will be sufficient to make up for the precipitous decline in wages . …
Dr. Hanson seems to be assuming that the stock market ( and other productive assets ) would increase dramatically in value …
The problem I see with this is that , according to modern financial theory , … asset values are defined by investors ’ expectations for the future cash flows . …
It seems clear to me that , in the midst of across the board job automation and plunging consumer demand , those future cash flows would be looking pretty minimal .
Ford seems to be confusing capital as stock vs. flow .
The fraction of production that is given to capital vs. labor depends on the marginal productivity of capital , times the quantity of capital , vs. the marginal productivity of labor , times the quantity of labor .
If capital and labor are the only owned factors of production , then if the fraction of income going to labor falls , the fraction of income going to capital must rise .
That income flow goes to capital regardless of what assets are used to represent the stock of capital .
Instead of trying to reason about what sets stock prices , it is simpler to imagine firms renting capital from capital owners , paying them according to capital ’s marginal productivity .
The standard views of techies about what techs will be feasible might be wrong , and the standard views of economists of how to forecast tech consequences might be wrong .
And it is fine for contrarians to try to persuade specialists they are in error , though contrarians would be wise to at least understand the standard view before trying to overturn it .
But surely what the world needs first and foremost is to see and take seriously the simple combination of the standard views on such important topics .
Added 8a 29Aug : Ford responds by just repeating his claim :
Machines could go from performing 25 % of jobs to 75 % within four years . …
Let ’s try to imagine an actual scenario : … Businesses rapidly deploy the technology and the unemployment rate rises . …
As consumer spending falls , businesses either adapt by laying off workers and automating still more jobs , or they fail entirely . ….
Mortgage defaults are now at an unprecedented level . …
How does the financial system and the overall economy survive that in the short run ?
I may be an economic rube , but I do n’t get it .
…
Production is equal to consumption plus investment , and those are both going to be in free fall , given a scenario like the one above .
Yes , a sudden unanticipated change would be disruptive , but no disruption does not imply falling production .
Ford needs to learn some economics , or listen to some economists .

Earlier this month , Linus Torvalds released 2.6.32 -rc6 â due to the Kernel Summit , RC6 was not released the usual week after RC5 , but two weeks after .
As usual at this point in the development cycle , mostly minor patches have been merged over the past few days to avoid making changes that might introduce new bugs in the three to six weeks that remain until the final release of Linux 2.6.32 .
Having looked at the network subsystem changes in the previous issue , the Kernel Log will now discuss the most important advancements in the field of graphics hardware support .
Some of these changes have probably been eagerly awaited by many users since AMD resumed closer cooperation with the open source developers .
3D and KMS for Radeon
The kernel and its Direct Rendering Manager ( DRM ) will now offer 3D support and kernel - based mode setting ( KMS ) for AMD 's series R600 and R700 GPUs .
These are used in the Radeon series 2000 , 3000 and 4000 models â which includes most of the Radeon graphics cards sold in the past couple of years as well as various AMD series 700 motherboard chip-sets .
For the 3D support and KMS to function , however , suitable ( developer ) versions of Libdrm and MesaÂ 3D as well as Radeon graphics drivers for X.org need to be installed .
Compiling this software stack is a task for advanced users â however , the Fedora project plans to provide all the necessary components in an experimental package with FedoraÂ 12 , which is scheduled for release in mid November .
The Radeon KMS will also offer basic support for activating TV outputs .
While the KMS driver for Intel graphics chips already offered this feature , it now supports a greater number of SDVO chips and more of their respective features ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
From version 2.6.32 , the Intel KMS code will also compress the frame buffer , which reportedly reduces power consumption by up to 0.5 watts ; in addition , the new " Dynamic Clock Frequency Control " feature is to further reduce power consumption by reducing the LCD refresh rate , the memory 's self refresh and the clock rate to prolong notebook battery life .
The Intel driver now handles the graphics memory more efficiently , ( 1 , 2 ) and will attempt to re-initialise crashed GPUs .
Coordinated
The kernel hackers have also integrated the VGA arbitration patches ( 1 , 2 , documentation ) .
In systems with several graphics cards , the patches cooperate with X Servers from version 1.7 to ensure that the respective graphics card will actually receive the VGA commands sent to it by the X Server â which reportedly allows much more flexibility when implementing multi-seat environments .
Further changes to the kernel code responsible for graphics support :
The " video= " parameter can now be used for setting a specific output screen resolution for individual monitors , or all monitors , in the KMS code .
The firmware previously tied in with the code for Radeon drivers has been shifted into separate files and will from now on be loaded using the firmware loader .
The developers also made a similar change to the driver code for Matrox graphics cards .
A new addition is the frame buffer driver for Qualcomm MSM / QSD SoCs , which are used in devices like the HTC Dream ( aka T - Mobile G1 , aka ADP1 ) .
The developers have reworked the code paths used for initialisation by the kernel 's Radeon drivers .
This is intended both to facilitate maintenance and improve suspend and resume behaviour â the relevant commits are listed at the end of this article .
These driver maintenance measures should also simplify the merging of several KMS code segments for AMD and Intel GPUs .
The frame buffer driver for VIA graphics hardware now also supports the VX855 chip-set .
Furthermore , the kernel hackers have rewritten the VIA driver 's 2D engine .
The new tracepoint support offers enhanced DRM code monitoring for Intel 's current graphics chip-sets .
The developers say they have also fixed numerous bugs with Intel series 8xx chip-sets that have occurred since GEM was introduced in 2.6.27 .
The KMS code for Radeon graphics hardware now supports Surround View â which involves running a Radeon graphics card in parallel with the chip - set graphics .
Minor gems
Many further minor , but by no means insignificant , changes can be found in the list below .
Like many of the references in the text above , the links point to the relevant commits in the web front end of the Git branch at kernel.org Linus Torvalds uses for maintaining the kernel sources .
There , the commit comments and the patches themselves provide extensive further information on the respective changes .

The State Department has always been tight - lipped about who receives democracy funding for Iran , out of fear that the groups ’ associates would be targeted in Iran .
It is unclear how many other groups have lost their funding under the Obama administration .
“ US government priorities for the region continue to include support for civil society and advocacy , promoting the rule of law and human rights , and increasing access to alternative sources of information , ’’ Edwards said .
“ Applications submitted to USAID are thoroughly reviewed against the evaluations criteria outlined in its solicitations . ’’
The job of doling out money to groups seeking to influence Iran has been shifted from the State Department ’s Near Eastern Affairs Bureau to a lower - profile division , its US Agency for International Development .
USAID spokesman Harry Edwards did not provide an explanation of why funding was denied for the Human Rights Documentation Center , widely seen as the most comprehensive clearing house of documents related to human rights abuses in Iran .
He said the government ’s funding priorities have not changed .
Michael Rubin , a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative Washington - based think tank , said , “ It is a shock that they did not get funding . ’’
A reason , he asserted , may be that “ the Obama administration is so focused on engaging Iran that they do n’t want this information to get in the way . ’’
“ The Iran Human Rights Documentation Center is at the forefront of pioneering and vitally important work , ’’ said Senator Joe Lieberman , a Connecticut independent , in a statement yesterday .
“ It is disturbing that the State Department would cut off funding at precisely the moment when these brave investigations are needed most . ’’
Many see the sudden , unexplained cutoff of funding as a shift by the Obama administration away from high - profile democracy promotion in Iran , which had become a signature issue for President Bush .
But the timing has alarmed some on Capitol Hill .
“ If there is one time that I expected to get funding , this was it , ’’ said Rene Redman , the group ’s executive director , who had asked for $ 2.7 million in funding for the next two years .
“ I was sur prised , because the world was watching human rights violations right there on television . ’’
But just as the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center was ramping up to investigate abuses of protesters after this summer ’s disputed presidential election , the group received word that - for the first time since it was formed - its federal funding request had been denied .
WASHINGTON - For the past five years , researchers in a modest office overlooking the New Haven green have carefully documented cases of assassination and torture of democracy activists in Iran .
With more than $ 3 million in grants from the US State Department , they have pored over thousands of documents and Persian - language press reports and interviewed scores of witnesses and survivors to build dossiers on those they say are Iran ’s most infamous human - rights abusers .
Obama officials have argued publicly for a less - confrontational approach than Bush , in the belief that the Bush administration ’s vocal support for democracy activists made them targets in Iran and stirred up fears of regime change .
The Obama administration has emphasized other forms of assistance , such as aid for software programs that help activists communicate on the Internet anonymously .
It also has continued funding for exchange programs .
In the coming months , for instance , the administration hopes to bring Iranian lawyers to major cities in the United States , including Boston , to talk with American lawyers about their concept of law .
Formed by two exiled Iranians in 2004 with a $ 1 million grant from the State Department , the center made its home near Yale ’s campus , where it attracted Yale law school professors to its board .
The board also includes the dean of Harvard Law School , Martha Minow .
The group has published 12 reports in English and Persian about the forced confessions of detained bloggers and journalists , the 1988 massacre of thousands of political prisoners , and the Iranian government ’s campaign to assassinate dissidents abroad .
Although the State Department has been the group ’s main source of funds , the Canadian government granted it money to research human - rights abuses in the wake of the disputed election this year .
Currently , the group is working to develop a list of all those who were arrested following the election and a list of those responsible for alleged abuses in prison .
But without additional funding , the group will shut down in May when its funding runs out , Redman said .
The group is not affiliated with any political party in Iran .
It attracted controversy during its early years , however , when one of its founders and current board members , Ramin Ahmadi , gave a workshop in Dubai on tactics of underground political resistance to Iranian citizens who had secretly traveled there .
Since then , the Iranian government has accused Ahmadi of being an agent of the United States , and some of his trainees were arrested .
Ahmadi , a medical doctor in Danbury , Conn. , still vocally supports the opposition movement , joking at a recent panel at Yale Law School that he could sneak audience members into Iran if they wanted to join .
But at least three other groups that received funding under Bush ’s democracy program for Iran have been told they would not receive funding this year , according to Roya Boroumand , founder of the Bormound Foundation , which works against the death penalty in Iran .
Boroumand said her group does not get State Department funds , but that she is in contact with other organizations who do , and all are worried .
“ If the rationale is that we are going to stop funding human rights - related work in Iran because we do n’t want to provoke the government , it is absolutely the wrong message to send , ’’ she said .
“ That means that we do n’t really believe in human rights , that the American government just looks into it when it is convenient . ’’

Overview :
Imagine finding the perfect training video but it is an hour long and you need to find the specific part of the video that covers your specific interest .
Or possibly you are an advertiser and you would like to have content aware advertising in some specific online videos .
You would like to have your advertising show up on a page when a specific word is mentioned in a video or maybe when a video is searched for a specific word , does that sound familiar it should as it is the google model for advertising and now it can apply to video .
The solution that I will cover in this article will allow you to transcribe the spoken word in videos into text and allow a user to search that text to find relevant areas of the video .
The example that we will cover is only the beginning .
I could imagine an entire searchable library of video or possibly even a web search engine that easily finds and displays video starting at the location where the search engine found a word that was spoken in the video .
Before we jump in it might be helpful to see an example .
Requirements :
In order to create the transcription you will need either Premiere® Pro CS4 or Adobe® Soundbooth ® CS4 .
My opinion is that if you are going to do any serious video editing you should consider Adobe® Creative Suite® 4 Production Premium as it contains everything you will need to edit , composite and publish high quality video projects .
Getting Started :
I should start by telling you what I am not going to cover .
I am not going to cover how to get started with Premiere Pro , Soundbooth and the Flash Media Server .
There are a number of great resources for each of these products .
What I am going to cover is the specific functionality in each of these products that relate to creating searchable video .
Lets start with Adobe Premiere Pro .
Once your project is created and the video and sound edited to your satisfaction it is time to transcribe the video .
This is a very straight forward step .
Simply open or expand the Metadata panel and you should see a button at the bottom of the panel called Transcribe .
If you do not see the panel you can open it from the Window menu .
The following panel allows you to transcribe as well as edit an existing transcription .
When you click the Transcribe button you will see the following dialog that allows you to choose the language , quality and whether to identify speakers .
The language choice is pretty straight forward .
As for the quality I see no reason to ever choose anything other than high .
When you choose identify speakers you will notice in the exported xml something like the following < Name > Speaker 1 </ Name > .
I can see this being an interesting addition to an application but for this example I did not take advantage of this feature .
This process can take some time to complete .
Keep in mind that an accurate transcription relies on two very important criteria .
First and foremost a good quality sound track is critically important .
If you have background noise or a muffled speaker you will not get a very accurate transcription .
Second is the dictionary that is used to recognize words .
In order to give you some context , imagine attending a lecture where the speaker spoke in a language that you did not understand .
A custom library is a library with specific word definitions that allow Premiere to more accurately identify and transcribe the spoken word .
This is an area that you will see expanded on in future versions of the Production Premium Creative Suite .
When the transcription process is complete the xml that represents that transcription is stored as XMP Metadata as part of the video file .
It is possible to access and use XMP Metadata that is stored in a swf , flv and f4v via Actionscript but this should be carefully considered .
If you create a long format video that contains a great deal of speech to be transcribed that finished transcription can represent a fairly large increase in file size .
As an example the following represents two files encoded with the same settings and length the larger file has metadata and the smaller does not .
Storing and accessing the transcription metadata stored in the final video file can also cause problems for streamed video from the Flash Media Server because of the way that text is stored in the video file .
I found the best way to use this transcription to create online searchable video was to export the xml file so that it did not remain part of the video file .
This may be addressed in the future but for now if your video is longer than say 15 minutes and you plan to stream that video it would be best to export the xml that represents transcription to an xml file that is stored outside the video file .
I would suggest that you exclude the metadata for the final video that will be displayed online .
In order to exclude metadata during export from Premiere Pro CS4 click the panel menu button on the right hand side of the options panel in the export dialog box .
In the popup deselect Include Source XMP Metadata .
One more slight wrinkle in the process is that you cannot export the transcription as xml from Premiere .
The only way to export the transcription is from Soundbooth .
Editing The Transcription :
Anyone familiar with speech to text knows that it is not possible to get one hundred percent accuracy .
With that said it is possible to get a high degree of accuracy given the criteria mentioned earlier in this article .
There are a number of tools that can help you clean up the transcription in both Soundbooth and Premiere .
Once the transcription process is complete and you see the text in Metadata panel you should see the play , loop and transcribe buttons .
You should also see a search field at the to of the Metadata panel in both Soundbooth and Premiere .
The search field allows you to search for words that are in the transcription .
This functionality can prove very useful when you find a word that was not transcribed properly and may show up in multiple locations through out the transcription .
Once you find a word that needs to be corrected simply double click the word and you will be able to edit that word .
Depending on how the word was recognized during the transcription process you may that you need additional functionality .
If you right click on a word in the Metadata panel you will see the additional features .
Exporting The XML :
As I mentioned previously you cannot export the XML file required for this example from Premiere that must be done in Soundbooth .
Soundbooth has many fantastic features including volume correction and my favorite visual audio healing .
You might wonder why I am mentioning Soundbooth features under the Exporting The XML heading ; to refresh your memory it is because you cannot export the XML transcription from Premiere .
If you have any last minute touch - ups for your audio track it might be a good idea to leave them to just before you export the transcription as xml .
Then it is a simple matter to right click the audio track in Premiere and select Edit in Adobe Soundbooth and then Render and Replace .
From Soundbooth you will be able to clean up your audio , if required , and export the transcription as xml .
The changes that you make in Soundbooth will show up in Premiere as soon as you save thanks to Dynamic Link .
Once you are in Soundbooth you should see that the transcription has come over with the audio track .
To export the xml file simply go to the File menu and then down to Export then select Speech Transcription .
Once the xml file is exported it is time to finish encoding your video into either an FLV or an F4V .
If you have made changes to the audio in Soundbooth save and return to Premiere to finish encoding your video .
When considering the functionality required to create searchable video streaming vs progressive is an important consideration .
Progressive video is video that is accessed by using the http protocol .
Streaming video is accessed by using RTMP .
For searchable video there are a couple of key differences that should help you choose the right technology .
First navigation with in the video is key to the idea of searchable video .
With progressive you would have to download all of the video from the start of the video to the place a user is navigating to in the video .
If the video is fairly long this can be very frustrating for a user .
You can imagine doing a search and finding the word you are looking for close to the end of say a forty minute video and having to wait for that amount of video to download before being able to jump to that portion of the video .
Streaming on the other hand simply starts sending the video from the part of the video requested .
Streaming makes searchable video usable for even long format video .
Another key feature of the Flash Media Server that assists in making searchable video a reality is something called enhanced seek .
The following is a definition from the online documentation :
“ Enhanced seeking is a Boolean flag in the Application .xml file .
By default , this flag is set to false .
When a play occurs , the server seeks to the closest video keyframe possible and starts from that keyframe .
For example , if you want to play at time 15 , and there are keyframes only at time 11 and time 17 , seeking will start from time 17 instead of time 15 .
This is an approximate seeking method that works well with compressed streams .
If the flag is set to true , some compression is invoked on the server .
Using the previous example , if the flag is set to true , the server creates a keyframe–based on the preexisting keyframe at time 11 – for each keyframe from 11 through 15 .
Even though a keyframe does not exist at the seek time , the server generates a keyframe , which involves some processing time on the server . ”
The preceding should be fairly easy to understand how searchable video would benefit from this functionality but to make sure I will put this functionality in the context of this example .
Imagine doing a number of searches on a long video .
If the keyframes were not placed on every frame what you would notice is that some percentage of searches would take you past the point where the word was spoken in the video leaving you to wonder if the word was found at all .
The Final Step :
At this point you should have a video encoded as either an FLV or an F4V and an xml file that represents the transcription from the video file .
In the second paragraph of this article there is a link to an example , the sample provided with this article has very close to the same functionality as that example .
You can download the sample with the link provided at the bottom this article .
Once you have downloaded those files and unpacked you should have the following files :
searchableVideo.html
searchableVideo.swf
searchableVideoPrefs.xml
You should also have a skins folder .
All of the files and the skins folder should be in the same directory on a web server or in the webroot in the Flash Media Server installation directory .
The following is the typical path for the webroot folder when installed on Windows XP .
C: \Program Files \Adobe \Flash Media Server 3.5\webroot
This is of course required so that you can access the content from a web browser .
The searchable Video. html file is the html wrapper that hosts the swf .
This is not required you can use your own html page to host the searchable Video. swf .
It is easy to add the searchable Video. swf to your own html page from within Dreamweaver .
Just add these files and the skins folder to your Dreamweaver site files and create a new page or open an existing page and simply drag the swf file ( searchableVideo.swf ) onto that page .
Dreamweaver will create the object and embed code for you .
Keep in mind that the searchable VideoPrefs.xml file needs to be in the same directory as the searchable Video. swf on the web server .
Organizing files for access over the web is much easier now with the Flash Media Server 3.5 because it has an embedded web server .
You can simply drop the html and swf files that you would like someone to access using a web browser in to the webroot folder in the installation folder of the Flash Media Server .
Once you have the files setup it is time to edit the searchable VideoPrefs.xml which allows you to specify the location of the transcription xml file and video .
In addition you can also make changes to some of the player functionality and appearance from this same searchable VideoPrefs.xml file .
I would suggest that you open the searchable VideoPrefs.xml file in either Dreamweaver or an xml editor do not use a word processor .
Once the file is open you should see the < sourceURI > tag .
It is important that you do not edit any of the tags only the content between them .
For instance make sure that when you are editing the < sourceURI > which represents the location of the video you do not change either < sourceURI > or </ sourceURI > in anyway only the text between those tags .
This is true for any tags in this file .
If you wanted to play a video on a server with a dns name of foo.com and the video was in a Flash Media Server application called lectureVideos and the name of the video was chem101.flv the < sourceURI > tag should look like the following :
< sourceURI>rtmp://foo.com/lectureVideo/chem101.flv</sourceURI >
This may seem complex but it is really fairly simple .
When you install the Flash Media Server on windows it has two pre-installed applications vod and live .
These applications are represented as folders in the following location C : \Program Files \Adobe \Flash Media Server 3.5 \applications .
The name of the application is the name of the folder in that location .
In the example that we mentioned you would have a folder called lectureVideo in the application directory mentioned above ( e.g. C: \Program Files \Adobe \Flash Media Server 3.5\applications\lectureVideo ) .
In side of that folder you will have a folder called streams and inside of that you will have a folder called _defInst_ and inside of that folder you will have your video file .
So the entire path to your video file on the Flash Media Server would be C : \Program Files \Adobe \Flash Media Server 3.5\applications\lectureVideo\streams\_defInst_\chem101.flv.
Remember that if you are using an f4 v file that you must prefix the file name with mp4 : .
For instance if the previous example was an f4v not an flv the sourceURI tag would be the following :
< sourceURI>rtmp://foo.com/lectureVideo/mp4:chem101.f4v</sourceURI >
As I mentioned previously there are many resources for learning about the different tools and servers used in this example .
Now you should have the hang of editing the searchable VideoPrefs.xml file .
Next we are going to edit the location of the transcription xml file that was generated in Premiere and exported from Soundbooth .
The same precaution holds true for editing this tag , do not change the tags in anyway only the contents .
This location can either be relative to the swf or a complete http uri .
For instance both of the following are correct :
< transcriptLocation>assets/RedWorkflow.xml
</transcriptLocation >
and
< transcriptLocation >
http://foo.com/searchableVideo/assets/RedWorkflow.xml
</transcriptLocation >
In the first example it would mean that the RedWorkflow.xml ( i.e. transcription xml file ) would be in an assets folder which would be in the same folder as the searchable Video.swf and searchable VideoPrefs.xml files .
In the second example the RedWorkflow.xml file could be stored on the same or a different server and access by using the http protocol .
Lets take a look at how the finished example should look and label some of the areas of the example so that it is easier to follow along .
In the following image I have highlighted and labeled the important areas of the player so that it will be easier to understand my references :
The Text Cloud section represents the highest occurring words in the transcription .
This allows the viewer to get an idea of the kind of content in the video .
The viewer can click on any of the keywords in the Text Cloud in order to display those results in the Found Items section .
The Relevant Text section is displayed when a viewer clicks an item in the Found Items section , it displays the text surrounding the found text .
The Video Display shows the video as well as markers representing the found text .
A viewer can rollover the marker to display the surrounding text as well as seek to that portion of the video .
The Search Field allows a user to enter and search on one or more words and the Found Items section displays the result .
It is also possible to sort the columns in the Found Items section by clicking the column headings .
There are a number of other settings in the searchable VideoPrefs.xml that you can use to change the functionality and appearance of the searchable video player .
First minwordLength , use this to set the minimum word length for the text cloud at the bottom of the example .
A setting of 5 will mean that no words shorter than 5 letters will show up in the word cloud .
Next there is videoInitStartSeconds which determines the initial start time of the video when the player is first launched .
There are a few other settings that will affect the appearance of the player and they are as follows :
globalTextColor : sets the color for ALL text on screen
swfBackgroundColor : sets the background color of the player
foundTextHighLightColor : changes the color of the text in the relevant text display
textBackGroundColor changes the background color for the text cloud and the relevant text area
Well that should get you started .
If you have problems , interests or comments please leave them on this site so that I can respond .
There are many possible additions and changes that I can think of for this example .
I am eagerly waiting to see and hear how people have used this example so please leave me a comment .

Good old Woz .
After all I ’ve done to him over the years , he still wants to be my pal .
So last night he calls and he says he just read that thing on my blog about the Facebook shares .
He says , Hey , remember when we went public and you would n’t give any shares to the guys who had been with us in the garage , and so I created the Woz Plan and gave them some of my shares , or sold them really cheap ?
So I was thinking I could help you out on this Facebook thing .
I ’ll give you some of my Facebook shares .
Okay ?
I ’m like , Wait a minute .
You got Facebook shares ?
How the hell did that happen ?
He ’s like , Steve , everybody got Facebook shares .
They ’ve been spreading them around like mad .
And I ’m like , Well , I did n’t get any , and he goes , Yeah , um , well , yeah , I guess everybody got them except you .
And I ’m like , What is up with that , and he says , Well , you know , I guess it ’s because you ’re kind of a dick .
Point taken , I say .
So then Woz says that he ’s got 2,000 shares and if it will make me feel better he ’ll give me half of what he got .
I ’m like , No way , I want a sixty - forty split , I get 1,200 and you get 800 , and you cover the taxes on my share .
He ’s like , See ?
That ’s what I ’m talking about .
What the heck is wrong with you , man ?
Someone wants to do you a favor and you still want more .
It ’s a sickness , Steve .
It really is .
I ’m like , Hey , let ’s not do this , okay ?
Let ’s not go over this again .
He says , Steve , you almost died this year .
Okay ?
I ’m glad you did n’t , because I love you .
But you almost died , and then you were saved , and now you ’ve got a new life — and this is all you can think about ?
About some shares of Facebook ?
This is what you ’re worried about ?
I go , I know , I should just be worrying about the tablet .
He goes , No !
Not the tablet !
I ’m like , Oh , you mean Android ?
Come on .
It ’s a mess .
The iPhone is kicking ass .
And we ’re totally picking up share with the Mac , too .
He goes , No !
Not that either !
And I ’m like , Dude , what ?
Is Intel trying to fuck us again ?
Who ’s trying to fuck us ?
Google ?
Adobe ?
Microsoft ?
Palm ?
Is it Ruby ?
What did you hear ?
I swear to God if Ruby hires another one of my engineers I will go over there and set his fucking car on fire in the parking lot .
Woz goes , Steve , it ’s Thanksgiving .
You should be thinking about what you ’re thankful for .
You see ?
So then it hits me .
I go , Yeah .
Wow .
Yeah .
Okay , I get it .
You ’re right .
The journey is the reward , he says .
Is n’t that what you used to say ?
It is , I say .
For a moment we just sit there , not talking .
Then he goes , Seems like a long time ago , does n’t it ?
Back when we were kids , making that Apple I . Remember those wooden cases people used to make ?
It was a long time ago , I say .
There ’s another pause , and then he says , Well , it was good to hear your voice , you know ?
I hope you have a good holiday .
I tell him , Same to you , and say hi to whoever it is that you ’re married to now , if in fact you ’re still married .
He says he is , and he will .
I go , Okay , and hey — on those Facebook shares ?
How about we do 55 - 45 .
Here ’s the weird part .
He does n’t get angry .
He gets all choked up .
He says , Sure , that ’s fine , whatever .
I said , Okay , I ’ll send Phil Schiller over to get the paperwork , and happy Thanksgiving , peace on earth , good will to men , namaste and much love , and hey , look , I owe you one .
So I ’ll tell you what .
When the tablet comes out , I ’ll get you one for half off .
He says , Oh , look , I ’m going into a tunnel , I ’m losing my signal , I ’ll have to call you back .
But he never did , and thank God for that .
I do n’t have time to sit around yakking all day .
Bam !
Silliest comic since the last silliest comic .
Edit : Also , this is a prequel / sequel to this strip .
One hard lesson we should have learned after Wall Streets collapse and the governments handling of the bailout is that there is no reason , whatsoever , for us to sacrifice our good faith and trust in former bankers who now run the Treasury and Federal Reserve .
And now as the flu season gets ready to kick off amidst much fanfare and predictions of doom due to a new H1N1 influenza virus , there is emerging sufficient information to raise very serious doubts whether our nations health authorities are truly serving the public health instead of commercial interests .
If the flu season goes according to schedule , the vaccine industrial complex will be poised to join Wall Street for record year rip - off profits .
We will also likely witness huge Pharma executive bonuses and perhaps gold - plated toilets .
Even if the CDC statisticians  crystal ball used to forecast rampant swine flu infections turns into a complete bust  which would only be one more added to many other failed flu predictions back to 1976  it will nevertheless be a very profitable failure as was the economic collapse for the banking cartel .
The vaccine industry has now received orders in the range of 3 billion doses during the course of the coming flu season .
The World Health Organization would like to vaccinate two thirds ( 4 billion ) of the global community , and the US alone is spending $ 2 billion to stockpile the nation with upwards to 250 million doses .
In the US , such profits could never be accomplished without a dynamic , marketing initiative to convince Americans that vaccines will keep them protected and alive .
And what better public relations machine for the vaccine complex , and all its supporters in health insurance and professional medical institutions , than our very own Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services .
Even better , our tax dollars are there to pay for it all .
We pay for the comfort in knowing that the CDCs disinformation campaign will continue to scare us over the major networks and the New York Times .
We can also assure vaccine makers that once and for all they are protected from liability in the event of serious flu vaccine injuries .

Nevertheless , the government has a lot of vaccine vials to distribute , therefore , the CDC needs to sustain the fiction of numerous elderly dying in nursing homes , unvaccinated pregnant moms and children facing life threatening complications , and scores of sick and dead burnt into our national subconscious .
It is all part of the CDCs script to get citizens rushing to their doctors and Wal - Marts to be vaccinated .
Peter Doshi , while at Harvard in the mid-2000s , published a devastating study in the British Medical Journal that systematically unveils the flawed predictive science used to publicize our health agencies  influenza statistics and mortality rates .
His analysis shook up enough health authorities to warrant twelve scientists from the CDC and National Institutes of Health to unsuccessfully take him on .
Now at MIT , Doshi continues his analysis of a centurys worth of influenza mortality data and government manipulation of influenza data , such as the annual figure of 36,000 influenza deaths we hear and read repeatedly .
[ 1 ]
Although this magical number was for all practical purposes alchemically conjured up via mathematical modeling back in 2003 , it continues to be the most holy number in the CDCs PR vocabulary every flu season .
Doshi draws the conclusion , published in the American Journal of Public Health , that commercial interests are playing the role of science in both industry and government . [ 2 ]
Deconstruction of the CDCs cherry - picked science and a growing anti-vaccination community are just some of the obstacles health authorities face .
Therefore , no public relations strategy can have a solid multimedia punch on American citizens without opinion leaders serving as the gnomes for the vaccine complex and our heavily invested government health agencies , which are about to be buried in millions of purchased vaccine vials eager for distribution .
This effort requires shock troopers , such as the pro-vaccine prophet Dr. Paul Offit , the creator of the rotavirus vaccine and a staunch critic against any scientist who discovers an association between vaccines and severe neurological disorders .
Dr. Offit is on record for an audacious comment that children can tolerate 100,000 vaccinations ( yes , you read that number correctly ) . [ 3 ]

However , during this particular flu season , government health officials  may have a more difficult time convincing Americans to be vaccinated for swine flu if recent polls are reliable indicators .
The latest Consumers Union poll released on September 30 shows almost two - thirds of parents will withhold vaccinating their children ; fifty percent of respondents  rationale is that the vaccine has not been tested thoroughly for safety . [ 4 ]
A poll of pregnant mothers conducted by the internet parent support group Mumsnet.com indicates women are turning more suspicious about the flu vaccines true efficacy and safety .
The survey of 1500 respondents found only 6 percent of pregnant women definitely  taking the shot , while 48 percent said they definitely  wouldnt .
A parallel poll revealed only 5 percent would definitely vaccinate their children . [ 5 ]
A more recent San Francisco Chronicle survey finds 54 percent saying the H1N1 flu is nothing to be worried about . [ 6 ]
A separate study conducted by Harvards School of Public Health showed that among the 41 percent who would not get the shot , 44 percent of parents are uncertain they would allow their children to receive it .
Aside from many who expressed a fear of the vaccines side effects , the poll found 31 percent expressing a distrust in our public health officials providing accurate information on vaccine safety .
[ 7 ]
Therefore , expect an aggressive government public relations campaign during the coming weeks and even months , while our tax dollars are spent on 250 million shots that independent epidemiological evidence is showing may be ineffective at best , and dangerous at worst .

European polls indicate that our neighbors on the other side of the great pond are less nervous about the H1N1 strains severity and far more suspicious towards health officials  rationale for hyping dire warnings of swine flus dangers .
In France , Le Figaro conducted a poll of 12,050 people showing 69 percent will refuse the vaccination .
In a separate French survey , one third of 4,752 doctors , nurses and healthcare workers surveyed would not be inoculated .
[ 8 ]
Twenty - nine percent of Germans surveyed said they would refuse it under any circumstance  and an additional 33 percent would likely refuse it .
In the region of Bavaria and Baden Wurttemburg , only 10 percent of those polled said they would submit their arms to injection .
In the UK , a couple polls reported in the Daily Mail last August , showed half of family physicians and a third of UK nurses do not want the swine flu vaccination .
Seventy - one percent do not believe the vaccine has been tested enough for safety and the swine flu is much milder than health authorities are saying .

During the course of the CDCs media war to push forward the vaccine industrys greed for profit , science and reflective caution are being sacrificed .
An important peer - reviewed study appearing in the June 2009 issue of Toxicological and Environmental Chemistry shows a causal relationship between the amounts of ethylmercury ( thimerosal ) found in inoculations for infants , when administered to monkeys , and cellular toxicity resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction , impaired oxidative reduction activity and degeneration and death in neuronal and fetal cells .

These are all indicative signs found in some ASD .
But health officials prefer to ignore such results .
For the future health of American children , the studys findings arrive at a bad time when a recent Harvard study now reports autistic spectrum disorders ( ASD ) has risen to 1 in 91 people compared to the earlier 1 in 150 estimate .
But since the study was sponsored by the CDC , the press release makes no indication that just maybe the over - vaccination of children with dozens of injections by the age of 5 years might be a causal factor behind this national epidemic of ASD and other neurological disorders .
During the course of interviewing many parents of autistic children for our documentaries Vaccine Nation and Autism : Made in the USA , the personal stories we filmed repeatedly were that of a once perfectly healthy and joyful child who , shortly after a vaccination or a series of injections , simply vanished from normality .
However , national health policy today seems to have almost legislated by divine decree that there is no relationship between vaccine ingredients and autism .
Besides , further independent research and first - hand personal stories would only interfere with the propaganda machine and the CDCs  Seven Step Recipe for Generating Interest In , and Demand for , Flu Vaccination . 
Peter Doshi first brought public attention to the CDCs PR influenza strategy known as the Seven Step Recipe .
Glen Nowak , now the Director of the CDCs Media Relations , outlined a concise public relations template while serving as the communications spokesperson for the National Immunization Program .
Speaking at the 2004 National Influenza Vaccine Summit , he presented the CDCs seven steps .
After a careful review of Nowaks Powerpoint presentation we discover a very detailed and concerted PR and multimedia campaign that includes the following ( quotes are from CDCs materials ) :
To encourage the belief that influenza infection can occur among people for whom influenza is not generally perceived to cause serious complications ( e.g. , children , healthy adults , healthy seniors ) .
In other words , promote flu vaccination to those who dont really need it .
In order to foster the demand for flu vaccinations  the CDC should target medical experts and public health authorities publicly ( e.g. , via media ) [ to ] state concern and alarm ( and predict dire outcomes )  and urge influenza vaccination .
By focusing on the message of dire health threats and human casualties upon those who dont really need to be vaccinated , the CDC will reach its milestone of framing of the flu season in terms that motivate behavior ( e.g. , as very severe ,  more severe than last or past years ,  deadly  ) .
Throughout the flu season , the campaign would continue issuing reports from health officials and media to emphasize that influenza is causing severe illness and / or affecting lots of people  helping foster the perception that many people are susceptible to a bad case of influenza . 
Of course , no marketing strategy is thorough without images .
Ergo another ingredient in the recipe is to use visible / tangible examples of the seriousness of the illness ( e.g. , pictures of children , families of those affected coming forward ) and people getting vaccinated ( the first to motivate , the latter to reinforce ) . 
The CDCs key points  indicate we are now in that critical timeframe for the CDC to distribute materials to a variety of partners .
This includes aggressively disseminating all medical reports , studies and PR spins to the soporific media and corporate - funded medical associations to support the governments mass vaccination efforts .
Come November , we will begin to see reports on pediatric deaths  due to influenza  although Dr. Martin Meltzer , a CDC expert in health economics , has stated almost nobody dies of the flu and  deaths [ are ] associated with flu , but not necessarily caused by flu . [ 10 ]
Apparently , the folks over in the various CDC departments and our different federal health agencies dont communicate with each other very well .

So why should our tax dollars go towards fabricating and / or ignoring science in order to vaccinate Americans ?
Nowak publicly stated the CDCs reasons on National Public Radio ,  the manufacturers were telling us that they werent receiving a lot of orders for vaccine for use in November or even December
It really did look like we [ CDC ] needed to do something to encourage people to get a flu shot . [ 11 ]
At this moment , we are witnessing a steady flow press releases and articles in the media to convert Americans to the wisdom of national health vaccination policy .
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) has issued preliminary positive results from an uncompleted clinical trial testing the H1N1 vaccine on children and young people between 6 months and 17 years of age .
The fact that the entire study only enrolled 70 individuals covering this age range should alone raise red flags about any reliable conclusions after the study is completed .
Moreover , the study is specifically designed for measuring the necessary immune response to protect youth from the swine flu .
It is not a safety study .
We usually expect that sound scientific ethics demand clinical trials to be reported after a final analysis of research data , however , the CDCs Seven Step Recipe is not concerned with scientific facts , or rigorous research protocol .
It is simply part of the PR game plan to get people vaccinated and to do it fast .
Donald McNeil , a shill for the vaccine complex writing for the New York Times has printed two recent articles aligned with CDC propaganda .
He quotes Dr. Jay Butler , chief of the swine flu vaccine task force at the CDC in order to relieve fears about flu vaccine adverse effects , especially to pregnant women .
Dr. Butler said ,  There are about 2,400 miscarriages a day in the US .
Youll see things that would have happened anyway .
But the vaccine doesnt cause miscarriages .
It also doesnt cause auto accidents , but they happen . [ 12 ]
I hope that is reassuring to all those expectant mothers across the country , especially since none of the approved H1N1 vaccines have undergone rigorous clinical safety trials on pregnant women or the potential adverse effects of mercury - laced vaccines and other ingredients , such as spermacide , detergent and cosmetics , on the developing fetus .
Germany on the other hand announced it is now taking preventative measures .
Agreeing that the verdict on ethylmercury and squalene safety for children is unsettled , Germany is requiring the vaccine industry to return to their plants and provide adjuvant - and mercury preservative - free vaccine lots .
McNeils more recent article in October 7ths New York Times should be read alongside the Seven Step Recipe for a clear visual unfolding of the CDCs PR strategy in action .
McNeil downplays the growing medical realization that the swine flu is in all likelihood much milder than seasonal flu in order to convince us to roll up our sleeves .
Following the CDC script , we see the picture of little 3 - year - old Clayton being vaccinated , while McNeill compares the swine flu death of an 18 - year - old Tibetan woman in China with a story of joyful young Brandon and his 9 - year - old sister gleefully surrendering their nostrils for a blast of live - attenuated H1N1 virus . [ 13 ]
While finalizing this article , Peter Doshi replied to an email and drew attention to an event in his Harpers article that should force us to pause before rolling up our sleeves .
Briefly , the 2004 flu season was a debacle for the vaccine complex and federal health officials after 50 million doses of flu vaccine promised by Chiron Corporation were made unavailable , therefore , putting the health industry into a panic .
In order to lessen the frenzy previously stirred by its public fear tactics , the CDC downgraded the flus urgency to an annoying illness , and stressed the protective benefits of regular hand washing . [ 14 ]
Now that is a national policy I can support .
I would much prefer the CDC funding Americans  soap bills to ward off an uncertain swine flu pandemic rather than using taxes for unsubstantiated threats from the CDCs national vaccine marketing campaign .

Microsoft has been issuing takedown notices for publicly hosting its leaked Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor ( COFEE ) tool .
The company sent off " Demand for Immediate Take - Down : Notice of Infringing Activity " to companies hosting websites that offered the tool .
The e-mails all start with the following standard statement : " Microsoft has received information that the domain listed above , which appears to be on servers under your control , is offering unlicensed copies of , or is engaged in other unauthorized activities relating to copyrighted works published by Microsoft . "
One of the websites that received legal threats from Redmond is Cryptome.org , a great repository for information about freedom of speech , cryptography , spying , and surveillance .
According to e-mail correspondences posted on Cryptome , Microsoft contacted Network Solutions , which hosts Cryptome , and since John Young , the owner of the website , was n't too keen on losing his whole website for the sake of a single 15 MB file , he removed the download link and sent Network Solutions a notice of compliance .
Every single Microsoft application that leaks out to the Web is available on BitTorrent networks and various underground corners of the Internet , and Microsoft can't really take care of all of them , though this move is consistent with the company 's promise to pursue unauthorized distribution of its code .
Of course , a few takedown notices will do little against those who really want to get their hands on the tool , though it will make it a tad harder to get at for those who are not very tech - savvy .
Microsoft first revealed the tool back in April 2008 , and in April 2009 , the company announced that it will aid global law enforcement in fighting cybercrime by providing its COFEE tool free of charge to International Criminal Police Organization 's ( Interpol ) Global Security Initiative ( GSI ) , a project that addresses international security challenges , and the participating 187 countries .
Microsoft managed to keep the lid tightly sealed until earlier this month , when pirates decided it was time to leak the tool to the Web and let more than just government crime - fighters use it .
The COFEE application uses common digital forensics tools to help law enforcement officials at the scene of a crime gather volatile evidence of live computer activity that would otherwise be lost in a traditional offline forensic analysis .
In other words , it lets officers grab data from password - protected or encrypted sources .
The forensics tool works best with Windows XP but Microsoft is working on a new version of COFEE for next year that fully supports Windows Vista and Windows 7 .

Législation : Les négociations sur le « paquet télécoms » européen sont arrivées à leur terme .
Le principe de la coupure de l'accès Internet pour sanctionner le téléchargement illégal est approuvé mais encadré .
L’Europe a finalement dit « oui » à la coupure d’accès Internet , sanction prévue par la loi française Hadopi 2 pour punir les internautes coupables de téléchargement illégal et récidivistes .
Il s’agit en fait d’un « oui mais … » qui encadre cette mesure coercitive a priori et a posteriori .
A priori en posant « le respect du principe de la présomption d'innocence » , et en exigeant « une procédure préalable juste et impartiale , incluant le droit d'être entendu pour la ou les personnes concernées ».
A posteriori en instaurant le droit à une révision du dossier par un juge .

L'amendement 138 enterré
Les eurodéputés ont donc choisi la voie du compromis en enterrant le conflictuel amendement 138 qui érigeait l'accès à Internet en droit fondamental ne pouvant être restreint « sans décision préalable des autorités judiciaires ».
Désormais , cette question de savoir qui d’un juge ou de l’Hadopi aura le pouvoir d’appliquer les sanctions ne se pose plus , l’Hadopi 2 ayant de toute façon déjà choisi le recours au juge .
Ce compromis européen ouvre la voie à la riposte graduée en France mais également dans d’autres pays et notamment en Angleterre .
Un projet de loi contre le téléchargement illégal qui instaure la riposte graduée y entrera en vigueur en avril 2010 .
Si au terme d’une période d’un an , le téléchargement illégal n’aura pas baissé de façon drastique , la coupure de l’accès Internet sera alors appliquée aux récidivistes .

Looks like the new Japanese Government formed under Hatoyama - san have started a blog on Ameba .
There is an official editor for the blog talking about major issues of the day .
Ameba operate a blogging platform hosting all the sites in a similar fashion to wordpress.com and do n’t offer any self - hosted options like the wordpress.org software .
It is interesting that the Government has decided to entrust its information to a third party operator , that they have no control over whether the business continues or not .
Their choice of Ameba may have been due to the number of celebrities and artists who host a blog on Ameba .
It is certainly a big plus for Cyber Agent who run Ameba .
I set up a blog on Ameba for shibuya 246 a while ago but never actually put any content on it .
I also have a space on Mixi as well .
Maybe now that Hatoyama - san is blogging on Ameba it might be time to start myself .
Do you blog or read any Japanese language networks ?
How do you find them compared to English language blog networks ?

DETROIT ( CNNMoney.com ) --
At 1300 E. Warren St. , you can smell the plight of Detroit .
Inside the Wayne County morgue in midtown Detroit , 67 bodies are piled up , unclaimed , in the freezing temperatures .
Neither the families nor the county can afford to bury the corpses .
So they stack up inside the freezer .
Albert Samuels , chief investigator for the morgue , said he has never seen anything like it during his 13 years on the job .
" Some people do n't come forward even though they know the people are here , " said the former Detroit cop .
" They do n't have the money . "
Lifelong Detroit residents Darrell and Cheryl Vickers understand this firsthand .
On a chilly September morning they had to visit the freezer to identify the body of Darrell 's aunt , Nancy Graham -- and say their goodbyes .
The couple , already financially strained , do n't have the $ 695 needed to cremate her .
Other family members , mostly in Florida , do n't have the means to contribute , either .
In fact , when Darrell 's grandmother passed recently , his father paid for the cremation on a credit card -- at 21 % interest .
So the Vickers had to leave their aunt behind .
Body number 67 .
" It 's devastating to a family not to be able to take care of their own , " said Darrell .
" But there 's really no way to come up with that kind of cash in today 's society .
There 's just no way . "
The number of unclaimed corpses at the Wayne County morgue is at a record high , having tripled since 2000 .
The reason for the pile - up is twofold :
One , unemployment in the area is approaching 28 % , and many people , like the Vickers , can't afford last rites ; two , the county 's $ 21,000 annual budget to bury unclaimed bodies ran out in June .
" One way we look back at a culture is how they dispose of their dead , " said the county 's chief medical examiner , Carl Schmidt , who has been in his position for 15 years .
" We see people here that society was not taking care of before they died -- and society is having difficulty taking care of them after they are dead . "
Detroit is not alone .
The Los Angeles coroner 's office said it , too , has seen an increase in the number of bodies abandoned .
That 's not surprising at a time when unemployment tops 10 % in many cities and the median cost of a funeral in America hovers around $ 7,000 .
Cremation can cost $ 2,000 .
Little help available
This is an issue of concern , said the Detroit mayor 's office , but the city can't afford to offer any assistance .
" The failure , through inability or choice , to bury the deceased is a reflection of the economic conditions that have arrested this region , where people are now forced to make emotionally compromised choices , " said a spokesman in a prepared statement .
The state , however , does have some funds available to assist with burial costs .
For fiscal year 2009 , Michigan allocated $ 4.9 million for assistance , and of that , approximately $ 135,500 remains .
Those in need of assistance can find grant applications at Michigan Department of Human Services offices , most funeral homes , and at Michigan. gov / dhs .
The Vickers did not know about the funds until CNNMoney notified them .
But , fortunately , they were eventually able to scrape together the $ 695 and will be able to cremate their aunt with help from Social Security , social services and their aunt 's church .
The way Darrell sees it , the stimulus package should have helped people in situations like this , rather than to " spark the economy and sell cars .
We can't take care of our own when it comes to laying them to rest and letting them rest in peace . "
' Reflection of the economy '
Believe it or not , the Vickers are among the fortunate .
Dozens of other bodies remain , some never identified .
And they can't be disposed of until their families come forward or the county 's burial fund is replenished when the 2010 budget is approved .
There were 66 bodies before Aunt Nancy's , and they 'll be interred on a first - arrived - first - buried basis .
" There are many people with sad lives , " said Schmidt .
" But it is even sadder when even after you are dead , there is no one to pick you up . "
And in a town with so much need , Schmidt noted one more cause for concern :
The increase in unclaimed bodies is not due to an increase in murders -- though the rate remains high -- but due to natural causes .
Schmidt speculated that many of the deceased did n't have health insurance or could no longer afford medication for the chronic medical conditions .
" If anything is a reflection of the economy , that is a reflection of the economy , " he said .
But this messy reality is shielded behind the Wayne County morgue 's perfectly trimmed hedges and pristine brick walls .
" I feel sadness because I can recall when it [ Detroit ] was really booming , " said investigator Samuels .
" I do n't think a lot of people are really aware that these types of things are happening in such a wide area . "
Kurt Vonnegut 's 26th book , " Armageddon in Retrospect , " a collection of unpublished essays and stories , with illustrations and a personal letter from the author , was published posthumously in 2008 .
The second posthumous book from the author is " Look at the Birdie , " which contains 14 unpublished early stories , illustrations and a letter from Vonnegut at age 29 .
Which raises the question :
How many more packaged books can we expect from the Vonnegut family vault ?
Given how celebrated Vonnegut is for writing such masterful works as " Cat 's Cradle " and " Slaughterhouse - Five , " one wonders if this latest , lesser book is necessary .
In the book 's foreword , Sidney Offit points out that the " stories selected for this collection are reminiscent of the entertainments " of the '50s and early '60s .
Indeed , the landscape is crowded with artifacts of that era : phonographs , newsboys , talk of the " Russians " and a door - to - door salesman .
Even the story " FUBAR " - or " fouled up beyond all recognition " - has its definition bleached to fit midcentury mores .
Fuzz Littler , public relations supervisor , spends " his fubar days " working for a company that has 527 buildings .
He 's reassigned to Building 523 , " the company gym , " where among the swimming pool and bowling alley he responds to " foolish and rambling " letters .
Enter Francine , a typist fresh from the Girl Pool , who saves Fuzz from his job , and himself .
Despite the antiquated tone of these early fictions , most do include glimmers of Vonnegut 's trademark wit , humor and morality .
His transgressors always get punished .
The decent are rewarded .
And at times his cutting observations are on full display : " While bachelors are lonely people , I 'm convinced that married men are lonely people with dependents . "
The book 's longest " entertainment " - " Ed Luby 's Key Club " - unfortunately reads like a B - grade noir film .
In it , a couple pays a visit to the town of Ilium , which is controlled by rich , powerful Ed Luby , " a vicious old man , absolutely bald , short and heavy , built like a .45 - caliber slug . "
Luby kills a prostitute and blames the murder on the naive twosome .
Harve , the husband , then escapes from jail by simply running out the door .
It 's a flippant caper , and the collection 's longest .
Vonnegut thankfully nails the character descriptions , " their faces as undistinguished as two cheap pies , " even as the plot sputters and unravels :
Harve jumps aboard a moving train , hops off , finds a distant farmhouse , then gets taken hostage by a shotgun - wielding man .
Near the end , he 's escorted to the hospital where , to assist the final surprise , " truth serum " is administered .
There are similar false notes , too , such as the bloated first line of the opener , " Confido " : " The Summer had died peacefully in its sleep , and Autumn , as soft - spoken executrix , was locking life up safely until Spring came to claim it . "
In other words , the story begins during the fall .
These tales run the gamut , from science fiction to domestic yarns , from the facile to the sure - footed .
It seems that Vonnegut is working out the kinks in these early attempts .
And when he does hit a note well , he hits it just right .
" Little Drops of Water , " laced with insight and maturity , is the collection 's strongest .
Larry Whiteman , a bachelor baritone singer , seduces young women while giving them voice lessons .
When he tires of them , he breaks up by making them graduate .
" The cue for graduation was the pupil 's overt use of the word marriage . "
Along comes the appropriately named Ellen Sparks , who refuses to " detach " from Larry after graduation .
Smitten , then scorned , Ellen grinds her way into Larry 's life by sending him postcards , honking her horn outside his apartment and " rattling the garbage can at bedtime . "
" All of her annoyances were regular , predictable , which made it very easy for Larry to assimilate them into the clockwork of his life and ignore them . "
Bit by bit , these drops of water soon form grooves in Larry 's daily life .
And the moment she withholds these small annoyances , " the die is cast , " and Larry begins to miss her terribly .
What 's interesting , and educational , about " Look at the Birdie " is the glimpse it gives us of Vonnegut 's early development .
This volume speaks to the power of artistic maturation .
Writers improve with time , with dedication , with age .
When reading these stories , even with their blemishes , the biggest thrill is the knowledge that this young author would later produce some of the most innovative and memorable books of the 20th century .

On one of the Galapagos islands whose finches shaped the theories of a young Charles Darwin , biologists have witnessed that elusive moment when a single species splits in two .
In many ways , the split followed predictable patterns , requiring a hybrid newcomer who 'd already taken baby steps down a new evolutionary path .
But playing an unexpected part was chance , and the newcomer singing his own special song .
This miniature evolutionary saga is described in a paper published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
It 's authored by Peter and Rosemary Grant , a husband - and - wife team who have spent much of the last 36 years studying a group of bird species known collectively as Darwin 's finches .
The finches — or , technically , tanagers — have adapted to the conditions of each island in the Galapagos , and they provided Darwin with a clear snapshot of evolutionary divergence when he sailed there on the HMS Beagle .
The Grants have pushed that work further , with decades of painstaking observations providing a real - time record of evolution in action .
In the PNAS paper , they describe something Darwin could only have dreamed of watching : the birth of a new species .
The species ' forefather was a medium ground finch , or Geospiza fortis , who flew from a neighboring island to the Grants ' island of Daphne Major , and into their nets , in 1981 .
He " was unusually large , especially in beak width , sang an unusual song " and had a few gene variants that could be traced to another finch species , they wrote .
This exotic stranger soon found a mate , who also happened to have a few hybrid genes .
The happy couple had five sons .
In the tradition of finches , for whom songs are passed from father to son and used to serenade potential mates , the sons learned their immigrant father 's tunes .
But their father 's vocalizations were strange : he 'd tried to mimick the natives , but accidentally introduced new notes and inflections , like a person who learns a song in a language he does n't understand .
These tunes set the sons apart , as did their unusual size .
Though they found mates , it may only have taken a couple generations for the new lineage to ignore — or be ignored by — local finches , and breed only with each other .
The Grants could n't tell for certain when this started , but they were certain after four generations , when a drought struck the island , killing all but a single brother and sister .
They mated with each other , and their children did the same .
No exact rule exists for deciding when a group of animals constitutes a separate species .
That question " is rarely if ever asked , " as speciation is n't something that scientists have been fortunate enough to watch at the precise moment of divergence , except in bacteria and other simple creatures .
But after at least three generations of reproductive isolation , the Grants felt comfortable in designating the new lineage as an incipient species .
The future of the species is far from certain .
It 's possible that they 'll be out - competed by other finches on the island .
Their initial gene pool may contain flaws that will be magnified with time .
A chance disaster could wipe them out .
The birds might even return to the fold of their parent species , and merge with them through interbreeding .
But whatever happens , their legacy will remain :
New species can emerge very quickly — and sometimes all it takes is a song .

Brandon Keim's Twitter stream and reportorial outtakes ; Wired Science on Twitter .
Brandon is currently working on a book about ecosystem and planetary tipping points .
They said little to each other , the president and the grieving father .
The two faced each other in a large room in the chapel building , where other families quietly sat in small groups .
In the early morning darkness , when most of the country was asleep , 18 caskets were taken off a giant C - 17 cargo plane .
One of them belonged to Steve Weston ’s son , Michael , a Drug Enforcement Administration special agent killed in Afghanistan days earlier .

A military representative introduced each group in turn , and aides could see the president in quiet conversation as he clasped women by the hand or laid his hand on men ’s shoulders .
“ It was the saddest room I ’ve ever been in ; 18 grieving families from all walks of life , ” Weston said .
“ It hurt so badly , and here he is , trying to offer comfort .
And I respect him for that . ”
On Thursday , President Obama flew nearly 100 miles by helicopter to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to witness the return of the caskets -- the first time he has made the trip since becoming commander in chief nine months ago .
His visit came at a critical moment in the conflict in Afghanistan -- taking place during the deadliest month for U.S. troops since the war began in 2001 .

The American general in charge of U.S. and allied forces there is calling for a big increase in troops -- possibly 40,000 or more .
Obama is taking his time making a decision , drawing sharp criticism that his lack of action is imperiling the U.S. mission .
At the same time , the specter of a long war with many more deaths hangs over him .
On Thursday , he took a few hours to witness its ultimate cost .
President George W. Bush never went to Dover for the return of war dead .
He conveyed his message by meeting elsewhere with the parents , spouses and children of the war dead -- events that were quiet and private , but frequent enough that word of them became a consistent part of the public story about Iraq .

Obama has also paid less - publicized visits to family members .
But the Dover moment was different , in part because the “ dignified transfer ” ceremonies had until recently been off limits to the media by Pentagon rule for almost two decades .
Thousands of fallen troops have returned to their families via C - 17 over the course of the last eight years .
Two days ago , the president had told an aide he wanted to be present to witness the transfer of those killed this week .
Late Wednesday , White House officials began preparing for the travel and , shortly after midnight , Obama arrived on the base .
Michael Weston , 37 , was one of three DEA agents killed in a helicopter crash Monday .
He had been deployed with troops on a drug raid in northwestern Afghanistan .
The agents were the first from the DEA to fall in the line of duty in the Central Asian country , underscoring the multifaceted nature of the drug - fueled insurgency .

The elder Weston , a lawyer from Lake Arrowhead , Calif. , was accompanied by his first wife , Judy , and his son ’s wife , Cindy .
She married Michael in May , just weeks before he shipped off for Afghanistan .
The proud father wanted Obama to know that the younger Weston had something in common with the president .
“ I said , ‘ Mr. President , my son went to Harvard Law School just like you did , ’ ” Weston said .
He described his son as a patriot who held off getting married because of his commitments , first as a Marine major doing several tours of duty in Iraq and other war zones , and then to the DEA .

After his last stint in Iraq in 2007 , Weston retired from the Marines and worked the streets of Richmond , Va. , as a drug agent , developing sources , conducting surveillance and building cases .
Given his Ivy League law degree and his military service , his son had been aggressively recruited by both the CIA and the FBI , but he picked the DEA instead , Steve Weston said .
“ He thought he ’d have more opportunity to go face to face with the bad guys , ” the elder Weston said .
And when the DEA began deploying dozens more agents to Afghanistan , Weston pestered his superiors until he received one of the slots .
Also killed Monday were Special Agents Forrest Leamon , 37 , and Chad Michael , 30 .

After meeting with the families , Obama watched as men in white gloves carried the caskets from a transport plane into mortuary vans .
Around 4 a.m. , Obama ’s helicopter took off for the return flight to the White House .
The first thing the president usually does on his night helicopter rides is flick on his overhead light , a sign for aides to lean in and talk business .
But as the Black Hawk blades whirred into motion , he left the light off .

“ He just looked out the window or stared straight ahead , ” said one person who sat near the president for the ride .
“ Nobody said anything . ”

[ Thanks to Madeline T. , Anne Marie , Therese S. , and Drugmnky for the screencap ! ]
Gee , what could possibly be wrong with calling this dress “ flesh - colored ” ?
This is what happens when white people are considered people and black people are considered a special kind of people , black people .
“ Flesh - colored ” becomes the skin color associated with whites and darker - skinned peoples are left out of the picture altogether .
We see this all the time .
Bandaids , for example , are typically light beige ( though they rarely call them “ flesh - colored ” anymore ) , as are things like ace bandages .
See our post on “ flesh - colored ” for these examples and more .
See also this post on lotion for “ normal to darker skin . ”
For contrast , see this post about how the generic human in Russian cartoons is colored black instead of white .

Thank you very much for your responce .
We thought the same thing to use USER_DEPENDENCIES .
You are right , we dont have access to the production machine .
It is a very big project , so many modules / layers / releases and we 'll always maintain last 3 releases in production ( end users can access any release ) .
People created some new objects for new designs and some how they forgot to drop old and unused objects .
Thanks again !!

Responding to Randy's Post August 12 , 2002 - 5:19 pm UTC Reviewer : Shrek from MD IMHO :
No access on Production -- no problem
( no SELECT only also , some queries can really
affect performance )
Test ( QA , Demo , or similar )
Limited access through roles ,
or execute privileges on packages OR as needed basis
Development :
I think the developers need Connect , Resource , definitely PLUSTRACE , and some other privileges / roles on an as needed basis .
Because they Can't do squat without it , and they need a destructive test env .
Therefore , run in ARCHIVELOG mode , and give developers full freedom
On a separate note :

I 've used SQL * Impact for this sort of thing , as it can pick references to SQL from batch code , forms etc .
You 'd probably need some idea of where to start looking .
While SQL * Impact does have reports for ' unused ' columns and other anomalies , nothing will help if you 've got a form using a table when no - one ever uses the form .

Easy .
I 've experienced the following
Make your documentation ' development ' focused ( ie ' create a procedure to mail clients latest offer ' as opposed to ' Procedure MAIL_CLIENT is used during the annual STOCKTAKE reconciliation process ...' ) .
All too common .
In one case , the documentation was discarded after the development as it had served its purpose .
Make it impossible for developers to keep documentation up to date ( " You ca n't change it .
It 's already been signed off . " )
Especially applies to updates by support staff , often with the excuse that ' they only fix the code so the design wo n't be changed '
Do n't have any procedures for dropping objects and programs , etc out of the application environment .
Or just make it so hard that no - one bothers .
Do n't differentiate between code written for a one - off task ( eg data conversion ) and regular , repeated , processing .
Script to find procedures / functions not being called January 12 , 2006 - 3:29 am UTC Reviewer : Mobra from Norway Hi Tom ,
I 've made this quick script to find code in a package that 's not being used anywhere ( in the same package or other packages ) .
[ Note : Of course any public routine might be called from a client , but we have a naming convention that allows us to filter out these from the results . ]
The script works by first finding and extracting all the function / procedure names within a single package , then looking through all the user 's code ( user_source ) to see if this function / procedure is being called .
This code works , but it 's quite slow .
The question is :
Is there a way to optimize the second query ?
I 've tried with a first_rows hint , but it did not appear to make much difference .
declare
l_proc_used boolean := false ;
l_proc_name varchar2 ( 255 ) ;
cursor l_proc_cursor is
select trim( replace ( replace ( lower ( text ) , ' procedure ' , '' ) , ' function ' , '' ) ) proc_name
from user_source
where ( lower ( text ) like '% procedure %'
or lower ( text ) like '% function %' )
and name = ' MY_PACKAGE_PKG '
and type in ( ' PACKAGE BODY ' ) ;
cursor l_src_cursor ( p_proc_name in varchar2 ) is
select /*+ first_rows ( 1 ) */ 'x '
from user_source
where lower ( text ) like ' %' || p_proc_name || '% '
and lower ( text ) not like ' % end ' || p_proc_name || '% '
and lower ( text ) not like '% procedure ' || p_proc_name || '% '
and lower ( text ) not like '% function ' || p_proc_name || '% ' ;
l_src_rec l_src_cursor%rowtype ;
function strip_params ( p_proc in varchar2 ) return varchar2
as
l_returnvalue varchar2 ( 255 ) ;
begin
l_returnvalue:=trim(copy_str(p_proc , 1 , instr( p_proc , '( ' ) - 1 ) ) ;
return l_returnvalue ;
end strip_params ;
begin
for l_proc_rec in l_proc_cursor loop
l_proc_name:=strip_params ( l_proc_rec.proc_name ) ;
l_proc_used : =false ;
open l_src_cursor ( l_proc_name ) ;
fetch l_src_cursor
into l_src_rec ;
l_proc_used:=l_src_cursor%found ;
close l_src_cursor ;
if l_proc_used = false then
dbms_output.put_line (' Procedure / function ' || l_proc_name || ' is NOT in use ...' ) ;
end if ;
end loop ;

what is the point ?
so I have a procedure not called by anyother procedure - so ?

It does NOT mean it is not in use , it just means someone is calling it from the client directly .

January 14 , 2006 - 4:25 am UTC Reviewer : Mobra from Norway ... to be able to find " dead code " .
Like I mentioned in the first post , we have a
naming convention that allows us to see ( or filter out ) functions and procedures that are called directly from the client .
Which means that any remaining functions / procedures in packages ( including subroutines private to a package ) that are not being called , are not being used any more ( " dead code " ) and can / should be removed .
The script supplied finds such code , the question was :
Is there a way to optimize the second query ( second cursor ) so that the script runs faster ?
Followup January 15 , 2006 - 3:23 pm UTC
I do n't know .... I 've never tried .
It seems that if you have to search for dead code , well , you only need to do that once ( so what if it goes slow once ) since you 'll obviously put into place the necessary documentation framework in the future to avoid the issue :)
Guess if I had to do it , I would put the names of the procedures / functions into a collection or temporary table and then select out everything that was n't in the rest ( instead of running a query per function / procedure , run a single query that returns likely ones ) but again , I just plain would n't do it - dead code ?
if you have a serious problem with dead code over and over and over and over and over again , you need to fix the cause - not the effect .
Your approach is fairly hit or miss as it is ( procedure names embedded in other procedure names - you look across ALL packages instead of just one ) ...
But , if I had to do this for whatever reason , I 'd go for the " query " route : ops$tkyte@ORA10GR2 > create or replace package foo 2 as 3 procedure p1 ; 4 procedure p2 ; 5 end ; 6 / Package created .
ops$tkyte@ORA10GR2 > ops$tkyte@ORA10GR2 > create or replace package body foo 2 as 3 4 procedure p1 5 is 6 begin 7 p2 ; 8 end ; 9 10 procedure p2 11 is 12 begin 13 p1 ; 14 end ; 15 16 procedure p3 17 is 18 begin 19 null ; 20 end ; 21 22 end ; 23 / Package body created .

Unused Procedures January 24 , 2006 - 5:07 am UTC Reviewer : Pradikan from INDIA Hi Tom ,
We are having a lot of procedures / packages ( approx - 5000 ) , which are used for various applications .
The point is that we want to eliminate procedures / packages which were unused for a long time .
Is there any tool which identified these procedures / packages , which we can delete from the database .
Also wanted to know about any automated tool which identifies junk code ( code which is of no use to the actual requirement ) in these procedures ..
Please let me know
Thanks in advance

Can we declare an existing proc ' INVALID ' September 08 , 2009 - 11:12 am UTC Reviewer : Alex from London , UK Tom ,
Documentation does not solve the problem completely .
We did create some of our 1300 procs for different releases of different apps ( we have 8 apps ) .
The releases have gone out and have been superceeded by the new code by now .
But you cannot realistically track what is used and what is not .
You can answer the question ' is this proc definitely used ' for any proc by spending 30 minutes of your time but you cannot do this ' in bulk ' for all the procs .
I can say that a proc is not used ' with 95 % confidence ' .
But before dropping it I would like to cover the rest 5 % .
And the only reliable way to find out is to ask oracle in some way if the proc was called or not over specified period of time ...
I was thinking of something like ' ALTER procname UNCOMPILE ' .
That would make perfectly valid procs INVALID .
Unfortunately there is no such option .
If I were to do this for all the procs which I suspect are not used , I will be able to come back in a months time and see which ones have been called and are valid now .

Much of the rest of the world can - it is called documentation .

For you see , you will wait six months - then since no one used it for six months , you will drop it .
However , at six months plus one day - I WILL USE THE FUNCTION / FEATURE OF YOUR APPLICATION THAT INVOKES THIS FUNCTION .
Now what .
You cannot just sit back and watch for things that are not " run " and then drop them .
That is beyond naive .
Tell you what , since your developers keep track of nothing , ignore the code .
just ignore it .
Why worry about getting rid of it ?
Just IGNORE THE EXISTENCE OF IT , pretend it is all used and just live with it .
What goal do you have by dropping it ?
what would you gain ( NOTHING ) ?
what would you lose ( probably code that is actually necessary ) .
Just ignore it .
I wo n't comment on this any more .
Just ignore it if you wo n't take the time to actually inventory what is used where , for which versions and why / when it is used .
If you can be sloppy in one place , you can do so anywhere - so just ignore it , it is not hurting you anymore than you already hurt .

Monitoring dead objects
September 09 , 2009 - 10:55 pm UTC Reviewer : John Lim from Malaysia Hi ,
We have the same problem that some people have created 3000 tables over a period of 10 + years that no one is sure is in use any more .
At first , we were planning to use turn on audit and track it to clean it up , then we came up with the idea of using Oracle 10 g 's AWR and using the log of sql's like this to find out all table accesses :
select
timestamp ,
p.object_owner owner ,
p.object_name name ,
p.operation opn ,
p.options options ,
( EXECUTIONS_TOTAL ) recent_execs ,
dbms_lob.substr(t.sql_text , 4000 ) sqltxt
from
dba_hist_sql_plan p
join dba_hist_sqlstat s on p.sql_id = s.sql_id
join dba_hist_sqltext t on t.sql_id=p.sql_id
where p.operation= ' TABLE ACCESS ' /* HOW ABOUT MAT VIEWS -- not sure -- check */
order by
2,3,6,1
We intend to log AWR for 3 + months and then do the purge of all tables not in the AWR listing .
We are in the first month of logging .
Is this a good idea , or did we miss something ?

I think that it helps people 's perspective to see how things are done at the high reliability end of the software engineering spectrum , and as Oracle developers we 're in a great position for this as our primary programming language , PL / SQL , is derived from ADA .
SPARK is an ADA - based language that has been used to deliver extremely reliable software , with less than one error for every 10,000 lines of delivered code (
So , start by having a look at this link :
/*
|| :META : selects employee
|| :META : inserts employee
|| :META : updates department
|| :META : updates address
|| :META : calls is_number
|| :META : calls log_entry
|| :META : calls dbms_application_info
|| :META : changes global_counter
*/
Try doing that for SQL statements also , and include a unique name while you 're at it ...
/*
|| :META : name update_employee_job_title
|| :META : updates employee
|| :META : selects employee
|| :META : selects department
|| :META : uses regexp
*/
People look at these issues and think " But it 'll take forever ! " and mope around like sullen teenagers prevaricating over picking up clothes from their bedroom floor , but you know what ?
It takes maybe a minute , maybe 30 seconds per statement .
Anyway , when you commit yourself to putting that in code it 's probably pretty easy to tell if someone has n't done it , and this will be checked this in the code reviews that someone who does n't like you ( ideally ) will be doing .
Not fool proof .
Not a 100 % solution to the " what code does what " problem .
But if it has value then give it a go , and in a year 's time maybe someone will be saying " Wow , that null job title bug was sure easy to track down .
Thanks goodness Jim is such a professional ! " .

I would agree with you and we tried to tell the customer this several times .
But the customer thinks differently ...
These tables were not created by us , but they want it " fixed " during a migration to new database server that we have been employed to carry out , and we are trying to solve this issue without too much overhead .
We were afraid that table audit would take eat up too much disk space .
As this seems to be the way to go , we will turn on table audit as you suggested .

removing unused tables : May 23 , 2010 - 10:32 pm UTC Reviewer : Jeemon from Singapore I think the views dba_tab_modifications / all_tab_modifications views

why - they report
a ) only for modifications
b ) only when the modifications exceed some threshold
c ) are emptied when we feel like emptying them
that is , a single row inserted every now and then - would n't show up .
Or it might show up and then disappear because statistics were gathered .
I 'll still say " this is a really dumb idea " .

Unused Objects -- V$DB_OBJECT_CACHE
August 27 , 2013 - 9:49 am UTC Reviewer : Amit from UK Hello Tom ,
Thanks for your points , based on that I 'm able to convince my client to leave dead object removal activity .
Just curious to know whether v$DB_OBJECT_CACHE will serve the purpose to find object not being used for a long time , may be if we collect the OBJECT information from this view , 3 - 5 times daily for for 6 - 12 months , then can we say that we have all the objects which have been used and rest are unused ones .
Best Regards

Dear Richard , I am a great admirer of the eloquent yet simple advice you give on Friendly Atheist .
I have been “ out ” as an atheist for about one year now .
I work in a Divinity Faculty , where I am surrounded by liberal , thoughtful , sophisticated religious believers , and recently I have been having thoughts about becoming an ordained minister in the Anglican Church .
I feel that this job would give me personal fulfillment and allow me to do what I really want to do in my life , which is to , well , ‘ minister ’ to people ’s needs , to be there for them in the hard times and help them celebrate the good times .
I believe that religion does not have to be about beliefs , but actions , that it can be a force for good rather than hatred , and that “ God ” can be useful as a symbol which can provide many different meanings and frameworks for different people .
I also believe that I would perhaps be more use to the furthering of reason and tolerance if I were within ‘ the system ’ , promoting religious moderation than simply being an outsider .
My question is : should I pursue this career path , whilst remaining an atheist ( or a ‘ theological non-realist ’ to give it a ‘ theologically acceptable ’ term ) ?
I would greatly appreciate your advice on this issue , and I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Best wishes , Conflicted
Dear Conflicted ,
You ’ve expressed two goals that you would like to accomplish in your life .
One is to “ attend to the wants and needs of others , to give aid or service , ” which is one of the definitions of the verb “ to minister . ”
Most people would agree that that is a very noble and admirable desire .
Your other goal is to bring about positive change in the church , making it more responsive to a wider range of people ’s needs , and to improve its influence on society ; to in a way , humanize it .
Many people would approve of that as well .
However , your proposed method poses some ethical and pragmatic difficulties .
It is n’t clear from your letter , but I ’m going to assume that if you were to apply to the ministry , you would do so openly as an atheist , just as you are now at your workplace .
I ’m assuming this because I think you know you would n’t be able to cover up your lack of belief for very long .
There are clerics who become free of their faith while they are ministering to their flocks .
Many leave the clergy , some famously , because they cannot abide the conflict of promoting and reassuring beliefs in others that they no longer hold for themselves .
They see it as hypocrisy , and it is too painful for them .
An unknown number of these people continue on in their ministry as secret apostates , keeping up a deception for either selfish or noble reasons .
Perhaps they just want to keep their jobs , or perhaps they want to keep on helping others somehow , “ ministering ” in that decent and generous meaning of the verb to which you aspire .
Being secretive about your atheism would pose ethical problems , and being open about your atheism would pose pragmatic problems .
Concealing it would require lying .
That by itself is an ethical breach that should not be acceptable to a person who wants to be a professional helper in any capacity .
Hiding it would most likely also cause injury to others .
Since people look to their ministers for ethical guidance and moral modeling as well as spiritual solace , a closet atheist minister would be running a serious risk of implanting terrible cynicism , bitterness and deep hurt in those who trust in him , once the truth eventually comes out .
Because eventually , it always does .
Being open about your atheism might stop you right at the front door of the Anglican seminary or divinity school .
From what I can find in a quick online search , the initial process of “ discernment ” involves intense and intimate examinations by your own personal priest , a discernment committee , a commission on ministry , a Bishop , and perhaps even a mental health professional .
These people will assess the suitability of your intentions , personal history , values , attitudes , ideas , goals ,
and your beliefs .
If you do n’t believe in their god , they may see you as missing an essential prerequisite .
Your openhearted desire to help others and your open - minded desire to bring more breadth , reason and tolerance to the church from the inside may not be enough for them to trust you with either their doctrine or their flock .
Even if you somehow get past all those barriers and become a minister , the hardest questions will come from the people whom you are trying to help .
They will look you in the eyes and say , “ My little girl died today .
Please tell me that she ’s going to heaven . ”
Will you respond with reason , or with the comforting myth they so desperately want to hear you confirm ?
Conflicted , I do n’t want to extinguish your wonderful longing to be of service to others , to “ be there for them in the hard times and help them celebrate the good times ” as you so movingly put it , by only listing reasons why your idea may not work .
Perhaps your experience in the divinity faculty and your knowledge of the Anglican Church is extensive , and you know how you could overcome those pragmatic hurdles .
I ’m certainly no expert on that .
Perhaps you can find ways to reconcile a person ’s desire for a reassuring bedtime story with your rational mind ’s demands to tell them the truth as you see it .
I do n’t pretend to be that wise , but I do n’t assume that no one else is .
Perhaps also , your broad vision of God and religion , and how you could influence the church from the inside toward embracing more reason , tolerance and moderation is somehow attainable .
When people propose lofty aspirations , I never use the word “ impossible ” because thousands of people have personally amazed me .
However , I can point out that you have other options , other venues for helping people on a personal level .
For instance , you sound like you ’d make an excellent counselor .
That is a broad and varied field , and you do n’t necessarily have to specialize too narrowly into one kind of need to fulfill .
It has a challenging and interesting process to qualify , just as would the ministry .
My years as a counselor were immensely fulfilling .
I made a positive difference , and I even saved a few lives .
I still get great pleasure from the little bit of service I can offer with this column .
But if the path of the psy does not appeal to you , there are many other ways that you could find satisfaction as well as sustenance by making the world around you a little better than it was before .
That is the whole point of life for people like you and me ; that we somehow , even in small ways , make a positive difference in others ’ lives .
Use your imagination .
Your generous spirit can be of great value in so many unexpected ways .
Find them all !
Richard
White tigers are rare in the wild because they stand out in the jungle
Two lions at a zoo in the northern Czech Republic have killed a rare white tigress after entering her enclosure .
The incident happened at Liberec Zoo - the only one in the country which has white tigers .
Zoo workers were alerted by the cries of the tigress , but were unable to stop the killing .
White tigers - the result of a recessive gene - find it difficult to catch prey in the wild because their colouration stands out in the jungle .
The lions - Sultan , aged 14 , and Elsa , 11 - managed to open a trap door leading to an open - air area occupied by the 17 - year - old tigress , Isabella .
Surviving daughter
Lions and tigers in the zoo share the same pavilion overnight , which they leave for separate open - air enclosures during the day .
But the open - air enclosures are rotated , and zoo authorities believe the lions were trying to get into the area where they had spent the previous day .
" The current security system has been in place for 12 years and such an accident has never happened before , " said zoo director David Nejedlo .
There are three surviving white tigers at the zoo , including Isabella 's daughter .
The zoo is the oldest in the Czech Republic and was established in 1919 .
Recycling centers across California are closing , and scores of troubled youths are being tossed from “ green ” jobs onto unemployment rolls in the wake of Sacramento ’s raid on bottle deposit funds .
California ’s recycling treasury , filled by consumers ’ nickel and dime deposits on drink containers , had hummed along successfully for two decades until state officials left it nearly bankrupt after taking $ 451 million out to help balance the budget .
The unredeemed deposits that subsidized recycling facilities and such projects as a local conservation corps are virtually gone , leaving the programs in the lurch .
Now operators of recycling depots in many supermarket parking lots are suing the state .
Without the subsidies , Tomra Pacific Inc. , a leading depot company , has closed at least 33 recycling sites -- more than 8 % of its total , said company president Adrian White .

“ Finding a location to recycle is going to get harder , ” White said .
Lacking a nearby redemption center , consumers can return containers to the grocery store .
But the obscure state law permitting that is as unfamiliar to consumers as it is to most store employees .
“ If . . . you have to be in the know just to get your deposit back , ” then the promise at the core of the bottle program -- pay a deposit , get it back when you recycle -- is voided , said Susan Collins , executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Container Recycling Institute .
Beyond the recycling program are the regional conservation groups that employ at - risk youths -- high - school dropouts , former gang members and parolees .
Advertisement
Scott Dosick , spokesman for the California Assn. of Local Conservation Corps , said that the state ’s 12 programs typically employ 4,000 but that cutbacks this year have eliminated roughly 500 of those jobs .
“ We are their last resort , ” Dosick said of corps members .
“ If we lay them off , they ’re pretty much back on the street .
“ Once they ’re gone , ” he said , “ the odds of getting them back are extraordinarily slim . ”
Lawmakers tried last summer to increase deposits or impose new ones on roughly 5 billion drink containers to replenish the recycling fund .
Opponents called the effort a back - door tax increase ; Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it .
On July 1 , the Schwarzenegger administration cut 85 % of the state subsidies , and this month it eliminated them entirely .
Advertisement
White said the governor had cast “ a veto against green jobs . ”
H.D. Palmer , a spokesman for the state ’s Finance Department , said he “ would defy anyone to find a governor in this country more committed to the green jobs agenda than Arnold Schwarzenegger . ”
The governor will propose a plan to refillthe fund in January , when he unveils his next budget proposal , Palmer said .
A hint of the fight to come was in Schwarzenegger ’s veto message , which chastised lawmakers for trying to expand the deposit program without including liquor and wine bottles .
Requiring deposits on those items would pit lawmakers against the powerful alcohol lobby , a major source of political contributions that has scuttled similar efforts in the past .
Advertisement
Schwarzenegger also demanded in his veto message that legislators pass a law forbidding future raids of the deposit fund .
It was Schwarzenegger himself who first proposed taking $ 100 million from the fund in early 2009 .
That struck recycling advocates , such as Californians Against Waste Executive Director Mark Murray , as more than a bit hypocritical .
Murray , in an analysis of the veto , said the governor ’s demand was akin to yelling , “ Save me from myself ! ”

MUMBAI / NEW DELHI : Even as the Atomic Energy Commission confirmed that the contamination of drinking water at the Kaiga atomic plant in Karnataka was an ``inside job ' ' , the heavy water that was introduced into a water cooler has been traced to vials kept in labs within the complex .
( Watch Video )
The heavy water , used as a coolant in the nuclear plant , is collected for lab tests before being released for use .
It is suspected that some vials of heavy water were diverted to ``spike '' the water cooler instead of being released into specified areas .
The heavy water was pushed into the cooler through an outflow pipe as the machine itself is sealed and authorities do not rule out the act of sabotage being carried out by a disgruntled nuclear scientist .
`` The staff who had access to vials and the various points in the chain where the vials could have been diverted are being examined , '' said MoS in PMO , Prithviraj Chavan .
He said all safety related procedures would be thoroughly reviewed and those responsible for the act would be traced .
The government is examining whether there was an intent to sabotage the functioning of the plant or whether a disgruntled individual had played a ``vicious prank ' ' .
The water cooler is located outside the reactor area and was found contaminated by radioactivity on the night of November 24 .
While not ruling out sabotage , senior nuclear scientists emphasized there was no radiation leak in the plant itself as reported in a section of the media .
Outgoing chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission , Anil Kakodkar , who is laying down office on Monday , was quoted as saying that it ``clearly is a malevolent act ' ' .
Sabotage has not been ruled out , he said , adding that somebody had ``deliberately '' put radioactive vials in a water cooler .
The heavy water samples need to be accounted for more carefully in future , sources admitted .
Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen , which is used for research , and in fusion reactors and neutron generators .
The alleged act of sabotage took place a fortnight after intelligence agencies warned of a terrorist attack on the country 's atomic plants .
After the alert , security at all the units had been stepped up .
Years ago , a similar incident took place at the Tarapur atomic power station .
An inquiry was held , leading to the dismissal of an employee .
According to the AEC chief , investigations are now focusing on two angles .
The authorities are working to identify the worker who contaminated the water cooler with tritiated ( or super heavy ) water .
They will also review security aspects related to radiation hazard .
Kakodkar said normally small quantities of tritiated heavy water are tested for chemical parameters .
Speaking to TOI on Sunday , chairman and managing director of Nuclear Power Corporation ( NPC ) , S K Jain , said the water cooler had been padlocked and the person in charge of maintenance on the night of November 24 was being examined .
`` The whole area has computer - accessed control .
So in course of time we will be able to narrow down on the person who did the mischief , '' he said .
``I will certainly describe this as a very serious incident because it has taken place even after we initiated special security checks following the advice of the Intelligence Bureau recently , '' he said .
Asked why any staffer should resort to sabotage , Jain , said he could not rule out a ``small percentage of employees being disgruntled for one reason or the other ' ' .
`` In a place with a manpower strength of nearly 700 , discontent among a small section of workers is inevitable , '' he said .
He said that credentials of workers at the plant are cleared by intelligence agencies prior to their appointment .
In an earlier statement , Jain said there were a number of measures for routine monitoring of radiation exposure of workers at a nuclear power plant .
One of them is urine sampling , in which some samples had indicated contamination .
NPC chief engineer N Nagaich said the water cooler served both Kaiga 1 and 2 units , which are 220 megawatt pressurized heavy water reactors .
Kaiga 1 has been shut for maintenance .
`` Not a single person was hospitalized because their condition was not serious , '' he said .
Kaiga 2 was operating normally .
Preliminary investigations were being conducted by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board and NPC .
Former chairman of AEC , P K Iyengar , told TOI that prima facie it appeared that the primary motive of the employee who contaminated the water cooler was ``merely to create a scare ' ' .
Another former AEC chief , M
R Srinivasan , has called for strengthening of nuclear security .
The reported act of sabotage at Kaiga has triggered speculation among a section of nuclear scientists as to whether it could possibly be a ``dry run ' ' by a disgruntled staffer .
`` By resorting to such mischief he perhaps wanted to gauge the reaction of other employees and the department as a whole , '' a scientist said on condition of anonymity .

CPanel Security
Hosting automation tools make management of server easier and efficient .
CPanel and WHMCS are the most common type of hosting solutions .
As with any hosting solution these tools also need a potential layer of security .
Despite of the various prominent security tools , the hacking activity has increased over the years .
Consequently they have to bear a huge data loss .
The only solution which is offered is ‘ time machine solution ’ allowing them to restore site .
Recently a major backup solution for cloud - based website has been released by Codeguard which is a leading provider of cloud - based backup solutions .
These solutions are easy to integrate with any shared hosting plan .
This can be done without having any deep technical knowledge .
This new introduced service complements the website security tools giving users another layer of security .
Coastguard was first integrated with A Small Orange which is an enterprise - class hosting provider .
Further , there are also few tips which can make CPanel secure :-
Keeping cPanel updated : Keeping CPanel updated may fix bugs in tools .
Sometimes the company introduces a new version with mitigating high - security flaws .

SSL : SSL ( Secure Socket Layer ) is a technology which encrypts data and gives assurance of keeping away data from any intrusion or breach .
SSL certificate adds a security layer and a user can understand if a website is secure or not , by just reading the URL .
If it starts with https then it is SSL enabled site otherwise not .
Now the Google has also announced that those websites who are using SSL will be given preference in indexing as they are considered secure .

Service Monitoring : Services and Daemons are the programs which run when the system boots up and will last up till server is running .
But many of the services are mission critical and if they crash Website can become inoperable leading to a huge business loss .
To save from this situation , the monitoring of service should be enabled .
Monitoring tools keeps track of all your mentioned services .
If any of them crashes abruptly , then it will be restarted automatically at once .
So this tool acts as a safeguard for unexpected abrupt crashes letting user experience less downtime .
This is an ad - hoc solution , not a permanent solution .
If your service crashes often then some severe solutions should be measured .
Security Advisor :
It is recommended to check security advisor regularly for security issues .
Here issues can be classified into four categories :
Red threats :
These are the issue which is needed to be addressed as early as possible to prevent your server from serious intrusion or threat .

Once your task is completed , you must scan server again to ensure that there are no security threats .
Mavizen ’s Electric Motorcycle Has Built - In Wi-Fi , Linux
Mavizen ’s TTX02 electric motorcycle is being dubbed as “ a laptop on wheels ” .
A really , really fast laptop on wheels .
Besides its impressive top speed of 210 km /h , the interesting thing about the bike is that it features a dedicated IP address , on - board web server , WiFi and Linux .
Mavizen is calling the TTX02 a “ laptop on wheels ” , signaling their approach to electric motorcycles via a consumer electronics perspective .
According to Azhar Hussain , TTXGP founder and entrepreneur , the consumer electronics perspective comes from the notion that “ we are living in a click culture and connectivity is the key , across the board .
Our approach was to find how we could make a laptop go racing .
We think electric vehicles have more in common with consumer electronics than traditional automotive . ”
[ imgclear ]
Of course , the “ consumer ” part of all this does n’t necessarily mean you or I will be checking our email flying down the road on this thing .
The bike is going to be produced in a limited 50 - unit run and aimed towards the racing scene — a development platform of sorts that can be used by professionals to customise the bike to fit their needs .
Although I suppose it is not impossible for the average Joe to get their hands on one — if you are willing to pony up the $ US41,300 asking price that is .

The right hammers
Huck over shooting
The conservative blogosphere unleashed a torrent of criticism against Mike Huckabee Monday after a man whose sentence he commuted as Arkansas governor was suspected of gunning down four police officers in Washington state over the weekend .
Maurice Clemmons , whom Huckabee granted clemency to nine years ago , remained at large after local police in Lakewood , Wash .
mistakenly thought they had him trapped in a house early Monday .
Clemmons is reported to have shot the officers as they were sitting at a table in a local coffee shop .

While many details of the murders were still unclear Monday , leading online conservative voices were quick to pass judgment on Huckabee , whose 2008 presidential campaign was forced to respond to accusations that he was too lenient with violent criminals during his years as governor .
“ The man being sought by police was granted clemency by former GOP Arkansas Mike Huckabee despite his violent history and vehement protestations from prosecutors and victims ’ family members , ” wrote conservative Michelle Malkin on her widely read blog .
“ This disaster is just one of Huckabee ’s ill - considered clemency legacies . ”
“ This is n’t Huckabee ’s first Horton moment , ” Malkin continued , referring to the convicted murderer who raped a woman during a weekend furlough program supported by then - Massachusetts governor and later Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis .
Willie Horton was featured prominently in damaging ads from George H.W. Bush ’s presidential campaign painting the Massachusetts Democrat as soft on crime .
On his conservative RedState blog , Erick Erickson wrote that the shooting “ is going to be extremely problematic for Governor Huckabee . ”
“ Of course , a lot of folks said the last guy was Mike Huckabee ’s ‘ Willie Horton , ’ Erickson continued .
“ How many Willie Hortons can one man have ? ”
Huckabee sought to distance himself from Clemmons in a statement posted on his political action committee ’s website late Sunday , blaming “ failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington State . ”
“ This is a horrible and tragic event and if found and convicted the offender should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law , ” Huckabee said .
“ Our thoughts and prayers are and should be with the families of those honorable , brave , and heroic police officers . ”
At the age of 18 , Clemmons was sentenced to 60 years in prison for burglary and theft – a sentence which he was slated to serve in addition to the 48 years he was already serving on five felony counts , including bringing a handgun on school grounds .
Citing Clemmons young age at the time he committed the crimes , Huckabee commuted Clemmons ’ sentence after the convicted felon had served 11 years .
Since getting released on parole , Clemmons has faced additional criminal charges — including at least eight felony charges in Washington , where he moved in 2004 , according to local press accounts .
Few of Huckabee ’s allies — including candidates he has endorsed for the 2010 campaign and his former campaign manager — responded to requests to speak to POLITICO about the fallout from the shooting .
But on conservative blogs , Huckabee came under sustained attack .
Numerous bloggers used the incident to remind readers that the former Arkansas governor faced criticism during the 2008 presidential primary for granting a pardon to convicted rapist Wayne DuMond .
Like Clemmons , DuMond returned to a life of crime , earning a second conviction before dying in prison in 2005 .
Michael Goldfarb , a former aide to Sen. John McCain ’s ( R - Ariz . ) presidential campaign and currently a blogger for the Weekly Standard , said Huckabee has suffered through a “ brutal 24 hours ” since the shooting , which came on the heels of his remarks to Fox News Sunday that he is “ less likely , ” rather than “ more likely , ” to run for president in 2012 .
Goldfarb picked up Malkin ’s criticism , telling POLITICO that the incident is Huckabee ’s “ second Willie Horton . ”
“ It was the worst week Huck ’s had since he lost South Carolina in ’ 08 , ” Goldfarb said .
“ Of course Huckabee could n’t predict that the convict would shoot police officers , but the exercise of executive clemency goes right to judgment in a way that is very clearly understood by voters , ” Ed Morrissey , a widely - read blogger on the conservative site Hot Air , wrote in an email .
“ His primary opponents will use it against him , and I 'd guess that such an attack would be particularly effective with social conservatives . ”
Former Huckabee press aide Joe Carter wrote on the blog for the Institute on Religion and Public Life that the story undercuts the former governor ’s strengths as a candidate .
“ Ironically , what makes Huckabee such an appealing Presidential candidate — his empathy for all people and genuine belief in the individual — is also the trait that will prevent him from ever reaching the White House , ” Carter wrote .
“ His experiences and intuitions that served him well as a minister of the gospel were not always applicable in of governor of a state .
The unfortunate reality is that for politicians , unlike pastors , there are limits to compassion . ”
Conservative blogs were not the only corner of the Internet where Huckabee took a pounding .
The popular Drudge Report website provided a prominent link to a Seattle Times story on Clemmons ’s disturbing criminal history accompanied by the headline , “ Huckabee granted clemency to man wanted for questioning . ”
The former governor ’s Wikipedia entry was altered midday to identify Huckabee in all caps as “ THE IDIOT ” who “ RELEASED THE COP KILLER MAURICE CLEMMONS . ”
Republican operatives and politicians contacted by POLITICO said the incident is already proving to be damaging .
One well - known GOP strategist with presidential campaign experience said the shooting is “ pretty devastating ” to Huckabee ’s political future .
Mark Corallo , a veteran Republican communications consultant , added that since Republicans “ are supposed to be the law and order , tough on crime party – it hurts [ Huckabee ] plenty . ”
While former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney used the DuMond story to attack Huckabee during the bitterly fought presidential primary , none of Huckabee ’s prospective 2012 opponents have singled out the former governor in the wake of the murders .
Spokesmen for Romney , Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich did not respond to requests for comment on Clemmons .
Former Alaska GOP Gov. Sarah Palin , meanwhile , posted a brief message about the shooting on her Twitter feed while stopped in Richland , Wash .
as part of her ongoing book tour , but made no mention of the clemency granted to the suspected shooter .
“ While in Washington state today my heart goes out to the WA police officers gunned down so tragically & senselessly , ” Palin wrote .
“ God comfort the families . ”
A 234 year - old plant known as a cycad apictured t the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew , southwest London .
Botanists at Kew have collected seeds from 10 percent of the world 's wild plants , their first goal in a long - term project to protect all endangered species .
Botanists at Britain 's Kew Gardens have collected seeds from 10 percent of the world 's wild plants , their first goal in a long - term project to protect all endangered species , they said Thursday .
Seeds from a wild , pink banana are among the latest additions to the collection at Kew , southwest London , designed to guard against dwindling diversity .
The banana from China , musa itinerans , is an important staple for wild elephants and is also useful for breeding new types of the fruit , but is under threat as its jungle habitat is cleared for commercial agriculture .
It became the 24,200th species of wild plant with seeds stored in the Millennium Seed Bank , a nine - year - old conservation project run by the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and institutions in 54 countries .
With it the project reaches its target to collect , bank and conserve seeds from 10 percent of the world 's most under - threat wild plant species -- although it is already working towards a new goal of 25 percent of plants by 2020 .
" The success we are celebrating today is extraordinary and on a scale never before contemplated in global biodiversity conservation , " said Professor Stephen Hopper , director of the Royal Botanic Gardens in west London .
" In a time of increasing concern about loss of biodiversity and climate change , Kew 's Millennium Seed Bank partnership provides a real message of hope and is a vital resource in an uncertain world .
" The need for the kind of insurance policy and practical conservation resource Kew 's Millennium Seed Bank provides has never been greater . "
About 60,000 - 100,000 species of plant are threatened with extinction -- a quarter of the total -- largely because of human behaviour , whether through the clearing or over - exploitation of land or climate change , Kew officials say .
The seed partnership -- the largest of its kind in the world -- focuses on collecting those plants most at risk and storing them for future use in conservation or for research .
Since 2000 , more than 3.5 billion seeds have been collected and stored in air - tight containers in the temperature - controlled vaults at Kew 's seed bank near Ardingly , southern England , as well as in their countries of origin .

Struggling to find a little something to be grateful for on this day of Thanksgiving ?
How about the fact that this is n't your laptop ?
While details are a tad sketchy , it seems that the owner of this MacBook Air somehow let his prized possession slip under a bus , which promptly drove right over it .
Amazingly , the Air does apparently still work ( apart from a little issue with the screen ) , although it 's pretty clear that the bus came out ahead in this match - up .

OAKLAND , Calif . 
Near the end of the Jets ’ first victory this October , Coach Rex Ryan grabbed his quarterback , Mark Sanchez .
Together , they drenched Bill Callahan with a cooler full of Gatorade .
Callahan coordinates the Jets ’ rushing attack , which topped 300 yards for the second straight Sunday .
The Jets became the sixth team in N.F.L. history and first since 1975 to deliver such consecutive performances , resulting in a rare shower for an assistant .
The Jets snapped their three - game losing streak by pounding the Raiders , 38 - 0 , and delivering the most lopsided home loss in Oakland history .
But the victory came at a steep price , as the Jets lost Leon Washington for the season with a broken right fibula .
“ What you saw today , this is our formula , ” fullback Tony Richardson said .
“ Great defense .
Run the ball .
The running game is always one of the last things to come along .
But when it does , it ’s a thing of beauty . ”

The latest trend in the Republican Party is an effort to weed out moderates — witness New York Republicans ’ successful effort to oust their own candidate in an upstate House race , in preference for an independent conservative .
But a new GOP “ purity test ” named for Ronald Reagan moves the line even farther to the right , and a liberal website has found that the test — if used in the past — would have screened out President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush as viable conservatives .
ADVERTISEMENT
The test was conceived by conservative attorney Jim Bopp , Jr. , who recently pushed a resolution to the Republican National Committee which proposed referring to the Democratic Party as the “ Democrat Socialist Party . ”
( The proposal was rejected . )
Bopp ’s litmus test , titled the “ Resolution on Reagan ’s Unity Principle for Support of Candidates , ” includes the following guidelines :
(1) Smaller government , smaller national debt , lower deficits and lower taxes by opposing bills like Obama ’s “ stimulus ” bill ( 2 ) Market - based health care reform and oppose Obama - style government run healthcare ; ( 3 ) Market - based energy reforms by opposing cap and trade legislation ; ( 4 ) Workers ’ right to secret ballot by opposing card check ( 5 ) Legal immigration and assimilation into American society by opposing amnesty for illegal immigrants ; ( 6 ) Victory in Iraq and Afghanistan by supporting military - recommended troop surges ; ( 7 ) Containment of Iran and North Korea , particularly effective action to eliminate their nuclear weapons threat ( 8 ) Retention of the Defense of Marriage Act ; ( 9 ) Protecting the lives of vulnerable persons by opposing health care rationing and denial of health care and government funding of abortion ; and ( 10 )
The right to keep and bear arms by opposing government restrictions on gun ownership
Trouble is , the measure would likely have screened out President Ronald Reagan , under whose watch the US deficit ballooned .
The federal deficit mushroomed from 2.7 percent of gross domestic product in 1980 , to 6 percent in 1983 .
Reagan also agreed to a $ 165 billion bailout of Social Security , in contradiction of conservative orthodoxy ( though he did drastically reduce the top income tax brackets for Americans ) .

The Gipper also raised the gasoline tax in 1983 .
George W. Bush would have had trouble too , Washington Monthly notes .
Bush , too , dramatically increased the size of the federal deficit , which was turning surpluses under his predecessor , President Bill Clinton .
He also broke with conservatives on the issue of opposing blanket amnesty for undocumented immigrants .
ADVERTISEMENT
Who else would fail the test ?
Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) , Republicans ’ 2008 presidential nominee , who voted against the Defense of Marriage Act in the Senate , which would have enshrined in federal law a prohibition against same sex marriage benefits .
McCain , however , has n’t been in far - right conservatives ’ good graces for some time .

Are you in a financial rut ?
Do you need some motivation to get you back on your feet and move forward ?
Perhaps you ’ve been trying to build and emergency fund this year and emergencies pop up as quickly as you deposit money into your savings account .
Or , perhaps you ’ve paid off all your debt and ca n’t seem to find the drive and motivation required to move onto your next goal .
Pressing onward is n’t easy , but it must be done to accomplish your financial goals .
Here are 20 tips to fire up your turbo charger , avoid distractions and stay on track !
20 Tips To Turbo Charge Your Financial Goals
Forget what is behind .
We ’ve all experienced financial blunders and made mistakes .
Stop beating yourself up over them !
You ca n’t change what is in the past , but you can impact today and tomorrow .
Move forward to what is ahead .
Know why your blunders and mistakes occurred and make sure you ’ve dealt with the root cause .
Next , step forward and take action on fixing the issue , i.e. , getting on a plan to get out of debt .
Learn from mistakes .
Never forget your mistakes and why you made them .
Forgetting mistakes results in repeating them over again .
Were you tempted to purchase something on credit without the cash to purchase ?
Did you act on the temptation ?
Do you regret it because you ’re now making a monthly payment with high interest ?
Figure out what caused you to act and get it corrected .
Celebrate along the way .
As you make progress , learn to take the time to celebrate .
There are many steps and goals along the journey .
It ’s a long road , so do n’t forget to celebrate the wins and include family and friends .
Find a way to give back .
As you step forward , some will be a step behind .
Do n’t forget what allowed you to move forward and share with others what got you there .
I ’ve found that helping others along the way helps learn and become more motivated towards my own journey .
Ignore the naysayers .
Many will question your methods and ask why .
Dave Ramsey always says that people will think you ’re strange and that usually means you ’re starting to do things right !
The bottom line is that it really does n’t matter what others think or say .
It ’s you underlying values and reasons for the goal that make the difference .
Watch the horizon closely .
Keep an eye out for things that can pull you off track to achieving your goals .
A car that starts making funny noises , an older washer and dryer can all be things that could be on the edge of costing you money .
If you think about them and can plan for them , you can avoid emergency spending .
Educate yourself .
Learn from others and best practices .
A great way to learn is to follow some personal finance blogs , or subscribe to a personal finance publication .
I always like to investigate and explore information that is available based on my current goal .
Invest the right amount of time .
Getting better at playing a sport takes practices .
Improving grades requires studying .
Improving your personal finances takes investment of time in managing your money , but also in learning .
Investing a little bit of time each day adds up to a large return over time .
Do n’t go at it alone .
Make sure you ’re using wise counselors along the way .
Even if you ’re not in trouble , it ’s a good idea to find someone who can hold you accountable to your plan ( other than yourself ) and provide you counsel based on their experience or area of expertise .
Realize when it ’s time to go to plan B .
Paying off debt is important , but if you sense your job might be in jeopardy pausing debt pay off to further build your emergency fund may be required .
The point is that you need to have a plan , but have the flexibility to change your plan based on circumstances .
Reflect often to maintain focus .
It does n’t do any good to lose sight of your plan .
Once your plan for savings or debt reduction is in place , you need to review it often to make sure you ’re following it .
Understand things that have caused you to move off track and take corrective action to mitigate the risk of them occurring again in the future .
Make sure your visions have goals and your goals have plans .
If your vision is to become financially free , determine the goals to get there .
Build a plan to achieve each goal .
If you do n’t have any action steps to take to achieve your goal , you ’re going to have a hard time taking a step forward .
Make it a community affair .
When it comes to getting out of debt or overcoming past financial blunders remember there are many people out there trying to do the same thing .
Hello !
We ’ve all made mistakes .
Connect with a community of people who are traveling the same road and share the same passion .
Find your motivation in God ’s word .
The Bible is full of financial guidance and financial principles .
There are over 2300 scriptures in the Bible related to finances .
Feel down or lost about your money ?
Seek guidance and find peace and security in God ’s money design .
Do n’t talk about it , be about it .
Finally , we ’ve all spent time talking about everything we need to do .
Stop talking about it and take action .
Talking is great when there is action to follow it up .
Talking without action is just a waste of breath .
Take a break .
If all you ’ve done lately is talk about money and personal finance , drop the subject for a while .
Perhaps you ’re burned out and your spouse is too !
You ’re spouse will probably appreciate it and it ’ll help you rest your mind .
Schedule the time to talk about your next objective when it ’s a neutral time , there are no distractions and you can think clearly .
Brainstorm a solution .
Not sure where to do ?
Play a brainstorming game .
Spend 10 minutes writing every single ( unfiltered ) thought or potential solution to your challenge on sticky notes .
Tip : find some friends and family to participate along with you .
Put all the stick notes on the wall when time is up and organize them based on what seems realistic and achievable .
Pick the top 2 - 3 and create action steps associated with them .
Listen to others talk about their situation .
A few times a week I ’ll listen to the Dave Ramsey Show .
Nothing gets me more motivated than hearing people talk about challenges and Dave Ramsey directing them to the right path .
Its powerful hearing so many people talk about how they want to become debt free and overcome their financial struggles .
Tell someone else about what you plan to do .
There is something about making a public commitment .
It helps us live up to our word and avoid the situation of having to tell someone you did n’t do what you said you were going to do .
So , if you say to your friend you ’re going to start a spending plan this month , or get out of debt in one year , be prepared for a follow up question in the near future asking you where you are with your goal !
Now go out there and make it happen !
Cases of swine flu in the UK have almost doubled this week , the Department of Health revealed today , as the outbreak imposes increasing pressure on intensive care beds .
So far 122 people have died after contracting the H1N1 virus and more than 500 are being treated in hospital , of whom 99 are in critical care – the highest figure since the disease emerged .
Children appear to be vulnerable to higher rates of infection .
Emergency planners have , however , downgraded the UK's worst case scenario , calculating this month that as many as 1,000 people could die during the pandemic infection .
Far more of the victims are likely to be younger patients , unlike the normal pattern of seasonal flu , which affects the elderly most severely .
Estimates of likely casualties have come down progressively over the past few months from an initial upper assessment of 65,000 deaths , later reduced to 19,000 and now cut back again .
The government 's emergency contingency committee , Cobra , met this morning to consider the disease 's progress .
The number of cases has climbed over the past week from 27,000 to 53,000 .
Following the deaths of two children at the same special needs school in Northern Ireland in the space of a week , those in special schools may be given extra priority for vaccination .
Revised guidance for NHS planners , released today , suggests that as many as 35,000 people could require hospital treatment during the outbreak and as much as 15 % of that number may need critical care treatment .
In the peak week of the outbreak , expected sometime this winter , up to 1.5 million people could be suffering from swine flu , the new guidance suggests .
A third of the UK 's children could catch the virus , whereas the " clinical attack rate " for the rest of the population is expected to be around 12 % .
Infection rates are higher in northern England at present .
" We are starting to see the disease creep [ southwards ] down the country , " explained Sir Liam Donaldson , the chief medical officer .
" We do n't understand why so many [ are in critical care now ] . "
In one NHS region , the East Midlands , almost 17 % of paediatric critical care beds are occupied by children suffering from swine flu .
The government 's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) yesterday promised to monitor any reports of side - effects among those vaccinated .
The agency is opening up a website – www.mhra.gov.uk/swineflu – for anyone inoculated to register adverse reactions .
In Northern Ireland , Dr Michael McBride , the province 's chief medical officer , warned : " It is going to be a long , difficult winter .
It could be one of the most difficult winters we have seen . "
A WHOLE range of objects never seen before could soon reveal themselves to a telescope with night vision .
NASA ’s Wide - field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) , which headed to the launch pad last week , will map the entire sky in infrared .
It will spot everything from nearby cool , failed stars to intense , 10 - billion - year - old starburst galaxies .
The telescope will also be able to distinguish objects like asteroids and comets from more distant stars .
WISE is expected to find about 100,000 new asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and hundreds of asteroids that pass close to Earth .

Is China headed toward collapse ?
The conventional wisdom in Washington and in most of the rest of the world is that the roaring Chinese economy is going to pull the global economy out of recession and back into growth .
It ’s China ’s turn , the theory goes , as American consumers — who propelled the last global boom with their borrowing and spending ways — have begun to tighten their belts and increase savings rates .
The Chinese , with their unbridled capitalistic expansion propelled by a system they still refer to as “ socialism with Chinese characteristics , ” are still thriving , though , with annual gross domestic product growth of 8.9 percent in the third quarter and a domestic consumer market just starting to flex its enormous muscles .
Advertisement
That ’s prompted some cheerleading from U.S. officials , who want to see those Chinese consumers begin to pick up the slack in the global economy — a theme President Barack Obama and his delegation are certain to bring up during next week ’s visit to China .
“ Purchases of U.S. consumers cannot be as dominant a driver of growth as they have been in the past , ” Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said during a trip to Beijing this spring .
“ In China , ... growth that is sustainable will require a very substantial shift from external to domestic demand , from an investment and export - intensive growth to growth led by consumption . ”
That ’s one vision of the future .
But there ’s a growing group of market professionals who see a different picture altogether .
These self - styled China bears take the less popular view : that the much - vaunted Chinese economic miracle is nothing but a paper dragon .
In fact , they argue that the Chinese have dangerously overheated their economy , building malls , luxury stores and infrastructure for which there is almost no demand , and that the entire system is teetering toward collapse .
A Chinese collapse , of course , would have profound effects on the United States , limiting China ’s ability to buy U.S. debt and provoking unknown political changes inside the Chinese regime .
The China bears could be dismissed as a bunch of cranks and grumps except for one member of the group : hedge fund investor Jim Chanos .
Chanos , a billionaire , is the founder of the investment firm Kynikos Associates and a famous short seller — an investor who scrutinizes companies looking for hidden flaws and then bets against those firms in the market .
His most famous call came in 2001 , when Chanos was one of the first to figure out that the accounting numbers presented to the public by Enron were pure fiction .
Chanos began contacting Wall Street investment houses that were touting Enron ’s stock .
“ We were struck by how many of them conceded that there was no way to analyze Enron but that investing in Enron was , instead , a ‘ trust me ’ story , ” Chanos told a congressional committee in 2002 .
Now , Chanos says he has found another “ trust me ” story : China .
And he is moving to short the entire nation ’s economy .
Washington policymakers would do well to understand his argument , because if he ’s right , the consequences will be felt here .
Chanos and the other bears point to several key pieces of evidence that China is heading for a crash .
First , they point to the enormous Chinese economic stimulus effort — with the government spending $ 900 billion to prop up a $ 4.3 trillion economy .
“ Yet China ’s economy , for all the stimulus it has received in 11 months , is underperforming , ” Gordon Chang , author of “ The Coming Collapse of China , ” wrote in Forbes at the end of October .
“ More important , it is unlikely that [ third - quarter ] expansion was anywhere near the claimed 8.9 percent . ”
Chang argues that inconsistencies in Chinese official statistics — like the surging numbers for car sales but flat statistics for gasoline consumption — indicate that the Chinese are simply cooking their books .
He speculates that Chinese state - run companies are buying fleets of cars and simply storing them in giant parking lots in order to generate apparent growth .
Another data point cited by the bears : overcapacity .
For example , the Chinese already consume more cement than the rest of the world combined , at 1.4 billion tons per year .
But they have dramatically ramped up their ability to produce even more in recent years , leading to an estimated spare capacity of about 340 million tons , which , according to a report prepared earlier this year by Pivot Capital Management , is more than the consumption in the U.S. , India and Japan combined .
This , Chanos and others argue , is happening in sector after sector in the Chinese economy .
And that means the Chinese are in danger of producing huge quantities of goods and products that they will be unable to sell .
The Pivot Capital report was extremely popular in Chanos ’s office and concluded , “ We believe the coming slowdown in China has the potential to be a similar watershed event for world markets as the reversal of the U.S. subprime and housing boom . ”
And the bears also keep a close eye on anecdotal reports from the ground level in China , like a recent posting on a blog called The Peking Duck about shopping at Beijing ’s “ stunningly dysfunctional , catastrophic mall , called The Place . ”
“ I was shocked at what I saw , ” the blogger wrote .
“ Fifty percent of the eateries in the basement were boarded up .
The cheap food court , too , was gone , covered up with ugly blue boarding , making the basement especially grim and dreary .
...
There is simply too much stuff , too many stores and no buyers . ”
Right at this moment in Toronto , there are as many as 4,000 illegal guns tucked under beds , stashed in closets or hidden in dresser drawers .
Complicated amnesty laws around gun legislation have many owners confused .
Now the city 's Guns and Gangs unit is going door to door setting people straight .
" If you have to ask the question if you are licensed ...
I can pretty much guarantee you are not in compliance , " said Superintendent Greg Getty , who works with the Organized Crime Enforcement unit .
So Getty and his team are going through tens of thousands of old gun registry documents to try and locate weapons where registration may have expired .
So far , they 've gone through 5,000 and located 400 guns .
Offending individuals are either given an opportunity to obtain the necessary permits and educate themselves on safe storage procedures — while Toronto police hold the gun for safe - keeping — or else the weapon is destroyed .
No one is being charged in the initiative , said Getty .
Chief Bill Blair said the ongoing initiative , which began in March , is crucial to the safety of the city .
So far this year , Toronto police have seized more than 1,500 firearms .
Of those , about 70 % were likely smuggled into Canada from the United States .
But nearly a third of the weapons originated in Canada , he said .
If you think you may be in possession of an unregistered , illegal firearm , contact Toronto police for information at 416-808-2222 .
You will not be charged , said Getty .

Five centuries of searching for one of Britain 's most significant battlefields has finally ended with the discovery of " extraordinary and unexpected " pieces of artillery in a Leicestershire field .
The finds near Market Bosworth at last pin down the notoriously " wandering site " of the battle that overthrew Richard III – the last English king to die at the head of an army – and established the Tudor dynasty and the modern state .
Surrounded by school parties still studying at least four wrong locations , a bevy of archaeologists unveiled 22 primitive pistol bullets and cannonballs , alongside soil surveys and data from metal detection over 2.7 square miles .
The revelations arise from an overlooked trough of rolling countryside two miles from the previously most widely accepted battlefield , below Ambion Hill .
The scale of the ammunition haul transforms the battle of Bosworth 's significance from a national landmark ( it is usually ranked with Hastings , Naseby and the Battle of Britain ) to international importance .
Glenn Foard , who led the £ 1 m three - year survey for the Battlefields Trust , said : " We are seeing here the origins of firepower which led to an empire spanning the globe .
Now this needs to be explored on every battlefield of the period in Europe . "
Pictures of stalwart yeomen with bows and arrows have been instantly outdated by the find , which shows how the battle , in 1485 , was a change from previous encounters in the Wars of the Roses .
Foard said : " Only two bullets have been found in 27 years ' work at Towton [ Britain 's bloodiest - ever battle , fought near Leeds in 1461 ] .
We are sure that we will dig up plenty more here . "
The lead used in the ammunition that was found , some of it mixed with pebbles and flints to save money , would be far less prone to rust than iron arrowheads .
The exact location of the site , between the villages of Dadlington , Shenton , Upton and Stoke Golding , will not be publicised until next year , when the survey ends .
But the four villages have hotly disputed the issue for centuries , referring to post - mediaeval texts and place - name evidence , such as Crown Hill , renamed from Garbrodys
Hill some time after 1485 .
" Our discovery suggests that the Crown Hill story is probably right , that Henry VII placed the crown on his head there after one of his soldiers found it in a thorn bush .
We will never know , but it would have been the obvious place , " said Foard .
The artillery discovery occurred after nearly three years of false leads .
There was one shock when the site of a marsh , mentioned by chroniclers as protecting Henry 's flank , proved a dead end .
Foard said : " We really thought we 'd nailed it , but soil surveys showed that the marsh had dried up in Roman times .
Thank goodness , we found another one . "
The discovery ends a prolonged period of nerves at Leicestershire county council , whose Battlefield Centre , at Ambion Hill , includes reconstructed mediaeval houses and staff marching about in full armour with swords and pikes .
" We 're relieved and delighted that our battlefield has n't gone wandering off into Warwickshire or the West Midlands , " said Heather Broughton , director of community services .
" OK , the centre [ built in in 1974 ] is n't in exactly the right place , but we 're planning a trail to overlook the real site which any ten - year - old 10 - year - old will be able to manage from here . "
The team 's work was praised by English Heritage 's regional inspector , Jon Humble , who said : " This is the second epic victory on Bosworth 's history - steeped soil .
It has taken more than 500 years to reveal one of Leicestershire 's greatest and most elusive secrets , but this is a world - class example of what can be received through archaeological research . "
Des Gallagher , of the Heritage Lottery Fund , which paid for the survey , called the results " groundbreaking stuff , altering our national history " .
Axel Müller , director of the International Medieval Congress , which two years ago reconstructed early mediaeval cannon at Leeds University , said : " Scholars will be settling down from tomorrow to think about what this means for studies of firepower in the development of warfare . "
The news absorbed visitors to the centre , including a party of teenagers from Soar college , Leicester , who set about trying to work out the location of the new site .
Mark and Marianne Lester , a sales manager and civil servant from Hinckley , said : " We 've been here before and we know quite a lot about the other battlefield sites .
Now we 'll have to start finding out about this one . "
Meanwhile , the chair of the Battlefields Trust , Frank Baldwin , called for stronger protection of Britain 's battlefields to deter treasure hunters .
He said : " We face public spending cuts but these places are a potentially a huge revenue earner .
Normandy alone has 10 times more battlefield centres than there are in the whole of the UK . "

King Richard III of England slept badly on the night of 21 August 1485 and so did his army commander , the Duke of Norfolk , who had received the anonymous message : " Jockey of Norfolk be not so bold , for Dickon thy master is bought and sold . "
So it proved the following day when 10,000 loyal Englishmen were outwitted by an army half their size , mostly Welshmen and French mercenaries , ably commanded by the Earl of Oxford .
For the last time in English history , a monarch died on the battlefield , after a last desperate appeal for a horse .
So the chroniclers have it , but details of the engagement will be altered by today 's finds .
What is undoubted is that Bosworth was one of Britain 's most important battles , ending and beginning an era .
As history stands now , Richard drew up his force on Ambion Hill , near Market Bosworth , Leicestershire , and bombarded the invading force of Henry Tudor ( soon to be King Henry VII ) .
It was a rash order to charge which undid Richard .
The king almost reached Henry but the vacillating Lord Stanley , whose 6,000 men had stayed neutral , entered the battle on Henry 's side .

Dear Friend of GATA and Gold :
The Federal Reserve System has disclosed to GATA that it has gold swap arrangements with foreign banks that it does not want the public to know about .
The disclosure contradicts denials provided by the Fed to GATA in 2001 and suggests that the Fed is indeed very much involved in the surreptitious international central bank manipulation of the gold price particularly and the currency markets generally .
The Fed 's disclosure came this week in a letter to GATA 's Washington - area lawyer , William J. Olson of Vienna , Virginia ( http://www.lawandfreedom.com/), denying GATA 's administrative appeal of a freedom - of - information request to the Fed for information about gold swaps , transactions in which monetary gold is temporarily exchanged between central banks or between central banks and bullion banks .
( See the International Monetary Fund 's treatise on gold swaps here : http://www.imf.org/external/bopage/pdf/99-10.pdf.)
The letter , dated September 17 and written by Federal Reserve Board member Kevin M. Warsh ( see http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/warsh.htm), formerly a member of the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets , detailed the Fed 's position that the gold swap records sought by GATA are exempt from disclosure under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act .
Warsh wrote in part : " In connection with your appeal , I have confirmed that the information withheld under Exemption 4 consists of confidential commercial or financial information relating to the operations of the Federal Reserve Banks that was obtained within the meaning of Exemption 4 .
This includes information relating to swap arrangements with foreign banks on behalf of the Federal Reserve System and is not the type of information that is customarily disclosed to the public .
This information was properly withheld from you . "
When , in 2001 , GATA discovered a reference to gold swaps in the minutes of the January 31 - February 1 , 1995 , meeting of the Federal Reserve 's Federal Open Market Committee and pressed the Fed , through two U.S. senators , for an explanation , Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan denied that the Fed was involved in gold swaps in any way .
Greenspan also produced a memorandum written by the Fed official who had been quoted about gold swaps in the FOMC minutes , FOMC General Counsel J. Virgil Mattingly , in which Mattingly denied making any such comments .
( See http://www.gata.org/node/1181.)
The Fed 's September 17 letter to GATA confirming that the Fed has gold swap arrangements can be found here :
http://www.gata.org/files/GATAFedResponse-09-17-2009.pdf
While the letter is far from the first official admission of central bank scheming to suppress the price of gold ( for documentation of some of these admissions , see http://www.gata.org/node/6242 and http://www.gata.org/node/7096), it comes at a sensitive time in the currency and gold markets .
The U.S. dollar is showing unprecedented weakness , the gold price is showing unprecedented strength , Western European central banks appear to be withdrawing from gold sales and leasing , and the International Monetary Fund is being pressed to take the lead in the gold price suppression scheme by selling gold from its own supposed reserves in the guise of providing financial support for poor nations .
GATA will seek to bring a lawsuit in federal court to appeal the Fed 's denial of our freedom - of - information request .
While this will require many thousands of dollars , the Fed 's admission that it aims to conceal documentation of its gold swap arrangements establishes that such a lawsuit would have a distinct target and not be just a fishing expedition .
In pursuit of such a lawsuit and its general objective of liberating the precious metals markets and making them fair and transparent , GATA again asks for your financial support and that of all gold and silver mining companies that are not at the mercy of market - manipulating governments and banks .
GATA is recognized by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as a non-profit educational and civil rights organization and contributions to it are federally tax - exempt in the United States .

MOUNTAIN VIEW —
Unless you were hiding under a rock for most of the day yesterday , you 're aware by now that Google held a press event at which the search giant pulled back the curtain on ChromeOS , the OS that 's really a browser ( and is based on the browser that 's really an OS ) .
The search giant announced that it is open - sourcing the OS , and described in detail much of its nature and function .
In this article , we 'll recap only a few of the highlights of the announcement , because the news has been covered exhaustively elsewhere .
Our main focus here is to provide some analysis and context , and to think about what ChromeOS means .
The highlights
What Google unveiled in detail is actually more than just an OS .
ChromeOS presumes a particular hardware platform — exclusively flash for storage , custom firmware , and a limited , Google - approved set of system and peripheral devices that the OS will recognize and use .
This being the case , this article will refer to a " ChromeOS portable , " because to think in terms of a " netbook that runs ChromeOS " is a mistake , for reasons discussed later .
The custom firmware integrates some of the functions of a boot loader , so it 's a bit more robust than a traditional BIOS .
During the seven - second boot time , the firmware loads a series of kernel modules , all of which are signed ; if the signature check fails at any point in boot - up , the machine will prompt the user for a reboot , after which a clean version of the OS is downloaded and the entire device is essentially re-imaged .
Once you get past the custom firmware layer that lives on the " hardware " side of the portable , ChromeOS proper is essentially a version of the Chrome browser that runs right on the hardware , with as little as possible in the way of an intervening OS stack .
Every " application " is just a webpage , which means that users do n't install binaries , ever , for any reason .
" We run completely inside the browser model , " said Sundar Pichai , vice president of product management at Google when describing user application execution .
Each application in ChromeOS lives in a browser tab
The OS itself lives on a read - only partition that 's not accessible to user - space processes .
The fact that the OS is stateless is a major security advantage , since it's that much harder for malicious code to hijack any part of it .
Also important is the fact that the user processes themselves are all sandboxed , and any user data that 's locally cached is encrypted by default .
The OS will support only a limited number of Google - blessed devices and peripherals , which is Google 's way of ensuring reliability and security .
Users who buy a ChromeOS portable will have to buy it for what it is , a cloud client that 's closer in many ways to a smartphone than it is to a netbook .
Speed and gaming
Google has promised that ChromeOS will provide an even faster Internet experience than the Chrome browser , and it's not hard to imagine how it will deliver on that .
Because Google owns the TCP / IP stack in ChromeOS , the company can optimize it for Internet HTTP traffic : very high numbers of simultaneous connections and high latencies .
Thus Google can make tradeoffs down in the networking stack that give a better user experience on ChromeOS , without worrying about how the OS will perform on a LAN with different file protocols and such .
As for the device 's potential for gaming , it 's certainly better than you think .
The ChromeOS engineering director , Matthew Papakipos , is the former Director of Architecture at NVIDIA , and he came to Google as part of the search giant 's purchase of Peakstream , a " GPGPU " middleware company that Papakipos founded .
Papakipos was one of the principals behind Google 's recently announced O3D API .
The O3D API essentially lets Javascript Web apps use a client 's GPU hardware for 3D acceleration , which means that you can run in - browser 3D scenes at full speed .
While you wo n't be playing Far Cry on a ChromeOS portable any time soon , it should be possible to do some interesting virtual world type applications and casual games eventually .
Death to the file , long live the URL
In my comments above on how ChromeOS works , I described user data as " locally cached " — with ChromeOS , all user data lives in the cloud .
A ChromeOS device presumes that the canonical version of your data is the cloud version , so it caches this data locally for faster access , and when a user modifies it , the changes are invisibly written back out to the network .
What this means in practical terms is that , while ChromeOS has a filesystem of some sort , you 'll never see it .
I , for one , could n't be more thrilled .
Longtime
Ars readers may be familiar with my periodic rants about the increasing disutility of the " volume / directory / file " metaphor for modern networked machines .
Saving files , copying them , syncing them — this is all pointless clerical work that I want my computer to do for me .
ChromeOS officially nukes the " file " as a core user - facing OS abstraction .
This is a huge victory for users everywhere , who can now interact with higher - level abstractions like contacts , geographic locations ( variously described via Google Maps ) , documents , applications , and other more viable entities that do n't digitally imitate the paper - based record keeping systems of a bygone era .
Of course , what Google has replaced the file with has problems of its own .
I 'm speaking of the URL , and let 's hope that the URL is only a stopping - off point on the route to something better .
URLs are long , unwieldy , not very user - friendly , and generally undesirable as a user - facing abstraction .
Google must find a way to hide the URL permanently , so that users can locate networked resources using a less awful method than copying , pasting , or ( God forbid ) manually entering a lengthy and mostly nonsensical text string .
Note that it 's still possible to browse a traditional filesystem with ChromeOS .
If you plug a USB drive into the portable , ChromeOS opens a file browser tab that lets you look through the file tree .
In the demo , Pichai clicked on a an Excel file that then opened in the Windows Live version of Excel .
" Microsoft has written a killer app for ChromeOS , " he snarked of Redmond 's Live offerings , which will enable ChromeOS to natively open Office docs without translating them to Google Docs .
Many TV shows and movies available online in the U.S. are blocked to users in Canada , but Canadians are still among the most voracious consumers of online video in the world .
Canadian companies could take advantage and cash in or lose big , technology analysts say .
Canadians watch more hours of videos on average than internet users in the U.S. , U.K. , Germany and France , said Bryan Segal , vice - president of sales for the market research company comScore Canada .
Top 4 online video providers in Canada in Feb. 2009 Source : comScore Inc. Company Market share Google sites ( incl. YouTube ) 52 % Microsoft sites 1.8 % Yahoo sites 1.5 % Megavideo.com 1.2 % Top 4 online video providers in the U.S. in Feb. 2009 Source : comScore Inc. Company Market share Google sites 41 % Fox Interactive Media 3.5 % Yahoo 2.7 % Hulu 2.5 %
In February , comScore found that 21 million Canadians , or about 88 per cent of internet users , watched an average of 10 hours of videos online for the month — 53 per cent more time than they spent watching videos online a year ago .
The numbers even include pornography or sites that require a person to pay .
Only 76 per cent of internet users in the U.S. watched videos online , and they spent an average of just five hours , even though they have access to an enormous range of TV episodes and movies through websites such as Hulu.com and youtube.com .
Much of that content is blocked to viewers in Canada due to distribution rights or copyright issues .
Segal said the numbers do n't surprise him , as he sees Canadians as news - and entertainment - hungry people .
" I think at the end of the day , the growth of video is a great thing for advertisers , media companies and consumers , " he said .
" Online video's a great opportunity . "
So far , in Canada the big winner is Google and its YouTube brand .
The site allows Canadians to access the short , low - resolution videos , many of them generated and uploaded by the public .
It does not let them watch the full episodes of TV shows such as Beverly Hillbillies and movies such as Casino Royale , something it recently started offering to viewers in the U.S .
Google dominates in Canada
Google had 52 per cent of the Canadian market share for online video in February , followed by Microsoft with just 1.8 per cent .
Segal 's numbers show that Google had just 41 per cent market share in the U.S. , while Fox Interactive media , an internet veteran that owns MySpace.com and has been streaming some TV episodes online since 2005 , came second with 3.5 per cent market share .
Hulu , which offers TV episodes and movies from many networks at a high enough quality to be viewed on a full - size computer screen , including some in high - definition , had 2.5 per cent market share just a year after it launched in March 2008 .
Hulu is backed by News Corp. , which owns Fox , and NBC Universal .
Mark Tauschek , a lead research analyst for Info - Tech Research Group who studies the network and wireless industry , said he's not surprised that Canadians watch a lot of online videos as the country has historically had a solid broadband infrastructure .
Companies are still only just beginning to think about how they can take advantage of the medium to boost revenue , he said .
Canadian TV networks not pushing online : analyst
Canadian media companies have so far chosen a different model than the U.S. , he said .
While Hulu buys television programs from content providers , and then sells its own ads to make money , Canadian television networks such as CTVglobemedia and Global TV have chosen to stream their own episodes of shows such as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and Heroes with their own revenue - generating ads .
" But the truth is they 're probably not the right guys to deliver that content , " Tauschek said , noting that a lot of infrastructure is needed to stream high - definition content to thousands of people .
" Should they have embraced something like Hulu by now ?
They probably should have , but at least they recognized that they have to somehow get on the bandwagon . "
The latest numbers show CTVglobemedia achieved 0.8 per cent of the market share for online videos and Global TV had just 0.1 per cent for their efforts .
" I think the fact is that they 're not really pushing it too hard , " Tauschek said , suggesting that they are really just testing the waters .
He added that they may be concerned about eroding viewership on TV , irking their cable and satellite partners and whether or not they have the streaming capacity to support higher online viewership .
But Tauschek said Hulu is " working feverishly " to make its service available in Canada and other Western countries .
He thinks they 'll be successful and Canadian television networks should take heed .
" They really ought to embrace it because if they do n't … they run the risk of the same thing happening to them that happened to the record labels , " he said , adding that when the music industry fought the internet , it led to an increase in piracy and a loss of revenues for their industry .
If the content providers do take the right approach , they could end up being the big winners , he predicts .
" I have a feeling that Hulu 's really going to start to explode . "
The cable and satellite television stand to lose revenues once consumers can get a wide range of TV with high image quality over the internet for free .
Cable , satellite companies could lose
" I think we 're just sort at the leading edge of that , " he said .
" In Canada , I think Rogers and [ Bell ] Expressvu are going to start feeling that . "
Rogers seems to have recognized the looming storm .
At CRTC hearings in March on the regulation of new media , Rogers proposed an online video platform similar to Hulu as a means of ensuring Canadian broadcasting content has a home on the internet .
The proposed service would require a Rogers ' cable subscription for access , although Rogers ' head of regulatory affairs , Ken Engelhart , said the company was open to partnering with other cable providers on the service .
Tyler Chamberlin , who researches corporate strategies for technology - based firms , said barriers remain to the wider adoption of online TV in Canada , such as the CRTC 's concern about cultural protection .
" I do n't think that we 've really figured out yet exactly what to do with the online world where it comes to culture … which , personally , I think is to the detriment of the country economically .
I think it holds us back culturally as well . "
Chamberlin , a lecturer at the University of Ottawa 's Telfer School of Management , added that Canadian companies may be reluctant to sell their content to a company like Hulu , as it may seem more advantageous for them to get access to the online market themselves than to give up the online rights .
" If people stop watching it on TV and … stream American content directly from Hulu , what 's left for them ? "
Chamberlin also believes that people have only just scratched the surface of what 's possible in the online world and many opportunities remain in online video , not just when it comes to TV , but also when it comes to streaming to the next generation of mobile devices and networks .
Tauschek also believes that there are money - making opportunities for non-media companies in online video , as it can be used to deliver all kinds of content to clients , although he is concerned that Canadian broadband infrastructure may not yet ready to deal with that .
While everyone agrees there 's money to be made in online video , it 's still not entirely clear who 's going to be making it .
Both Chamberlin and comScore 's Segal said no one should be discouraged by Google 's dominance in online video in Canada .
Chamberlin said that 's the kind of thing that can change very quickly in the online world .
" You can go from a market leader to out - of - business rapidly . "
Segal said it 's not necessary to even dethrone the leader to make money — given the popularity of online videos , even a small market share can represent a lot of dollars .
" Being a leader is great , but being behind the leader can be very profitable as well . "

Conservationists warned yesterday that one of Australia 's worst off - shore oil spills was killing wildlife and " massively contaminating " one of the world 's last great wildnernesses .
Amid a fourth attempt to plug the 64 - day - old leak at the Montara drilling rig , the slick – which has already spread over an area 10 times the size of London – continued to expand at the rate of 300 barrels of oil a day in an area of the Timor Sea famed for its marine reserves and coral .
A survey by the Worldwide Fund for Nature found dolphins , migratory sea birds , sea snakes and marine turtles were exposed to toxins .
The slick has killed hundreds , possibly thousands , of animals .
Since August 21 when there was an accident at the Montara offshore drilling rig's well head , around 403,000 litres of oil have been pumped into the Timor Sea .
The rig is owned by the Thai oil company PTTEP .
Satellite images show a 25,000 square kilometre slick spreading across the surface of the ocean and spilling into Indonesian waters , threatening the marine reserves of Ashmore and Cartier reefs along the way .
WWF director of conservation Dr Gilly Llewellyn , who conducted a three day expedition through the polluted waters , said if the spill were closer to shore there would be global outrage .
" There were times when we were literally in a sea of oil from left to right and as far as we could see ahead of us - it was heavily oiled water and it was sickening because in this we were seeing dolphins surfacing , " Llewellyn said .
" We recorded hundreds of dolphins and sea birds in the oil slick area , as well as sea snakes and threatened hawksbill and flatback turtles .
Clearly , wildlife is dying and hundreds if not thousands of dolphins , seabirds and sea-snakes are being exposed to toxic oil , " Llewellyn said .
The expedition recorded 17 species of seabird , four species of dolphins and five marine reptiles including two species of marine turtle .
However the paucity of research on the marine life in the area has hampered attempts to document the damage .
Still , Llewellyn says experience from previous oil disasters suggests the damage will be long lasting .
" We know that oil can be a slow and silent killer .
Impacts from the Exxon Valdez disaster are still being seen 20 years later , so we can expect this environmental disaster will continue to unfold for years to come , " she said .
When oil , gas and condensate began seeping into the Timor Sea PTTEP estimated it would take 50 days to plug the well which is located about 250 kilometres off the Kimberley region of the West Australian coast line .
Three previous attempts by PTTEP Australasia to plug the leak , 2.5 kilometres below the sea bed by pumping it full of heavy mud have failed .
Australia 's federal environment minister , Peter Garrett , said he was confident everything possible was being done to stop the oil leak .
Some industry executives , however , said that the restrictions were too harsh and would have a significant impact on consumers by limiting the availability of credit just when it was needed most .
“ I would suspect that many community banks will simply stop offering overdraft protection to avoid the costs and penalties of complying with the rule , ” said Camden R. Fine , president of the Independent Community Bankers of America , which represents about 5,000 financial institutions .
“ If that happens , it will not be the banks that suffer as much as it will be the consumers and small businesses that have taken bounce protection for granted .
In many ways this rule and proposals in Congress turn back the clock 25 years and deny a service that was demanded by the consumers in the first place . ”
Fed officials said that the banking industry received $ 25 billion to $ 38 billion a year in overdraft fees , including fees for checks and electronic transactions not covered by the new rules .
Other Fed rules in the last two years have been directed at predatory loans , abusive mortgage practices , opaque home equity loans and misleading information about credit cards .
Some of the credit card rules were superseded by legislation signed this year by President Obama that requires the card companies to give notice before raising rates and makes it more difficult for them to market cards to students .
The Fed announcement was endorsed by senior Democratic lawmakers who also urged the agency to do more .
“ Giving customers the chance to choose whether they want overdraft protection is important , but we need to do far more to protect customers from abusive bank products , ” said Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut .
“ We still need to stop the excessive fees , repeated charges , lax notification , and processing manipulation that have become standard in these so - called overdraft protection programs . ”
Last month Mr. Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , and Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , introduced legislation to limit the number of overdraft fees to one a month and to require a bank to seek permission from consumers to cover debit card and check purchases that would push their bank balance below zero .
Global Humanity Problem / Solution Summary ; After Decades Modern Civilization Conclusions are the Same
These are the same results I found during my Architectural Thesis in 2000 .
The larger the amount of humans on the planet , makes for less available resources per person over time .
Overpopulation makes our impact EXPONENTIAL , for better and for worse .
The responsibility of Stewardship is also therefore increasingly harder .
War and Environmental problems become harder to handle , while we at the same time develop better tools and more workers to help pre-existing problems .
Civilized SUSTAINABILITY
can be seen as a large building ; the more you add on to accommodate people , the more you have to maintain , and larger problems are created that may be un-sustainable .
Utopia was never perfect , even in the original novel by Sir Thomas More .
My most positive conclusion ( besides escapism , nihilism , or negativism ) has always been EDUCATION .
It is the longest way , but the best answer .
High - tech games are only beginning to address the needs of education for the future , but we must develop many more tools .

Scottrade Review
Scottrade is ranked 60 in Fortune ’s best companies to work for in 2009 , but what ’s good about the broker other than the Scottrade promotion code being offered ?
This review is written to find out .
Click Here to Open an Account with Scottrade
Scottrade at a Glance
Never mind any other brokerage firms , Scottrade offers four different trading platforms within its own system with Scottrade , Scottrader , Scottrade Mobile and Socttrade Elite .
Here are a brief description of each :
Scottrade –
The standard platform that works within the website .
No software , no plugins , nothing needs to be installed .
The usual limitations apply though : no streaming quotes ( though real time quotes are available ) , less than instant response time ( although it ’s bearable most of the time ) .
For most investors , this is adequate .
Scottrader –
The introduction for customers to streaming quotes , customizable trading screens and others like top 10 lists and real time updated account balances , positions and order execution .
Scottrade Mobile – I have no idea why you want to trade using your phone , but basic options are there if you really need it .
The software works on all versions of iPhone , Blackberries and any device that is Internet capable .
Scottrade Elite –
The most flexible and feature rich trading platform , but there ’s a $ 25,000 balance requirement to get this free .
Be careful because there ’s an option to NASDAQ TotalView and Level II , which costs extra unless you do enough trades per month ( 15 and 10 respectively ) .
Commissions and Other Fees
For years , Scottrade cleaned shop with just $ 7 a trade .
In fact , the commissions were so good that everyone thought it was just a Scottrade promotion .
However , recent competitors like TradeKing bring new meaning to the word “ discount brokers .
Nevertheless , $ 7 a trade is still very attractive for most , promotion or not .
Same story with options .
Commissions are at $ 7 plus $ 1.25 per contract .
Not earth shatteringly low prices but still reasonable .
Unlike the bigger brokerage firms , there are $ 0 fees to maintain the account no matter how much you have in your accounts .
The only requirement is that it takes $ 500 to open an account ( $ 2,000 for a margin account ) .
Why Scottrade
In my opinion , the only reason why I would want to pay more commissions with Scottrade is the fact that like many premium discount brokers , there are branches within the U.S. that I can visit .
I did a quick search for branches around my home , and there are four locations within 10 miles .
In addition , Scottrade offers Thomson Financial Research directly to every customer to aid our investment decisions .
Awards and Others
As mentioned , Scottrade is among the best companies to work for .
On top of being ranked 60 in Fortune ’s Top 100 companies to work for , they were two spots better at 58 in 2008 .
Reasons include consistent quarterly bonus payouts even despite the toughest economic environment , never having a layoff and extremely happy employees .
I was also encouraged to hear that they also ranked first in customer satisfaction according to J.D. Power and Associates for the highest investor satisfaction with self - directed services .
I guess when employees are happy , customers are happy too .
Scottrade Promotion
The broker is going to reimburse you for up to $ 100 when you transfer your account to Scottrade .
No promotion code needed , although you need to submit a form after you open an account .
So Is Scottrade Right for Me ?
For many , going with the company that offers the lowest commissions is what feels right but if you are looking for branches just in case you want to meet , see and talk to a live person , Scottrade is a solid option .
Coupled with awesome customer service , Scottrade might be for you .

US Navy Intelligence is soon to deploy radical new computer monitoring software able to sniff out " deviations " among hundreds of thousands of sailors at sea on the world 's oceans .
Rather than some kind of Orwellian porn- enforcement system for use on the USN's own matelots , however , the so - called Predictive Analysis for Naval Deployment Activities ( PANDA ) technology will instead be used to sift a global plot of worldwide shipping movements to identify vessels acting in a menacing fashion .
" With tens of thousands of ships on the world 's oceans every day , it is very difficult to identify behaviour that may indicate a threat , " said Rich Dickinson , PANDA honcho at Lockheed Advanced Technology Labs , providing the kit .
" We believe PANDA provides a great improvement for [ maritime domain awareness ] by automatically detecting deviations and alerting operators to them . "
The idea is that the Office of Naval Intelligence will deploy PANDA at its National Maritime Intelligence Centre in Maryland , where the new tech will be able to monitor tracking information covering much of the watery globe .
As well as information fed in by US warships , monitoring stations , patrol aircraft and so on , the US intelligence community is also known to make extensive use of radar spy satellites able to scan vast swathes of ocean from orbit and pick out any ships .
( Such satellites often need more power than can be provided by solar panels , meaning that they are one of the main users of nuclear energy in space . )
Monitoring every track on the Big Plot for suspicious behaviour - or " deviations " , as Lockheed terms such actions - would be impossibly manpower - intensive , however .
That 's where PANDA comes in , using " pattern - based learning technologies , historical data , and track monitoring " to pick out potentially threatening ships engaged in possible WMD smuggling or whatever .
Given the acronym , readers will be unsurprised to note that the agency originally behind PANDA * is none other than DARPA , the Pentagon tech bureau where , should you be applying for a job as a lab assistant , you do n't have to be hunchbacked - but it helps .
The PANDA roll - out to naval intelligence represents a move to Phase III by the project , meaning actual working kit as opposed to design studies and trials .
Phase IV , if approved , would see the tech fully scaled up and handed over to the Navy .
Lockheed ATL announced the decision yesterday .
There 's a pdf presentation on PANDA from DARPA here . ®

More than 40 years after his death , the body of former CIA scientist Dr. Frank Olson has been exhumed .
Olson ’s son Eric is convinced his father was murdered by agents of the American government because he wanted to leave the CIA .
Dr. Frank Olson was an expert for anthrax and other biological weapons and had top security clearance .
Forensic pathologists at George Washington University performed an autopsy and concluded that Olson probably was the victim of a violent crime .

As you probably know by now ( you have been paying attention , have n’t you ? ) , banks are required to retain a certain amount of capital on their books .
The capital is there to keep them solvent even if their assets lose value , so the amount they ’re required to have depends on how risky their assets are .
If they have , say , a bunch of crummy C - rated securities on their books , they have to maintain a full load of capital to back them up .
But A - rated securities are less likely to lose value , so for those they only have to maintain 50 % of the normal capital levels .
And for AAA securities , they can get by with only 20 % or less .
After all , AAA securities are pretty unlikely to lose value .
Right ?
This was one of the reasons behind the CDO frenzy of the past few years .
If you slice and dice a bundle of securities so that most of them are AAA - rated , then you can reduce the capital you need to back them up , which frees up that capital for other uses .
But then everything came crashing down , the ratings on those bundles tumbled , and suddenly banks had to pony up more capital to back them up .
What to do ?
Answer : slice ’em and dice ’em all over again .
Welcome to the re-remic :
The way it works is that insurers and banks that hold battered securities on their books have Wall Street firms separate the good from the bad .
The good mortgages are bundled together and create a security designed to get a higher rating .
The weaker securities get low ratings .
…. A hypothetical example cited in research by Barclays Capital said that a $ 100 million asset that required $ 2 million in capital at a triple - A rating may require $ 35 million if downgraded to double - B-minus .
At triple - C , the capital requirement might rise to 100 % , or $ 100 million .
In a re-remic , three - fourths of the same asset may regain a triple - A rating , requiring just $ 1.5 million in capital , Barclays said .
The remaining one - quarter may require 100 % capital , but the total capital requirement would fall to $ 26.5 million . ….
” There is $ 350 billion to $ 400 billion in market value of securities with no natural buyer due to their rating , ” Barclays said in a June report .
“ The re-remic market provides a way out of this gridlock by creating new AAA securities , which are likely to be viewed as attractively priced . ”
Shiny new AAA securities !
Hooray !
And there ’s more !
Ratings for re-remics come from the same ratings agencies that bollixed up the original ratings .
And investment banks pocket fat fees for performing the financial alchemy .

Chip - maker
Intel has promised to supply a fix for a recently released firmware update , which once applied , bricked certain users ' solid - state drives ( SSD ) .
The firmware , dubbed the SSD Optimizer update , was made available late last month , but was quickly pulled by Intel .
The decision by Intel to stop the firmware 's availability was due to various reports , including several disgruntled forum posts , that the software was bricking certain users drives .
Updating promised to make the X25 - M series of SSDs more efficient , assuring speed increases of up - to 40 % .
Even though some users have had the pleasure of enjoying the detailed performance upgrade , certain users have not been so lucky , experiencing a software crash and ending up with bricked devices .
The glitch in the firmware has been identified as a problem only for those running the 64 - bit edition of Windows 7 .
Intel 's Alan Frost explained that the company had " replicated the issue " internally and were " working on a fix " with the resolution being seen " as a high priority " , unfortunately he failed to deliver a solid date for the fix 's availability .

It ’s already been a quarter century since Wayne Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers laid claim to the franchise ’s first Stanley Cup .
Led by Gretzky ’s 205 points in 1983 - 84 , the Oilers set a league record 446 goals in the regular season .
That record still stands today .
Their opponents were the four - time defending champion New York Islanders , and they were not about to relinquish the crown easily .
New York , led by captain Denis Potvin and sniper Mike Bossy , had won their last nine Finals games , sweeping the Oilers in the previous season and outscoring them 17 - 6 .
This season , the schedule for the finals format had been altered by the NHL with a two - three - two games format .
Opening the series in New York , a lone goal by Oilers tough guy Kevin McClelland , was all goaltender Grant Fuhr needed to blank the Islanders 1 - 0 in game one .
The Islanders countered in game two with a 6 - 1 shelling of Edmonton as the Nassau Coliseum fans chanted “ Drive for five ” .
However , gaining a split in the first two games gave the young Oilers a boost of confidence and a three game run at home .
The Oilers ’ offence took advantage of their home arena , the Northlands Coliseum and pounded the defending champions in successive 7 - 2 victories in games three and four .
Defenseman Kevin Lowe recalled how Gretzky stood up in the Oilers dressing room , before the start of game five , and said , “ I ’ve had a lot of individual honors and personal recognition , but nothing I ’ve ever done , won or received means as much to me as winning the Cup . ”
Led by their captain ’s words , Edmonton was determined to clinch the series at home and opened a 4 - 0 lead in game five after two periods .
Proving they were not done , a young Islanders rookie named Pat Lafontaine answered back with two goals in the first 35 seconds of the third period .
With Fuhr injured in game three , Andy Moog kept the relenting Islanders attack at bay .
Dave Lumley added an empty net goal late in the third and the game was over with a score of 5 - 2 .
The Oilers were the new Stanley Cup Champions .
“ I hope we ’re an influence on the game , ” said Gretzky during the team ’s dressing room celebration .
“ We proved that an offensive team can win the Cup .
We showed you can win by skating and by being physical without having to fight all the time , ” he added .
“ The first thing that sticks out in my mind from that first Stanley Cup was the team that we beat , ” recalled Oilers ’ defenseman Lee Fogolin .
“ The Islanders were such a great team and they were great champions .
They had a never - say - die attitude and playing against them , you could never trust any lead you had . ”
With eight goals and eighteen assists in nineteen playoff games , Mark Messier emerged from Gretzky ’s shadow and won the Conn Smythe trophy as playoff MVP .
“ We had a great teacher in the Islanders , ” said Edmonton general manager and coach Glen Sather .
Edmonton ’s patterned forechecking and disciplined play in front of its own goal were crucial to the team ’s success , and was a key element missing in the previous season .
The Islanders dynasty was finished and the Oilers dynasty was about to begin .
Edmonton would repeat as champions the following season as well as in 1987 , 1988 and add a Gretzky - less Cup victory in 1990 .

By
November 13 , 2009 -- Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal has published a number of articles on the Chinese Revolution and the subsequent restoration of capitalism in China . [ 1 ]
This article aims to give more detail on the current situation , including the Chinese government 's efforts to ameliorate some of the harmful effects of capitalism .
But first I will briefly recount the process of capitalist restoration .
` Market reforms ’
Mao Zedong died in 1976 .
By December 1978 Deng Xiaoping was in full control of the Communist Party ( CCP ) .
He launched a series of economic changes , often referred to as " market reforms " .
When the market reforms began , it was not immediately clear how far they would go .
As far as I am aware , there is no evidence that Deng was already committed to the restoration of capitalism in December 1978 .
But in any case , the outcome did not depend solely on the intentions of one person , but on the results of social and political struggles .
In the early stages , the reforms were similar to those carried out by the Russian Bolsheviks during the period of the New Economic Policy in the 1920s -- i.e. the use of market mechanisms to develop the economy , but with the state sector remaining predominant in large - scale industry .
The first step in the market reforms was to encourage peasants to sell produce from their private plots on the free market .
The next step was the introduction of what was called the " responsibility system " .
Each peasant household was allocated a certain amount of collectively owned land to farm .
Each family had to produce a certain amount of wheat , rice or other crops for the collective .
Whatever they produced above this amount they could keep for themselves , sell to the state or sell on the free market .
In the cities the responsibility system meant that individual factories became responsible for their own profits and losses .
If a factory could not make a profit it could be forced to close .
Foreign - owned companies were allowed to establish joint ventures with Chinese state and collective enterprises .
As the ``reform ’’ process went further , some wholly foreign - owned enterprises were established .
Restrictions on the ability of Chinese citizens to establish privately owned enterprises were progressively eased .
" Special economic zones " were established , where foreign capitalists were offered cheap labour and land , low taxes and easy repatriation of profits .
But soon foreign capital was no longer confined to these zones , and began spreading throughout China .
Corruption spread as bureaucrats increasingly strove to accumulate wealth for themselves and their relatives and cronies in the context of an increase in private ownership of the means of production .
The bureaucrats began to start to turn themselves into owners of capital .
The Beijing massacre
But opposition to corruption -- and to the bureaucratic regime -- began to grow .
In 1988 - 9 there was an upsurge of demands for freedom and democracy , and against corruption .
In April 1989 students protested in Beijing 's Tienanmen Square .
They remained for more than a month and were joined by many non-students .
The army was ordered to remove the protesters , but the latter talked to the soldiers and won many of them over .
Hundreds of thousands of workers joined the protests . [ 2 ]
Eventually the regime brought in new army units that used extreme violence to crush the movement .
A wave of repression followed .
Capitalist restoration
In my view the repression of the 1989 upsurge helped prepare the ground for capitalist restoration .
In principle , a different outcome was possible .
The relaxation of repression during the 1980s , however limited and contradictory , created the potential for moving in the direction of socialist democracy .
The mass upsurge of students and workers in 1989 was beginning to take China further in this direction .
Unfortunately this potential was crushed .
In early 1992 , Deng Xiaoping gave the go ahead for a policy of all - out privatisation .
He cited the example of Guangdong province , where privatisation was most advanced , as an example for the whole of China to follow .
The 14th Communist Party congress later that year confirmed this perspective , adopting a policy of creating what was termed a " socialist market economy " .
In reality , it was a policy of creating a capitalist economy .
At the 15th congress of the Communist Party in 1997 the policy was reaffirmed and deepened .
Jiang Zemin ( the president of China at that time ) declared that the CCP's aim was the rapid privatisation of all small and most medium sized state - owned enterprises .
China 's economy today
The privatisation of industry proceeded very rapidly during the 1990s , and continued more slowly thereafter .
The state sector 's share of industrial production fell from 100 % in 1978 to 37.5 % in 1999 and 31.6 % in 2004 .
The private sector 's share was 62.1 % in 2004 , while the share of collectively owned enterprises was 4.6 % . [ 3 ]
Today millions of Chinese workers are ruthlessly exploited by local and foreign capital .
Extremely long hours , physical punishment , fines and non-payment of wages are amongst the abuses suffered by many Chinese workers . [ 4 ]
By 2005 China had become the world 's third - biggest recipient of foreign investment .
In that year , the flow of foreign direct investment into China was US $ 72 billion , which was exceeded only by Britain and the United States , according to OECD figures .
Transnational corporations increasingly used China as a base for producing goods for sale on the world market .
The transnational corporations ( and the South Korean , Taiwanese and Hong Kong contractors who do much of their dirty work ) were attracted by the huge reserve army of labour created by the displacement of peasants from the land , and of workers from state - owned factories that have cut their workforce or closed down altogether .
They were also attracted by the total absence of unions in many enterprises , and the tameness of the All - China Federation of Trade Unions where it existed .
Privatisation destroyed China 's social welfare system .
A range of services such as health , housing and others had been provided to workers via their workplace .
The loss of state - and collective - sector jobs meant the loss of these services .
The result of all these changes was a vast increase in economic inequality .
The GINI index , a statistical measure of inequality , rose dramatically -- from 0.16 in 1979 to 0.389 in 1995 , 0.417 in 2000 and 0.45 in 2001 [ 5 ] .
This compared with a world average of 0.40 .
In other words , China was more unequal than most of the world 's countries , including the United States ( 0.42 ) and Japan ( 0.28 ) .
Since then the level of inequality is believed to have increased further .
" The ranks of China 's US dollar billionaires have swell from three to 130 in just five years " , according to The Age 's China correspondent John Garnaut . [ 6 ]
Strong state sector
China 's economy is now essentially capitalist , as indicated by the privatisation of the bulk of the means of production , and the conversion of labour power into a commodity .
Workers can only survive by selling their labour power to an employer .
But the most extreme ideologues of neoliberalism ( both in China and elsewhere ) are not satisfied with the degree of privatisation that has occurred so far .
State - owned enterprises remain dominant in certain strategic industrial sectors , such as iron and steel , electricity and telecommunications , and in the banking sector .
The neoliberals want more complete privatisation , and unfettered access to all areas of the economy for local and foreign capital .
The Chinese Communist Party has up to now resisted these pressures .
A strong state sector helps China maintain a degree of independence from the imperialist powers .
It has also helped China to recover from the effects of the global financial crisis which began in 2008 .
The initial impact of the crisis was severe .
Tens of millions of workers lost their jobs , particularly in the export - oriented manufacturing industries .
But the Chinese government was able to stimulate the economy by ordering state - owned enterprises to spend money , and state - owned banks to lend money .
This caused the resumption of rapid economic growth in 2009 .
Much of the spending was wasteful and / or environmentally destructive .
Many of the export - oriented industries remain in a depressed state .
Nevertheless , China can claim to have survived the economic crisis relatively well , due to its comparatively strong state sector .
Socialist ?
The continued existence of a strong state sector does not make China socialist .
In the past , many capitalist countries have had a significant sector of state - owned enterprises .
Most of these have been privatised since the rise of neoliberalism .
( Australian examples include the Commonwealth Bank , Telstra , Qantas . )
The global financial crisis seems to have brought the privatisation drive to a halt in China for the time being .
There have even been some instances of private companies being replaced by state enterprises .
John Garnaut says ( rather melodramatically ) that Wang Jun , the governor of China 's Shanxi province , " is in the process of smashing the private mining industry and feeding the carcasses to big state - owned companies " . [ 7 ]
Wang Jun has nationalised private coal mines in the province as part of a safety campaign following massive mining accidents .
Garnaut , while acknowledging that safety is a real issue , claims that the main goal is to improve the efficiency of coal mining , given China 's growing demand for coal .
If this is the case , it is not unprecedented in the history of capitalism .
State ownership of key industries can sometimes be beneficial for the functioning of the capitalist system as a whole .
The British government nationalised the coal mines after the World War II .
This did not mean that Britain had become socialist .
Similarly , China 's economy remains fundamentally capitalist , despite some cases of re-nationalisation in the wake of the global financial crisis .
Popular resistance
Workers have been fighting back against the attacks on their job security , living standards and working conditions .
There have been thousands of strikes and protests by Chinese workers , as well as numerous protests by peasants against land seizures by local governments and property developers .
There have also been protests against pollution and environmental destruction , as well as protests by ethnic minorities against discrimination .
According to Ching Kwan Lee and Mark Selden : " Nationwide , the Ministry of Public Security recorded 8,700 collective disturbances in 1993 , rising to 11,000 and 32,000 in 1995 and 1999 respectively .
In 2003 , three million people were involved in 58,000 incidents , rising to 74,000 in 2004 and 87,000 in 2005 " . [ 8 ]
Intellectual trends
Repression , both under Mao and under Deng , caused many Chinese people to become disillusioned with socialism .
In particular , many students who became Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution , and who later realised that they had been manipulated by Mao , turned not only against Maoism but against Marxism .
Some became admirers of the West , and saw capitalism as the only alternative to a tyrannical regime claiming to be communist .
Neoliberalism gained ground amongst intellectuals .
But others were disturbed by the ruthless exploitation of the workers under " free market " policies , as well as by the chaotic nature of capitalism , as exemplified by the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s , and by the 2008 global financial crisis .
This led to the rise of the " new left " , a group of intellectuals critical of neoliberal policies .
The government allows a certain degree of freedom for discussion of these issues , although being too critical of the government can still be risky .
Discussion of the oppression of national minorities such as the Tibetans and the Uighurs is particularly risky . [ 9 ]
In response to the rise in popular struggles , the CCP leadership has often used violent repression .
But it has also made some concessions to mass discontent .
After previously placing the main emphasis on " efficiency " , the CCP began to talk more about " social justice " as a pillar of a " harmonious society " .
It has made efforts to build a new social welfare system to replace that which was destroyed .
It has also introduced new labour laws , and has encouraged the All - China Federation of Trade Unions to unionise the private sector , including foreign companies .
Rebuilding the social safety net
Prior to the " market reforms " , people had job security and a basic social welfare system provided through the workplace -- a system known as the " iron rice bowl " .
Shaoguang Wang , from the Chinese University of Hong Kong , notes that : " communes and brigades in rural areas and work - units in urban areas were not only economic entities but also social and political entities .
They offered job opportunities to their members and paid them without much difference , and also provided them and their dependents with various social benefits such as nurseries , kindergartens , schools , healthcare , pensions and funeral services .
This included financial assistance to the disabled and the families of members who had died . " [ 10 ]
This situation lasted until the mid-1980s .
As the market reforms deepened , workplaces shed their responsibility for social welfare .
According to Wang , " When rural villages and urban enterprises were gradually extricated from their social responsibilities , evolving into pure economic entities , villagers and employees lost pensions , healthcare and welfare benefits , and had to spend money buying them " . [ 11 ]
Around the turn of the century , the government began to rebuild the social safety net in areas such as health care , education and pensions .
Health care
Before the victory of the communists in 1949 , China 's health indicators were amongst the worst in the world , with a life expectancy of about 35 years .
By the late 1970s this had been raised to 68 years . [ 12 ]
But after the onset of the market reforms , there was little further progress , despite rapid economic growth and scientific and technical advance .
From 1980 to 1998
China 's life expectancy rose by only two years , a lesser growth rate than the world average .
According to Shaoguang Wang , " As reform deepened , market ideology steadily infiltrated the health sector , becoming the effective guiding principle of health reform ...
China 's healthcare system became one of the most commercialised in the world . " [ 13 ]
Individuals were expected to pay for health care , which had previously been largely financed by a combination of funding from the government and the workplace ( factories , offices in urban areas , communes in rural areas ) .
In rural areas , the breakup of the communes and the decline in government support led to the collapse of the rural Cooperative Medical System .
The number of villages covered by the CMS decreased from 90 % in 1979 to 5 % in 1985 . [ 14 ]
In urban areas , the decline was not quite as dramatic , but by the end of 2003 only half of urban residents were covered by some health insurance scheme .
Migrant workers were excluded from the schemes that existed .
Shaoguang Wang comments that : " The marketisation of health was particularly detrimental to the well - being of the poor .
While the rich could now enjoy first - class medical care of international standards , the poor were often forced to endure minor health problems and put off dealing with major health conditions . " [ 15 ]
Around 2000 there was the beginning of a change in policy .
The government 's share of health - care spending began to increase a little after a long period of decline . [ 16 ]
The government also began a drive to increase the proportion of the population covered by various health insurance schemes .
Schemes for employees require contributions from both employers and workers .
There are also schemes for other urban residents , and a new rural cooperative medical system , funded by contributions from members and from central and local governments .
Efforts are being made to include migrant workers in health insurance schemes .
The number participating had reached 31.3 million by the end of 2007 ( which meant that most migrant workers were still not covered at that time ) . [ 17 ]
Workers ' rights and unionisation
In 2007 a new labour contract law was adopted by the National Peoples Congress .
This requires employers to give workers a written contract , and puts some restrictions on the right to hire and fire .
A conciliation and arbitration system was also established to hear complaints by workers against their employers .
The new laws were of some benefit to many workers .
But a significant proportion of workers did not benefit , because their employers failed to comply with the laws .
And for many workers the benefits of the new laws were soon swept away by the global economic crisis of 2008 .
Twenty million migrant workers were laid off , and employers took the opportunity to lower the pay and conditions of those who remained .
In 2006 the All - China Federation of Trade Unions launched a drive to unionise foreign companies , and succeeded with many , including Wal - Mart , which is very hostile to unions . [ 18 ]
Critics charge that the ACFTU is more concerned with controlling workers than organising them to fight for their rights .
It is often described as a " yellow union " .
It does not encourage strikes .
However it does challenge blatant violations of China 's labour laws by employers through legal channels . [ 19 ]
Foreign policy
Mao used radical anti-imperialist rhetoric in the 1960s , but swung to an openly pro-imperialist foreign policy in the 1970s .
US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger visited China in 1971 .
During the same year , China supported the reactionary side in conflicts in Sri Lanka , Bangladesh and Sudan .
US president Richard Nixon consolidated the relationship by visiting China in 1972 , and China continued to take reactionary positions on foreign policy questions , justifying it with the claim that the Soviet Union was the main enemy .
The pro-imperialist policy was continued by Deng Xiaoping .
One of the worst examples was the Chinese invasion of Vietnam in 1979 .
Since then China has moved away from its close political alliance with US imperialism .
Today China has good relations with the revolutionary governments of Cuba and Venezuela , as well as with other Third World governments , such as Iran , that are in conflict with the US .
In my view China today can be described as a bourgeois nationalist regime .
Its economy is capitalist , but the government is relatively independent of the imperialist powers .
It should be noted however that China still has close economic links with imperialism .
China keeps its foreign exchange reserves in US dollars , propping up the US currency .
The need for socialism
Despite the partial reversal of some neoliberal policies , China remains a highly unequal society , where workers are ruthlessly exploited and lack job security .
The air and water are extremely polluted .
Despite significant investment in renewable energy , the use of fossil fuels continues to expand , and China is now the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gases .
Minorities such as the Tibetans and Uighurs continue to be oppressed .
Freedom of speech continues to be restricted .
A struggle for genuine socialism remains necessary .

Last week 's issue of NME featured a list of the 20 loudest songs ever released , to mark the return of Spinal Tap .
Included on it were the Jesus and Mary Chain as well as Atari Teenage Riot , Black Sabbath , and a track from My Bloody Valentine .
The latter 's song , " You Made Me Realise " , a four - minute track released in 1998 , would be transformed into a blistering live performance when the band repeated a single chord over and over before shifting into a deafening wall of sound lasting up to 20 minutes .
It was with this track that they chose to end their five 2008 comeback shows at London 's Roundhouse .
Not surprising , then , that two of their members – guitarist singer Kevin Shields and his girlfriend singer guitarist Bilinda Butcher have tinnitus and a perforated eardrum between them .
Now , My Bloody Valentine are teaming up with earplug company Earplugshop.com to hand out the protectors at their gig .
It will be seen as a gimmick by many .
And , anyway , surely it 's a bit late .
The band have been going for 25 years and you only have to type tinnitus and My Bloody Valentine into Google and a plethora of blog sites appear with fans lamenting their loss of hearing , thanks to a MBV gig .
One blogger said : " I was lucky enough to catch My Bloody Valentine live back when they were touring Loveless .
If I recall correctly , I withstood the band 's now legendary 15 - minute noise blitzkrieg during the climax of " You Made Me Realise " without any earplugs , and I 'm sure it had a great deal to do with the tinnitus I 've been grappling with since 1999 . "
Another said , on the Royal National Institute for Deaf People tinnitus forum : " I remember My Bloody Valentine , a classic band .
Saw them live in 1991 , but they were very loud and probably not good for tinnitus in the flesh ! "
On the band 's own forum , one member – a self - proclaimed fan of the group for 19 years – who has suffered ever since attending last year 's Roundhouse show , went as far as to say he'd be " too bitter to listen to them again " .
All regretted not using earplugs .

Shields himself blamed his hearing damage on " listening to mixes in headphones at very loud levels without giving my ears time to recover " while Butcher said : " I had a punctured ear drum which fortunately they were able to put right , but for a while I could n't hear out of one ear and it was very depressing .
On stage , we all wear hearing protection and encourage anyone who sees us regularly to do the same . "
Albums should be at a consistent sound level so that when you have your iPod on shuffle , no track will deafen above the others .
Last month , American rock band Dinosaur Jr. recalled the European CD version of their new album , Farm , because it was too loud .
While the album was being mastered , the software program had " doubled " the sound layers , resulting in a thee- decibel increase in the overall sound volume .
But the same sound regulation does not apply to live music .
Gigs regularly exceed the recommended decibel limit that it is safe to be exposed to for any length of time , with sound levels easily reaching 115 decibels , which causes hearing damage in less than 30 seconds , the safe level being 85 decibels .
But MBV 's shows have been known to reach more than a deafening 120 decibels .
At their comeback shows at the Roundhouse , there were fans complaining afterwards that their ears hurt , it was so loud , a definite warning sign of hearing damage .
On that tour , free earplugs were available , but this is the first time they will be proactively distributing them .
Earplugs are readily accessible at gigs across Europe , but in Britain your best chances of saving your ears is to sidle up to a security guard at the gig in the hope they have a spare set .
Under law , if you 're working amid sound levels above 90 dB , you can work only short periods of time and are given hearing protection .
If everyone at a gig is wearing earplugs to muffle the sound , why do n't the promoters putting on the gig simply turn down the volume ?
The reason is that the power of volume is all part of the physical experience of the gig .
Howard Monk , promoter at the Local , and drummer explains , " A band like MBV is super loud .
Part of the experience is the wave of sound which is exciting .
It 's the rumblings and vibrations you can feel .
There 's an experience to be had which you would n't get if it was n't loud .
MBV playing wave after wave of amplifying and increasing sound does not only have an effect on the ears but the chest – and the bowels as well .
A lot of the way is how deaf people would experience the music . "
One of the world 's most acclaimed percussionists , Evelyn Glennie , has been profoundly deaf since the age of 12 .
She performs bare foot to feel the music , and deals with vibrations and the physical sensation she gets in her chest .
It 's not only that gigs are too loud .
Sometimes , they are too quiet .
Many fans attending the first Field Day in 2007 , an annual one - day festival in London in August , featuring pop , folk and acoustic acts , complained about being unable to hear the acts .
As well as the sound level being too low , with five stages in Victoria Park , sound would bleed from one stage to another and there was hardly an area you could be without hearing the music from another band .
Last year , the Mercury nominated folk star Laura Marling , could not be heard from the back of the crowd .
Admittedly , quieter music is going to be harder to project in the outdoors , but it was n't just acoustic acts that suffered poor amplification .
One punter told me they were at the back thinking they were listening to a DJ , when all the time they were missing a band 's set .
It 's a problem that is not limited to Field Day , it happens at several festivals and is the promoter 's responsibility to prevent .
At Wireless , a bandstand stage dedicated to Bella Union acts was just as compromised .
While it worked for the inner circles of fans watching the bands , anyone else would have heard grime star Chipmunk or the electro beats of Fischerspooner .
Monk , a drummer as well as promoter , is well aware of the pitfalls : " I was playing with The Memory Band at the Big Chill Festival in 2006 , and Tunng were playing a quiet number when a sound check started in a big tent next door with powerful dubby dance music .
It became clear that somebody had n't given much thought to the space .
In promotion , you have to give yourself space .
When I 'm booking a PA for a gig in a church , it might be quiet music and might be a quiet space but you still have to make sure it 's audible over the sound of people 's mumbling . "
The Local , known for their programming of folk music , came as a result of matching the sound to the space available .
Starting out in a venue beneath a pub in Crouch End , the vibrations would go into the pub upsetting the pub -goers .
As a result , they started to put on less noisy acts .
" That 's how we got into that folk world where we exist right now – you programme stuff according to the venue . "
More people than ever are exposing themselves to loud music because of the growth in live music .
Still , according to a poll , 81 per cent of people do n't realise that they can permanently damage their hearing after just 15 minutes of exposure to loud music .
The handing out of earplugs at gigs and festivals is long overdue , and music - lovers should look to other options on the market which do not affect sound quality .
Neon foam earplugs may not look particularly rock 'n'roll , but it 's about time that a rock band demonstrated the importance of hearing protection so people can continue to enjoy music for years ahead .
Just remember Morrissey wearing a hearing aid on Top of the Pops in the Eighties to support a female fan too embarrassed to wear one .
He made hearing aids look cool .
The sound and the fury Six of the loudest bands ever
Kiss
More than 30 years of performances and albums have made Kiss 's ear - splitting noise and make - up legendary among rock and metal lovers well after the American band rose to fame in the late 1970s .
The Who
In 1976 , The Who won the ' Guinness World Records ' title for " The Loudest Band in the World " , playing at 126dB .
Pete Townshend once apologised to fans who had been leaving concerts with their ears bleeding .
Kiss
More than 30 years of performances and albums have made Kiss 's ear - splitting noise and make - up legendary among rock and metal lovers well after the American band rose to fame in the late 1970s .
AC/DC
The Australian rock band 's " Black in Black " track for the eponymous album has an unforgettable riff that has led to them being hailed as one of the loudest bands ever .
Manowar
Snatched The Who 's title in 1994 when they played at 129.5dB , and , most recently in 2008 at 139dB .
As of 1994 , the ' Guinness World Records ' no longer celebrates the " The Loudest Band in the World " for fear of promoting damage to ears .
The Jesus And Mary Chain
The East Kilbride rockers , famous for rarely playing for more than 20 minutes , should have short , sweet and loud as a disclaimer .
" Inside Me " , from the 1985 album ' Psychocandy ' , is symptomatic of brothers Jim and William Reid 's penchant for decibels .
Black Sabbath
The 1970 song " Iron Man " is credited by ' NME ' as one of the loudest tracks of all time .
Formative in developing the heavy - metal genre , Black Sabbath are among the most influential of the loud bands .

From ABC News : Are ' Dead Peasant ' Life Insurance Policies Fair ?.
The anchors were " stunned " to find that this is going on after watching Michael Moore 's new movie , Capitalism a Love Story .
Maybe Claire Shipman would n't be so surprised if they were n't using a documentary film maker as their research department .
Life insurance used to be rather straightforward , known for offering security to loved ones in a tough time .
So when Irma Johnson learned that her husband , Daniel , who died of brain cancer , had been insured for $ 1.5 million , it should have been at least a small comfort .
But she did not receive the money .
His employer did .
It 's one of the strangest free - market perversions that Michael Moore highlights in his latest film , " Capitalism : A Love Story . "
In the corporate practice dubbed " Dead Peasants " life insurance , companies wager on employees ' lives , expecting to make money when they die .
And it 's pervasive , said Mike Myers , an attorney who has uncovered many of these cases and helped angry relatives sue .
" Life insurance is traditionally used to guard against the death of breadwinners .
This is an investment scheme , " he said .
Dozens of blue chip companies have these policies , according to Myers .
But only banks are forced to reveal them , and several have billions of dollars worth of policies .
" The driving force behind it is the tax deductions , " he said .
The life insurance policies were designed to allow companies to insure a few crucial executives .
Savvy companies then realized they could also get a tax break by insuring many lower - level employees .
The financial scheme does n't actually cost the employees anything , except , some say , their trust .
Betina Tillman felt shocked and deceived when a reporter from The Wall Street Journal told her that her brother , a music store cashier , was insured by his employer for $ 339,000 when he died , despite the fact that he no longer worked at the store .
" We were just in disbelief they were able to do it , and actually cash the policy and cash in on the policy , " Tillman said .
She sued , and won .
Now , the government mandates that companies obtain the consent of employees .
The US and China need , yet seem to fear , each other Chinese spies are aggressively stealing secrets to build up China 's military and economic power , a US advisory panel on US - China relations has warned .
Its members urged the US Congress to ensure the country was adequately protected against Chinese spying .
The report was published in the same week that US President Barack Obama made his first official visit to China .
A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington dismissed the allegations as baseless and irresponsible .
Sophistication ?
The report - which says China 's spying is becoming more intense and sophisticated - was produced by the US - China Economic and Security Review Commission .
" China is changing the way that espionage is being done , " said Carolyn Bartholomew , who chaired the commission .
CHINA AND US TIES Both veto holders on UN Security Council China is the biggest foreign investor in US treasury bonds , owning estimated $ 770 bn ( £ 457bn )
China is the world 's biggest greenhouse gas producer at 20.7 % of global emissions , followed by the US with 15.5 % US imports from China dwarf its exports , stoking trade tensions
China 's rising nationalism
The US - China power balance Col Gary McAlum , a senior military officer , told the commission the US defence department had detected 54,640 malicious cyber incidents to its systems in 2008 , a 20 % rise from a year earlier .
This figure was expected to jump 60 % this year , he said .
Not all these attacks are from China , but China was the largest culprit , the report said .
" A large body of both circumstantial and forensic evidence strongly indicates Chinese state involvement in such activities , " the commission said in its 367 - page report to Congress .
" China 's peacetime computer exploitation efforts are primarily focused on intelligence collection against US targets and Chinese dissident groups abroad . "
The report also said that Beijing was building a navy that could block the US military from reaching the region if fighting should break out between China and Taiwan .
The 12 - member bipartisan commission was set up in 2000 to analyse the implications of growing trade with China .
' Cold War fantasy '
The release of the report came as Mr Obama ended his first official trip to Asia , which included several days in Beijing , where he had extensive talks with President Hu Jintao .
A lonely figure on the Great Wall of China Wang Baodong , spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington , called the spying allegations " baseless , unwarranted and irresponsible " .
He called the commission 's suggestion that China 's navy was being built up to challenge the US in the Pacific a " Cold War fantasy " .
Mr Wang criticised the commission for recycling old , unproven allegations and for issuing an annual report " aimed at misleading the American public "
More broadly , the report expressed concern about the practice of reward and punishment practised over foreigners seeking access to China , saying it stifled their freedom to raise questions .
The commission also criticised China on its trade policy and said the US should support Taiwan 's military .
Mr Obama has yet to decide on the latest Taiwanese arms request .

Researchers who want animal sperm - to study fertility or for artificial insemination - have a suite of attractive options :
They can ram an electric probe up an animal 's rectum , shove an artificial
vagina onto the animal 's penis , or simply do it the old - fashioned way - manual stimulation .
The first option , electroejaculation , uses a priapic rectal probe to send electricity pulsing through the animal 's nether regions .
" All the normal excitatory signals that stimulate ejaculation , like touch , sight , sound and smell , can be replaced with the current from the probe , " says Trish Berger , professor of animal science at the University of California , Davis .
" It 's fascinating .
Of course , this is a woman talking . "
Electroejaculation generally requires anesthetizing the animal and is typically used on zoo dwellers .
The other two methods - the artificial vagina , or AV , and the good old hand - require that animals be trained to the procedure .
The AV - a large latex tube coated with warm lubricant - is used primarily to get sperm from dairy bulls ( considered the most ornery and dangerous of bovines ) .
The bull gets randy with a steer ; when he mounts the steer with his forelegs , a brave technician , AV in hand , insinuates himself between the two aroused beasts and deftly redirects the bull 's penis into the mock genitalia , which he must then hold tight while the bull orgasms .
( Talk about bull riding ! )
Three additional technicians attempt to ensure this ( fool ) hardy soul 's safety by anchoring themselves to restraining ropes attached to a ring in the bull 's nose .
Alas , this is n't always absolutely effective : Everyone who 's wielded an AV has had at least one close call , and more than a few have been sent to the hospital .
The much safer " digital pressure " is used mostly with pigs , who are trained from an early age to mount a small bench while the researcher reaches around with a gloved hand and provides appropriate pleasure - er , pressure .
It has been one of the great blogging success stories , not to mention literary mysteries .
But now the true identity of the Diary of a London Call Girl blogger has been revealed , by Belle de Jour herself .
The blog , based upon a secret life covering 14 months as a high class escort and prostitute in London , spawned a successful national newspaper column , a best - selling book and even a TV movie .
For a number of years now speculation has been rife as to who Belle de Jour really was , with the media ' outing ' everyone from the editor of the Erotic Review ( Rowan Pelling ) to best selling novelist and author of How To Lose Friends And Alienate people , Toby Young .
While the notion of Belle de Jour being a balding man was amusing , the actual revelation of identity has been no less shocking .
The woman behind the blog , and who did indeed work as a £ 300 per hour hooker in London six years ago , is actually now a respected research scientist called Dr Brooke Magnanti .
Dr Magnanti is a developmental neurotoxicology and cancer epidemiology specialist , and turned to prostitution in 2003 when she was having money troubles during the final stages of her PhD thesis .
The 34 year old told the Sunday Times that she has no regrets and that while she " did have another job at one point , as a computer programmer " she kept up with the prostitution as " it was so much more enjoyable " .
So there you have it , prostitution is more enjoyable than computer programming .
Truth be told , at a rate of £ 300 per hour it pays better as well .
Eine der größten Geheimniskrämereien der neueren deutschen Politik beginnt sich zu lichten .
Die deutsche LKW - Maut , trotz weltweit ausbleibender Aufträge von Politikern gern als " Exportschlager " gefeiert , offenbart sich im Detail als großes , gut funktionierendes Geldverschiebesystem , von dem Staat und Maut - Betreiber gleichermaßen profitieren .
Das jedenfalls legen etliche Dokumente zum Public - Private - Partnership - Projekt nahe , die Wikileaks in diesen Tagen veröffentlichen wird und die heise online vorliegen .
Bislang waren alle Versuche gescheitert , die Offenlegung des 17.000 Seiten starken Vertragswerks zu erreichen .
Üppige Renditen und überaus großzügige Wartungsgebühren offenbaren sich bei dem Blick in die Dokumente – und selbst bei den Summen für den nach 12 Jahren Maut - Betrieb vorgesehenen Abbruch des Gesamtsystems wird nicht gekleckert , sondern geklotzt .
Die LKW - Maut sorgt zwar für Einnahmen von ca. 3 Milliarden Euro per Jahr , doch der Maut - Betrieb ist dabei mit 700 Millionen selbst der größte Kostenfaktor .
Wie diese enorme Summe zustande kommt , zeigen Dokumente aus den Jahren 2002 bis 2003 , die die Whistleblower - Seite veröffentlichen will .
Ein erster Blick in das von der Bundesregierung akzeptierte Angebot vom Mautbetreiber Toll Collect zeigt die Maut als Geldverteiler .
So wurden die 300 Mautbrücken mit Bau , Installation und Haltung mit mindestens 511.000 Euro ( für eine dreispurige Brücke ) pro Brücke veranschlagt .
Für die kontinuierliche Softwareanpassung der Brückensysteme genehmigte man sich großzügig 24,8 Millionen Euro im Jahr .
Selbst für den einfachen Abbau einer Brücke wurden 30.500 Euro veranschlagt .
Für eine schon vorhandene Abrechnungssoftware setzte man eine Miete von ca.
150 Millionen pro Jahr an , die an die AGES überwiesen wurde , welche sich in letzter Minute in die Maut - Gemeinschaft eingeklagt hatte .
Ohnehin genehmigte sich der Betreiber eine Rendite von mehr als 1 Milliarde Euro bei Gesamtkosten von ca. 6 Milliarden .
Dies errechnete die Illustrierte Stern auf Basis einiger Kalkulationsdateien von Toll Collect .
Sie kam dabei auf eine Nettorendite von 19 Prozent .
Diese traumhaften Zahlen für das Maut - Konsortium sind wohl der Grund , warum die Maut - Verträge geheim sind , nicht die Technik .
Mehrfach betonen die Maut - Anbieter in den bislang der Presse vorgelegten Wikileak - Dokumenten , dass sie nur " Off the Shelf " - Produkte und erprobte Verfahren einsetzen wollen , nur bei der " Anwendung von Algorithmen zur Erkennung der Maut - Pflicht " wollte man ein eigenes , innovatives Verfahren der Bietergemeinschaft einsetzen .
Ein ausführlicher Hintergrundbericht über die vorliegenden Maut - Vertragsdokumenten erscheint auf heise online , sobald alle Dokumente von Wikileaks veröffentlicht sind .
Derzeit ist die Whistleblower - Site damit beschäftigt , unter 911.wikileaks.org über eine halbe Million Nachrichten zu veröffentlichen , die zeitlich um die Terroranschläge am 11 .

Since free trade replaced mercantilism , liberals have recognised that capitalism can do good even if that is not its first objective .
The benign force Adam Smith called the " invisible hand " was instrumental in the creation of modern journalism .
After stamp duty on newspapers was abolished in 1855 , allowing the price of a daily title to drop from 5d to 1d , new investment and technology produced a blitz of paper .
Newspapers were launched all over Britain .
And , since publishing them was now profitable , professional reporters were hired to replace the amateur ideologues that had filled the illegal , unstamped press with political passion but few facts .
The result was a diverse press that could perform the fourth estate duty of speaking truth to power .
Now a newspaper innovation has been launched that can help the free world 's news industry to recover the prosperity it first achieved under Queen Victoria .
Johnston Press , Britain 's most prolific newspaper publisher with 286 titles , will place the online content of six of its local titles behind paywalls .
Online readers of the Worksop Guardian , Ripley and Heanor News , Whitby Gazette , Northumberland Gazette , Carrick Gazette and Southern Reporter will have to pay £ 5 for a three - month subscription .
It was expected that Rupert Murdoch would be the first proprietor to admit the twin stark truths that journalism is not free and that no good has come of the nigh universal pretence that it should be .
But the News Corp chairman is not the only one who has noticed that free access to online journalism has been bad for newspaper profits , bad for their editorial independence and bad for representative democracy .
Pretending that online journalism costs nothing has left once great titles from Los Angeles to London in the same grim predicament .
Each has been obliged to subsidise its online presence from the revenue generated by its printed edition .
But it did not take the mightiest intellect to guess that people would be less willing to pay for the printed product if they could read its contents online for nothing .
Newspaper owners were persuaded that online publication should be free by a potent cocktail of commercial fantasy and woolly ideology topped with a sprinkling of youth appeal .
Plausible salespeople emerged from the wreckage of the dotcom boom to persuade them that advertisers would slash each other 's jugulars for the privilege of promoting their products beside the work of expensive columnists and correspondents .
Believing that links alone create value is no more rational than imagining that the mass turns comestibles into the flesh and blood of a prophet .
But newspapers were reluctant to admit the emperor was stark bollock naked for fear of sounding old - fashioned and remote from the pseudo - democratic ethos of the internet .
It is time to admit that giving away value is not remotely democratic .
In fact it undermines processes that keep representative democracy healthy .
In the first years of the internet era thousands of professional journalists have lost their jobs because online revenues cannot pay their salaries .
Trained reporters who sit in courts and council chambers have become rare .
Community reporting has been replaced by global celebrity gossip touted by PR companies .
The workings of the state are no longer monitored at first hand and the electorate is deprived of information it needs to exercise choice .
Johnston Press alone cannot restore sanity .
But the experiment it is launching should remind us that information required to hold power to account cannot be produced free of charge .
Good journalism supplies the raw material without which freedom of conscience becomes meaningless .
Ensuring its supply is essential .
The internet is a valuable tool .
It can bring inspiring , diligent and creative reporting into every home .
But it will not do so by obliging consumers to accept the shoddy , propagandist ranting some categorise as citizen journalism and less credulous critics recognise as a deplorable reversion to the days when news was always deployed as a political weapon and only occasionally reported .
Never mind that Johnston Press is primarily interested in profit .
It is no more a commercial entity than the Washington Post at the time of Watergate or the Sunday Times when it exposed the scandal of thalidomide .
It is leading a change that must happen .
People who care about democracy must hope it happens fast .
We have not attempted political freedom without well - funded , intelligent journalism , but we can assume that it would not be pretty .
When accurate reporting dies it is usually replaced by gossip , prejudice and bigotry .
Quantum computing promises ultra - fast communication , computation and more powerful ways to encrypt sensitive information .
But trying to use quantum states as carriers of information is an extremely delicate business .
Now two physicists have shown , mathematically , how to gently tease out unwanted knots in quantum communication , while keeping the information intact .
Their work is reported in the current issue of Physical Review Letters and highlighted with a Viewpoint in Physics ( http:// physics . aps. org / ) .
When two particles are entangled , they effectively act as a single entity , even though they might be on opposite ends of the galaxy .
Physicists can code information into particles to make quantum bits , or qubits , then entangle the qubits in an orderly fashion to form an entangled bit , or ebit .
Ebits can then be used to create incredibly tough codes or teleport information between two distant systems .
But messy entanglements among particles make qubits more susceptible to losing their encoded information .
Now Dong Yang and Jens Eisert of the University of Potsdam have shown how to delicately comb out a snarl of entanglements among many qubits while keeping the information intact .
They designate one qubit as a hub and then use a combination of two existing quantum protocols to transform the original cat 's cradle into an arrangement where entanglement fans out neatly from the hub qubit to each of the other qubits .
This looks like a primitive model for a quantum World Wide Web : individual users each form an ebit with a single quantum search engine , and send queries and receive results via quantum teleportation .

Nicola Puddicombe said she was thinking about killing her boyfriend months before he was discovered in her bed bludgeoned to death with an axe to his head , her former lover testified Wednesday in Ontario Superior Court .
Ashleigh Pechaluk told jurors it was in the fall or winter of 2005 when a distraught Puddicombe told her she could take no more of Dennis Hoy 's mental , emotional and physical abuse .
" What was your reaction ? " Crown attorney Tom Lissaman asked .
" Part schocked , " replied Pechaluk , adding quickly she thought Puddicombe was feeling that way " justifiably . "
Lissaman asked Pechaluk if Puddicombe indicated what " options " she was considering to murder Hoy , a GO Transit worker who was 36 when he was killed early on Oct. 27 , 2006 .
" She cooks for him all the time so she said she would put something in his food , " Pechaluk said .
" What did you say to that ? " Lissaman asked .
" I do n't think I said anything . "
" Did she tell you anything about the type of poison ? "
" No .
She made the comment .
I was n't going to dig deeper . "
Pechaluk , acquitted of murdering
Hoy earlier this year , was on the stand for the third day at Puddicombe 's first - degree murder trial .
The two women became involved in an intimate relationship almost a decade after Puddicombe , now 36 , began dating Hoy .
Pechaluk has portrayed Hoy as a controlling , manipulative and cruel man who belittled Puddicombe and knocked her around when she got out of line .
Puddicombe did n't break things off because she felt trapped and feared for the safety of herself , her family , dogs and Pechaluk , the 25 - year - old testified .
Pechaluk said Puddicombe told her Hoy had connections to an outlaw motorcycle gang and also carried an OPP badge as part of his job , giving him access to databases that would allow him to track her down if she left him .
On numerous occasions in early 2006 , Puddicombe also expressed the desire for something to happen to him , such as being in a car accident .
" What did you take those comments to mean , " Lissaman asked .
" She did n't like him .
She did n't want to be with him . "
But at other points in her testimony Pechaluk said Puddicombe was " torn " about her feelings for Hoy , even after he started seeing an old girlfriend .
" She loved a certain part and hated another , " Pechaluk said .

Alittle late in making those Thanksgiving flight plans ?
Wondering how you could possibly afford your ticket -- that is , without putting a kidney up for sale on Craigslist ?
Good news !
You can get a free flight home on Southwest plus a $ 300 travel voucher .
Just do what I plan to -- get on a Southwest flight in the next few days , and when it ’s taking off , shout over and over , “ Go , plane , go ! ” and “ I want Daddy !
I want Daddy ! ”
Pamela
Root got the free flight and the voucher , plus an apology from Southwest , after her 2 - year - old kept screaming those things at the top of his little lungs as their San Jose - bound flight was about to take off .
In fact , little Adam reportedly screamed so loudly that the safety announcements could n’t be heard and the pilot turned the plane back to the gate in Amarillo , Texas , where the two were booted off .
Root was appalled when a flight attendant told her something to the effect of “ We just ca n’t tolerate that [ screaming ] for two hours , ” reported the San Jose Mercury News .
Root insisted Adam would be “ fine once we take off ” -- which , in my book , means either “ He ’ll be fine ” or “ It would be a serious pain in the butt to be stuck in Amarillo another day . ”
Unbelievably , Root demanded the apology she eventually got from the airline ( shame , shame , Southwest ) and hit it up for the cost of diapers and the portable crib she says she had to buy for the overnight stay .
Even more unbelievably , there ’s still no word of any apology from Root to the other passengers .
There is a notion , reflected in numerous blog comments about the incident , that other passengers should “ just deal ” and “ give a kid a break . ”
This notion is wrong .
Parents like Root and others who selfishly force the rest of us to pay the cost of their choices in life are n’t just bothering us ; they ’re stealing from us .
Most people do n’t see it this way , because what they ’re stealing is n’t a thing we can grab on to , like a wallet .
They ’re stealing our attention , our time and our peace of mind .
More and more , we ’re all victims of these many small muggings every day .
Our perp does n’t wear a ski mask or carry a gun ; he wears Dockers and shouts into his iPhone in the line behind us at Starbucks , streaming his dull life into our brains , never considering for a moment whether our attention belongs to him .
These little acts of social thuggery are inconsequential in and of themselves , but they add up -- wearing away at our patience and good nature and making our daily lives feel like one big wrestling smackdown .
Southwest sent the right message in yanking Root and her screaming boy off the plane .
Unfortunately , it lacked the corporate courage to stand its ground , probably fearing a public relations nightmare from the Mommy Mafia .
Yet , almost every day , I encounter parents who need to get the same message Root initially did .
Trust me -- should I long to hear screaming children , I ’ll zip right past my favorite coffeehouse and go read my morning paper at Chuck E. Cheese .
I know , I know -- because I am not a parent I cannot possibly understand how hard it is to keep a child from acting out .
Actually , that probably has more to do with the way I was raised -- by parents I describe as loving fascists .
As a child , I was convinced that I could flap my arms and fly , but the idea that I could ever be loud in a public place that was n’t a playground simply did not exist for me .
I hear claims that some children are prone to tantrums no matter how exquisitely they are parented .
If this describes your child , there ’s a solution , and it is n’t plopping him in a crowded metal tube with hundreds of people who ca n’t escape his screams except by throwing themselves to their deaths at 30,000 feet .
Granted , there sometimes are extenuating circumstances , reasons parents and their little hell - raiser simply must take a plane .
Well , actually , there are two : dire family emergency ( Granny ’s actually dying , not just dying to see the little tyke ) and the need for a lifesaving operation for the wee screamer .
In all other cases , if there ’s any chance a child is still in the feral stage , pop Granny on a flight or gas up the old minivan .
It really does come down to this :
Your right to bring your screaming child on a plane ends where the rest of our ears begin .

Hillary Clinton has “ bombed ” again with another war story that never happened — this time in Belfast .
She said in a speech at Stormont last week on her whirlwind visit to Northern Ireland that the city ’s Europa Hotel was devastated by an explosion when she first stayed there in 1995 .
But the last terror strike on the landmark building was 1993 — TWO YEARS before she checked in as First Lady with President husband Bill .
Sunday Life has discovered that renovations had been completed on the hotel in January 1994 — 22 MONTHS before they stayed there .
She told a packed Assembly last Monday : “ When Bill and I first came to Belfast , we stayed at the Europa Hotel ... even though then there were sections boarded up because of damage from bombs . ”
However , hotel sources have confirmed there was “ no way ” there was a board in sight when the power couple arrived .
US Secretary of State Clinton ’s latest slip - up has echoes of her blooper last year — when she said she “ mis- spoke ” after telling a story about dodging sniper fire in Bosnia in 1996 .
Last night , one of Clinton ’s spokesmen told Sunday Life there was “ no comparison ” between the two incidents .
He added that she had simply been trying to express a sincere “ perception ” of a Belfast in darker days .
Ian Kelly said from his Washington office : “ I think what Secretary Clinton was trying to do was draw contrasts between contemporary Belfast , which I know has changed hugely from the Belfast of 1995 .
“ We not talking about the same thing [ as ‘ mis - speaking ’ in Bosnia ] .
Secretary Clinton was simply contrasting .
“ The place she had in her mind still had quite a bit of tension .
“ That was what she was trying to note — that there has been a real change since 1995 when there was real desire for change among mothers , fathers and children . ”
Yesterday , the Europa Hotel concierge who dealt with the Clintons during their 1995 stay , said he had “ no memories ” of any boards at the hotel then .
Martin Mulholland added : “ The hotel was spotless .
There had been no bombs and there was no scaffolds or wooden boards or anything like that when they came .
“ The place was spotless .
The only security or boards that went up were the ones put up by Bill Clinton ’s secret service team . ”
Our photos show Martin shaking then President Bill Clinton ’s hand outside the Europa when he came for his overnight stay on November 30 , 1995 .
Clinton ’s “ mis-remembrance ” could have been overlooked at the height of the Troubles , when the plush Europa became the most bombed hotel in the world .
Its windows were boarded up so many times after blasts that for a while it was dubbed “ Hardboard Hotel ” .
But the official history of the Europa — the book In The Headlines — lists the last successful bomb attack there as 1993 .
A skip lorry loaded with 500 - 1,000lb of explosives detonated near the hotel , ripping apart a side of the Grand Opera House and leaving a gaping hole in the Europa .
By August 1993 , however , it had been bought over by hotel
giant the Hastings Group , who gave it the sparkling new front we know today .
It was last March when Clinton claimed she bravely dodged sniper fire in Bosnia after landing in the conflict - torn country as First Lady in 1996 .
During a speech on Iraq — while battling against Barack Obama to become Democratic presidential nominee — she said : “ I remember landing under sniper fire .
There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport , but instead we just ran with our heads down to get in the vehicles to get to our base . ”
But her “ war story ” came back to haunt her when archive TV news footage had showed her walking calmly away from the plane with daughter Chelsea .
Red - faced Clinton confessed after : “ I did misspeak the other day .
This has been a very long campaign .
Last week for the first time in 12 years or so , I misspoke . ”
Another blunder came last April , when Clinton told on the campaign trail how Trina Bachtel was turned away for lack of health insurance and both she and her unborn baby died .
Miss Bachtel ’s grieving family , however , said the story was simply not true .
Despite the fact that Hillary mis-remembered her time living in the shadow of bombs at the Europa in 1995 , she returned to stay there last week .
Her entourage took over 110 rooms and , on her visit to Stormont last Monday , she hugged Martin McGuinness and talked of how Northern Ireland had transformed .

When Calvin Schaffer pinned on his police officer 's badge on February 27 , 2009 , he was n't planning on getting himself hauled into federal court for e-mailing nude pictures of himself to a woman he pulled over in a traffic stop .
But that 's exactly what happened , and Schaffer yesterday pleaded guilty in a Kansas court to a case that eventually involved even the FBI .
How did a local scandal become a federal issue ?
As The Topeka Capital - Journal puts it , " The e-mails crossed state lines and through several jurisdictions by traveling over the Internet through servers in California and Virginia . "
That was enough to trigger the Commerce Clause of the Constitution , and the feds charged Schaffer with wire fraud .
The court has scheduled a sentencing hearing for November 16 .
Server location : it matters
Back in February , Schaffer pulled a woman over on suspicion of driving while intoxicated .
According to the federal indictment , he then " offered assistance in connection with his official duties to a person he had previously arrested to seek dismissal of her criminal charges in exchange for a sexual relationship . "
Schaffer insists that the woman first sent him nude pictures of herself ; she told investigators that she played along with his advances on the way to jail and later recorded conversations with Schaffer , which she turned over to the FBI .
However the situation progressed , Schaffer admits that he later sent similar photos ( both nude and " partially nude " ) of himself back to the woman — using , believe it or not , " computer equipment belonging to the Goddard Police Department and the citizens of Goddard , Kansas . "
The coup de grace ?
He sent the e-mails when he was on duty .
He also tried twice to have the local prosecutor dismiss the charges against the woman .
Had Schaffer 's e-mails been routed through Kansas servers , the issue might have remained a local one , but the messages passed through servers on both coasts .
Once that happened , federal investigators and prosecutors could get involved in the case — as they can in many cases in which the Internet is used .
Schaffer had originally pleaded not guilty to the charges , but he changed his plea yesterday as part of a deal to reduce his sentence .
Goddard , a town of just 3,300 with only nine police officers , is n't used to so much attention .
As its police department website boasts , " residents enjoy a tranquil small town environment with a low crime rate .
The majority of crime reported is property and financial related ( i.e. theft , insufficient fund and forged checks , etc ) . "
The department 's motto is PRIDE — Pride , Respect , Integrity , Duty , Ethics — but we doubt the department is feeling much of it at the moment .

If you had the choice of being a product manager at either Yahoo or Google , which company would you choose ?
I ’m going to go out on a limb and say that most of us would choose to work at Google .
The press is filled with glowing stories about how great everything that Google touches is .
Of course , there ’s the free food at work angle also .
Likewise , Yahoo has been getting savaged in the press as they lose visitors , botch marketing agreements with Microsoft , and generally drop the ball .
However , it turns out that we might be making the wrong decision .
In the battle for capturing viewers for financial information , the Yahoo product managers are winning the battle hands down …
Statistics Do n’t Lie
Randall Stross over at the New York Times has taken a close look the ongoing battle between Google and Yahoo for Web users who are looking for timely financial news .
You might think that things are close or that Google is coming on strong .
You ’d be wrong .
Right now Yahoo ’s financial site is attracting 17.5 x the traffic that Google ’s financial site is getting .
You read that correctly : not 2x , not 10x , but 17.5 x !
This is not a recent occurrence either .
For the last 19 months ( 1.6 years if you care ) Yahoo Finance has been # 1 in this category .
Google is currently ranked 17th .
Yahoo was able to attract 21.7 M unique visitors while Google has only been able to attract 1.2 M unique visitors .
What Yahoo Product Mangers Are Doing Right
In talking with Yahoo ’s product managers Stross found that they had taken the time to sit down with their target audience and discover what they wanted – and what they did n’t want .
This research revealed that the more financial information that was presented to users , the greater their anxiety became .
Once the Yahoo product team had this break - through realization , they went ahead and took a page out of Apple ’s product playbook and created a very simple design that had a clean look that did n’t overload the visitor with too much information .
The Yahoo team also realized that one of their greatest assets was other Yahoo sites .
The Yahoo Finance team developed a great relationship with the Yahoo ’s front page team and they have worked together to identify what topics the Finance team could cover that would allow the front page team to send traffic to them .
Yahoo has achieved this product success with very little original content .
In fact , only about 5 % of the Yahoo Finance site ’s information is original .
Yahoo realizes that this is a weakness and they plan on boosting this to 10 % in the future .
Does Google Have The Better Product ?
Does anyone remember the VHS vs. Beta video tape format wars that happened so many years ago ?
It sure looks like we are looking at a repeat of this once again .
Google arguably has a technically superior financial site .
Goggle ’s strategy so far has been to offer visitors the best financial data and charts .
In the case that this is not enough , Google comes back and offers them even more data and charts .
One of the biggest drawbacks that the Google Finance team has is that Google ’s home page does not have a clear link to the Google Finance page .
It ’s entirely possible that a visitor to the Google home page may never learn that the Google Finance page even exists because the only reference to it is buried in a list of menu items .
One clear advantage that Google has over the Yahoo Finance page is that they offer free real - time price quotations obtained directly from the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq .
Yahoo
Finance on the other hand gets its stock prices from the BATS Exchange and they have a delay of roughly 1 minute .
Google visitors get real - time stock prices for free , Yahoo visitors have to pay for access to real - time quotes – $ 10.95 or $ 13.95 / month ( NYSE or Nasdaq ) .
Final Thoughts
Who ’s going to win this battle ?
You would think that that with Google ’s deep pockets they would eventually come out the victor .
However , it appears as though Google ’s product managers still do n’t get it .
A case in point is Google ’s new set of stock price charting tools that they call “ Technicals “ .
These tools allow users to analyze stock prices over time using 12 different technical formulas .
Based on what Yahoo has discovered about visitors to financial information pages , this new set of features will not boost Google ’s draw .
In the end , the product managers at Yahoo Finance understand that the best way for a free financial site to prosper is by including less mathematics and more entertainment .
The winner of this battle will inform their users just enough to answer their questions without causing them any unnecessary anxiety .
Product managers at Yahoo who are able to stay tuned into what their finance customers are really looking for will have have found yet another way that great product managers make their product (s ) fantastically successful .

What We ’ll Be Talking About Next Time
How are you at walking and chewing gum at the same time ?
It ’s sorta a classic challenge – do two different things simultaneously and do them well .
Product managers are facing the challenge today – cut the cost of their product and simultaneously use innovation in order to make their product more competitive .
How hard can that be ?

Newer workplace drug tests using hair samples reveal 10 times as many job applicants and employees taking cocaine and methamphetamine than had been found in urine tests .
Quest Diagnostics on Friday will release hair data for the first time that show that in the first half of 2009 cocaine was found in three of every 1,000 urine tests performed on job applicants and employees , whereas hair testing found cocaine in 32 of 1,000 .
For every 1,000 tests , methamphetamine showed up once in urine and nine times in hair .
Hair tests reveal far more drug users because they show a pattern going back three months , whereas urine tests are better at finding recent one - time use , but only drugs taken within the previous one to three days .
Urine tests are best at finding out if drugs were involved in a workplace accident or if a worker behaves suspiciously , but they also allow applicants to abstain from use in preparation for screening .
Urine tests show a decrease in workplace drug users from 13.6 % in 1988 to 3.5 % now , and Quest says drug use the last few years found in hair tests is also falling .
Urine tests show cocaine use is down 57 % since 2005 , while hair tests show a 36 % decline .
Urine tests show methamphetamine use has fallen 64 % for that same period , but hair tests show a 55 % decline , Quest says .
That helps allay employer fears that drug use only appeared to be declining because urine tests were being " beaten , " says Barry Sample Quest 's director of science and technology .
Hair tests are newer and cost about twice as much as urine tests , which range from less than $ 15 to $ 30 , depending on the number of tests , says Quest , which tested 9 million employees and job applicants last year .
It has performed 840,000 hair tests from 2005 through the first half of 2009 , enough to establish confidence in today 's first - time release of the data , Sample says .
Quest 's findings are not surprising and show differences in the detection window , says drug expert Stephen Higgins , a psychiatry and psychology professor at the University of Vermont .
Calls for the legalization of marijuana have yet to influence the workplace ; pot was found in 2 % of Quest 's tests in the first half of 2009 , down gradually from 2.5 % in 2005 .
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration data show a 0.3 % uptick in overall marijuana and hashish use from 2007 to 2008 .
No drug is demonstrating an upward trend in the workplace , Sample says .

If you have torn yourself away from the virtual library that is the Internet long enough to visit a real library , you know that the smell of old books  musty , slightly acidic , even grassy  is instantly recognizable .
But is it quantifiable ?
And if so , might old - book odor prove useful to librarians and conservators charged with preserving collections ?
Matija Strlic , a researcher with the Center for Sustainable Heritage at University College London , thinks it might .
With colleagues in Slovenia and with the assistance of the National Archives of the Netherlands , he has published proof - of - concept research that shows that it is possible to understand both the composition and condition of old paper by analyzing the volatile organic compounds they emit .
Image Credit ...
Chris Gash
Dr. Strlic said he got the idea one day at a library when he saw a conservator sniffing an old piece of paper , trying to determine what it was made of .
“ I thought , certainly a technique could be developed to do that more accurately , ” he said .
The approach is similar to breath analysis used to diagnose illness , he added .

It ’s been a busy month for the constitutional court in the tiny Gulf Arab nation of Kuwait .
Earlier this week , Kuwait ’s highest court ruled that women now have the right to obtain a passport without the consent of their husbands and guardians .
The ruling abrogated an article of a 1962 law that required women to gain their husband ’s signature on any passport application .
The court , following complaints from thousands of women who have petitioned to change the law , finally ruled that the article violated a number of constitutional provisions that guarantee personal freedom and gender equality .
The Kuwait Times , billed as the first daily in the Gulf , hailed the decision as “ historic ” and “ landmark ” in its piece on the ruling , and cited an interview with a Kuwaiti man who noted that the ruling was long overdue .
“ The court should have ruled on this issue a long time ago as women have already obtained the right to vote and run for office in parliament , ” Khalid Ahmed , a 32 - year - old Kuwaiti told the Kuwait Times .
But , even as some Kuwaitis were lauding the new advances , others were criticizing a “ controversial ” decision by one of Kuwait ’s four female members of parliament to fight another constitutional law .
Rola Dashti , who was elected to parliament in May , submitted a proposal to the court last week to remove a 2005 electoral law requirement that women must comply with Islamic Shariah law .
The law does n’t specify what that entails or which women it applies to .
Last week , the government ’s Fatwa Department complicated the matter when it ruled that under Shariah law , Muslim women are required to wear hijab .
Conservative lawmakers say that fatwa must apply to parliament ’s four female members ( two of whom wear hijab , two of whom two do not ) , the U.A.E. newspaper The National reports .
But Dashti has dismissed the fatwa as non-binding and has said that including Shariah regulations in the electoral law is a breach of the constitution .
“ The regulations clearly violate articles in the constitution which call for gender equality and make no reference to Sharia regulations , ” she told the AFP news agency .
The timing of the two constitutional court cases could n’t be more ironic and could indicate a significant shift in the cultural underpinnings of Kuwaiti society .
Within the same month , Kuwaitis on seemingly polar opposite ends of the ideological spectrum are attempting to make their voices heard , for what they believe to be the good of the nation .
It ’s a delicate dance between those who are fighting to allow women more rights and those who would prefer she stay within the status quo .
But also of note are the mostly positive reactions to change in the country from major media outlets in the Gulf and the wider Middle East .
A Voice of America news report quotes Hala Mustafa , of Egypt ’s Al - Ahram newspaper , as saying the passport ruling is a “ positive ” sign of progress .
Meanwhile , an editorial in the Kuwait Times warns that the parliamentary hijab situation could spell “ a recipe for disaster ” for the country .
The Times ’ Badrya Darwish , heavy on the sarcasm , asks :
“ How come the issue of hijab and niqab and the dress code among women is a major issue in the Arab world today ?
As I already wrote earlier this week , Egypt has a dispute over hijab or niqab .
It looks like everything is peaceful in the Middle East .
Business is booming .
Economy is flourishing .
Democracy prevails everywhere .
There is stability and security at its best . ”
The court is due to rule on the hijab issue next week , but in the meantime , one ca n’t help but wonder if Kuwait is in the midst of a paradigm shift in popular opinion of women ’s rights .
The “ Religious Literacy Dictionary ” in Stephen Prothero ’s 2007 bestseller , Religious Literacy , devotes less than two pages to “ Buddhism , ” but spends seven lines making the point that “ Buddhists have not been particularly active in American politics . ”
This notion , accurate or not , is probably the perception of most Americans , many of whom have little real awareness of the 2,500 - year - old tradition to begin with .
It may also explain why President Obama ’s 25 - member Advisory Council on Faith - based and Neighborhood Partnerships ( which just launched its official Web site ) currently lacks a Buddhist representative , despite the presence of at least one appointee from the other four major world religions .
That said , it bears mentioning that Buddhists have been conspicuously absent from many of the administration ’s conversations about and efforts around religion in America .
We were not included , for example , in President Obama ’s inaugural address , which was addressed to “ Christians , Jews , Muslims , Hindus , and non-believers . ”
In response , the noted scholar - practitioner Robert Thurman quipped at a City & Arts Lectures event in San Francisco that perhaps the Commander - in - Chief was including Buddhists , who do n’t always fit into traditionally theistic models of religion , among the “ non-believers . ”
This might be true , but I ’d like to advance a case for including Buddhists more explicitly in the Oval Office ’s work with religious organizations and services .
Admittedly , we Buddhists in America are few when compared with our sisters and brothers from , say , the Judeo - Christian religious traditions ; the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life ’s U.S. Religious Landscape Survey found that those who identify as Buddhist comprise 0.7 % of the US population .
Still , according to the think tank ’s findings , of the five major world religions , Buddhism has the third largest following in the United States , with more adherents than Islam and Hinduism .
In addition , Buddhist Americans comprise an incredibly unique and vibrant population — so much so that Los Angeles , for example , has become , as Harvard Divinity School ’s Diana L. Eck has noted , “ the most complex Buddhist city in the entire world . ”
When you think about it , we have also left a remarkable legacy of offerings for our fellow Americans , both Buddhist and non-Buddhist .
Consider , for example , the many temples and centers that serve as important hubs of religious education , spirituality , and community in and around large ethnic enclaves throughout the country , such as those under the purview of the Buddhist Churches of America or the Buddhist Council of New York .
Consider Naropa University , the Institute of Buddhist Studies , University of the West , and Soka University of America — the four fully - accredited , Buddhist - affiliated , degree - granting institutions of higher education in the United States .
Consider the Insight Meditation Society , the San Francisco Zen Center , and Shambhala Mountain Center , each of which attract thousands of visitors every year for programs of contemplative practice and study .
Consider Maitri Compassionate Care in San Francisco , a very early North American AIDS hospice established by the late Issan Dorsey of the Hartford Street Zen Center .
Consider the Prison Dharma Network and the National Prison Hospice Association , both founded by Sensei Fleet Maull of the Zen Peacemaker Order .
Consider the Ikeda Center for Peace , Learning , and Dialogue at Cambridge , founded by Daisaku Ikeda , president of Soka Gakkai International .
Consider the Bay Area - based Buddhist Peace Fellowship , which mobilizes dozens of chapters and thousands of members around important social and political issues .
Consider publications like Tricycle : The Buddhist Review and Shambhala Sun ( for whom I blog ) that have found appeal beyond just their target demographic .
Consider the work of Buddhists in professional chaplaincy , which has been explored in recent articles in both the New York Times and Los Angeles Times .
Consider the newly founded , New York - based Buddhist Global Relief , whose mission is to “ provide relief to the poor and needy throughout the world regardless of nationality , ethnicity , gender , or religion . ”
These are but a very few examples of the incredible work of Buddhists in America .
A Buddhist representative on the Council on Faith - based and Neighborhood Partnerships , then , seems quite appropriate , given that it is an initiative tasked with “ [ forming ] partnerships … to more effectively serve Americans in need . ”
It is worth mentioning too that Buddhist practices and ideas have begun to leave an indelible impression on the culture at large .
Of special note , many non-Buddhist Americans have found the tradition ’s teachings and tools helpful in their pursuit of better mental health .
The historical Buddha , who abandoned a life of opulence and privilege in order that he might better understand the workings of his own mind and experience true spiritual awakening , once said simply , “ I teach only suffering and the end of suffering . ”
So profound were his insights and those of his interlocutors throughout the ages , however , that modern psychologists and other caring professionals , particularly those in the United States , have found great utility in them .
The emergence of such treatments as mindfulness - based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , mindfulness - based cognitive therapy ( MBCT ) , and dialectical behavior therapy ( DBT ) , as well as further developments in other cognitive and behavioral therapies , owe much to Buddhist understanding .
There is also a great deal of anecdotal evidence to support claims about the growing influence of the tradition in caregiving and counseling generally .
I find it telling , for example , that HBO , as part of a recent documentary produced to promote their psychotherapy - centered series In Treatment , made it a point to include Buddhist psychologist Mark Epstein alongside notable Freudians , Jungians , and others representing more traditional schools of thought in the field .
Additionally , the medical industry ’s growing appreciation of Buddhist mindfulness practice ( or , the training of the mind to become more aware of the present moment without investment in evaluative thinking and the compulsion to jump from discursive thought to discursive thought ) has had a marked effect on the treatment of stress , chronic pain , and other health issues in the United States .
In 2007 , the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine , one of the National Institutes of Health , found that more than 20 million Americans had used meditation techniques derived from Buddhist or Hindu traditions for various health reasons in the previous twelve months .
Furthermore , in a USA Today article published this past summer , Jon Kabat - Zinn , Professor of Medicine Emeritus and founding director of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine , Health Care , and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School , was quoted as saying that there are now more than 240 programs in clinics and hospitals across the country that offer some kind of program in mindfulness meditation instruction .
By running tests on and studies of longtime monastic practitioners , neurologists like the University of Wisconsin ’s Richard Davidson are also beginning to scientifically verify Buddhist claims like that of the eighth - century pundit Shantideva :
“ All the suffering in the world comes from seeking pleasure for oneself ; all the happiness in the world comes from seeking pleasure for others . ”
In addition to discovering something about the nature of happiness from them , scientists are learning more about neuroplasticity , or ongoing brain development , by studying Buddhist contemplatives as well .
All of these findings have been striking enough , in fact , to inspire various high - profile conferences and meetings between scientists and Buddhists .
In 2005 , for example , His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet was invited by the Stanford University School of Medicine to dialogue with a panel of distinguished neuroscientists .
In short , Buddhist Americans and their work should not be overlooked .
Indeed , how helpful a Buddhist representative might be on something like the President ’s Advisory Council on Faith - based and Neighborhood Partnerships !
One hopes that this will be recognized sooner rather than later .
To be fair , council members are appointed to one - year terms , which allows for the possibility of lots of diverse participation over time ; hopefully , there will be many opportunities in the future for Buddhists to take part .
There is certainly no shortage of excellent candidates to choose from — Jack Kornfield of Spirit Rock Meditation Center , Bishop Socho Koshin Ogui of the Buddhist Churches of America , Zenju Earthlyn Manual of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship , Bhante Chao Chu of the Los Angeles Buddhist Union , B. Alan Wallace of the Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies , Roshi Joan Halifax of the Upaya Zen Center , Bhante Kondanna of the Staten Island Buddhist Vihara , Jan Willis of Wesleyan University , and two - time Colbert Report guest Lama Surya Das are just a few names that come immediately to mind .
President Obama has said :
The particular faith that motivates each of us can promote a greater good for all of us .
Instead of driving us apart , our varied beliefs can bring us together to feed the hungry and comfort the afflicted ; to make peace where there is strife and rebuild what has broken ; to lift up those who have fallen on hard times .
The administration can acknowledge the reality of religious pluralism in America and thusly promote the greater good for all by ensuring that a wide range of religious and non-religious representatives — a wide range that will necessarily include Buddhist Americans — is in dialogue on the Council on Faith - based and Neighborhood Partnerships .
Like their sisters and brothers from various other backgrounds , Buddhist Americans clearly have wisdom to bring and important contributions to make to national service efforts .
If you think the Afghanistan war effort was screwed up before , just you wait .
President Hamid Karzai has won , by default , a second term as president after his main rival decided the elections were too corrupt to run in .
That means Afghanistan avoids a messy , logistically challenging runoff vote .
But it also leaves a kleptocratic system intact – and raises serious questions about what exactly the United States and NATO are supposed to do next in Afghanistan .
One of the primary goals in a counterinsurgency campaign to legitimize and win support for the local government .
Which is kind of tricky , when the head of that government presided over a sham election .
A short recap : Afghan election officials today canceled a second - round presidential vote after the withdrawal of Karzai 's challenger , Abdullah Abdullah .
Over the weekend , Abdullah dropped out of the race , telling reporters a " transparent election is not possible " in Afghanistan ; Karzai responded by telling Radio Azadi that he oh - so - sincerely wished that his rival had stayed in the race .
" It would have been to the benefit of all of us , " Karzai said .
" In any case , he is free to make up his own mind . "
The transcript of the interview with Karzai is definitely worth reading .
As it happens , Karzai actually met with Abdullah before the announcement , a meeting the incumbent described as " a private talk between the two of us . "
I 'd love to know what transpired there :
Was some kind of deal made ?
Did Afghan CEO former U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad just happen to be hanging around the presidential palace ?
Either way , Karzai's " win " raises a whole host of questions about U.S. decisionmaking on Afghanistan :
Why invest so much in elections that were clearly flawed ?
Why did we keep so many bad actors on our payroll for so long ?
And then – just as Karzai is about to win another term – why " accidentally " leak compromising information about Karzai 's brother ?
The scrapping of this weekend 's vote and the confirmation of Karzai may speed a decision on troop levels by President Barack Obama .
But the administration 's new Afghanistan strategy may also require working around – as well as working with – Karzai 's administration .
A big part of a big part of Abdullah 's platform was a pledge to devolve power to Afghanistan 's regions – and take power out of the president 's hands .
At present , the president directly appoints provincial governors and district chiefs .
Abdullah and his backers argued that decentralizing power would create an Afghanistan that is more democratic , and more accountable .
Now reform seems like a more distant prospect .
It will be interesting to see if the United States pushes for changes to Afghanistan 's political system as a rising insurgency continues to threaten security .

Men who regularly take part in moderate - to - heavy intensity exercise such as jogging , tennis or swimming may be less likely to have a stroke than people who get no exercise or only light exercise , such as walking , golfing , or bowling , according to a study published in the November 24 , 2009 , print issue of Neurology® , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology .
However , exercise did not have a protective effect against stroke for women .
Women who took part in moderate - to - heavy intensity exercise did not have a reduced risk of stroke .
The study involved 3,298 people living in northern Manhattan , NY , with an average age of 69 who were followed for about nine years .
During that time , there were 238 strokes .
A total of 41 percent of the participants reported that they participated in no physical activity .
Twenty percent regularly participated in moderate - to - heavy intensity activities .
Men who participated in moderate - to - heavy intensity activities were 63 percent less likely to have a stroke than people with no physical activity .
The baseline risk of ischemic stroke over five years in the entire group was 4.3 percent ; among those with moderate - to - heavy intensity activities the risk was 2.7 percent , and among those with no activity it was 4.6 percent .
" Taking part in moderate - to - heavy intensity physical activity may be an important factor in preventing stroke , " said study author Joshua Z. Willey , MD , of Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia .
Willey is also a member of the American Academy of Neurology .
" A large percentage of the participants were not taking part in any physical activities .
This may be true of many elderly people who live in cities .
Identifying ways to improve physical activity among these people may be a key goal for public health . "
These results are contrary to some other studies that found that even light intensity physical activity reduced the risk of stroke .
Willey said the number of participants may not have been large enough to detect subtle differences in the group that took part in only light physical activity .
Stroke is the leading cause of disability and the third - leading cause of death in the United States .
The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health .
Senate kills census citizenship amendment
By Ed O'Keefe
Sens. David Vitter ( R - La. ) and Robert Bennett ( R - Utah ) wanted the Census Bureau to ask about citizenship status next year .
Updated 2:28 p.m. ET
The Senate voted Thursday to block a Republican attempt to require the Census Bureau to ask people for their citizenship status during next year 's decennial census .
Lawmakers voted 60 to 39 to effectively kill an amendment by Sens. David Vitter ( R - La. ) and Robert Bennett ( R - Utah ) that would have excluded illegal immigrants from population totals used to apportion Congressional seats in each state .
The pair argued that the high numbers of illegal immigrants in larger , heavily - urbanized states would mean that at least nine other states would lose Congressional seats following next year 's census .
The proposed amendment would have been added to the 2010 Commerce , Justice and Science Appropriations Bill .
Several immigration and civil rights advocacy groups said the proposal would lead to a severe undercount of Hispanics and other immigrant groups fearful of potential punishment .
The Census Bureau warned that passage of the amendment would add billions of dollars in costs to the 2010 Census to print new forms and retrain workers .
By law , the decennial census counts the actual number of people living in the United States , without regard to citizenship status .
Critics also noted that the Constitution 's Fourteenth Amendment , states that " Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each state . "
( Emphasis added . )
" We commend the Senate for standing up for the Constitution and for sparing the nation from the damage the amendment would have done to the Census and to the civil rights of millions of people -- both native - born and immigrant -- who would have been discouraged from being counted had the amendment passed , " said Wade Henderson , president of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights .
" We also hope that today 's vote sends a strong message that the Senate is committed to a 2010 census in which every person counts and every person is counted . ”
The Service Employees International Union had also opposed the measure , arguing it might have scared several of its members to not fill out census forms .
SEIU Executive Vice President Eliseo Medina applauded the Senate 's move , calling the Vitter - Bennett amendment a " misguided attempt to undercut 2010 enumeration efforts and mar this critical process with hateful , anti-immigrant politics . "
By law , the decennial census only counts the actual number of people living in the United States and does not account for citizenship .

Researchers from Stony Brook University Medical Center in New York have confirmed that Homo floresiensis is a genuine ancient human species and not a descendant of healthy humans dwarfed by disease .
Using statistical analysis on skeletal remains of a well - preserved female specimen , researchers determined the " hobbit " to be a distinct species and not a genetically flawed version of modern humans .
Details of the study appear in the December issue of Significance , the magazine of the Royal Statistical Society , published by Wiley - Blackwell .
In 2003 Australian and Indonesian scientists discovered small - bodied , small - brained , hominin ( human - like ) fossils on the remote island of Flores in the Indonesian archipelago .
This discovery of a new human species called Homo floresiensis has spawned much debate with some researchers claiming that the small creatures are really modern humans whose tiny head and brain are the result of a medical condition called microcephaly .
Researchers William Jungers , Ph.D. , and Karen Baab , Ph.D. studied the skeletal remains of a female ( LB1 ) , nicknamed " Little Lady of Flores " or " Flo " to confirm the evolutionary path of the hobbit species .
The specimen was remarkably complete and included skull , jaw , arms , legs , hands , and feet that provided researchers with integrated information from an individual fossil .
The cranial capacity of LB1 was just over 400 cm , making it more similar to the brains of a chimpanzee or bipedal " ape- men " of East and South Africa .
The skull and jawbone features are much more primitive looking than any normal modern human .
Statistical analysis of skull shapes show modern humans cluster together in one group , microcephalic humans in another and the hobbit along with ancient hominins in a third .
Due to the relative completeness of fossil remains for LB1 , the scientists were able to reconstruct a reliable body design that was unlike any modern human .
The thigh bone and shin bone of LB1 are much shorter than modern humans including Central African pygmies , South African KhoeSan ( formerly known as ' bushmen " ) and " negrito " pygmies from the Andaman Islands and the Philippines .
Some researchers speculate this could represent an evolutionary reversal correlated with " island dwarfing . "
" It is difficult to believe an evolutionary change would lead to less economical movement , " said Dr. Jungers .
" It makes little sense that this species re-evolved shorter thighs and legs because long hind limbs improve bipedal walking .
We suspect that these are primitive retentions instead . "
Further analysis of the remains using a regression equation developed by Dr. Jungers indicates that LB1 was approximately 106 cm tall ( 3 feet , 6 inches ) -- far smaller than the modern pygmies whose adults grow to less than 150 cm ( 4 feet , 11 inches ) .
A scatterplot depicts LB1 far outside the range of Southeast Asian and African pygmies in both absolute height and body mass indices .
" Attempts to dismiss the hobbits as pathological people have failed repeatedly because the medical diagnoses of dwarfing syndromes and microcephaly bear no resemblance to the unique anatomy of Homo floresiensis , " noted Dr. Baab .

From the Tax Foundation via Bruce McQuain , I do n't think this needs any comment :
Take a decently sized housecat .
Let 's say a cat that is well - fed and weights 7.5 kilograms .
We can all comprehend such a mass .
It 's not too small , neither too big .
A cat is something we can pick up and lift in earth 's gravitational field .
Let 's give each person in the world a cat .
You need a massive number of cats with a huge total weight .
The total mass of cats needed equates to the mass of the largest concrete structure ever build : the Three Gorges Dam .
This dam is big , but not just big .
It 's awesome .
Imagine pouring a tonne of concrete every minute of the day , seven days a week , during a period of more than a century .
That is Three Gorges .
Now build such a dam for every single living human being .
That is a lot of concrete with a total mass equal to the mass of Vesta , the second most massive body in the asteroid belt of our planetary system .
We are talking here about a massive piece of rock five - hundred - thirty kilometers across .
Repeat again .
Every human receives an asteroid the size of Vesta , rendering a total mass equal to that of the giant fusion reactor that keeps us warm in our cold and dark universe : the sun .
The sun seems so common from our distant perspective , a disk of the size of the moon albeit considerably brighter .
Yet the size of the sun is beyond comprehension .
Reduce the sun to the size of our earth , and it would occupy an area in the sky 12,000 times smaller than the sun we know .
But we are n't there yet .
Repeat once more .
Give each living person a sun .
You now have a mass second to none .
Spectacular gravitational forces pull all this mass inward .
Even if you have anticipated this gravitational pull and carefully spread the billions of suns over a volume far beyond the solar system , hell will brake loose .
Nature does not allow a concentrated mass of this size being causally connected to our universe .
An event horizon will form beyond which the black hole hides and only the gravitional attraction remains .
The formation of a black hole is inevitable .
You better hide till this gravitational armageddon is over .
Whilst billions of suns , billions times billions Vestas , billions times billions times billions Three Gorges Dams , and billions times billions times billions times billions cats get swallowed , ultra high energy gamma rays and powerful relativistic jets emerge .
The gamma rays spread over the entire universe , whilst the plasma jets penetrate thousands of light years into intergalactic space thereby forming one of the largest objects in the universe .
It takes a while , but at some moment in time all the mass has been swallowed .
Dust has settled ( or rather has been swallowed ) and you are left with a supermassive black hole of size equal to the black hole in galaxy M87 .
This is the largest known black hole occupying the center of a galaxy .
A black hole larger in size than our entire planetary system .
Following the gravitional apocalyps we just witnessed , this giant black hole is extremely quiet .
An object of supreme peacefulness .
It is black after all , and nothing is supposed to leave the black hole .
However , some very faint glow will emerge .
As Hawking has thought us , black holes emit energy and slowly but steadily evaporate .
Do n't expect any bright light .
Black holes typically emit low - energy radio waves with wavelengths comparable to the size of the black hole .
Black holes are matter crushers that transform matter into radiation .
However , the process can be painstakingly slow as the radiation power of black holes is inversely proportional to the square of their mass .
The result is that our six - and - a - half billion suns shine with a mere total power of 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 002 Watt .
It will take a while before all the mass in the black hole is consumed and emitted in the form of radiation .
We are not too far off calling this a black hole : no known object is anywhere near in darkness to this supermassive black hole .
As we have seen , the size of the black hole we build is huge .
When placed at sun 's position , it covers the orbits of all planets .
Light would take four - and - a - half days to circumvent this giant black hole .
We have also seen that its mass is spectacular .
So we have an enormous object with a spectacular mass .
What is the ratio between these two large numbers ?
What is the mass divided by volume , or the density of this black hole ?
The answer might surprise you .
This cosmic giant has a density of 0.5 mg/cm3 , less than half the density of earth 's atmosphere at sea level .
Why are giant black holes so sparse ?
The standard answer used to be : Einstein 's theory of gravity says so .
But a more modern , and arguably more insightful , view is : when limited to any smaller region , nature would n't be able to handle the amount of data that needs to be tracked and memorized to transfer mass into radiation .
As we saw , black holes are matter crushers that translate matter in to radiation .
But black holes do not do this in a random way .
It is done in such a way that no information gets lost .
When all the matter has been transferred into radiation , by measuring the state of each photon that has been emitted by the black hole , one can in principle calculate back the precise configuration of matter that entered the black hole .
Each photon of radiation that leaves the black hole caries away some bits of information .
The total number of photons that get emitted during the evaporation of the black hole is roughly equal to the number of Planck areas that fit onto the black hole horizon .
This all hints towards a fundamental constraint on storage of information : in a given spherical region of space nature can store an amount of information that is proportional to the area of that sphere .
This is the holographic principle , proposed 16 years ago by Gerard 't Hooft .
It seems that the holographic principle sets a clear constraint to the yet - to - be - found theory of quantum gravity .
So , black holes are matter crushers , and their horizons are giant cosmic flash memories that capture and record the information contained in the infalling objects utilizing Planck scale discretization .
Each bit of information that enters the black hole increases its horizon area by a few Planck areas , whilst each bit of information carried away by an evaporating photon makes the horizon shrink by an equal amount .
At the very heart of the holographic principle is the phenomenon of black hole complementarity proposed by Lenny Susskind .
Whilst a free falling observer would fall through the horizon of a giant black hole without noticing anything unusual , a stationary observer hoovering outside the black hole observes all matter and the information therein being deposited at the black hole horizon and eventually being re-emitted as Hawking radiation .
Black hole complementarity tells us that both descriptions represent equally valid and causally disconnected histories that can not lead to any inconsistencies .
Quantum physics is weird .
And even more so when applied to black holes .
Months ago the president of CNN / U.S. , Jonathan Klein , offered a choice to Lou Dobbs , the channel ’s most outspoken anchor .
Mr. Dobbs could vent his opinions on radio and anchor an objective newscast on television , or he could leave CNN .
For a time , Mr. Dobbs did tone down his TV rhetoric , but on Wednesday he made a more drastic decision :
He chose opinion .
Mr. Dobbs told viewers that he was resigning from his CNN job immediately .
Sitting before an image of an American flag on his studio set , he said “ some leaders in media , politics and business have been urging me to go beyond the role here at CNN and to engage in constructive problem solving as well as to contribute positively to the great understanding of the issues of our day . ”
He remained vague about how he would contribute “ to the national conversation , ” saying that he was considering “ a number of options and directions . ”

The UK government 's chief science adviser has told BBC News that he supports the former chief drugs adviser 's scientific view on cannabis .
Professor John Beddington , the UK's chief scientist , would not be drawn on whether the Home Secretary was wrong to sack Professor David Nutt .
David Nutt was chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs .
He was fired after using a lecture to say cannabis was less harmful than alcohol and tobacco .
Asked whether he agreed with Professor Nutt 's view that cannabis was less harmful than cigarettes and alcohol , Professor Beddington replied : " I think the scientific evidence is absolutely clear cut .
I would agree with it . "
This is a single instance where there has been a problem .
In my two years in government there has only been an instance with the ACMD
Professor John Beddington Professor Beddington is the man ultimately responsible for scientific advice in government .
He said that he believed that the sacking had occurred because of a breakdown in trust between Professor Nutt and the Home Secretary Alan Johnson .
" I think it 's very difficult - when clearly trust had broken down between the Home Secretary and Professor Nutt - to see how that could go on , " he told BBC News .
He stressed the importance placed by government on obtaining clear - cut scientific advice from experts .
He added : " I think it 's fair to say we need to make a distinction between scientific advice and evidence , which is the role of experts and scientific committees , and the role of ministers , which is to make policy . "
Inner workings
He said he did not believe that the incident revealed an underlying problem in the way government used scientific advice .
" There has been a lot of concern in the media that this is in some sense an undermining of the way in which government uses scientific advice .
Let me put it in context : there are more than 75 scientific advisory committees , " he said .
" This is a single instance where there has been a problem .
In my two years in government there has only been an instance with the ACMD . "
Professor Beddington said that he would urgently consult with other heads of expert committees to see if they had experienced difficulties in their role .
However , some senior scientists who advise government feel that the Nutt affair is reflective of the inner workings of providing scientific advice in Whitehall .
Many of the advisers I spoke to felt that their committees produce reports whose conclusions are inadequately reported because the publicity is tightly controlled by government press officers .
These advisers did not want to be quoted .
Scientists are sometimes required to sign confidentiality agreements - a practice said to exist for commercial reasons .
But critics claim the agreements can act as a legal gag on scientists who speak out on government initiatives .
" I 'm going to be talking to the advisory committees , I 'm going to get feedback from the chairmen .
There are going to be cases where there has to be non-disclosure , " Professor Beddington said .
" I want to know whether those cases are appropriate - if there is commercial confidentiality or there are sensitivities - or whether they are blanket . "
He added : " If there was so many problems , we would not get the quality of scientific advice we get . "

Marc Morano , probably first up against the wall , had this post a while back with a number of public threats , from TPM , Joe Romm , Joe Kennedy , Grist Magazine , David Suzuki , and James Hansen , among others .
It used to irk Melissa Calapini when her 3 - year - old daughter , Haley , hung around her father while he fixed his cars .
Ms. Calapini thought there were more enriching things the little girl could be doing with her time .
But since the couple attended a parenting course  to save their relationship , which had become overwhelmed by arguments about rearing their children  Ms. Calapini has had a change of heart .
Now she encourages the father - daughter car talk .
“ Daddy ’s bonding time with his girls is working on cars , ” said Ms. Calapini , of Olivehurst , Calif .
“ He has his own way of communicating with them , and that ’s O.K . ”
As much as mothers want their partners to be involved with their children , experts say they often unintentionally discourage men from doing so .
Because mothering is their realm , some women micromanage fathers and expect them to do things their way , said Marsha Kline Pruett , a professor at the Smith College School for Social Work at Smith College and a co-author of the new book “ Partnership Parenting , ” with her husband , the child psychiatrist Dr. Kyle Pruett ( Da Capo Press ) .
Iran , and Hezbollah are engaged in a war .
Only the tip of the iceberg surfaces once in a while , yet this is a war in every way , and it takes place every day and every hour .
On Sunday , according to Lebanese sources , we saw one of the rare appearances of this war in the public arena .
The beginning of what we saw on Sunday was a huge blast in the heart of Damascus on February 12 , 2007 .
Just like all the other people residing in the Damascus neighborhood , people at 17 Nissan Street also must have rushed to the window to see what happened .
They saw a giant flame that resulted from the explosives planted in the jeep that blew up , killing Imad Mugniyah .
A European diplomat who at the time was deployed in Damascus said that the horror of this assassination , which was attributed to Israel ’s Mossad , could be seen not only in the eyes of Hezbollah , Hamas , and Islamic Jihad members who reside in Damascus .
It was also apparent in the embarrassed looks in the eyes of members of Syria ’s defense and intelligence establishment .
They realized that if Mugniyah can be blown up at the heart of the city ’s most secure neighborhood , it is possible to reach any site – even 17 Nissan Street .
Spying Games Hezbollah :
We discovered Israeli wire taps Ynet Lebanese media report that blast heard near towns of Houla and Mais al - Jabal that ' was caused by discovery of breach in Hezbollah telecommunications network . '
According to report , two cables found – one for listening , one for broadcast Hezbollah :
We discovered Israeli wire taps
In the wake of the assassination , the defense and internal security establishments of Syria , Lebanon , and Hezbollah embarked on an aggressive search for the assassins or any sign of a leak .
This search was similar to the one for people who may have leaked information about Syria ’s nuclear project .
On both fronts , the mystery still looms large for the three interested parties : Syria , Iran , and Hezbollah .
Who ’s winning the war ?
The Syrians and Iranians always feared Israeli bugging .
Throughout the 1960s , the Syrians discovered on several occasions strange devices hidden underground .
When they attempted to dismantle them , the devices exploded and killed the technicians .
The next time it happened to them was in the beginning of March 1978 , when they engaged in infrastructure work around a phone line that connected a military base to the Damascus switchboard .
The device exploded , killing 12 people .
This did not only happen in Syria .
In the “ October War ” museum in Cairo , there is a phone pole on display that the Egyptians claim was replaced by Israeli Special Forces by another pole containing a bugging device .
In the wake of the strike on the Syrian reactor , Mugniyah ’s assassination , the bombing of the arms convey from Iran to Hamas via Sudan , and other incidents that made them feel transparent to Israel ’s intelligence services , Hezbollah , Lebanon ’s internal security service , the Iranians , and the Syrians embarked on an attempt to identify the sources of the leak that prompted the deeds attributed to Israel .
Simultaneously , the Lebanese received American training and technical assistance that greatly advanced their technological capabilities to uncover spies .
So who ’s winning this secret war ?
If Israel indeed stood behind the espionage ring exposed in Lebanon and the planting of the bugging devices , as the Lebanese media claim , then Jerusalem sustained several harsh blows in the past year .
On the other hand , only those who do nothing never make mistakes .
During this period , Hezbollah experienced two highly embarrassing incidents where illegal arms depots blow up , not to mention the group ’s inability to avenge Mugniyah ’s killing and its fear of a major clash with Israel .
In addition to securitizing life settlements , for example , some banks are repackaging their money - losing securities into higher - rated ones , called re-remics ( re-securitization of real estate mortgage investment conduits ) .
Morgan Stanleysays at least $ 30 billion in residential re-remics have been done this year .
Financial innovation can be good , of course , by lowering the cost of borrowing for everyone , giving consumers more investment choices and , more broadly , by helping the economy to grow .
And the proponents of securitizing life settlements say it would benefit people who want to cash out their policies while they are alive .
But some are dismayed by Wall Street ’s quick return to its old ways , chasing profits with complicated new products .
“ It ’s bittersweet , ” said James D. Cox , a professor of corporate and securities law at Duke University .
“ The sweet part is there are investors interested in exotic products created by underwriters who make large fees and rating agencies who then get paid to confer ratings .
The bitter part is it ’s a return to the good old days . ”
Indeed , what is good for Wall Street could be bad for the insurance industry , and perhaps for customers , too .
That is because policyholders often let their life insurance lapse before they die , for a variety of reasons — their children grow up and no longer need the financial protection , or the premiums become too expensive .
When that happens , the insurer does not have to make a payout .
But if a policy is purchased and packaged into a security , investors will keep paying the premiums that might have been abandoned ; as a result , more policies will stay in force , ensuring more payouts over time and less money for the insurance companies .
“ When they set their premiums they were basing them on assumptions that were wrong , ” said Neil A. Doherty , a professor at Wharton who has studied life settlements .
Indeed , Mr. Doherty says that in reaction to widespread securitization , insurers most likely would have to raise the premiums on new life policies .
Critics of life settlements believe “ this defeats the idea of what life insurance is supposed to be , ” said Steven Weisbart , senior vice president and chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute , a trade group .
“ It ’s not an investment product , a gambling product . ”
After Mortgages
Undeterred , Wall Street is racing ahead for a simple reason : With $ 26 trillion of life insurance policies in force in the United States , the market could be huge .
Not all policyholders would be interested in selling their policies , of course .
And investors are not interested in healthy people ’s policies because they would have to pay those premiums for too long , reducing profits on the investment .
But even if a small fraction of policy holders do sell them , some in the industry predict the market could reach $ 500 billion .
That would help Wall Street offset the loss of revenue from the collapse of the United States residential mortgage securities market , to $ 140 billion so far this year from a peak of $ 918 billion in 2006 , according to Dealogic , a firm that tracks financial data .
Some financial firms are moving to outpace their rivals .
Credit Suisse , for example , is in effect building a financial assembly line to buy large numbers of life insurance policies , package and resell them — just as Wall Street firms did with subprime securities .
The bank bought a company that originates life settlements , and it has set up a group dedicated to structuring deals and one to sell the products .
Goldman Sachshas developed a tradable index of life settlements , enabling investors to bet on whether people will live longer than expected or die sooner than planned .
The index is similar to tradable stock market indices that allow investors to bet on the overall direction of the market without buying stocks .
Spokesmen for Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs declined to comment .
If Wall Street succeeds in securitizing life insurance policies , it would take a controversial business — the buying and selling of policies — that has been around on a smaller scale for a couple of decades and potentially increase it drastically .
Defenders of life settlements argue that creating a market to allow the ill or elderly to sell their policies for cash is a public service .
Insurance companies , they note , offer only a “ cash surrender value , ” typically at a small fraction of the death benefit , when a policyholder wants to cash out , even after paying large premiums for many years .
Enter life settlement companies .
Depending on various factors , they will pay 20 to 200 percent more than the surrender value an insurer would pay .
But the industry has been plagued by fraud complaints .
State insurance regulators , hamstrung by a patchwork of laws and regulations , have criticized life settlement brokers for coercing the ill and elderly to take out policies with the sole purpose of selling them back to the brokers , called “ stranger - owned life insurance . ”
In 2006 , while he was New York attorney general , Eliot Spitzersued Coventry , one of the largest life settlement companies , accusing it of engaging in bid -rigging with rivals to keep down prices offered to people who wanted to sell their policies .
The case is continuing .
“ Predators in the life settlement market have the motive , means and , if left unchecked by legislators and regulators and by their own community , the opportunity to take advantage of seniors , ” Stephan Leimberg , co-author of a book on life settlements , testified at a Senate Special Committee on Aging last April .
Tricky Predictions
In addition to fraud , there is another potential risk for investors : that some people could live far longer than expected .
It is not just a hypothetical risk .
That is what happened in the 1980s , when new treatments prolonged the life of AIDS patients .
Investors who bought their policies on the expectation that the most victims would die within two years ended up losing money .
It happened again last fall when companies that calculate life expectancy determined that people were living longer .
The challenge for Wall Street is to make securitized life insurance policies more predictable — and , ideally , safer — investments .
And for any securitized bond to interest big investors , a seal of approval is needed from a credit rating agency that measures the level of risk .
In many ways , banks are seeking to replicate the model of subprime mortgage securities , which became popular after ratings agencies bestowed on them the comfort of a top - tier , triple - A rating .
An individual mortgage to a home buyer with poor credit might have been considered risky , because of the possibility of default ; but packaging lots of mortgages together limited risk , the theory went , because it was unlikely many would default at the same time .
While that idea was , in retrospect , badly flawed , Wall Street is convinced that it can solve the risk riddle with securitized life settlement policies .
That is why bankers from Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs have been visiting DBRS , a little known rating agency in lower Manhattan .
In early 2008 , the firm published criteria for ways to securitize a life settlements portfolio so that the risks were minimized .
Interest poured in .
Hedge funds that have acquired life settlements , for example , are keen to buy and sell policies more easily , so they can cash out both on investments that are losing money and on ones that are profitable .
Wall Street banks , beaten down by the financial crisis , are looking to get their securitization machines humming again .
Ms. Tillwitz , an executive overseeing the project for DBRS , said the firm spent nine months getting comfortable with the myriad risks associated with rating a pool of life settlements .
Could a way be found to protect against possible fraud by agents buying insurance policies and reselling them — to avoid problems like those in the subprime mortgage market , where some brokers made fraudulent loans that ended up in packages of securities sold to investors ?
How could investors be assured that the policies were legitimately acquired , so that the payouts would not be disputed when the original policyholder died ?
And how could they make sure that policies being bought were legally sellable , given that some states prohibit the sale of policies until they have been in force two to five years ?
Spreading the Risk
To help understand how to manage these risks , Ms. Tillwitz and her colleague Jan Buckler — a mathematics whiz with a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering — traveled the world visiting firms that handle life settlements .
“ We do not want to rate a deal that blows up , ” Ms. Tillwitz said .
The solution ?
A bond made up of life settlements would ideally have policies from people with a range of diseases — leukemia , lung cancer , heart disease , breast cancer , diabetes , Alzheimer’s .
That is because if too many people with leukemia are in the securitization portfolio , and a cure is developed , the value of the bond would plummet .
As an added precaution , DBRS would run background checks on all issuers .
Also , a range of quality of life insurers would have to be included .
To test how different mixes of policies would perform , Mr. Buckler has run computer simulations to show what would happen to returns if people lived significantly longer than expected .
But even with a math whiz calculating every possibility , some risks may not be apparent until after the fact .
How can a computer accurately predict what would happen if health reform passed , for example , and better care for a large number of Americans meant that people generally started living longer ?
Or if a magic - bullet cure for all types of cancer was developed ?
If the computer models were wrong , investors could lose a lot of money .
As unlikely as those assumptions may seem , that is effectively what happened with many securitized subprime loans that were given triple - A ratings .
Investment banks that sold these securities sought to lower the risks by , among other things , packaging mortgages from different regions and with differing credit levels of the borrowers .
They thought that if house prices dropped in one region — say Florida , causing widespread defaults in that part of the portfolio — it was highly unlikely that they would fall at the same time in , say , California .
Indeed , economists noted that historically , housing prices had fallen regionally but never nationwide .
When they did fall nationwide , investors lost hundreds of billions of dollars .
Both Standard & Poor ’sand Moody ’s , which gave out many triple - A ratings and were burned by that experience , are approaching life settlements with greater caution .
Standard & Poor ’s , which rated a similar deal called Dignity Partners in the 1990s , declined to comment on its plans .
Moody ’s said it has been approached by financial firms interested in securitizing life settlements , but has not yet seen a portfolio of policies that meets its standards .
Investor Appetite
Despite the mortgage debacle , investors like Andrew Terrell are intrigued .
Mr. Terrell was the co-head of Bear Stearns ’s longevity and mortality desk — which traded unrated portfolios of life settlements — and later worked at Goldman Sachs ’s Institutional Life Companies , a venture that was introducing a trading platform for life settlements .
He thinks securitized life policies have big potential , explaining that investors who want to spread their risks are constantly looking for new investments that do not move in tandem with their other investments .
“ It ’s an interesting asset class because it ’s less correlated to the rest of the market than other asset classes , ” Mr. Terrell said .
Some academics who have studied life settlement securitization agree it is a good idea .
One difference , they concur , is that death is not correlated to the rise and fall of stocks .
“ These assets do not have risks that are difficult to estimate and they are not , for the most part , exposed to broader economic risks , ” said Joshua Coval , a professor of finance at the Harvard Business School .
“ By pooling and tranching , you are not amplifying systemic risks in the underlying assets . ”
The insurance industry is girding for a fight .
“ Just as all mortgage providers have been tarred by subprime mortgages , so too is the concern that all life insurance companies would be tarred with the brush of subprime life insurance settlements , ” said Michael Lovendusky , vice president and associate general counsel of the American Council of Life Insurers , a trade group that represents life insurance companies .
And the industry may find allies in government .
Among those expressing concern about life settlements at the Senate committee hearing in April were insurance regulators from Florida and Illinois , who argued that regulation was inadequate .
“ The securitization of life settlements adds another element of possible risk to an industry that is already in need of enhanced regulations , more transparency and consumer safeguards , ” said Senator Herb Kohl , the Democrat from Wisconsin who is chairman of the Special Committee on Aging .
DBRS agrees on the need to be careful .
“ We want this market to flourish in a safe way , ” Ms. Tillwitz said .
It 's either the ultimate in couch comfort or a totally bizarre idea dreamed up by a pair of designers obsessed with neuroscience .
Either way , the " Brainwave Sofa " is clearly a one - of - a - kind piece of furniture .
The couch 's lumpy , bumpy shape is a three - dimensional version of a brain scan , specifically a three - second recording of designer Lucas Maassen 's alpha brain waves as he closed his eyes and thought of the word " comfort . "
Data from the electroencephalograph was processed by BioExplorer , a 3 - D visualization program , and then fed directly into a milling machine that cut the shape out of soft foam .
" The process is a wink to a rather futuristic design process , " the couch creators wrote in a press release , " for which a designer merely has to close his or her eyes , or merely rest , to have the brain do all the work , and create the data needed to have the CNC machine cut the shape of the sofa . "
The x-axis of the couch represents Maassen 's brain waves in hertz , while the y - axis shows the amount of alpha activity as a percentage , and the z - axis is the time in milliseconds .
Once the foam core of the sofa was completed , the designers covered it by hand in soft gray felt and decorated the valleys of the brain waves with buttons .
The Brainwave Sofa goes on display Wednesday at the Bits 'n Pieces Exhibition in New York .
If you happen to stop by the show , please have a seat on the brain couch — and let us know if it 's comfy .
Or just weird .

The force of water is indisputable as is evident from natural calamities such as floods and tsunamis .
Water is capable of widespread destruction and it cannot be stopped completely by human means .
Waves in the seas can be a very strong manifestation of the destructive powers of water .
In December 1978 , the ship Munchen set sail on a routine trip to America .
The ship which was very large and supposedly unsinkable , sent an emergency message for rescue .
The search and rescue operations were unable to find the ship and it disappeared mysteriously .
Investigations carried out thereafter attributed the sinking of the ship to a very large wave termed as the Freak Wave .
A Freak
Wave is a single breaking wave that is extremely large in nature and humans are not aware of its origins .
Though experts suggest that such a huge wave is practically impossible , mariners often talk of Freak Waves being in existence .

Our favorite gay , British , libertarian - conservative High Ganja Priest of Political Commentary , The Atlantic 's marathon Daily Dish blogger ( and lovah ) Andrew Sullivan , is calling out Sarah Palin .
For what , this time ?
For reading his blog , son .
SHOTS FIRED .
This shit 's gangsta :
The terrifyingly prolific Sullivan took one of the 73 or so posts he penned before lunch to quickly frisk today 's Wall Street Journal piece on Sarah Palin 's web strategy for her Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Bullshit , Going Rouge ( ©McSweeney's , 2009 ) .
And what is Sarah Palin 's web strategy for her book ?
Among the features of this new strategy : buying Internet advertising based on Google searches of her name , and using Facebook as a key means of communicating with voters .
Her team also has considered filing libel suits against bloggers who spread rumors about her family .
GAMECHANGER .
Not exactly the VBS.tv campaign I was hoping for , but still : damn .
Sullivan , however , took this opportunity to note his ( and my ) favorite part of what 's otherwise a snoozer of a filing .
Which was this gem :
Ms. Palin was particularly angry at bloggers and the media , associates said , for speculation that her baby Trig was really the child of Bristol , her daughter .
At one point , according to people familiar with the discussions , Ms. Palin considered pursuing a libel suit against at least one blogger , the Atlantic 's Andrew Sullivan .
Ms. Palin decided against such a move because of the publicity it would bring .
Mr. Sullivan , in response , said asking " factually verifiable questions is obviously not libel . "
A spokeswoman for Ms. Palin did n't respond to email requests seeking comment .
Oh ho ho .
Christmas came early for Andrew ( though the trees stay year - round , thug ) .
Sullivan 's been a veritable thorn in many sides of many Palins , but naturally , Sarah 's the big game .
And let 's be clear about this : people who have bloggers who write nasty things about them should never , ever , ever admit that they read that blogger .
Because that blogger now knows they have a mainline to their target 's face .
And like she 's gonna stop reading .
What does Sullivan have to say about this ?
Besides hysterically prefacing what 's probably his favorite block of text ever with the words " Money quote , " he basically goes for the jugular while victory dancing on her face .
This is basically the political blogger 's version of the Dirty Bird , in a post titled Sarah Palin , Obsessive Daily Dish Reader :
Sources with access to Palin have indeed told to me that the Wasilla whack - job was an obsessive reader of this blog as it dared to ask factual questions about her past that could be easily answered .
I have no way of knowing this myself , and regard it as odd that a vice - presidential candidate would be hell - bent on suing a blogger who , presumably , was merely making a total ass of himself in wondering if Palin 's surreal account of her last pregnancy was factually accurate .
Or is there something there - of some unknown sort - that she desperately wanted to intimidate and suppress ?
As Bubble would note : " Who can say ? "
What can Levi possibly mean that " she knows what I got on her ? "
The MSM wo n't touch this , of course .
Ho !
We 'll take some of that , please .
Move it on your left , Andrew .
Shit 's bomb .
La RATP , Accor , Axa : rares sont encore les entreprises qui effectuent leurs recrutements sur la base de CV anonymes .
Mesure plébiscitée en 2006 pour son rôle dans la lutte contre la discrimination à l'embauche , votée dans le cadre de la loi sur l'Egalité des Chances , elle n'a pourtant jamais juridiquement vu le jour , ses décrets d'application n'ayant simplement pas été publiés .
« Force est de constater que ni le monde de l'entreprise ni les syndicats n'ont réellement bougé sur cette question depuis 2006 » , estime aujourd ' hui Yazid Sabeg .
Devant tant d'inertie , le gouvernement souhaite donc relancer cette pratique par le lancement , mardi à l'Assemblée nationale , d'une expérimentation .
Durant six mois , une cinquantaine d'entreprises volontaires de toutes tailles s'engageront à recruter au moins partiellement sur CV anonyme , et à adopter pour ce faire un cadre unique , selon un cahier des charges déterminé au préalable .
Pôle emploi , qui jouera un rôle de coordinateur de l'opération , fera également partie des organismes participants .
Sept départements concernés
Du traditionnel curriculum vitae , l'accord prévoit ainsi de bannir nom , prénom , âge , sexe , date et lieu de naissance , nationalité , situation familiale et photographie , et ce pour toute candidature , qu'il s'agisse de contrats d'intérim , de contrat à durée déterminée ( CDD ) ou de contrat à durée indéterminée ( CDI ) .
L'expérimentation devrait être mise en œuvre dans sept départements ( la Seine - Saint - Denis , le Nord , le Rhône , les Bouches - du - Rhône , le Bas - Rhin , la Loire - Atlantique et Paris ) .
Reste cependant à savoir quel sera l'impact effectif de la mesure sur la promotion de l'égalité des chances .
Si l'association partenaire A Compétence égale , productrice d'un rapport sur le sujet remis en juin à Yazid Sabeg , fait remarquer que la moitié de ses membres des cabinets de recrutements se prononcent en faveur de la mesure tandis que l'autre s'y oppose , peu d'éléments permettent à ce jour de jauger l'efficacité du CV anonyme contre la discrimination à l'embauche .
L'évaluation de l'opération , qui sera conduite au bout de six mois par le ministère , devrait fournir des éléments d'analyse .

' Where 's mummy ? ' :
Babies left in filth as mother binged for 24 hours
Baby , aged three months , found crying with hunger
Boy , one , found in cot with no blanket , soaked in urine
Girl , four , had tried to feed her younger siblings
' Britain 's worst mother ' :
The 22 - year - old drank a bottle of wine and snorted coke before leaving her children
A single mother left her four young children including two babies home alone while she went on a 24 - hour drink and drugs binge , a court heard .
Worried neighbours contacted police after seeing the woman 's eldest child , a four - year - old girl , hanging out of a window crying : ' Where 's mummy ? '
The 22 - year - old mother drank a bottle of wine and snorted cocaine with friends after putting her daughters , aged three and four , and their brothers , aged one and three months , to bed .
But soon afterwards she left the children to fend for themselves and went out to carry on drinking at a series of house parties and bars , not returning until 10.30 pm the following day .
Police alerted by neighbours found the house littered with empty beer cans
and bottles and a scene of ' filth and disorder ' inside .
They discovered the one - year - old boy in a urine - soaked cot in a bedroom on his own .
His younger brother was found crying in a travel cot , with no blankets , and with a soiled nappy .
He had dried milk and sick over his clothing and was grey , docile and dehydrated .
The three - year - old girl had managed to dress herself , while her older sister , who was the most distressed , had pushed chairs up against kitchen cupboards to try to reach some food because she was so hungry .
There were also children 's footprints in baby milk powder on the floor where the oldest child had tried to mix a bottle feed for her younger brother .
Yesterday the mother , who can not be named for legal reasons , was warned she faces jail after admitting four charges of child neglect .
She sat with her head bowed throughout the hearing at Preston Crown Court which was told that all four youngsters have since been taken into care and see their mother only on supervised visits .
Judge Norman
Wright granted the woman bail while reports from social services are prepared .
She will be sentenced next month .
An earlier hearing was told that the incident occurred in July after the woman , from Blackburn , put her children to bed in the early evening .
She drank a bottle of wine before a group of friends and strangers arrived .
They carried on drinking and began snorting cocaine .
Leaving the children asleep upstairs , the woman then left with the group for another house party before moving on to several bars in Blackburn town centre .
She eventually returned the following night .
Catherine Allen , prosecuting , told the earlier hearing before magistrates in Blackburn : ' The children had been trying to gain access to the cupboards because they were hungry .
' Inside the house there were empty cans , bottles , broken furniture and the kitchen knives could have been accessed .
Any of the children could have been seriously injured or worse .
They had no access to food or drink . '
One neighbour said last night that the community had been left ' deeply shocked ' by the case .
' It must take the worst kind of mum in the country to do that to your kids , ' the neighbour added .
The case comes days after figures released in the wake of the Baby P scandal revealed a shocking rise in child neglect .
Two serious case reviews - inquiries launched following the death of a child where abuse or neglect are suspected - have been launched every week over the past six months .
How a map can prevent the next financial crisis .
The shock of the financial meltdown has had congressional committees scrambling for their gavels for the better part of a year .
Politicians have been discussing how to make sure that such a near - cataclysm never happens again , and , for the most part , they 've focused on the need for new regulation .
What 's called for , President Obama said in March , is " a financial regulatory mechanism that prevents the kind of systemic risks that have done so much damage over the last several months . "
But all the talk of regulation misses a key point :
If we do n't know which institutions are doing what -- if we do n't actually monitor what we 've regulated -- then that regulation wo n't work .
Indeed , signs of regulators ' ignorance about what really goes on in the financial markets have been building up for years .
Regulators got a warning in 1998 , when a little - known hedge fund called Long - Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) suddenly faced collapse over a series of bad bets on emerging economies ' debt .
It would n't have made news , except that the little fund from Connecticut turned out to be holding 5 percent of the market where financial institutions traded risk with each other .
In Washington , the heads of the major financial regulators were frantic .
" When LTCM came close to collapsing in the fall of 1998 , that came as a great surprise to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and to the Board of Governors , even though the counterparties to the contracts of LTCM were the big banks and the big investment banks , " says a highly placed member of the Clinton administration .
Yet the authorities did n't learn .
Two years later , the Commodity Futures Modernization Act , whose formulation was guided by a report signed by Alan Greenspan and Larry Summers , removed whole categories of so - called " over - the - counter " derivatives from oversight , allowing financial institutions to trade these securities in secret .
It did n't take long to see what could happen :
In 2001 , the Enron debacle showed how a single company could use over - the - counter derivatives to accumulate billions of dollars in debt -- unbeknownst to rating agencies and its own shareholders .
Workers uncovered a young Irishman 's grave in New York 's Greenwich Village more than 200 years after he died .
Now authorities are determined to solve the mystery of the life and death of the Co Kildare man .
New York City Dept of Parks and Recreation workers expected to find unidentified bones when they dug below the city 's Washington Square Park -- more than 20,000 people are believed to be buried in the former graveyard .
But they discovered the 210 - year - old 3 ft - high sandstone gravestone of a Co Kildare man who died in 1799 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Its writing , still clear , read : " Here lies the body of James Jackson , who departed this life the 22nd day of September , 1799 aged 28 years , native of the county of Kildare , Ireland . "
Workers have several times found skeletons during the restoration of the park , but Jackson 's stone was the first burial marker .
" It 's very unusual , " John H Geismar , the archaeological consultant who made the discovery , said .
" In fact , I 'm stunned . "
The New York Historical society has identified one James Jackson of 19 East George Street , who was listed in the city death records on September 23 , 1799 , Ms Geismar said .
His occupation is listed as a watchman , though a city directory at the time listed him as a grocer .
Diana de Zerega Wall , an archaeology professor at the City University of New York , said that at the time Jackson was buried , the city was wrestling with a series of yellow fever outbreaks and he may have died from the illness .
Victims were buried there away from the then centre of town , as a safety measure .
After the discovery , workers dug seven feet below the gravestone but found no body .
It is thought it may have been moved when the area was developed into parade grounds .
Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe said that even in the absence of a body , the city hopes to learn more about the young Irish immigrant .

Barack Obama introduced himself as America's " first Pacific president " as he launched his four - nation tour of the region , vowing to deepen ties with Asia and arguing that China 's rise should be welcomed rather than feared .
Kicking off his visit in Tokyo , he also sought to thaw the chill in relations with his hosts , America 's closest allies in the region .
The new prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , has vowed to make Japan less dependent on the US , but the two men agreed to put off the issue of resolving the future of US forces in Japan .
However , police in China are reported to have detained dozens of dissidents in a crackdown ahead of Obama 's arrival there today .
Human rights campaigners said that at least 30 activists who were expected to apply for the right to hold protests directed at the Chinese government during the US president 's visit were arrested .
Reformers worry that Obama will play down China 's poor human rights record in order to maintain good relations on issues such as the economy .
" We get the impression Obama does n't want to talk about human rights on this trip , but it is precisely because of his visit here that these people are being rounded up and detained right now , " Ai Weiwei , a Beijing - based artist and social commentator , told the Financial Times .
Speaking yesterday during the first stop on his nine - day Asian tour , Obama told an audience of 1,500 in the Japanese capital : " I want every American to know that we have a stake in the future of this region , because what happens here has a direct effect on our lives at home . "
American officials have portrayed the trip as an opportunity to develop relationships and make progress on non-proliferation , climate change and the economy , and are playing down expectations of any agreements .
As in his previous foreign affairs speeches , Obama emphasised his personal ties in the region – referring to his birth in Hawaii , time in Indonesia and boyhood travels in Asia – and the administration 's break with unilateralism .
" We welcome China 's efforts to play a greater role on the world stage – a role in which their growing economy is joined by growing responsibility , " he said .
" Power does not need to be a zero - sum game and nations need not fear the success of another . "
He held out a hand to North Korea again , calling for it to denuclearise ; and to Burma , if it undertakes democratic reform and frees political prisoners , including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi .
Burma 's prime minister will be present at the president 's meeting with Association of South - east Asian Nations ( Asean ) leaders in Singapore .
Obama also announced that the US will sign up to a trans -Pacific free trade agreement .
That may help to deflect accusations of protectionism , which are likely to be aired throughout his tour .
He stressed the need for " balanced " growth and said Asian countries should not be dependent on exports to the US .
The economic crisis has underlined the interdependence of " Chimerica " in particular and the trade imbalance that has left China with vast US dollar holdings .
Washington wants the Chinese currency , the yuan , to appreciate further ; Beijing will repeat its concerns that US debt could endanger its dollar holdings .
But Obama 's Chinese visit is about more than money .
The world 's two largest carbon emitters are meeting just weeks away from the Copenhagen climate - change conference .
China 's influence on North Korea and Iran are central to Obama 's non-proliferation agenda .
Its handling of Afghanistan and Pakistan will also be high up in discussions .
Obama 's China policy is essentially his predecessor 's ; the relationship is increasingly amicable .
But some fear attempts to broaden it could mean less meaningful engagement .
" Bush 's approach was : you are rising in the international system and need to take on more responsibility , " said Victor Cha , director of Asian affairs in the National Security Council under George Bush and now at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies .
" Obama is heaping on all these very , very high expectations – on issues like climate change and currency – and I think they are expectations that China cannot possibly meet . "
China sees itself as a vulnerable developing country as well as a rising power .
And shared anxieties – such as those over proliferation – do not equal identical interests .
" China 's own interests in those hot spots [ North Korea , Iran , Afghanistan and Pakistan ] make it deeply conflicted about playing a larger role on the world stage , " said Stephanie Kleine - Ahlbrandt of the International Crisis Group .
" While the United States frames China in terms of its growing responsibilities as a major power , China continues to think primarily in terms of its own interests . "
To some observers , the administration is also too keen to please Beijing , wasting leverage rather than smoothing the path to greater gains .
Obama 's decision not to meet the Dalai Lama last month – aides say he will do so in future – " does n't send a signal that the US wants to work with China ; it sends a signal they have basically got us , " said Cha .

subject Re : I am ready for induction process .
Dear brother ,
This is wonderful news and I believe it is no accident we have met .
We are pleased you have shown interest in our faith and fight against poverty .
If you complete the induction we will see to it all your problems are taken care of and the $ 100,000 USD donation is processed with Godspeed .
It is a very simple and easy induction process .
Normally we would be present but due to the circumstances we must ask you to photograph the induction .
I have attached the icon of our beloved Saint Karlos Diamonds .
This is a very important image and must be on your ceremonial robe .
In order to complete the induction free of problems we ask you to note the following carefully .
1. Saint Diamonds is reknowned for baptising people in rivers while he sat on a chair .
So you must be photographed sitting on a chair in a river or something full of water with your feet submerged and you must be seen to be baptising yourself or others with red wine to represent the blood of christ .
2 . You must be wearing a white robe with the icon attached clearly painted on it .
That is a red diamod with a K in the centre .
3 . You must also have a crown of flowers around your head and a wooden spoon in your hand .
He always wore flowers on his head in memory of Christ and carried a spoon to eat from strangers bowls and he thought people generosity is the way to happiness
And that is it .
Please follow all instructions to the letter as my Elders are very serious when it comes to ceremonial inductions .
I trust you will do a good job .
If I was there with you I would baptise you myself but the circumstances being as they are we must ask you to provide photographs of your baptism .
If you are ready to do this and join us I will inform the Elders of your efforts and have the neccesary requirements and steps taken to ensure your donation is paid quickly as soon as you provide photos of your sacred baptism .
Do not hesitate to ask me questions if you feel you need to and may God be with you my brother .

Dear Brother ,
Many thanks for your mail concerning directions for the induction .
I must be honest to tell you that one thing baffles me about the whole process of the induction and I would want to know if I am not being initiated into some kind of cultic society , Also the wooden spoon could be difficult to get , please clarify .
Again don�t you have existing members here in South Africa who would assist / guide me with the induction ceremony because I would not want to make any mistakes during the ceremony ?
Would you be kind enough to send some previous photograph for this will assist me a great more .
Please furnish me with your phone number so we can discuss on certain issues before I proceed with the ceremony .
Thanking you for your anticipated co-operation .
Best regards ,

Dea Brothet Don ,
We are not a cult my friend .
We are a charitable church that spreads generosity to strangers through Christs teachings and our beloved Patron Saint .
The induction has never been photographed before you are the first .
Normally we would not need photos because we would have someone present to witness the ceremny but these unusual circumstances call for it .
To clarify for you .
The ceremony represents Saint Diamonds methods of baptism .
He always wore a crown of flowers you may create a crown hat is similar but you must be seen wearing a crown of some sort .
He always sat on a chair with his feet in water .
You may do this in your house with your feet in a water basin if you wish and any normal spoon is fine seeing as though you are having trouble locating a wooden one .
The pouring of red wine on your forhead signifies the blood of christ washing away your sins and the robe with his icon it is self evident .
My Elders have revoked my phone privelliges for now until you have comleted the ceremony .
They are eager to proceed with the donation and work with you and really want you to be a member so we may begin our work in Africa .
You must see this as an honour my brother .
Have no fear and trust in God .
It is no accident you have come to us .

Dear Brother ,
Thanks for your mail .
I believe you as servant of God will be very conversant with the scriptures .
Like Gideon in the Bible book of Judges , when he received the call to deliver the children of Israel from the hands of their warring neighbors , he had to ask and ask questions to be sure that the Lord indeed is the one speaking to him .
Likewise , I want you to pardon me for the series of questions I have to ask because the days are full of unpredictable things .
Could you please tell me where your church is based ?
What are your physical address and or web address ?
Is the founder the great Saint Karlos Diamond still alive ?
How do you think that I can benefit the church ?
Please brother kindly give me every necessary information I should know about your church for I do not want to make mistakes .
Thanking you so far for everything .
Remain Blessed in the Lord .
Regards ,
Don

Dear Don ,
I hope you are not a " Doubting Thomas " , brother Don .
I do not normally need to explain myself or our intentions but seeing as though you are very far away I have no choice .
St. Diamonds was a private man that lived 500 years after Christ 's death , so no my Son he is not alive .
Upon receipt of your induction I will forward all relevant doctrine to you for your perusal .
We have already discussed your importance to us in the building of new church in your community , so I am a little confuse as to why you see fit to question me now .
I have prepared a little lesson on Gideon for you .
You see yourself as being Gideon ???.. and I God .. Sir I am a mere Pastor that is trying to spread generosity through Christ 's teachings .. I pray you will ask your local Pastor for his website address ..
If he has one I would like to visit his site ..
My address is as follows ..

Gideon -
His story is told in chapters 6 to 8 in The Book of Judges .
He is also named in the Epistle to the Hebrews as an example of a man of faith .
He is the son of Joash , from the clan of Abiezers in the tribe of Manasseh .
The name Gideon means " Destroyer " , " Mighty warrior " or " Feller ( of trees ) " .
As is the pattern throughout the book of Judges , the Israelites again turned away from God after forty years of peace brought by Deborah 's victory over Canaan and were allowed to be attacked by the neighbouring Midianites and Amalekites .
God chose Gideon , a young man from an otherwise unremarkable clan from the tribe of Manasseh , to free the people of Israel and to condemn their worship of idols .
Very unsure of both himself and God 's command , he requested proof of God 's will by a miracle :
36 Then Gideon said to God , " You say that you have decided to use me to rescue Israel .
37 Well , I am putting some wool on the ground where we thresh the wheat .
If in the morning there is dew only on the wool but not on the ground , then I will know that you are going to use me to rescue Israel . "
38 That is exactly what happened .
When Gideon got up early the next morning , he squeezed the wool and wrung enough dew out of it to fill a bowl with water .
39 Then Gideon said to God , " Do n't be angry with me ; let me speak just once more .
Please let me make one more test with the wool .
This time let the wool be dry , and the ground be wet . "
40 That night God did that very thing .
The next morning the wool was dry , but the ground was wet with dew .
( Judges 6:36 - 40 , )
God be with you Brother Don ..

Dear Pastor Godfrey ,
Thanks for your mail and the explanations .
I can see that you are beginning to be unhappy with my questions which I do n't really expect .
Remember you said I can ask you questions at the begining .
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT I AM A DOUBTING THOMAS NOW ?
Do you expect me to jump into something I do not know and sell my concience to satan forever .
Here is my pastor 's website .
Pastor Ray McCauley
www.rhema.co.za
I was of the view that a big organisation like yours should have a physical and web address where people can easily locate you .
Get back to me with other details I need to know before I can tell you when I will perfom the induction ceremony .
The address you sent to me is not complete , which country of the world is it to be located ?
Looking forward to your response .
Best regards ,

Dear Brother Godfrey ,
Thanks for your mail .
It 's quite an exprience getting to know you and your church .
I believe that christianity is a religion of choice .
I do not know how I have insulted you or your church .
Even the business I propose to you is still open to question and scrutiny .
I can not force you to do anything against your will neither will you on me .
You gave me the option to ask questions and now my quest for more knowledge becomes irratating .
Well I do n't know how you reason but if you are still interested in me and the whole thing we have been discussing , you are very free to get back to me .

Dear brother Don ,
I have stated many times I cannot help you with your business until you are a member of our church .
You Said ..
" Do you expect me to jump into something I do not know and sell my concience to satan forever . "
This is very insulting .
We are a charitable church spreading generosity and good will through christ 's teachings .
We offered you a substantial donation of $ 100,000 to begin a church for us in your community and gave you extremely clear and concise instructions on how to conduct our induction ceremony .
But you are fixated on websites and addresses and Satan .
If you wish to join us and receive the donation please complete the induction and provide the photographic evidence of said ceremony ..
My Elders and I await your response .
If you have anymore doubtful questions that disrespect our work do not reply .
Peace be with you .

Dear Brother Don ,
I have received your complete set of induction Photos .
I must say you seem to have carried it out perfectly .
I hope you felt the rejuvenating feelings we have felt upon its completion .
I am glad to say you will be welcomed well into our church .
I must have the Elders inspect the photos and upload our complete doctrine and thus forward it for your perusal .
The next step in the process is this .
I will send you an application form London which you must print out and fill in and return to me post haste .
The form is quite simple but very important and it concerns your character , your intentions and basically covers the building of our new church in your community .
You will need to state where the new church will be built .
You must present photos of the site also and ofcourse sign it .
This is all legal type stuff we must have completed .
I will be travelling to London to visit the accountant tomorrow with the bank details you provided and you may call me on that number below any time in the evening .
Let me know a time so I will be waiting by the phone .
It is a church phone and will only be answered if an appointment has been made to recieve a call .

Dear Pastor Godfrey ,
I have done as instructed by securing a site for the church .
This premises was originally used as a church and was later turned to a
business place .
Currently it 's not in use and needs to be renovated .
The
zoning plan of the property allows for three storey so there is
oppurtunity to add more floors if need be .
It can conviniently take between 200 to 300 worshipers at a time and it
has got few rooms for office use .
I am forwarding to you the photos including the completed induction
agreement form duly signed .
I hope these will meet you in good stead .

I have no doubt the Elders will be also .
I need to forward your tremendous work to them and await their instructions .
I am absolutelty positive they will hold you in the highest esteem and see to it that you get exactly what you deserve .
The work is done now my friend .
You have proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that God has chosen the right man for us .
That building looks perfect .
You can't imagine my elation at the moment .
I feel I could float up to heaven and kiss Hosanna in the Hiace .
Sit tight my brother and I will inform you of the developments from here , once the Elders have decided on the correct course of action .

Read it at your leisure my brother .
The Elders have released the donation to me and I have it here in London with me .

I will keep you informed of my progress on my laptop and what time and day I will land in your country .
So pray your heart out for me and my safety .
Is it not obvious what is meant by this statement ??.. As for Hosana in the Hiace ..
It is an old saying a Priest I used to know said all the time .. I do not know its literal meaning .
I just like to say it .
I will see you very soon my brother .

Dear Don ,
We are currently under instruction to cease contact with you from the police .
We need to know what you intend to do with Pastor Godfrey .
Please do not hurt him .
We are trying to raise the funds for his release .

Dear Lucy ,
I 've got your message but I suspect that this whole thing is a game .
Please
tell me the police station where pastor Godfrey is being held so that I will
go and see him there .
I do n't have friends and what I 'm discussing with Godfrey is not fraud or
anything illegal .
I want you to call any police you like to come to me for
clarity .
I think you people have been playing games with me from the
begining , if not why have you refused to disclose your identities you have
got a church that exist only in your imagination no physical address .
I
asked several question of which none was answered .
I follwed your pastor
foolishly because I thought he was true servant of God .
I became suspicious because of some foul languages he sometimes use about
his god and saint .
I strongly believe you guys are a group of con men based
in johannesburg or ......
You 've met the wrong person because the man who
gave me godfrey 's contact is involved in the same dirty business like you .
Frankly speaking he is a member of my local church and I know what he is
into ,
He recently passed away .
His body is currently lying at the chris
Hani hospital in soweto waiting to be buried .
That is the reason I have not
filled the so called MTCN because I had wanted to see your godfrey and tell
him my involvement .
As a true minister myself I am not afraid of anything because my hands are
clean .
I once told pastor Godfrey that I suspect he 's got some skeleton in
his cupboard and now I am realising that indeed there are some .
You gave me a london phone number which is rooted .
You guys are clever
indeed .
Again I do n't have friends who are capable of doing the kind of evil
things you think or do .
Thanks for failing me and God .

HOWTO Avoid Being Called a Bozo When Producing XML
“ There ’s just no nice way to say this :
Anyone who ca n’t make a syndication feed that ’s well - formed XML is an incompetent fool . ——
Maybe this is unkind and elitist of me , but I think that anyone who either ca n’t or wo n’t implement these measures is , as noted above , a bozo . ” – Tim Bray , co-editor of the XML 1.0 specification
There seem to be developers who think that well - formedness is awfully hard — if not impossible — to get right when producing XML programmatically and developers who can get it right and wonder why the others are so incompetent .
I assume no one wants to appear incompetent or to be called names .
Therefore , I hope the following list of dos and don’ts helps developers to move from the first group to the latter .
Note about the scope of this document :
This document focuses on the Unicode layer , the XML 1.0 layer and the Namespaces in XML layer .
Getting higher layers like XHTML and Atom right are outside the scope of this document .
Also , anything served as text / html is outside the scope of this document , alhough the methods described here can be applied to producing HTML .
In fact , doing so is even a good idea .
Contents
Do n’t think of XML as a text format
Even people who have used compilers and seen the error and warning messages seem to think that text formats can be written casually and the piece of software in the other end will be able to fix small errors like a human reader .
This is not the case with XML .
If the document is not well - formed , it is not XML and an XML processor has to cease normal processing upon finding a fatal error .
It helps if you think of XML as a binary format like PNG — only with the added bonus that you can use text tools to see what is in the file for debugging .
Do n’t use text - based templates
Text - based Web templating systems ( MovableType , WordPress , etc. ) and active page technologies that seem to allow you to embed program code in document skeleton ( ASP , PHP , JSP , Lasso , Net. Data , etc. ) are designed for tag soup .
They do n’t guarantee well - formed XML output .
They do n’t guarantee correct HTML output , either .
They seem to work with HTML , because text / html user agents are lenient and try to cope with broken HTML .
The most common mistakes involve not escaping markup - significant characters or escaping them twice .
Do n’t use these systems for producing XML .
Making mistakes with them is extremely easy and taking all cases into account is hard .
These systems have failed smart people who have actively tried to get things right .
Do n’t print
Using print ( or echo ) calls sprinkled all over your code to emit pieces of markup and literal text is error - prone as well .
Is the string you are printing markup or text that needs to be escaped ?
Have you printed multiple start tags at a time ?
Can you get the end tags right ?
When your program grows and is modified , these things become increasingly difficult to keep track of .
It is very easy to overlook something .
Indeed , it is very likely that something goes wrong .
Use an isolated serializer
Still , producing the markup characters and writing them as bytes into an output stream has to happen somewhere .
Putting all the code the writes to the output stream in a single class or compilation unit makes it possible to debug the escaping - sensitive code in one place .
The serializer should have SAX - like methods such as startElement ( nsUri , localname , attributes ) , endElement ( nsUri , localname ) , characters ( text ) , processing Instruction ( target , data ) , etc .
The methods always take unescaped strings and escape attribute values and character data .
With this approach , the notorious escaping problem just vanishes !
For Java , there is gnu.xml.util.XMLWriter and its subclass gnu.xml.pipeline .TextConsumer that plugs into the GNU JAXP SAX pipeline framework .
( A word of warning : The GNU JAXP XMLWriter does not work properly for all characters unless used with the UTF - 8 output encoding and with the XHTML mode turned off .
If you believe you need the XHTML mode — that is , the Appendix C mode — you may want to check out fi.karppinen.gnu.xml.util.XMLWriter and fi.karppinen.gnu.xml.pipeline.TextConsumer instead .
However , if you need the Appendix C mode , you are probably trying to serve XHTML as text / html .
Doing so is considered harmful , so what you really need is a serializer that produces HTML 4.01 from XHTML 1.0 SAX events . )
For Java , there is nu.validator.htmlparser.sax.XmlSerializer .
It does not support XHTML 1.0 Appendix C. If you want Appendix C support , you should probably send HTML5 as text / html instead , since serving XHTML as text / html is considered harmful .
For that , there is nu.validator.htmlparser.sax .HtmlSerializer .
For C , there is eg. GenX .
C programmers may also find the tools in libxml2 useful .
Use a tree or a stack ( or an XML parser )
Although the serializer API sketched above makes the escaping problem disappear , the application could still call startElement ( ) and endElement ( ) in a bad sequence and break well - formed nesting .
Since an XML document parses into a tree , traversing an analogous programmatically produced tree ( eg. DOM or XOM ) induces the right sequence of startElement ( ) and endElement ( ) calls .
It is worth noting that even though recursive tree traversal usually gets all the attention in algorithm and data structure text books , a tree with parent references can be traversed iteratively .
If you are serializing a tree data structure into an XML format that closely mirrors the in -memory structure , you can use the treeness of the data structure for ensuring well - formed nesting instead of first building a DOM or XOM ( or similar ) tree .
A tree may be an overkill , however .
To ensure proper nesting , a stack is sufficient .
A stack can keep track of the open elements without wasting space on parts of the document that have already been handled or have not been handled yet .
More importantly , the stack does not need to be explicit : the runtime stack can be used .
If startElement is always called at the beginning of a method and endElement is always called in the end , the runtime stack guarantees the nesting .
Code using the runtime stack for ensuring nesting would look like this :
void emitFoo( ) {
startElement ( NS_URI , " foo " ) ;
emitBar ( ) ;
if ( shouldEmitBaz ) {
emitBaz ( ) ;
}
endElement ( NS_URI , " foo " ) ;
}
Finally , one way of producing SAX events in a proper sequence may be obvious : a SAX parser emits SAX parse events in a proper sequence .
It may also be so obvious that it is easy to overlook .
The original way to get some SAX events is parsing an XML document at runtime .
But if you are producing XML dynamically , what good does it do to parse a static document ?
Well , boilerplate markup can be put in a static XML file and the interesting parts can be produced programmatically .
A SAX filter can look for interesting points in the XML document ( eg. a particular processing instruction or element ) and inject additional SAX events to the pipeline before returning to control to the parser .
The injection may involve parsing another document and injecting events from it into the same pipeline .
If the static XML data is trusted , it is possible to even name methods in processing instructions and use reflections to call back into the application based on the XML data .
Another approach to boilerplate markup is code generation in such a way that the parse events from an XML parser are recorded as generated program code that can play back the events efficiently without actually reading input at runtime .
My SaxCompiler takes this approach .
Since the events are recorded from an XML parser , they occur in a permissible sequence .
Do n’t try to manage namespace declarations manually
Namespaces in XML makes it possible for XML element and attribute names to be in a namespace .
Being in a namespace means being associated with an additional string symbol , which is required to be an URI alhough it is compared code point for code point .
The name of the XHTML element for paragraps is not just p .
It is the pair consisting of the XHTML namespace URI and p — that is ( http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml , p ) or in James Clark ’s notation { http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}p .
The URI is bound to the local name by using an intermediate syntactic abstraction .
The namespace can be declared as a default that affects unprefixed element name ( but not attribute names ) or it can be bound to a prefix .
The crucial point is that the prefix string itself can be chosen arbitrarily and carries no meaning .
Also , the declarations can appear earlier in the document tree and are scoped .
My aim in the above paragraps is to convey that the namespace mechanism is sufficiently complex to be dangerous to be left up to the casual programmer and application code .
Instead , the application programmer should use the URI –local name pair and leave the management of the namespace declarations and prefixes to a dedicated piece of code that someone has already debugged .
( Of course , it is OK for the programmer to suggest prefixes to make the output more readable . )
For the GNU JAXP framework , gnu.xml.pipeline.NSFilter is such a piece of code .
GenX , on the other hand , does this within the serializer component itself .
Use unescaped Unicode strings in memory
To keep the abstractions clear , the content strings in memory should be in the unescaped parsed form .
For example , if you have content that says two is greater than one the string in the memory should be “ 2 > 1 ” .
In particular , it should not be “ 2 > 1 ” .
“ 2 > 1 ” is what you mean .
Only when the string reaches the serializer , it is the responsibility on the serializer to write “ 2 > 1 ” in the output .
Passing along a chunk of markup is done either by passing a tree data structure ( eg. DOM fragment ) or by emitting multiple SAX events in sequence .
Moreover , the chances for mistakes are minimized when in - memory strings use the encoding of the built - in Unicode string type of the programming language if your language ( or framework ) has one .
For example , in Java you ’d use java.lang .
String and char[ ] and , therefore , UTF - 16 .
Python has the complication that the Unicode string type can be either UTF - 16 ( OS X , Jython ) or UTF - 32 ( Debian ) depending on how the interpreter was compiled .
With C it makes sense to choose one UTF and stick to it .
Use UTF - 8 ( or UTF - 16 ) for output
The XML 1.0 specification requires all XML processors to support the UTF - 8 and UTF - 16 encodings .
XML processors may support other encodings , but they are not required to .
It follows that using any encoding other than UTF - 8 or UTF - 16 is unsafe , because the XML processor used by the recipient might not support the encoding .
If you use an encoding other than UTF - 8 or UTF - 16 and communication fails , it is your fault .
Arguments about particular legacy encodings being common in a particular locale ( eg. Shift_JIS in Japan or ISO - 8859 - 1 in Western Europe ) are totally irrelevant here .
( The xml:lang attribute can be used for CJK disambiguation .
There is no need to use parochial encodings for that . )
From the XML point of view both UTF - 8 and UTF - 16 are equally right .
If your serializer only supports either one , just go with the one the serializer already supports .
UTF - 8 is more compact than UTF - 16 ( in terms of bytes ) for characters in the ASCII range .
Even if your content does not contain characters from the ASCII range frequently , the element and attribute names in well - known vocabularies as well the XML syntax itself consist of characters from the ASCII range .
UTF - 8 data is also easier to examine for debugging with byte / ASCII - oriented network sniffing and file examination tools .
UTF - 16 is more compact than UTF - 8 only when the number of characters from the U+0800 –U+FFFF range exceeds the number of characters from the ASCII range — and the latter includes markup whenever well - known XML vocabularies are used .
It might be tempting to try to optimize the size of the document by choosing the encoding depending on the content or the expected content .
However , doing so opens up more possibilities for bugs .
Even when the serializer offers a choice , it is safer to pick either UTF - 8 or UTF - 16 and stick to the choice regardless of content or deployment locale .
I am biased in favor of UTF - 8 .
Use NFC
In Unicode , common accented letters can be expressed in two different ways : as a single character or as a base character followed by combining character .
For example ‘ ä ’ can be represented as one character ( LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS ) or as two characters ( LATIN SMALL LETTER A followed by COMBINING DIAERESIS ) .
The former is known as the precomposed form and the latter as the decomposed form .
There are also presentation forms that are considered compatibility equivalents of other characters .
For example , LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI is a presentation form of LATIN SMALL LETTER F and LATIN SMALL LETTER I .
Unicode Normalization
Forms defines four normalization forms of Unicode that differ in their representation of characters that can be decomposed or that have compatibility equivalents .
Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0 : Normalization ( which is still a working draft ) specifies that the Normalization Form C ( NFC for short ) ought to be used on the Web .
There are a lot of transitional applications that treat Unicode as wide ISO - 8859 - 1 — like ISO - 8859 - 1 is wide ASCII .
These applications are able to deal with precomposed accented characters but not with the canonically equivalent NFD representations .
Thus , NFC is the safer choice if you want to maximize the probability that your text renders nicely .
Using NFC is not a well - formedness requirement — just a robustness bonus .
According to the XML spec , “ an XML processor MAY , but need not , make it possible for an application to retrieve the text of comments ” .
Since the receiving application is not guaranteed to see the comments , comments are not an appropriate place for data that you want to the recipient to process .
That a particular DTD does not allow embedded RDF metadata does not make comments an appropriate place for metadata .
Do n’t rely on external entities on the Web
It follows from the XML spec that external entities are inherently unsafe for Web documents , because non-validating XML processors are allowed not to process them and someone may be using a non-validating XML processor to parse the content you serve on the Web .
Therefore , it makes sense not to rely on external entities .
When you are not relying on them , why have them around at all ?
Anyone processing them would just waste time .
The straight - forward way is to produce doctypeless XML .
But what about validation ?
It turns out there is a better validation formalism than DTDs .
It is more interesting to know the answer to the question “ Does this document conform to these rules ? ” than to the question “ Does this document conform to the rules it declares itself ? ” RELAX NG validation answers the first question .
DTD validation of answers the second .
RELAX NG allows you to validate a document against a schema that is more expressive than a DTD without polluting the document with schema - specific syntax .
Do n’t bother with CDATA sections
XML provides two ways of escaping markup - significant characters : predefined entities and CDATA sections .
CDATA sections are only syntactic sugar .
The two alternative syntactic constructs have no semantic difference .
CDATA sections are convenient when you are editing XML manually and need to paste a large chunk of text that includes markup - significant characters ( eg. code samples ) .
However , when producing XML using a serializer , the serializer takes care of escaping automatically and trying to micromanage the choice of escaping method only opens up possibilities for bugs .
Do n’t bother with escaping non-ASCII
Since you are using UTF - 8 ( or UTF - 16 ) , the output encoding can represent the whole of Unicode directly .
There is no need to escape non-ASCII characters in any way .
Only < , > , & and ( in attribute values ) " need escaping .
That ’s it .
No entities needed .
No numeric character references needed .
If you insist on escaping non-ASCII , please make sure you handle astral characters correctly .
Avoid adding pretty - printing white space in character data
XML has a design problem that makes source formatting leak into parsed content .
Instead of reserving eg. literal tabs and line feeds exclusively for source formatting so that the parser could always discard them , XML allows white space to be both significant content and meaningless pretty - printing .
The mess is left for higher layers to sort out .
To avoid problems , it is prudent never to introduce pretty - printing white space in character data .
Personally , I do n’t pretty - print at all when I produce XML programmatically .
The safe way to pretty - print is to put the white space inside the tags themselves instead of putting it between them .
That is , if you have
< foo > bar </ foo >
instead of doing this
< foo >
bar
</ foo >
do this
< foo
> bar</ foo
>
Do n’t use text / xml
The XML specification provides a means for XML documents to declare their own character encoding .
This way , the encoding information travels with the document even in environments that ca n’t store or communicate the encoding information externally .
Unfortunately , the XML specification allows external encoding information to override the internal encoding information .
Considering Ruby ’s Postulate , it would probably be a better idea to count on the internal information just like you trust a ZIP file itself when it comes to figuring out which compression method has been used instead of letting an external HTTP header say which decompression method you should apply .
According to RFC 3023 , the text / xml content type never allows you to use the internal information .
Even in the absence of an explicit charset parameter , the default is US - ASCII trumping the XML spec .
( Of course , there ’s a lot of software that ignores the RFC , but that ’s not a good basis to build on . )
When the type application / xml is used without the charset parameter , the XML spec governs on the matter of character encoding .
For some vocabularies , there are types of the form application / *+xml , which also do n’t suffer from the counter - intuitive encoding default of text / xml .
Use XML 1.0
XML 1.0 is well supported .
XML 1.1 is not interoperable with XML 1.0 software .
XML 1.0 processors are required to reject XML 1.1 documents .
XML 1.1 adds the ability to use some previously forbidden control characters like the form feed while still forbidding U+0000 , so you still cannot zero - extend random binary data and smuggle it over XML as text .
XML 1.1 also allows you to use Khmer , Amharic , Ge ’ez , Thaana , Cherokee , and Burmese characters in element and attribute names .
Contrary to what XML 1.1 propaganda may lead people to believe , XML 1.0 already allows content in those languages .
Additionally , XML 1.1 changes the definition of white space to accommodate IBM mainframe text conventions .
Test with astral characters
Unicode was originally supposed to be 16 bits wide .
However , the original 16 bits running up to U+FFFF turned out to be insufficient .
Thus , Unicode was extended to extend up to U+10 FFFF .
The range of scalar values is considered to be partitioned into 17 planes with 16 bits worth of code points on each plane .
The characters in the range of the original 16 bits constitute the Basic Multilingual Plane ( or BMP or Plane 0 ) .
The range above U+FFFF consists of astral planes and the characters above U+FFFF are called astral characters .
The original way of simply storing a character as an unsigned 16 - bit integer was extended to cover the astral planes using surrogate pairs yielding the UTF - 16 encoding .
A range of values that fall in the BMP are set aside to be used as surrogates .
An astral character is represented as a surrogate pair : a high surrogate ( a 16 - bit code unit ) followed by a low surrogate ( another 16 - bit code unit ) .
Some programs operating on 16 - bit units may not pass surrogate pairs through intact even though one might think the surrogate pairs could be smuggled through legacy software as two adjacent “ characters ” .
Moreover , when UTF - 16 data is converted into UTF - 8 , the surrogate pair needs to be converted into the scalar value of the code point which is then converted into a 4 - byte UTF - 8 byte sequence .
Some broken converters may produce a 3 - byte sequence for each surrogate instead .
( This kind of broken UTF - 8 has been formalized as CESU - 8 . )
Because of these issues , it is a good idea to test that astral characters can travel through your system intact and that the output produced is proper UTF - 8 and not CESU - 8 .
Test with forbidden control characters
XML semi-arbitrarily forbids some ASCII control characters and Unicode values that are reserved to be used as sentinels ( eg. U+0000 and U+FFFF ) .
These characters render the document ill - formed .
Therefore , it is important to make sure they cannot occur in the output of your system .
It is a good idea to try to introduce these characters into the system and make sure that they are either caught right upon input or at least filtered out in the XML serializer .
Test with broken UTF -*
Whichever UTF you use in memory or for input , it is possible to construct illegal code unit sequences .
With UTF - 32 the scalar value may be outside the Unicode range .
With UTF - 16 there may be unpaired surrogates .
With UTF - 8 there may be overlong byte sequences , sequences that are not the shortest form for a given character or sequences whose scalar value fall in the surrogate range .
You should try throwing broken code unit sequences at your system and make sure that broken input can never silently translate into broken output .
Most importantly , if your input or memory UTF is the same as the output UTF , you should not merely copy code units into the output without checking them .
Usually checking is achieved as a side effect by using UTF - 8 for input and output and UTF - 16 in memory , so broken data is caught in the conversion .
