Let Fake States Fail : Anarchy as a Viable Solution to Artificial States
This guest post is by Claudia R. Williamson , Post - doctoral Fellow at NYU ’s Development Research Institute and is part of Secession Week 2010 : Culture and Secession .
The boundary of nations can be the result of a naturally emergent process where individuals on the ground choose to align themselves together or borders can artificially be drawn from the top - down for political considerations .
Artificial states were often created post - colonization or from post - war agreements without much consideration for how division or unity would affect indigenous groups .
At times , some ethnic groups were artificially divided by political boundaries , while other groups wanting separation were forced together into one political unit .
No other continent is affected more by artificial , or fake , states than Africa .
Most African borders were created during colonization with few changes made after de-colonization .
The consequences from these divisions are substantial .
A recent study , Artificial States , by Alberto Alesina , William Easterly and Janina Matuszeski , documents these consequences stating , “ eighty percent of African borders follow latitudinal and longitudinal lines , and many scholars believe that such artificial ( unnatural ) borders , which create ethnically fragmented countries …are at the root of Africa ’s economic tragedy . ”
The authors illustrate that higher ethnic group separation and more artificially drawn boundaries significantly lowers the level of a county ’s income .
These negative effects may persist because as outsiders create states , it may become more difficult for individuals residing in political units to overcome collective action problems such as providing public goods and finding ways to define property rights and enforce contracts .
In the absence of externally imposed divisions , socials norms may arise encouraging group cooperation and peaceful exchange .
The work of Peter Leeson provides historical evidence that this is in fact the case .
In pre-colonial Africa , stateless societies inhabited much of the continent ; however , instead of chaos ensuing ethnic tribes developed a variety of mechanisms to signal trustworthiness in order to minimize potential conflict and facilitate trading across groups .
The imposition of colonial rule , including the creation of artificial states , created noise in this signaling process causing a breakdown in trade , creating ethnic conflict and contributing to Africa ’s current poor economic performance .
So what is a viable solution to Africa ’s artificial states and the resulting negative consequences ?
Secession is one possible alternative , or put a different way , let so - called fake states actually fail .
The Fund for Peace Failed States Index classifies a significant portion of African countries as failing – a situation described when a national government is not providing some baseline functions such as providing internal security and minimal provision of public goods .
Instead of continually propping up artificial regimes through the use of foreign aid or direct military intervention , the international community should let these artificial states left over from colonialism dissolve into natural territories more closely aligned with individual preferences .
We have evidence that by doing so individuals might actually become better off .
Since 1991 , Somalia has essentially been stateless , i.e. , lacking a central government ; however , this anarchic state should not imply chaos or a lack of governance .
To the contrary , Somalia has established a reasonable level of law and order based on a traditional customary system that predates colonial rule .
Once the state collapsed , many returned to this traditional system .
And it appears to be working relatively well .
As documented by Peter Leeson ’s 2007 paper , “ The government ’s collapse and subsequent emergence of statelessness opened the opportunity for Somali progress . ”
Comparing data on development indicators pre- and post - statelessness , Leeson finds that Somalia ’s welfare is actually improving .
Benjamin Powell expands on this analysis showing that Somalia ’s welfare improvements are increasing at a faster rate than the average sub-Saharan African country .
The basic idea behind why statelessness can be welfare improving is relatively simple and straightforward .
If state predation goes unchecked government can actually do more harm than good , reducing welfare below its level under anarchy .
Thus , given a choice between an artificially propped up highly predatory government to a group of individuals operating under a spontaneously emerging governance system , anarchy starts to look more like a viable alternative .
This argument holds not only for African states but for other artificial states as well , including Iraq and the Middle East where conflict persists along colonially drawn borders .
This “ let ‘ em fail ” view is counter to most advice for fixing failed states .
But , I think , when considering possible solutions to fake or failed states , we should consider allowing individuals to rebuild and restructure their own political and economic institutions from the ground up .

US regulators are considering an inquiry into whether Apple violates antitrust law by requiring that its programing tools be used to write applications for the iPad and iPhone , a source familiar with the matter has now said .
The news comes amidst a high - profile dustup between Apple and Adobe Systems , which makes the widely used Flash software to provide video and build games .
Apple CEO Steve Jobs ... his comments on Adobe 's Flash may be put under the regulators ' spotlight .
Although Flash is nearly ubiquitous on the internet , Apple calls it a balky battery hog and Apple chief executive Steve Jobs will not allow Flash on the iPhone or iPad , or as a tool to build apps on those devices .
Apple has sold more than 50 million iPhones since its debut in 2007 , and one million iPads since its April 3 debut .
The devices ' popularity means extra scrutiny about every Apple move related to the smartphone platform .
Image caption Mark Zuckerberg wants to move to a web with a " social default " .
Facebook looks likely to cave into pressure from users and simplify its privacy settings in the near future .
It follows criticisms of its privacy policy from US senators , the European Union and civil liberty groups .
The social networking giant told BBC News that it was listening to the message from users that it has " made things too complex " .
" We 're working on responding to these concerns , " a spokeswoman said .
" Watch this space , " she added .
Crisis meeting
At the end of last year Facebook changed its default privacy settings , allowing profile information to be shared with the wider web , unless users specifically opted out .
Last month it moved a step further , opening up Facebook data to third - party websites , described by founder Mark Zuckerberg as a move towards " a web where the default is social " .
While Facebook sold the idea as a way to offer a more personalised surfing experience , critics were concerned that users were losing control over their information .
Image caption Facebook has launched a new site to appeal to mobile users
It prompted a letter from the European Commission saying changes to its privacy settings were " unacceptable " .
The move caused outrage among some users , who have organised a " Quit Facebook " day , scheduled for May 31 .
Last week Facebook held an internal meeting to deal with the crisis , which has already seen some high - profile users deactivate their Facebook accounts .
Facebook said it " did n't comment on deactivations " .
" Some 10 million users have joined Facebook since the recent privacy changes , " said a spokeswoman .
" There is a notion that people do n't know what they are doing but people are much more savvy about their online privacy than is often portrayed , " she added .
Since the changes were introduced in December , more than 50 % of users have changed their privacy settings , Facebook said in a statement to BBC News .
" The fact that approximately half have accepted , and half are customising shows that our recommendations are reasonable , " the statement read .
But it acknowledged that more could be done .
" We have heard from our users that our efforts to provide granular control have made things too complex .
Of course we 're working on responding to these concerns , " it said .
Critics say navigating its privacy policy is overly complex .
Its current privacy policy has 50 different settings and 170 options and runs to 5,830 words , making it longer than the US Constitution .
Alternatives to Facebook are springing up , including open source social network Diaspora .
Designed by four students from New York University , the project has quickly gained thousands of backers and received $ 125,000 in donations to help get it off the ground .
Mobile world
In separate news , Facebook has launched a site designed to increase its footprint in the developing world .
0.facebook.com is a mobile site that includes all the social network 's key features but is offered with no data charges .
It will be available through 50 mobile operators in 45 countries .
" When using the mobile internet , people around the world face two main challenges - sometimes the experience is too slow to be fun and the cost of data plans and understanding them can be daunting , " Facebook 's Sid Murlidhar wrote on the firm 's official blog .
" We have designed 0.facebook.com to help solve these two barriers and we hope that even more people will discover the mobile internet with Facebook as a result , " he added .
Facebook currently has more than 400 million users around the world .
ASP.NET and F# ( I. ) - Creating MVC web applications in F #
Some time ago , I wrote a couple of examples of developing web applications in F# using ASP .
NET .
Since then , the F# language and runtime has changed a little bit and there are also new technologies available in ASP .
NET , so I thought I 'd write a more up - to - date article on this topic .
In this article , I 'll present a simple " demo " F# web application that you can use as a starting point when creating your own projects ( you 'll also find a convenient Visual Studio 2010 template below ) .
The article shows the following interesting things :
ASP .NET MVC -

F# features -
The application also uses some nice F# features that are quite useful for developing web applications .
We 'll use modules and records to implement the model and we 'll also use advanced meta- programming features for constructing LINQ queries .
If you want to use F# for creating an MVC application , you have a few options .
It should be possible to create the web application solely as an F# project .
However , we 'll use a more convenient approach .
We 'll create a standard C# MVC project and move all the actual implementation to an F# library .
We 'll look at the application structure shortly .
The following screenshot shows a page that lists products in the Northwind database :
Application structure
The most convenient way to create an MVC web application , which is implemented in F# is to mix several C# and F# projects in a single solution .
F# does n't include web project templates and does n't implement all Visual Studio tools that are needed for comfortable web development , so we 'll create a C# projects that allow us to use LINQ to SQL and ASP .
NET designers .
All important pieces of code will be written in F# though !
WebApplication is the main MVC web application project .
This is a C# project , but it does n't contain almost any code , because model and all controllers are implemented in a referenced F# library .
This project mainly contains views ( aspx files ) and other resources ( such as stylesheets and database ) .

Core is an F# project that implements the core functionality of the application .

The Global .fs file registers routes for the URL rewriting .

WebApplication .
Data is a simple C# project that contains only generated LINQ to SQL classes for our sample database .
Although it is possible to rewrite the classes to F# , it is more convenient to use the tool available for C# in Visual Studio .
When creating the projects by hand , you 'll need to translate the generated controllers from C# to F# and you 'll need to add all relevant ASP .
NET references to the F# library project ( there is an absurd number of them ) .
However , you should n't face any difficulties or tricky problems .
In any case , it is easier to start using the Visual Studio 2010 template that you can download below .
Now that we looked at the application structure , we 'll look at a couple of interesting places in the application .
This may give you an idea of some benefits that F# provides to web developers ( although the sample is only very basic ! )
Implementing model in F# with LINQ
As already mentioned , I decided to use the F# implementation of LINQ to SQL for data access in the application .
There are only a few articles about this topic , so we 'll discuss it in some more details .
As already mentioned , LINQ to SQL cannot generate the classes natively in F# , so I created a separate C# project that contains just the generated classes .
The following listing shows the content of the Model.fs ( without a single function that will be discussed shortly ) .
As you can see , I created one record type for storing information about products that will be displayed in the page ( we 'll use it later ) .
The rest of the model is implemented as an F# module , which means that it will appear as static class to .
NET .
Modules are quite useful for storing functionality that does n't need to be encapsulated in a class , so this is a perfect fit :
namespace WebApplication .
Core open Microsoft .
FSharp .
Quotations open Microsoft .
FSharp .
Linq open Microsoft .
FSharp .Linq .
Query //
Namespace with LINQ to SQL generated classes open WebApplication .
Data //
Stores information about product ( will be used later ) type ProductInfo = { ID : int Name : string Category : string Price : System .
Decimal } //
Implementes the model for our MVC application module Model = // Returns the ' Product ' entity with the given ID let ProductDetail ( id ) = let dx = new NorthwindDataContext ( ) < @@ seq { for p in dx .
Products do if ( p. ProductID = id ) then yield p } |> Seq.head @@ > |> query
The ProductDetail function first creates a new instance of the generated data context and then runs the query .
A query in F# is written using quotations .
This means that the data - processing code is enclosed in < @@ ... @@ > , which instructs the compiler to store the expression tree of the code ( instead of compiling it ) .
The quotation is then passed to the built - in query function that interprets it as a LINQ query .
Inside the query , you can use sequence expressions as well as some basic functions from the Seq module .
In our application , we 're using sequence expression that selects all products with the specified ID and then use the Seq. head function to get only first such product .
Composing LINQ queries
The second function implemented in the model will return a list of products .
I made it a bit more sophisticated to demonstrate some interesting capabilities of the F# support for LINQ .
In particular , the function takes a parameter that can specify how to sort the products .
The parameter is a quotation that represents the expression tree of a key selector that specifies how products should be sorted .
A key selector is a function that takes a product and returns some its property ( or even calculated value ) .
For example , to sort products using the length of the product name , the key selector would be < @@ fun p -> p.ProductName.Length @@ > .
Let 's first look at the code and I 'll explain how the key selector is used after that :
let ListProducts ( keySelector : Expr< Product -> ' T > ) = let dx = new NorthwindDataContext ( ) < @@ seq { for p in dx .
Products |> Seq.sortBy %keySelector do for c in dx .
Categories do if ( p.CategoryID.Value = c.CategoryID ) then yield { ID = p. ProductID Name = p.ProductName Category = c.CategoryName Price = p.UnitPrice .Value } } @@ > |> query
The keySelector parameter has a type Expr < Product -> ' T > , which means that it is an expression tree ( or a quotation , in the F# terminology ) of some function that takes a Product and returns some value - the function is generic , so the value can be anything .
It is used in the quoted expression as a parameter of the Seq.sortBy function .
We use % keySelector , which means that the quotation of the key selector will be " spliced " into the quotation we 're writing .
When we pass the quoted query to the query function later , it will see the actual expression in place of the variable spliced using the % operator .
This allows us to compose queries from individual pieces , which is quite useful and cannot be directly done in C# - we can for example dynamically compose the WHERE clause using conditions specified by the user .
The sample query also uses a sequence expression with nested for loops to implement the JOIN functionality .
Although this is n't needed , because the Product entity contains a reference to the associated Category , I wrote the join explicitly to demonstrate a more complex LINQ query in F#.
Finally , when returning the result using the yield keyword , we construct a value of the record defined in the previous listing ( which is a bit simpler than declaring and creating a class in C# ) .
Implementing controllers in F #
Now that we have the module implementing the model component of our MVC application , we 'll also need to implement the controller .
We 'll look at the content of the ProductsController .fs file , which is more interesting as it uses the model and also calls the ListProducts function with several different key selectors as arguments .
The class contains two members that implement two actions of the controller .
The member List loads a list of products from the database .
It has a parameter which may be null and specifies the ordering of products ( simply as an integer ) .
The second member returns details about the specified product and is named Detail :
let ( |NonNull|_| ) ( a: Nullable < _ > ) = if a .
HasValue then Some( a.Value ) else None type ProductsController ( ) = inherit Controller ( ) member x.List( id: Nullable<int > ) = x.ViewData .
Model <- match id with | NonNull (1 ) -> Model.ListProducts < @@ fun p -> p.UnitPrice.Value @@ > | NonNull ( 2 ) -> Model.ListProducts < @@ fun p -> p.CategoryID.Value @@ > | _ -> Model.ListProducts < @@ fun p -> p.ProductName @@ > x. View ( ) member x.Detail ( id:int ) = x.ViewData .
Model <- Model.ProductDetail id x. View ( )
The listing first defines a simple active pattern that is useful when working with Nullable < T > values .
It matches when the value given as an argument contains some value and fails when the value is empty .
We use it in the List member where we need to select the ordering .
When the parameter contains 1 , we order products by price , parameter 2 specifies ordering by category and in all other cases ( including empty value ) we use default ordering by the product name .
As you can see we specify several different key selectors ( functions taking Product enclosed in quotation using < @@ ... @@ > ) of various return types .
This is possible , because the ListProducts function is generic .
In both of the actions , we assign the result to the Model property of the ViewData .
This allows the view to access the model in a type - safe way .
The code in the view is standard C# code , so we wo n't look at it here - it is just worth mentioning that F# records appear as standard .NET classes to the C# code , so the integration is very smooth .
Summary
When developing ASP.
NET MVC application in F# , the most convenient thing to do is to create a C# project and move all implementation to an F# library that is then referenced from the C# project ( which contains only aspx files and other content related to the presentation layer ) .
In F# , we can use LINQ for accessing data and the fact that quotations can be nicely composed using splicing allows us to implement some patterns that are not easy to write in C#.
Moreover , F# features such as modules and records as well as pattern matching are quite useful in web development .
However , this article contains only a very basic example that does n't really take the full advantage of F# , so can only encourage you to download the template below and try experimenting yourself !
Visual Studio 2010 template
As already mentioned , I created a simple template based on the described project that allows you to simply create MVC web applications that use F# by selecting the template in Visual Studio 2010 .
To increase your appetite , the screenshot on the right is taken from my " New Project " dialog after installing the template .
There are two minor gotchas with projects created from the template that you need to go through :
You 'll need to go to the WebApplication .
Data project and generate the LINQ to SQL classes from the database description manually ( for some reason , this does n't happen automatically when you build the project ) .
To do this , right click on Nortwind .dbml and select " Run Custom Tool " command .
You 'll need to fix the reference from WebApplication .
Core to WebApplication .
Data - simply remove the existing reference and add it again ( choosing the reference to another project in the solution ) .
Once that 's done , you should be able to run the project ( assuming that you have SQL Server Express installed - the version that comes with Visual Studio 2010 is fine ) .
In case you do n't want a template for Visual Studio , you can also download the sample as a stand - alone solution :
Enlarge AP file photo The Mojave Desert cross , the subject of a tense Supreme Court case in April , was stolen .
@FAITH_REASON ON TWITTER @FAITH_REASON ON TWITTER
Join the conversation : Religion , spirituality & ethics | Reader forum : Your beliefs LOS ANGELES  Private caretakers are vowing they will replace the steel cross honoring American war veterans that was stolen from its rocky base in the Mojave Desert less than two weeks after the Supreme Court ruled the memorial could remain on federal land .
Wanda Sandoz , who with her husband , Henry , have maintained the cross and its predecessor for more than 25 years , said she was stunned to learn Monday that thieves had cut welded bolts and made off with the cross .
" Who would do such a thing ? " she said .
" I can't imagine the type of person that would do this .
I do n't know that type of person . "
The Veterans of Foreign Wars , which first placed a wooden cross on the rock in 1934 to honor troops killed in World War I , has offered a $ 25,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for the theft .
VFW National Commander Thomas Tradewell called the theft a " desecration of a war memorial . "
" The memorial will be rebuilt and the vandals will be caught and prosecuted in federal court , since the crime occurred on government property , " he said .
Sandoz said her husband plans to replace the cross , with the VFW 's help , with an exact replica of the one he installed in 1996 , when a previous version was vandalized .
FAITH & REASON : Could a different ' memorial ' replace Mojave cross ?
SUPREME COURT : Allow cross on public land in California TENSE ARGUMENTS : Justices divided over cross on park land
The stolen cross was made of 4 - inch steel pipe welded together into a 7 - foot - tall cross and bolted into a rocky peak .
The site is in California , about 200 miles northeast of Los Angeles .
Linda Slater , spokeswoman for the National Park Service , said workers at the Mojave National Preserve saw the cross in place Sunday afternoon and discovered it missing Monday morning .
Its location is near a trailhead and a paved road where there is frequent foot and vehicle traffic , she said .
" I think everybody is shocked , " Slater said .
The cross has been the object of a lawsuit by plaintiffs who charged the religious symbol 's placement on federal land violated the U.S. Constitution 's separation of church and state .
The Supreme Court , in a 5 - 4 ruling last month , refused to order its removal and referred the case back to a lower court .
Congress is also trying to resolve the issue by transferring the memorial 's site into private hands .
" This was a legal fight that a vandal just made personal to 50 million veterans … and their families , " Tradewell said .
It was not immediately clear whether a replacement cross will be permitted .
" We 're waiting for news from the Department of Justice as to what we should do .
The case is still in litigation , " Slater told the Associated Press .

Food consumption under “ Satan ’s administration ” and Israeli siege
I hate hyperbole when things are already so bad that no exaggeration is needed .
So I am going to keep things as rational and methodical as possible , with a nice and healthy smattering of caveats wherever needed .
Still , I have no doubt what I am about to say would disturb my family members who slowly starved in Auschwitz while working as hard laborers .
But I trust the reaction would arise more from painful memories and terrifying denial than anything else .
The facts of that matter are that in some places of the world , at some moments in history , you have policymakers deciding in precise terms how many calories an imprisoned population needs to survive .
Of course , this happens in actual prisons everywhere .
It also happens in Gaza today , as Israeli planners decide how many calories are needed to sustain the Palestinian population of 1.5 million people without creating a “ humanitarian catastrophe ” while they pursue their “ political ” weapon of siege against Hamas and the civilians of the Gaza Strip .
And it happened in the concentration and Nazi-run labor camps of the 1930s and 1940s .
Surely , the Nazi camps were incomparably worse ( strictly nutritionally speaking ) .
Right ?
Well , sort of .
Nutritional planning in Auschwitz
According to Yediot ’s “ journey into the Nazi records “ — i.e. “ Satan ’s administration ” — carefully archived documents reveal that on a randomly selected day ( Monday , December 7th , 1942 ) , a “ hard laborer ” in Auschwitz received 450 grams of bread , 30 grams of margarine , and 125 grams of cheese .
This yields a total of 605 grams per “ hard laborer ” .
In calories , 450 grams of bread is about 1,200 calories , 30 grams of margarine comprises about 175 calories , and 125 grams of cheese constitutes about 425 calories ( all numbers approximate ) .
So the daily caloric intake of an Auschwitz laborer in December 1942 was about 1,800 calories .
Note two things : ( 1 ) this is the absolute minimum recommended daily intake for men , according to the American College of Sports Medicine , and ( 2 ) billions of the world ’s poor people live ( and hunger ) today under this caloric intake .
I make these comments only by way of context ; they should not be read to mean that Nazi nutritional policy had any positive qualities whatsoever .
Exactly the opposite : they kept people at the bare bones of working survival so they could just manage to continue living as productive slaves .
Nutritional planning in Gaza
What about Gaza ?
After an Israeli NGO named Gisha sued the Israeli government under freedom of information legislation in order to find out exactly what is allowed for import into Gaza , and why , we now have a much better picture of Israeli siege planning .
In particular , the court case surfaced four documents that describe the details of Israel ’s siege , which is considered a “ central pillar in the means at the disposal of the State of Israel in the armed conflict between it and Hamas . ”
The documents lay out details about how goods requests are processed , how shortages in Gaza are monitored , and the list of approved goods .
The fourth document , of primary importance here , is titled “ Food Consumption in the Gaza Strip – Red Lines , ” and it establishes what Israel considers to be the minimum caloric intake needed Gaza ’s 1.5 million inhabitants , according to their age and sex .
Thus , Israeli planners have given careful consideration to the minimum amount of calories to be allowed in to Gaza to simultaneously serve as a weapon against Hamas , to attain Netanyahu ’s strategy of “ no prosperity , no development , no humanitarian crisis ” but still ensure the Palestinians get on a diet , in Dov Weisglass ’ “ joking ” words ( “ It ’s like a meeting with a dietitian .
We need to make the Palestinians lose weight , but not to starve to death . ” ) .
The Israeli government argued in the court case that releasing the specific numbers of calories , and the goods lists ( which include terrorist goods like coriander , crayons , and pasta ) , would damage national security , so we do not know the exact numbers for comparative purposes .
What we do know comes from two main sources .
The first , the Gaza Gateway project , charts goods entering versus goods needed ; typically allowances comprise between 25 % and 33 % of estimated daily need for Gaza ’s 1.5 million residents .
We also know from the IDF spokesperson ( via the IDF Twitter feed : @ IDFSpokesperson ) the daily amount of goods they allow into Gaza .
Let ’s take yesterday to be our random day .
According to the IDF tweet , 109 truckloads were allowed to enter ( this is very , very close to the mean over all days , and is thus representative of average daily allowances ) with 1,853 tons of humanitarian aid .
Now , how to compare ?
Well , let ’s be as generous as possible to the IDF .
Let ’s assume all these tons of aid have no packaging and so every single gram aid has caloric value ( to humans ) ; this is , of course , an absurdly strong assumption that works in the favor of the IDF ’s “ benevolence . ”
Under this assumption , then , the IDF yesterday let in almost 2 billion grams of food — 1,681,000,000 grams to be exact .
For every individual in Gaza , therefore , the IDF allowed in about 1,120 grams of food .
Of course , our assumptions were stringent and unrealistic , so the real quantity of food is probably very much lower .
We know from an IMF study that “ 75 percent of the population has been forced to reduce the quantity of food they buy , while 89 percent reduced the quality . ”
But we cannot calculate calories because Israel wo n’t tell us what it allows in .
Making these numbers even more unrealistic is the fact that this humanitarian aid includes shelters ( from international agencies , foreign governments , and NGOs ) and other non-edible items ; this also means the amount of food is lower .
If we assume that only one quarter of the humanitarian aid is non-edible , then we are left with something like 840 grams of food per person in Gaza .
This is a reasonable upper bound on possible , per-capita nutritional allowances for Gaza .
This ( admittedly rough ) estimate suggests that Israel allows Gazans to consume ( at most ) about 40 % more grams of food than the Nazis did their Auschwitz laborers .
So generous !
The lavish humanitarianism illustrated by Israel ’s Gaza policy is the final , definitive proof that critics of the Gaza siege are anti-Semites , as far as I am concerned .
Israel ’s siege differs from Auschwitz ’s nutritional policy by 40 % !
Time for the critics to shut their mouths .
Or not .
As long as you have scientists and military officials sit down to determine the lowest possible caloric intake you can provide to an imprisoned population , and then write policy documents explaining your methods , you are culpable for such comparisons , hyperbolic or not .

The industry , like all others , is deeply affected by a recession that has placed Americans far away from the office break rooms and lobbies that are the vending machine 's natural habitat .

Or maybe under the overpass where everyone lives now ? )

Q. Glenn , you 're a blogger at Salon.com , and author of three books : How Would A Patriot Act , A Tragic Legacy , and Great American Hypocrites .
You 're also one of the few writers who has levied harsh criticism against the War on Terrorism related policies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama .
I 've been surprised by how readily President Obama has embraced Bush - era legal arguments on detainee issues , and particularly troubled by his assertion that he possesses the unchecked power to assassinate , without due process , American citizens who he designates as " enemy combatants . "
Presuming that the Republican nominee in 2012 is also bad on civil liberties , what should a voter who cares deeply about these issues do ?
A . That 's hard to say , because ultimately , elections are about comparative choices , making it difficult to assess what one should do against an unnamed opponent .
If the GOP opponent is substantially worse , that would be a different calculus than if s/he is merely marginally worse or roughly as bad .
But what is clear is that , for a variety of reasons , the two - party system does not work in terms of providing clear choices .
No matter who wins , the same permanent factions that control Washington continue to reign .
That 's true no matter which issues one considers most important .
At some point , it 's going to be necessary to sacrifice some short - term political interests for longer - term considerations about how this suffocating , two - party monster can be subverted .
Q. You 've been adamant about the need to investigate lawbreaking during the Bush Administration , and to prosecute former government officials who committed illegal acts , arguing that it 's integral to the maintaining the rule of law in America .
There is , however , precedent for presidential lawbreaking in wartime , and the United States rolling back its worst excesses without ever actually going through a prosecution .
So is it really vital that we prosecute former officials like , say , Dick Cheney ?
Would we be better off today if past presidents -- FDR or LBJ , for example -- had been prosecuted for war crimes ?
A. Just because something was done in the past is no reason to consider it a good thing or to continue to do it in the future .
I absolutely believe that prosecution of past war crimes would have produced extremely good results .
At the Nuremberg Trials , Americans themselves explained why it 's so vital not to permit serious crimes to go unpunished : it 's not just a matter of justice ( though it is that ) , but also future deterrence .
If war crimes are permitted to go unpunished , it is virtually certain they will be repeated .
If Presidents know that they can commit serious crimes with impunity ( as they know now ) , then one thing is certain : they 'll continue to commit them .
What possible reason would any future rational Presidents have for refraining from torture or other war crimes if they decide they want to do that ?
They can do with absolute impunity , so why would n't they , and why should n't they ?
That 's the framework we 've created .
More broadly , the Founders emphasized continuously that America would entail all sorts of inequalities : in talent , in abilities , in wealth , in power .
All of that was acceptable provided everyone played by the same rules , which are set forth in what we call " the law . "
The only way outcome inequalities can be justified is if everyone is subject equally to the rule of law .
Once you start exempting people based on their status ( which is what happens when Presidents are immunized for their crimes ) , a central premise of the American political system -- that everyone is equal under the Rule of Law -- is subverted , and all of the other inequalities become indefensible .
Q. You'd think that Tea Partiers , with their distrust of President Obama and their ostensibly libertarian ethos , would be allies in the fight to rein in executive power .
On the other hand , these are people who look to War on Terrorism hawks like Rush Limbaugh , Sarah Palin and Mark Levin for intellectual leadership .
To complicate things even more , some of these people are huge Ron Paul fans .
In your work , do you presume that you can win some of these people over to your civil libertarian position , or do you assume that an alliance of this kind is untenable ?
A . It 's absolutely tenable .
Some of the earliest and most vocal opponents of the Bush / Cheney assault on the Constitution were found on the Right .
Back when virtually all leading Democrats were petrified of opposing George Bush on anything having to do with Terrorism -- or , worse , were actively supporting what he was doing -- people like Bob Barr , Bruce Fein , the Cato Institute , even George Will were emphatically objecting .
I devoted a chapter in my first book , about Bush 's executive power abuses , to conservatives who consistently applied what they were saying about such things in the 1990s to oppose those abuses when perpetrated by a Republican administration .
As you suggest , when it comes to Terrorism issues , Ron Paul is as steadfast in defense of civil liberties as any major political figure in the country .
A significant minority of my readership has always been libertarians and other non-progressives who viewed Bush radicalism with serious alarm .
I 've written about civil liberties in The American Conservative several times .
When Jane Hamsher and I founded Accountability Now , to target incumbents who served corporate and Beltway interests rather than their constituents , we did so by forming a coalition with libertarians and others devoted to civil liberties protection .
There is much greater agreement across the ideological spectrum than our conventional political punditry wants to recognize .
But clearly , the people on the Right genuinely devoted to civil liberties and restraining executive power are ( as is true for Democrats ) only a minority .
The problem is partisan tribalism .
Most people care about restraining executive power and fighting for civil liberties only when their party is out of power .
When their party is in power , they place blind trust in political leaders and believe they will do Good without any need for checks and restraints , because they are Good .
That 's why conservatives who spent the 1990s shrieking about the tyrannical FISA court ( it issued warrants for the Government to eavesdrop on Americans in secret ! ) suddenly favored warrantless eavesdropping ( and every other unchecked power ) when a Republican was President , and it's why so many Democrats who spent the last decade pretending to be so upset about Bush 's Terrorism policies and expanded powers are perfectly content now that it 's Barack Obama wielding them .
That said , I think the citizenry is becoming less and less defined by loyalty to one of the two parties , and these partisan divisions are breaking down , becoming much less clean .
We saw that with opposition to TARP , the general anger toward corporatist control of Washington , discomfort with our policy of endless wars , and the widespread disgust with incumbent power .
Far more important than Right v. Left is insider v. outsider ( or politically powerful v. powerless ) .
That fact is becoming more crystallized , and the more that happens , the more the artificial barriers that divide citizens ( Right and Left ) will erode , the more apparent will be the commonalities .
The political establishment ( both parties ) benefits from keeping citizens divided against one another based on trivial distractions and tribal loyalties , which has the effect of strengthening the political establishment .
That 's been the impediment to having citizens across the ideological spectrum join together to combat abuses of power in Washington , and I think it 's eroding .
That , I think , is what Washington elites fear most .
Q. You 've been critical of the Washington DC press corps -- especially the folks who cover the White House -- for their cozy , self - serving relationship with powerful sources .
Do you have any ideas for remedying this situation ?
If you were DC Bureau Chief at The New York Times , how would you cover official Washington ?
When I began writing about politics , I believed that applying pressure , shame , and the like to our national journalists could help influence behavior in a positive way .
I no longer think that .
Our national media is n't subservient to political power because of the behavior or personality attributes of any particular journalists -- at least not primarily .
The real problem is structural and cultural .
The largest corporations which own the largest media outlets need to maintain a positive , constructive relationship with the government -- as the corporate - government axis grows , that relationship becomes increasingly important -- so the last thing they want to do is antagonize political power .
Journalists who work for the largest media outlets are nothing more than corporate employees -- no different than the Accounting Manager or Sales Representative in a non-media division .
All people who work in large corporations know what is expected of them , know what can advance or undermine their careers .
There 's just no incentive for corporate journalists to be hostile or even adversarial to the powerful ; the opposite is true : their career incentives are for them to be as friendly as possible .
There are all sorts of other , frequently noted reasons why our major journalists are largely so subservient to political power : that 's how lazy journalists secure access and thus " scoops " ; corporations in general tend to hire people whose instincts are to please and accommodate authority rather than work against it ; journalists now reside in the same socioeconomic circle and celebrity culture as the politicians they cover , etc. etc .
But ultimately , corporate ownership of the largest media outlets means there are structural impediments to an adversarial press corps .
That 's why I no longer think the goal is to reform the existing establishment media but , rather , to create an alternative to it , a competitor to it , that will perform the functions it refuses to perform .
We 're always going to need large media outlets .
An entity as powerful and sprawling as the Federal Government can only be investigated and checked by media institutions with substantial resources .
We need a corporation like The Washington Post which can pay Dana Priest to do nothing for months but work on a single story concerning CIA black sites or conditions at Walter Reed .
And there are good journalists doing real adversarial work at these large media outlets .
But I see blogs and other alternative media sites as using technology to supplement what those media outlets do and performing the functions they fail to perform .
Q. How does your background as a constitutional law and civil rights litigator inform the way you approach research and writing as a journalist ?
One of the primary skills one learns as a litigator is to make one 's case by beginning with first premises , establishing their truth with evidence , and then compelling the conclusions you want others to reach .
That 's how I try to write now .
I think that if you want to make an argument , there 's an obligation to lay out the premises for it , provide evidence for it , allow readers to assess the documentation for themselves .
That belief probably comes from the way judges and juries need to be persuaded that an argument is true .
Beyond that , I chose to litigate constitutional and civil rights cases , and to represent plaintiffs , because I wanted to use my abilities to empower those who are vulnerable and powerless and who are being mistreated by the powerful .
That , to me , is a primary purpose of the Constitution itself , and , when done correctly , a core purpose of journalism .
That 's what I try to do now as well in the work I do .
I 'd much rather be at war with corrupt elites than serving their interests .
Q. You 've complained on numerous occasions about misinformation spread in the mainstream press .
If you could correct one mis-impression among Americans that is exacerbated by media , what would it be ?
One particularly harmful mis-impression comes from our media 's refusal to report that we ourselves frequently do exactly that which we like to believe only the Bad , Tyrannical countries do .
The American media incessantly highlights the bad acts of other governments ( especially the ones the American government dislikes ) while completely ignoring identical acts by our own government ( one illustrative example was the melodramatic obsession over Iran 's detention of Roxana Sabera , or North Korea 's detention of Euna Lee and Laura Ling , while completely ignoring the far more severe detentions of Al Jazeera and other journalists for years by the U.S. Government without any charges whatsoever ; that creates the severe mis-impression that detaining journalists is something only the Bad , Tyrannical countries do ) .
That 's exactly the opposite of how it should be -- the American media should be far more interested in the abuses of our own government than those of other countries -- and it creates this severe mis-impression that only other countries , but not America , engage in these bad acts .
It 's pure propaganda .
Q . The model you 've used to succeed in the blogosphere is quite unlike most other high - traffic bloggers -- you generally post no more than once a day , your output tends to come in long , researched posts rather than shorter , " blog - length " items , your tone is more earnest than most , and you 're funded by a mix of a journalistic institution and reader contributions .
Is this a model that has a future among other writers ?
What accounts for your having arrived here , whereas other professional progressive bloggers seem to be paid solely by their employer and produce many posts a day to keep up traffic ?
The most important asset I have is that I 'm only answerable to my readers .
Even when I moved my blog to Salon , it was non-negotiable for me that I would retain absolute editorial independence : nobody has the ability to change a comma of what I write , to direct that I write or not write about a topic , etc .
Salon has been superb in that regard -- they 've provided support when I 've asked but never interfered in anything I 've written and have always stood behind it , even when influential people have complained vociferously -- and I would never put myself in a situation where that was n't the case .
I have a reader fund - raiser once a year which ensures that I can continue to work independently ( i.e. not have to work at larger media outlet where I 'd lose independence ) and which allows me to have a research assistant and other tools that aid what I do .
It 's the perfect balance of being accountable but also fully independent .
As for blogging style , there 's obviously a demand for all different types of approaches .
I 'm aware that my writing demands a lot from readers in terms of time and attention , and some people are not going to read what I write because of the length or complexity .
That 's fine .
I 'm happy with that .
I 'm aware that if I shortened and simplified what I wrote , there 'd be some additional people who would become readers who are n't now ( though I 'd also likely lose readers as well ) .
I do n't necessarily want a readership that has a short attention span or which demands that everything be reduced to four simple sentences .
Given the size of my readership , and the fact that it 's grown steadily beginning with the day I began writing , there is obviously a substantial demand for the kind of writing I do , so there 's no reason for me to change it .
I do n't think any one style is objectively superior .
Some of my favorite bloggers are the pithiest and rarely write more than a paragraph or two .
Others who I read every day write long essays .
For me , I try to write in a way that would persuade me if I were the reader .
When I read an argument , I do n't want to have premises tacitly assumed or conclusions asserted without documentation .
That often leads to sloppy analysis or cheap , crowd - pleasing showboating .
I want to see assertions proven and conclusions demonstrated with a full logical thought - train .
Since I want that when I 'm a reader , that 's what I feel obligated to provide to my readers , even if it means much longer and more detailed posts than is the norm .
For people who want to ingest everything in no more than 100 words , there are millions of blogs for them ; I have no interest in replicating that .
As important , it 's necessary to write longer and more evidence - based arguments if you 're making points outside of the conventional categories of political debate .
The reason cable news shows can have 4 - minute segments is because they rarely include anything other than the standard Democratic and GOP talking points .
Everyone is already very familiar with all the premises .
Nothing needs to be explained .
The discussion basically writes itself .
If I were one of those bloggers who wanted to wake up every day and write some version of " Democrats - are - great / GOP - is - horrible " or vice - versa -- just regurgitate DNC and RNC talking points every day -- I would n't need more than a paragraph for any argument .
I 'd have a readership already on board with everything I wanted to say , and nothing would need to be explicated .
I would just feed them the conclusions they already embrace ( Rush Limbaugh is a liar !
Sarah Palin is stupid !
Glenn Beck is crazy !
Michael Moore is fat ! ) and all would be harmonious .
But if you want to write outside of that framework , you can't rely on already - assumed premises .
You have to re-create the perspective from scratch .
That means beginning with the initial premises , proving them with evidence , and building them into a coherent whole .
That takes space and time and words to do , and that 's how I prefer to write .
Q. You self - identify as a progressive .
I consider myself a mix of conservative and libertarian , though when I write here at The Atlantic or do guest spots on All Things Considered , I 'm identified merely as " a Southern California based journalist " or some such .
We both do our best to produce intellectually honest analysis grounded in fact , research , and logic .
Are the ideological labels so ubiquitous in our political discourse more trouble than they 're worth ?
The FTA has a new ( January ) report on carbon footprints of various transit modes , based on 2008 data .
For electric transit , the authors use estimates based on the composition of that region ’s power grid .
Here are the locally relevant figures :
System lbs. CO2 per passenger mile Washington State Ferries 2.123 Seattle Streetcar 1.301 Avg. U.S. SOV 0.964 Metro Diesels 0.452 [ Tacoma ] Link 0.411 Metro trolleys 0.388 Sounder 0.369 ST
Express 0.327 King Co. Vanpools 0.246 Snohomish Co. Vanpools 0.239 Pierce Co. Vanpools 0.228 Seattle Center Monorail 0.190
For comparison , the Portland MAX , a more mature system , comes in at 0.213 .
The national champion is Maryland ’s MARC commuter rail at 0.013 .
Of large systems , BART ( 0.085 ) is very efficient with particularly clean energy .
Thoughts below the jump .
What ’s missing here is the extent to which certain transportation types encourage density and walking , thus reducing passenger miles and overall carbon impacts .
That ’s difficult to measure but important to remember .
Considering Link ’s partial implementation and relatively undeveloped corridor , it is doing pretty well and will probably be in the ballpark of MAX when built out .
[ This 2008 data of course refers to Tacoma Link .
No more late night edits ! ]
For some of these modes , the marginal cost of a new rider is zero ; those modes will be better at sustainably accommodating growth .
King County ’s vanpool system is second in size in the nation (! ) , behind only Utah Transit Authority .
It serves 6.2 % of all vanpool passenger miles in the nation .

Alex Jones - Dark Secrets : Inside Bohemian Grove
This film covers Alex Jones and his adventure to find out what 's really going on at Bohemian Grove .
After you 're done reading over this , do n't forget to read The Order of Death - Jones ' follow up to this film .
Let 's just jump right in !
As usual there 's a very dramatic introduction sequence , with the music and filters it sort of reminds me of an early Marilyn Manson music video .
[ Alex Jones ]
Hello , I'm Alex Jones and I 'm a radio and television host based in Austin , Texas .
And for many years I 've been exposing the criminal activities of the global elite , also known as the New World Order .
In past films we 've documented the centralization of power , the move towards world government ; the attack on the nation state ; self defense ; the second amendment ; family values , that is , the family itself , as well as private property rights .
If you have n't read any of the other Alex Jones articles on my web site , I suggest you check those out as well .
He does little to expose real conspiracies in America , such as COINTELPRO , but rather tries to expose imaginary things that have their roots in medieval Europe and anti-Masonic beliefs right here in America .
But time and time again in my research I come , well ... eye - to - eye with something that 's even hard for me to believe .
And that 's that the elite , again , the so - called establishment kings , those that know best , the visions of the anointed ones , are obsessed with the occult , from presidents to governors to heads of industry .
We 've all seen the stories of presidents and first ladies obsessed with their astrologers , making national policy decisions upon their recommendations .
Spiritual guides , shamans in the White House , my friends , it gets far worse than that .
It 's not just politicians who are interested in the occult , but also regular people .
If that were n't the case , you would n't find horoscopes in nearly every newspaper in North America .
Now I personally am a Christian , but even an atheist should be concerned about the information we 're about to bring forward in this new documentary film , the Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove .
You see , for over a 120 + years in northern California in Sonoma County , on a 2,700 acre secluded redwood grove , leaders from around the world , prime ministers , chancellors , presidents , governors , again , the heads of industry , banking , academia , the media , Hollywood .
Only a select few , a little over 2,000 people , travel there to engage in bizarre ancient Canaanite , Luciferian , Babylon mystery religion ceremonies .
The actual membership number is around 2,700 [ 1 ] and really is a wide verity of individuals , primarily leaders in business , but also entertainers , politicians on so forth .
As far as clubs go , 2,700 does not seem like a " select few " , if their true intentions are making decisions here , they sure have a lot of overhead in running the world .
I 'm not sure how they can be " Canaanite " , " Luciferian " and also " Babylon[ian ] " .
These three religions / practices are pretty much incompatible with each other .
The Canaanite religion was not much different than the religion of the Hebrews - where Judaism and Christianity originate [ 2 ] , where a single god is worshipped , but other gods are acknowledged as actually existing in the Bible [ 3a to 3z ] , but there several passages that contradict this [ 4a to 4d ] .
Obviously , today 's Hebrews , Jews , Christians , Muslims , and all faiths that originate from the original Abrahamic faith no longer acknowledge multiple gods , but it was a part of their belief system for several thousand years .
By Luciferian I assume he 's referring to Satanists who worship an actual anthropomorphic Satan .
Such a belief system actually is n't too different from Christianity , considering if one is willing to worship " Satan " / " The Devil " , then one essentially are agreeing that the Christian view of Lucifer is therefore real .
And of course , if one admits that aspect of Christianity is real , then one is admitting to worshipping what is considered to be a lesser being , meanwhile acknowledging the Christian God actually exists .
Sound confusing ?
Yeah , I think it 's stupid too , but there are actual people out there who do practice this and not all of them are 14 - year - olds dressed in black .
The religion of ancient Babylon had a tremendous affect on Judaism and thus Christianity .
In fact , concepts such as angels ( with wings , that is ) and many other stories , such as the creation story , the great flood , and so forth are pretty much identical to earlier Babylonian tales and beliefs .
It 's very likely those ideas came into Judaism from Babylon .
Of course in various areas of ancient Babylon there were gods that played a more central role , depending on the city , such as Ishtar at Akkad [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] .
An interesting side note is that Zeitgeist Part I does n't mention this , but I did .
I hardly see how these systems could be worshipped and believed in side by side .
They have many similarities linking them , but the concepts and central beliefs are all completely different .
It 's obvious that Alex Jones is simply attempting to take occult sounding belief systems and apply them to the Bohemian Club to make it sound scary .
In reality , Alex Jones does not seem to realize how much of the Canaanite religion is identical to his own or how the Assyro - Babylonian religion had a tremendous affect on what became his belief system .
At least , that was the rumors .
And so I went to the library and got on the Internet and saw many of the mainstream news articles admitting that world leaders do indeed go there , and they fly into San Francisco and other surrounding cities and they drive into the rural hills and mountains of Northern California ...
I have tremendous doubts that Alex Jones thought they were " just rumors . "
If this thing is so secret , especially if it's a bunch of " dark secrets " , how was he able to find so much about it ?
You can find thousands of pictures of Bohemian Grove events and their little ritual pretty much everywhere [ 8 ] .
... and that these stories have been coming out that they worship some 45 foot stone owl god .
And then I began to read some of the documentation of this " Moloch " character of the Old Testament mentioned many times in Leviticus .
That 's in the bible .
Why are world leaders traveling to the middle of nowhere to worship this thing ?
They do n't worship the owl .
It 's likely a reference to Athena - goddess of knowledge - who was constantly seen with an owl in nearly all depictions of her [ 9 ] [ 10 ] .
I 'm not sure why he 's bringing up Moloch , as Moloch is not mentioned by the Bohemian Grove people , nor has Moloch ever been associated with the owl or depicted as an owl , only as a bull .
It 's really no surprise Moloch is mentioned in the Old Testament , as he was one of the most popular gods in the middle east [ 11 ] .
Well I had to check it out myself .
And I 'm proud of my team , Mike Hanson , Violet Nichols , they traveled with me there , we talked to some of the locals discreetly , we successfully infiltrated , with the help of some of the locals and Channel 4 , World of Wonder , British television that teamed up with us .
And I successfully infiltrated , through the Secret Service , through the guards , through the Sonoma County sheriff 's department .
We were inside for hours .
That 's only one day out of the two weeks that they meet there for the admitted summer fire festival of the Bohemian Club .
Well , basically that 's enough for me .
It 's hard to even describe it with words .
And I hope that our hidden cameras can give you at least a small piece of what I witnessed .
To have world leaders engaging in this type of sickening behavior , oh yes there 's much more to come , mock human sacrifices ... they claim , just shocks the foundations of what Americans believe their leaders to be .
Believe their leaders to be ?
Is he implying that leaders can only be " good ol ' Christians " ?
And then to have it intimately connected with world government , it does n't make a lot of sense until you research history .
All throughout history , spanning back into the mists of the beginnings of civilization , we see world leaders from the empires of old , from the Aztec kings and priests , to Babylonian leaders , to ancient Rome , engaging in twisted behavior .
If you 're familiar with Alex Jones ' other movies and my writings on them , you 'll find that there 's little to no evidence of his world government conspiracy theories .
Interestingly enough I found my evidence by researching history , among other things , and his theory still does n't make a whole lot of sense .
That 's true , absolute power corrupts absolutely , and even outside of Mesoamerica , Mesopotamia , and ancient Europe , you can find not only leaders engaging in twisted behavior , but regular people as well .
Could it be that when you have all the power and all the women and all the money and all the lands and all the art , you have to do something new ?
You have to go against the basic grain of humanity .
You have to get off in a sick way .
That 's what we witnessed in northern California , July 15th , 2000 .
Get ready to go inside the Bohemian Grove .
This should be interesting ...

A member of the Class of 2010 — who this season dons synthetic cap and gown , listens to the inspirational words of David Souter ( Harvard ) , Anderson Cooper ( Tulane ) , or Lisa Kudrow ( Vassar ) , and collects a diploma — need not be a statistics major to know that the odds of stepping into a satisfying job , or , indeed , any job , are lower now than might have been imagined four long years ago , when the first posters were hung on a dorm - room wall , and having a .edu e-mail address was still a novelty .
Statistically speaking , however , having an expertise in statistics may help in getting a job : according to a survey conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers , graduates with math skills are more likely than their peers in other majors to find themselves promptly and gainfully employed .

The safest of all degrees to be acquiring this year is in accounting : forty - six per cent of graduates in that discipline have already been offered jobs .
Business majors are similarly placed : forty - four per cent will have barely a moment to breathe before undergoing the transformation from student to suit .
Engineers of all stripes — chemical , computer , electrical , mechanical , industrial , environmental — have also fared relatively well since the onset of the recession : they dominate a ranking , issued by Payscale.com , of the disciplines that produce the best - earning graduates .
Particular congratulations are due to aerospace engineers , who top the list , with a starting salary of just under sixty thousand dollars — a figure that , if it is not exactly stratospheric , is twenty - five thousand dollars higher than the average starting salary of a graduate in that other science of the heavens , theology .
Economics majors are n’t doing badly , either : their starting salary averages about fifty thousand a year , rising to a mid-career median of a hundred and one thousand .
Special note should be taken of the fact that if you have an economics degree you can , eventually , make a living proposing that other people should n’t bother going to college .
This , at least , is the approach of Professor Richard K. Vedder , of Ohio University , who is the founder of the Center for College Affordability and Productivity .
According to the Times , eight out of the ten job categories that will add the most employees during the next decade — including home - health aide , customer - service representative , and store clerk — can be performed by someone without a college degree .
“ Professor Vedder likes to ask why fifteen percent of mail carriers have bachelor ’s degrees , ” the paper reported .
The argument put forth by Professor Vedder ( Ph.D. , University of Illinois ) is , naturally , economic : of those overly schooled mail carriers , he said , “ Some of them could have bought a house for what they spent on their education . ”
Another economist , Professor Robert I. Lerman , of American University ( Ph.D. , M.I.T. ) , told the Times that high schools , rather than readying all students for college , should focus on the acquisition of skills appropriate to the workplace .
According to the Times , these include the ability to “ solve problems and make decisions , ” “ resolve conflict and negotiate , ” “ coöperate with others , ” and “ listen actively . ”

It may be news that the academy is making a case for the superfluity of the academy , but skepticism about the value of college , and of collegians , is hardly novel .
Within the sphere of business , a certain romance attaches to the figure of the successful college dropout , like Steve Jobs , who was enrolled at Reed for only a semester , or Bill Gates , who started at Harvard in 1973 but did n’t get his degree until it was granted , honorarily , thirty - four years later .
On the political stage , too , having spent excessive hours in seminar rooms and libraries is widely regarded as a liability .
Vide Peggy Noonan ’s celebration , during the 2004 Presidential campaign , of George W. Bush ’s lack of cerebration .
“ He ’s not an intellectual , ” Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal .
“ Intellectuals start all the trouble in the world . ”
The candidates ’ education , or the insufficiency thereof , came up again during the most recent Presidential election .
Sarah Palin told Katie Couric that she was “ not one of those who maybe came from a background of , you know , kids who perhaps graduate college and their parents get them a passport and give them a backpack and say go off and travel the world ” — even though Palin evidently considered college important enough to have tried out five different ones within three years .
Meanwhile , Barack Obama ’s degrees from prestigious universities were , to his critics , evidence of his unfitness for office .
“ The last thing we need are more pointy - headed intellectuals running the government , ” the political scientist Charles Murray ( B.A. , Harvard ; Ph.D. , M.I.T. ) said during the closing months of the campaign .
As President , Obama has rightly noted that too many Americans are already skipping college or dropping out , even without economists having advised them to do so ; within weeks of the Inauguration , he pledged to increase the national graduation rate , which is significantly lower than that of many other developed nations , including Canada , Japan , and Korea .
The skip - college advocates ’ contention — that , with the economic downturn , a college degree may not be the best investment — has its appeal .
Given the high cost of attending college in the United States , the question of whether a student is getting his or her money ’s worth tends to loom large with whoever is paying the tuition fees and the meal - plan bills .
Even so , one need n’t necessarily be a liberal - arts graduate to regard as distinctly and speciously utilitarian the idea that higher education is , above all , a route to economic advancement .
Unaddressed in that calculus is any question of what else an education might be for : to nurture critical thought ; to expose individuals to the signal accomplishments of humankind ; to develop in them an ability not just to listen actively but to respond intelligently .
All these are habits of mind that are useful for an engaged citizenry , and from which a letter carrier , no less than a college professor , might derive a sense of self - worth .
For who ’s to say in what direction a letter carrier ’s thoughts might , or should , turn , regardless of the job ’s demands ?
Consider Stephen Law , a professor of philosophy at the University of London , who started his working life delivering mail for the British postal service , began reading works of philosophy in his spare time , decided that he ’d like to know more , and went on to study the discipline at City University , in London , and at Oxford University .
( A philosophy graduate in the Class of 2010 , by the way , stands to earn an average starting salary of forty thousand dollars a year , rising to a lifetime median of seventy - six thousand .
Not exactly statistician money , but something to think about . )
Indeed , if even a professionally oriented college degree is no longer a guarantee of easily found employment , an argument might be made in favor of a student ’s pursuing an education that is less , rather than more , pragmatic .
( More theology , less accounting . )
That way , regardless of each graduate ’s ultimate path , all might be qualified to be carriers of arts and letters , of which the nation can never have too many .

To buy the 5.0 or the 2011 Shelby GT500 ?
That is the question .
True to the plethora - of - packages Mustang it 's based on , the relative value of Ford 's new 550 HP supercar - killer all depends on which option boxes you tick .
Advertisement
Full Disclosure : Ford wanted us to drive the mildly - upgraded GT500 so badly , they flew me all the way to the land of my ancestors , put me up in a trackside hotel and fed me a dry , taste - free pulled pork sandwich .
Honestly Ford , this is like the tenth time you 've fed me bad barbecue , what 've you got against slow - roast pork ?

For 2011 , Ford 's taken the 2010 Shelby GT500 , swapped its heavy iron block for a new aluminum one with a wet sump ( The Ford GT 's engine , on which the GT500's is based , used a dry sump , this is a different block despite the aluminum ) , in the process dropping 102 lbs from the nose and 120 lbs overall .
Power is also up 10 HP to 550 HP and torque remains unchanged at 510 Lb - Ft .
Electricity replaces hydraulics for the power steering and there 's a new Z - brace for the steering rack that ties into to the radiator support , similar to the one employed on the 2011 Ford Mustang GT .
HID headlights are now standard .

2010 Shelby GT500 : First Drive
With the 2010 Shelby GT500 , SVT 's engineers claim they 've turned a 500 HP Mustang into a 540 HP … Read more
That does n't sound like a lot and it does n't add up to a huge difference in the driving experience , but there was a huge amount of effort involved in making those changes and the numerical benefits they bring are pretty impressive .
The GT500 's cylinders ditch liners in favor of a crazy spray - on anti-friction coating called Plasma Transferred Wire Arc ( this ditches 8.5 Lbs all by itself ) and the new engine manages a gas - guzzler tax - free 15 MPG city / 23 MPG highway EPA figure .
The extra power is largely thanks to a new 2.75 - inch exhaust system that also ups engine noise .
Advertisement
Road noise has been reduced perceptibly , replaced with exhaust noise and the Electric Power Assist steering is noticeably sharper .
You can't feel the power increase ( which does n't improve the 4.4 second 0 - 60 or 12.1 second 1/4 mile times ) .
Ford flew me all the way to North Carolina , then made me drive to Virginia for this ?

Luckily there 's more .
For 2011 there 's a new , optional , $ 3,000 Performance Package that really makes the model update worthwhile .
Check that box and you get near - slick Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar G : 2 tires ; wheels grown an inch to 19 - inch ( front ) and 20 - inch ( rear ) wheels while shedding weight ; the rear axle ratio is increased from 3.55 to 3.73 ; ride height is lowered 11 mm ( front ) and 8 mm ( rear ) ; spring rates are up 20.5 percent ( front ) and 9.5 percent ( rear ) and damping is increased in kind .
All that 's enough to knock nine seconds off the GT500's lap time around the 4.1 - mile Grand West course at Virginia International Raceway .
The Performance pack also utterly resolves the 5.0 / GT500 dilemma .
Where the standard GT500 delivers numbers that surpass the regular Mustang , the driving experience remains incredibly similar .
You 're only paying about a half second 0 - to - 60 penalty with the regular Mustang .
Factor in the $ 18,000 premium for the Shelby and the 5.0 is a no-brainer .
Tack on the Performance pack , however and things are equally black and white in the Shelby 's favor .
Advertisement
It 's amazing what a bunch of added grip , shorter gearing and increased suspension control can do to a car .
Through VIR 's fast , off - camber corners and over crests that had the 2010 GT500 wiggling around imprecisely , the Performance Pack - equipped ' 11 is now planted an confidence inspiring .
Driving the two cars back to back , it was also surprising how laggardly the ' 10 felt in comparison , all due to its taller gearing ; third gear was enough to pull the ' 11 out of corners that the ' 10 needed second gear for .
Advertisement
The tires are really the highlight of the package .
Developed specifically for this fastest of Mustangs , the Goodyears noticeably improve turn in , raise mid-corner speeds and allow you to get more of the power down sooner .
Sadly , they 're only making them for the larger wheel sizes so sticking a pair on your 2010 model wo n't be terribly easy .
The other big change for 2011 is to the convertible .
Last year , we said the 2010 Shelby GT500 convertible sucked because it retained the old 2008 model 's kill - you handling , only upgrading the engine and looks .
This year , the ‘ vert gains all the 2011 's chassis upgrades while boosting its lateral stiffness 12 percent for improved structural rigidity and less cowl shake .
You can even get the Performance Package on the convertible .
Thank you , Ford , for listening to us .

So is it worth spending $ 18 k more than the 2011 Ford Mustang GT just to get some on - paper performance improvements ?
Not really , but it is worth spending $ 21 k more to get handling that is now equals the 550 HP supercharged V8 's massive straight line performance .
The Performance Package - equipped 2011 Shelby GT500 is no longer merely a rip- roaringly fast Mustang — it 's a well - balanced rip- roaringly fast Mustang .
He came .
He saw the Black Eyed Peas .
He urged the US soccer team to conquer England in Saturday ’s match .
“ It feels great being here , ” Vice President Joe Biden said Friday morning to a small gathering of local dignitaries at the US Consulate .
“ And in the spirit of the Irish , I want to say that we ’re going to beat England . ”
Mr. Biden lost no time in joining in the playful and relatively harmless nationalist feelings in the Johannesburg air today .
On this , the first official game day of the South Africa World Cup , nary a car drives by without the flag of one of the 32 countries competing in this soccer tournament , and none are more plentiful than the flags of South Africa .
From the early hours of the morning , one could hear the sound of those long , plastic trumpets known as vuvuzelas .
Those not wearing the jersey of his or her favorite team is either painfully embarrassed about it , or is serving as the grim - faced security detail for Very Important Persons such as , well , Joe Biden .
COVER STORY : As World Cup 2010 kicks off , where South Africa stands 16 years after apartheid
One local news organization , the Daily Maverick , has taken to taunting the Mexican team – which faces off against South Africa ’s own team this afternoon at 4 pm local time ( see the daily schedule ) .
Never mind that the local boys , Bafana Bafana , are ranked 47 in the world , the Daily Maverick declared today to be “ Bafana Victory Day . ”
“ This afternoon all the waiting and uncertainty finally ends , and we learn by just how wide a margin Bafana Bafana will beat Mexico , " they wrote in their column Coming up Today .
" Conservative prognosticators put the scoreline at 3 - 0 , but they 're just trying to set expectations low to make for a wilder party afterwards . ”
The day began on a somber note , however .
The 13 - year - old great - granddaughter of Nelson Mandela , Zenani , died Thursday night in a car accident following the 2010 Kickoff Concert in Soweto ’s Orlando Stadium .
The driver of the car was arrested for drunk driving , and Mr. Mandela announced that he would not be attending the opening ceremony today , as had been planned .
Yet very little seems to keep a tap on the rest of the South African public ’s mood .
One local news radio station exuberantly , but mistakenly , reported that President Barack Obama was scheduled to arrive in South Africa .
As elsewhere in Africa , Mr. Obama is seen here as a hero .
Biden told those gathered at the US Consulate it would be his personal honor , and not his boss ’s , to represent the United States at the World Cup , adding with a grin , “ The president is really angry .
He ’s dealing with an oil spill , and I ’m dealing with you . ”

Israel confiscated seven oxygen machines en route to hospitals in the West Bank and Gaza based on the claim that there was a chance the generators attached to the machines would not be used for medical purposes , Palestinian news agency Ma'an reported Saturday .

According to Ma'an , the Ramallah - based health ministry said that the generators , which were donated to the Palestinian Authority by a Norwegian development agency , were seized by Israeli officials despite the fact that only one machine was bound for Gaza .
The generators " came under the category of possible use for non-medical purposes " if they were delivered to southern Gaza , the Palestinian health ministry said in a statement , adding that the six other machines were bound for government hospitals in the northern Gaza , inducing the European Hospital in Gaza City , the Rafdieyah hospital in Nablus , and other facilities in Ramallah and Hebron .
The Ministry of Health appealed to the Norwegian Development Agency , which supplied the machines , and asked that they intervene and demand the release of the equipment at the soonest possible date , Ma'an reported .
" Any delay in obtaining the medical equipment will negatively affect the health of patients , " the statement concluded .

I was working on a project to port Scribd.com code base to Rails 2.2 and noticed that some old plugins we were using in 2.1 were abandoned by their authors .
Some of them were just removed from the code base , but one needed a replacement – that was an old plugin called acts_as_readonlyable that helped us to distribute our queries among a cluster of MySQL slaves .
There were some alternatives but we did n’t like them for one or another reasons so we ’ve decided to go with creating our own ActiveRecord plugin , that would help us scale our databases out .
That ’s the story behind the first release of DbCharmer .
Today , six months after the first release of the gem and we ’ve moved it to gemcutter ( which is now the official gems hosting ) and we ’re already at version 1.6.11 .
The gem was downloaded more than 2000 times .
There are ( at least ) 10 + large users that rely on this gem to scale their products out .
And ( this is the most exciting ) we ’ve added tons of new features to the product .
Here are the main features added since the first release :
Much better multi-database migrations support including default migrations connection changing .

We ’ve added ActiveRecord associations preload support that makes it possible to move eager loading queries to the same connection where your finder queries go to .

We ’ve added an ability to temporary remap any ActiveRecord connections to any other connections for a block of code ( really useful when you need to make sure all your queries would go to some non -default slave and you do not want to mess with all your models ) .
to any other connections for a block of code ( really useful when you need to make sure all your queries would go to some non -default slave and you do not want to mess with all your models ) .
The most interesting change : we ’ve implemented some basic sharding functionality in ActiveRecord which currently is being used in production in our application .
As you can see now DbCharmer helps you to do three major scalability tasks in your Rails projects :
Master - Slave clusters to scale out your Rails models reads .
Vertical sharding by moving some of your models to a separate ( maybe even dedicated ) servers and still keep using AR associations Horizontal sharding by slicing your models data to pieces and placing those pieces into different databases and / or servers .
So , If you did n’t check DbCharmer out yet and you ’re working on some large rails project that is ( or going to be ) facing scalability problems , go read the docs , download / install the gem and prove them that Rails CAN scale !
Alone in the Arizona desert in 1999 , Robert Buelteman had a flash of clarity — the rest of his life looked utterly predictable , and he was no longer in love with his art .
At that , he stopped working professionally on the black - and - white photography that had been his raison d’être for 25 years and “ surrendered to serendipity . ”
Under the starry sky , appropriately enough , he could not shake images of the Metaflora series , Walter Chappell ’s luminous work in Kirlian photography — a process that involves sending electrical currents through objects that rest directly on a photographic plate .
When he emerged from the desert , Buelteman was obsessed with getting back to basics : cameraless , lensless , computerless photos .
Most Kirlian equipment is about the size of a Polaroid camera , but Buelteman wanted to work big , with prints up to 40 - by - 96 inches ( his photos have sometimes been referred to as Georgia O’Keeffe meets Frankenstein ) .
He found an engineer to build a generator that could drive an image over 80 square inches , and Buelteman constructed his own supersize easel made of aluminum sheet metal floated in a solution of liquid silicone , sandwiched between pieces of 1/8 - inch - thick Plexiglas .
Then he tracked down 8 - by - 10 - inch , tungsten - balanced color transparency film .
After one year he had completed only two pieces —
“ My wife thought I might be crazy . ”
But at the opening of an exhibition organized by Sarah Adams , granddaughter of iconic landscape photographer Ansel Adams , one of those images mesmerized a crowd of 150 people .
Since then , his work has been shown in more than 35 countries and he ’s been published in 18 languages .
Part of the draw is Buelteman ’s new twist on this old craft , named for Russian inventor Semyon Kirlian for his work with photograms in the 1930s , though it dates back much further .
The “ Buelteman technique ” adds light sources such as xenon strobe , tungsten and fiber optics .
Buelteman literally “ paints ” his subjects by illuminating them with a fiber - optic probe the size of a human hair .
But using no computer enhancement ( Buelteman says some of the colors he achieves do n’t exist in Photoshop ) , the outcome is somewhat at the mercy of physics .
As with Chinese brush - stroke painting , once a stroke is made , there ’s no going back , which has a simplicity that appeals to Buelteman .
As he says , “ It ’s a myth that having more options equals greater freedom . ”
Yet the prep work and setup are anything but simple : “ In black - and - white film work there are 15 or 16 variables ; in this process there are more than 50 , some of them intangible , like the opacity of a leaf . ”
In contrast to the structure of his black - and - white work , Buelteman compares his Kirlian image - making to improvisational jazz .
The faint of heart should know that this pursuit is not dangerfree .
Buelteman has electrocuted himself many times ; on one occasion he was lifted off the ground by a 40,000 - volt jolt .
“ I ’m working completely in the dark with electricity — fear is part of the process . ”
Recently Buelteman has been battling his way back to reality , having been sidelined for some three years with Lyme disease , an experience he calls “ humbling , ” though he adds that “ it has made my work all the more precious to me . ”
Now he ’s once again in the dark with his metal plates and high voltage .
One of his most recent works is of rainbow chard , something he spent a year finalizing .
One reason for the lengthy timeline : Buelteman , an avid gardener , is actually growing many of the plants he shoots in the courtyard of his northern California house : “ It ’s lettuce heaven . ”
Though cameraless photography can be used with inanimate objects , plants make ideal subjects .
And the tight relationship between film , light , plants and Buelteman ’s own hand has brought him a “ connectedness that has eluded me in other parts of my life . ”
In The Bag
- Buelteman ’s “ bag ” these days is more likely to contain pruners than a camera , to collect plants to take into the studio
- Buelteman ’s work is strictly studio , so he no longer totes a camera bag to locations .
in his workshop , which is converted from a five - car garage , he relies on surgical scalpels to get the form and opacity he wants in petals and foliage prior to manipulating them on the imaging easel .
•
Another necessary piece of equipment is a wooden safety fence around the easel — with its big electricity - conducting metal plate — to forestall future electrocution accidents .
Hanging on the wall : a neck brace as a reminder of buelteman ’s previous face - off with 40,000 volts .

The strange case of Joseph Moshe has resurfaced .
In August of 2009 , Moshe was accused of making threats against the White House .
He briefly made headlines during a stand - off with police in Los Angeles .
During the confrontation , the Israeli scientist remarkably withstood five rounds of chemical agent tossed inside his car in the parking lot of the Federal Building in West Los Angeles .
Police confronted microbiologist Joseph Moshe for allegedly making threat against the White House .
It was later learned that Moshe had called into a radio talk show and said he wanted to supply evidence regarding tainted H1N1 swine flu vaccines being produced by Baxter BioPharma Solutions .
Moshe claimed a Baxter lab in Ukraine was producing a bioweapon that would be passed off as a vaccine .
He said the vaccine contained an adjuvant engineered to weaken the immune system .
Replicated RNA from the virus , Moshe insisted , was responsible for the 1918 pandemic Spanish flu .
It was speculated Moshe worked for Israel ’s Mossad .
In late October of 2009 , Ukraine was hit by an especially aggressive and virulent form of hemorrhagic pneumonia .
“ The virus appears to be either a highly aggressive mutation of the globally - circulating H1N1 strain , or a combination of three different influenza strains now circulating in Ukraine , ” Mike Adams wrote at the time .
“ Moshe claimed that Baxter ’s laboratory in the Ukraine out of all places was creating this biological weapon .
All of this came out in the beginning of August , which is more than 2 months before the situation that is currently unfolding [ in Ukraine ] .
For Moshe to correctly name the country where a new epidemic would be unleashed , requires either inside information , or an incredible coincidence as anyone with a basic knowledge of statistics can confirm for himself , ” David Rothscum wrote on October 31 .
The H1N1 flu “ pandemic ” turned out to be mostly government and media hype .
It was later said the United Nations ’ World Health Organization had connived with Baxter , GlaxoSmithKline , Novartis , and Sanofi - Aventis to create a pandemic scare in order to sell vaccines .
Alex Jones talked with Dr. Sherri Tenpenny about the swine flu hype and how it was used to distract from larger issues .
In January of this year , the WHO insisted it was not unduly influenced by drug companies to exaggerate the dangers of the H1N1 flu virus .
The WHO subsequently appointed a committee to investigate the allegations but its credibility suffered a serious blow when it was learned Dr. John Mackenzie would be included in the investigation .
Mackenzie has direct links with several vaccine and pharmaceutical companies and was influential in the WHO declaration of a level 6 pandemic in 2009 .
At the time , some 200 million doses of H1N1 vaccine and funding of approximately $ 12 million were pledged to fight the virus .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
In February of 2009 , Bloomberg reported that Baxter had accidentally contaminated samples with the bird flu virus .
The contamination was discovered when ferrets at a lab in the Czech Republic died after being inoculated with vaccine made from the samples .
The virus material was supposed to contain a seasonal flu virus and was contaminated after “ human error , ” according to Baxter .
Dan Even , writing for Haaretz , reported earlier this week that a report had linked the deadly Cryptococcus gatti fungus to labs in the United States and the Nes Tziona Biological Institute in Israel .
“ The report also linked an Israeli American scientist , Dr. Joseph Moshe , to the spread of the fungus , ” writes Even .
An outbreak of the fungus killed six people in Oregon and was predicted to move into northern California and possibly farther , according to experts .
“ No one knows how the species got to North America or how the fungus can thrive in a temperate region , ” notes Christine Dell ’ Amore of National Geographic News .
Cryptococcus gattii is an airborne fungus native to tropical and subtropical regions , including Papua New Guinea , Australia , and parts of South America .
However , much like the H1N1 virus , the threat posed by the “ killer ” fungus appears to be little more than corporate media sensationalism .
“ At its peak , we were seeing about 36 cases per million per year , so that is a very small number , ” Christina Hull , an assistant professor of medical microbiology and immunology and of biomolecular chemistry at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison , told Bloomberg Businessweek on April 30 .
Joseph Moshe is currently scheduled for a court hearing on his mental status on August 24 , 2010 , in California .

As we close in on WWDC , which kicks off with a Steve Jobs keynote on June 7 , more details about the next revision of the iPhone continue to leak .
The supposed display and aluminum chassis have been throughly examined , while Chinese manufacturers claim to have cases ready for sale .
Also , the latest beta of iPhone OS 4.0 has a working implementation of Places in the Photos app , similar to the feature that appeared on the iPad this year and iPhoto '09 last year .
Czech site Super iPhone put what is believed to be the display of the next iPhone under a microscope , and compared it to current iPhone and iPod touch models as well as the Google Nexus one .
The analysis suggests the next iPhone will have a wide viewing angle IPS LCD display , much like that found in the iPad .
The resolution should also be 960 x 640 pixels , as is widely rumored .
The benefit here is that current iPhone apps can be pixel - doubled to fit the screen with no apparent difference in quality .
However , apps that are built to take advantage of the higher resolution will look even better .
In particular , the 320 ppi density should make text extremely sharp , even at small point sizes .
i Phone Portugal — currently offline with its ISP reporting the site 's account as " suspended " — got its hands on what are purported to be the machined aluminum and plastic inner chassis for the next - gen iPhone .
These frames were reportedly purchased in China , and it's not known if they are authentic or not .
However , the site claimed the quality and workmanship led them to believe the parts are the real McCoy .
The site created lengthy videos comparing the frames to the iPhone 3GS and iPad — from what we have seen from the videos and earlier leaks , the parts do appear to be legitimate .
Unsurprisingly , Chinese manufacturers are already claiming to have cases for the new iPhone ready for sale .
MacRumors points out that these cases are likely designed around leaked prototypes or parts , which has happened in the past .
The tactic backfired last year , however , when an updated iPod touch shipped without the camera which some prototypes had .
Finally , AppleInsider has screenshots detailing the recently activated Places feature set to debut for iPhones and iPod touches in iPhone OS 4.0 .
The feature had already been promised for the update , but it was n't functional until the most recent developer beta .
Places will show a Google map with pins indicating where particular images were taken , essentially identical to features found in the iPad 's Photos app and on iPhone '09 .
As expected , Faces and Events will also likely appear in the final version , expected to be revealed in full next week during WWDC .
As the Newzbin resurrection saga continues , the boss of Team R Dogs has been answering a whole range of questions about the site 's return .
More than $ 40,000 has been invested in the project so far , a coder hired and they are n't scared of the MPA either .
" We ’ll just do a Pirate Bay on them , " they say .
" We can run faster than them and shapeshift . "
Last week a group calling themselves Team R Dogs contacted ex-members of Newzbin with a message claiming that they would soon bring back the site .
That news was quickly followed by the revelation from an ex-director of Newzbin that the site ’s domain names had been sold to a Seychelles - based company in order to clear debts .
A couple of days ago the company , WCIS Limited , told Torrent Freak they did not wish to tell us about their intentions for the domains .
Run by an ex-Newzbin editor , the DeepSharer blog has now managed to secure an interview with Team R Dogs boss Mr White .
Here are the main points , plus those from the later Q & A .
After reiterating that they are nothing to do with the original Newzbin staff , Mr White said that since they already had the Newzbin code , bringing the site back after their legal problems was just the opportune thing to do .
At least to begin , the site will be a “ straight clone ” of the old site , but a redesign is on the agenda .
This process could carried out with the help of users who could be asked to vote on the inclusion of new features .
There is even talk of adding non-Usenet search features such as BitTorrent and Rapidshare .
And the porn will return on Newzxxx too .
As for retention , the aim is to reach at least 400 days as soon as possible and then move to 600 + days within 9 months from launch .
So will ex-users of Newzbin return to the site ?
Team R
Dogs certainly hope so as they say the whole thing is costing a fortune and quite frankly , they need the money .
“ I have personally signed cheques for an $ 22,000 Sun server and 2 x $ 9,000 Sun servers to help run this site and I expect to sign more .
I have hired a fulltime coder on good salary , I am recruiting another expensive geek to keep the site up , ” explains Mr White .
Although the site will probably launch for free for a week or two , the site will revert to a pay venue .
“ Let me be clear .
We have a profit motive in this .
We have n’t tried to ‘ steal ’ from Newzbin1 guys – they got shutdown by the MPA , not by us .
The MPA have given us an opportunity to make money .
Thanks MPA , ” he continues .
“ Does this mean we intend to shit on users & ex-Newzbin1 members ?
Fuck no .
We want to provide a good service and take the same profits the Newzbin1 guys did .
Yea sure we are using their works to do so but they have abandoned their works and they have SAID so themselves .
There is no moral ambiguity here : they have dropped out of the scene and we are replacing them . ”
Part of the support for ex-members will be the continuation of any credit they had on the site , although how far back that will go will remain to be seen .
For those adding new credit , a 3rd party payment system will be used .
But let ’s not forget about the fate of Newzbin at the hands of the MPA – how will Team R Dogs fend off that inevitable attack ?
“ We ’ll just do a Piratebay on them , ” they say .
“ We can run faster than them and shapeshift . ”
The Los Angeles Police Department has launched an internal investigation after one of its officers was caught on camera apparently kicking a cyclist during a protest against oil giant BP on Friday .
According to the Los Angeles Times , the incident took place on Hollywood Boulevard during a “ Critical Mass ” cycling event .
Critical Masses — which involve cyclists riding through the streets to call for cyclists ’ rights — typically take place on the last Friday of every month .
This particular event targeted BP for its role in the Gulf oil spill .

Video of the incident , which was posted to YouTube , shows what appears to be a police officer stepping out and kicking at a passing bicycle .
“ Whoa , what the f*** was that for ? ” the unidentified cameraman can be heard saying .
Moments later , the video shows two officers converge on the cameraman and take him down to the ground .
“ Get up , ” one officer can be heard saying , as another says “ Stay down . ”
“ What did I do ? ” the cameraman can be heard saying .
According to the LAist , between 200 and 1,000 cyclists took part in the protest , which made its way from Los Angeles into Hollywood .
The Weho Daily blog reports that “ interaction with the LAPD took a turn for the worse in Hollywood … where a few riders were taken down by officers . ”

“ The vast majority of the police along the way were helpful and accommodating , ” a witness told Weho Daily .
“ But for whatever reason the police in Hollywood were extremely aggressive and were harassing riders for no reason other than to get their kicks ( I presume ) . ”
The president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League said in a statement quoted by the Times that people should n’t “ rush to judgment ” about the video .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It is always important to remember that home video , shot from a distance , from one angle and in the dark , and not at the beginning of the incident seldom tells the whole story , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Paul M. Weber said .

and / or Daniel
Agent Langston Graham did notbecause he thought she had defected to the Ring .
Outside of a serious miscommunication or misunderstanding with her , which is highly unlikely , that justification makes no sense and has little supporting evidence .
Something else was definitely going on .
Except for perhaps his relationship with Sarah , Graham demonstrates that he is a cold , calculating person from the moment we meet him .
He seems to view people as disposable , as he ordered Casey to kill Chuck .
Granted , so did General Beckman , but Beckman seemed to take no pleasure at all in doing so , whereas Graham was more than happy to have Chuck out of the way .
Furthermore , Beckman has demonstrated that she does everything she does strictly for the sake of her country and people , just like Casey , whereas Graham always seemed to have another angle .

There is also the issue of Sarah 's red test .
It really stands out from the rest of the series .
First of all , Sarah was given absolutely no information on her target whatsoever , whereas Chuck was given all the relevant background and information on the target for his red test .
Second , when Sarah or Casey is ordered to or otherwise must kill someone , there is always some kind of justification , not just " because the boss says so " .
Why would Graham give Sarah no information at all ?
And why did he work so hard to cover it up ?
Maybe Graham was a Ring agent who was trying to cover his ass or otherwise turned on the organization .
Or maybe he had his own agenda , and he had Evelyn Shaw killed for reasons that had nothing to do with the Ring .
In any case , I believe she found something very incriminating on Graham , and he killed her to stop her , and perhaps get back at her husband too .
If Graham had not been killed by FULCRUM ( and if his actor had n't been busy with 24 ) , I think it is safe to say that he would have tried to get Team Bartowski , and Sarah especially , to do something really awful , and he would eventually have become an all - out villain .

General Diane Beckman is this Diane .
She has moved up in the world of espionage .
Or else she was running the FBI and the CIA all along .
Captain Awesome is a spy .
It 's been stated that he and Ellie work at the same hospital .
A possible cover ?
And , in the second season , their conflicting shifts are a source of relationship woes .
So they work together long enough for her to have no reason to disbelieve him , then conveniently he does n't have to be there when she is there to confirm that he is still at the hospital ?
He 's now aware that Chuck is a spy .
Word of God is that he was intended to be exposed as a Russian Spy at the end of Season 1 , but his character became so popular that the creators dropped that plotline ...
Or Did They ?
It 's still possible .
And if he's not a spy now , Captain Awesome may yet be recruited or become involved in spy missions .
We just do n't know about them .
As of season 3 , he 's certainly getting involved in the spy work , although he is n't an official spy yet .
And , as it turns out , he appears not in the least cut out for it .
Though that maybe Obfuscating Stupidity .
He 's extremely fit and healthy , and what he does for a living is kept rather vague .
He also talks and behaves like an awkward parody of " youth " culture by someone not involved in it .
For example , he may have heard that young , hip people use the word " awesome " , and so he says it all the time .
He 's obviously a spy , deep undercover , and maybe he 's been observing Chuck ever since the Stanford incident .
The CIA almost gave Chuck the Intersect on purpose .
Confirmed .
In his CIA recruitment videos in " Chuck Versus the Alma Mater " , Professor Fleming commented on Chuck 's ability to retain subliminal images and mentioned the Omaha Project , which the CIA intended to assign Chuck to .
If not for Bryce 's interference , Fleming would have recruited Chuck , and the CIA would have used his brain to store the Intersect .
As it happened , during his time at the CIA , Bryce learned that the Omaha Project was the Intersect .
( This may explain why he said " We 'll always have Omaha " to Sarah at the end of " Chuck Vs. the Nemesis " . )
When he needed someone to send the Intersect to , he recalled his conversation with Fleming and sent it to Chuck , knowing that Chuck would be able to absorb the information .
Chuck was never supposed to receive the whole Intersect .
Advertisement :
Most of the spy bosses seemed at least a little surprised that he 'd absorbed the whole thing .
We even find out that some , if not most , people can't handle Intersect downloads .
Project Omaha gave a large portion of data ( for example , everything on the Russian mob ) to a number of protected " analysts " , allowing agents not to spend days or weeks learning extensive knowledge .
Chuck would have been the star analyst .
The Intersect was always supposed to be uploaded into a human being .
This seems supported by the end of one episode ( late first season or early second ) where they finish the new Intersect computer before it blows up , have a line of agents remove their presumably Intersect - blocking sunglasses , and stand there waiting .
, have a line of agents remove their presumably Intersect - blocking sunglasses , and stand there waiting .
Confirmed in " Chuck Versus the Suburbs . "
Ties into the above .
This explains why Fleming would be interested in a person 's ability to retain subliminal images .
Also , why Bryce would even think to do it .
The encoding and streaming technology to do so obviously was developed at the same time as the Intersect itself .
Further , it makes sense to bring the Intersect to things when you can't bring things to it .
The subject ( Chuck , in this case ) is essentially an Intersect mobile unit .
Finally , when it comes to finding patterns , Humans Are Special .
That property of the brain improves the Intersect 's performance beyond what can be achieved technologically .
Neither the General nor Sarah and Casey know this , so learning it will be what makes Casey spare Chuck .
Buy More and Large Mart will have a merger in the future .
This show 's plot did seem familiar ...
Forming , of course , Buy n Large
Morgan is being groomed to take the Assistant Manager position .
Assuming Emmett Milbarge does n't stick around .
( And , completely off - topic , Emmett Milbarge ?
Seriously , how screwed up were his parents trying to make him ? )
We all know that already .
The events of " Chuck Versus the Gravitron " ( specifically , Big Mike 's comments after his CMoA ) indicate this very thing , as it appears that Morgan called in Casey to deal with the ' shoplifter ' that Big Mike subsequently took out
Only if Morgan 's not leaving .
Update : Emmett is dead , and Morgan is back from Hawaii ... who knows , it just might happen !
Of course , Chuck would have to turn the position down first , since he 's easily the most competent employee in the entire store .
, and Morgan is back from Hawaii ... who knows , it just might happen !
Of course , Chuck would have to turn the position down first , since he 's easily the most competent employee in the entire store .
Confirmed in Chuck vs. Operation Awesome .
Funnily enough in season 4 Beckman hands over the role of manager to Morgan - so apparently he was destined for even greater responsibilties .
Only time will tell if the duration he spent under the wing of Big Mike 's guidence was enough for him to not screw up .
Since Mark Christopher Lawerence is still listed as a series regular for the fourth season , chances are he 'll take on an Obi Wan role & advise Morgan in regards to his duties as manager .
Well , Morgan did make Big Mike his assistant manager in " Chuck Versus the Cubic Z " .
Season 2 has spent a significant amount of time showcasing Morgan 's growth as a character separate from Chuck , forcing him to make decisions for the employees and give advice that normally he would have just let Chuck take care of .
Characters are beginning to consult him about minor things , and he 's even begun going against his stated policy of ' doing as little as possible ' .
One of the long term arcs of the show will be Morgan taking over Chuck 's former Buy More role as the employee mascot as Chuck's ' extracurricular activities ' take more of his time ...
Anna is a Slayer
And she has mad kung fu abilities , good enough that Casey wanted her tested for recruitment .
Mostly because Julia Ling played a potential Slayer in one episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer .
She may have died , but still — it would give us a good reason why she 's so seldom seen onscreen .
She 's busy killing vampires .
Anna is away at spy school
Rather than just simply being Put on a Bus , Casey 's recommendation to have her tested resulted in her being recruited .
Running off with a classmate was just her cover story .
Orion is still alive
Confirmed !
And not only is Orion alive , but he 's also Chuck 's father , Stephen Bartowski .
Not anymore he is n't . :(
Although he was right in front of the entrance to a room with equipment for cellular regeneration , which was how Daniel Shaw was brought back .
That , or Papa Bartowski is now going to exist as a virtual personality a la Jor - El .
So , fingers crossed :) .
Of course , Orion claimed that the Governor was the only thing keeping him alive & then his Governor smashed against the floor after Shaw shot him , but he might have been lying , wrong , or had his Governor repaired or replaced in time .
We never got to see his face .
We also never saw him die .
It 's possible that he found a way out , maybe by tricking Fulcrum into taking someone else and then blowing up the ' copter to cover the evidence .
If he was able to do this , then it 's possible that he did n't want the CIA to find him .
Since he chose the location , he could have controlled the situation so he would not be in any danger .
Orion is FULCRUM
went to school with the FULCRUM leader
be back when he went to Roark Instruments ( because he'd be " caught " ? )
when they entered the Intersect room ( called for backup ? )
put on the sunglasses when he tried to run the program ( knew it 'd fail ? )
He did n't need to put on the sunglasses .
He has an Intersect in his head , so he knew he would survive the experience .
He .
He knew he would n't .
He did something with his arm computer .
He did n't bother to
Chuck is becoming a Fake Ultimate Hero
Implausible now that Chuck has Intersect 2.0 in his head .
But the Intersect is faulty , and he needs to be able to work when there is none ...
Now that the intersect is gone he will probably become this , but to an even higher degree .
" Chuck Versus the Predator " hints that the villain recognizes and seems to respect Chuck 's alter ego Carmichael .
FULCRUM are reluctant to investigate the Buy More because they 've lost too many agents there .
By the end of the series , FULCRUM will be terrified of the legendary " Agent Carmichael " .
Fulcrum is also the organization responsible for co-opting Michael Westen
This needs to be canonized .
Inspired by the existence of a crossover fic between the two shows , although it 's not explored within the story .
Both groups snatch up talent from all walks of intelligence and special forces agencies for as - yet - undefined goals .
Plenty of people are aware that Chuck is the Intersect - or at least involved with the government .
Morgan knows now .
Ellie , however ...
Seriously , this is just screaming Open Secret .
Awesome ( who , as noted up top , is almost certainly a spy himself ) and Big Mike ( and probably most of the rest of the Buy More - why else is he allowed to randomly disappear and do so many " external installs " ? ) , to name but some .
On the other hand , Morgan and Ellie quite pointedly do not know - probably because the Government decided that they were too close ( personally ) to the Asset to risk informing .
The Intersect was based on neuralizer technology .
They 're both based on memory modification , they both use optical interfaces , and they can both be blocked by sunglasses .
It totally fits .
The Intersect was based on imprinting technology .
the first time the intersect was tested on a human it basically had this effect unintentionally
They both use image sequences and wide electromagnetic spectrum visual patterns .
It totally fits .
The Intersect is imprinting technology in its infancy .
First , Chuck became able to know and " remember " things that he could n't have known without the Intersect .
Then he was given new physical abilities ( though Word of God says those abilities will be erratic at first ) .
We 've even seen evidence of memory erasing when Orion removed the original Intersect from Chuck .
The technology has n't developed far enough to give him an entire new personality , but it 's easy to see that this could be the eventual goal .
The other people exposed to the Intersect , such as in " Chuck Versus the Suburbs " , died because they had n't had their original memories wiped first .
If the technology had progressed a little farther , they might have become like Alpha instead .
Chuck , as suggested above , has specific mental traits that enable him to contain the Intersect without being wiped first .
These traits are probably shared by Echo , since she did not go insane when she became Omega .
They 're probably also hereditary , since Orion also has an Intersect in his head ... maybe Chuck and Echo are related ?
How Chuck is in season 3 is very similar to how Echo is in the second half of season 2 of Dollhouse .
At least Chuck does n't have full personalities in his head to deal with .
Casey is Sarah 's brother .
Casey is a single , heterosexual man who 's been working closely with a woman who looks like Yvonne Strahovski for months ; nevertheless .
he 's never shown the slightest sign of being attracted to her .
The obvious explanation is that he 's her brother .
Sure , we 've seen her as a child without any brother .
But Casey is somewhat older than she , and he could easily have become disgusted with his con-artist father and left forever .
Maybe he does n't even know Sarah is his sister - she 's not using her original name , and they could have been separated for years .
But on a subconscious level , he recognizes her as related and can never be attracted to her .
That 's not quite how that works .
Take a look at these two Wikipedia articles for more info .
Basically , if this guess were true , it comes down to whether they were reared together .
If not , they 'd actually be more likely to find each other attractive .
Or maybe he 's not a fan of blondes ....
( Gary Cole and Adam Baldwin are close in age .
Do n't think so ! )
Casey 's too busy crushing on Beckman to notice the gorgeous crazy woman right next to him .
Chuck 's mother is / was a spy .
Makes a hell of lot of sense , especially since she died in mysterious circumstances and Orion was a spy .
Like many other things in the series , it would be like Alias .
Specifically , Chuck 's mother is either the woman on that shadowy Fulcrum panel , or ... General Beckman .
Possessive , pushy , keeps trying to sabotage his relationship with Sarah and has cameras in his room .
She 's My Beloved Smother with the resources to back it up !
She 's gotta be a former Soviet spy .
The timeline works for the fall of the soviet union when she disappeared .
Possibly justified in the third season finale .
Oh - so very much Confirmed as of the fourth season
Think about it .
Everyone in his life except his sister and his best friend seems to be a spy anyway .
That 'd explain why she left to an extent , and it would draw a nice parallel with Chuck and Sarah , if Orion was also an asset who fell for his handler .
Chuck 's emotions are the key to the Intersect
Considering it was modified by Orion , who in universe ships Chuck and Sarah ...
It 's almost certainly related to Chuck 's psychological state to some degree .
It 's not necessarily dependent on Sarah specifically , but he definitely has to be in the right frame of mind to use it .
Anger seems to trigger it , as seen in " Chuck Versus the Pink Slip " where Chuck has to suppress himself attacking Emmett .
Well , in " Chuck Versus the Tic Tac " , Laudanol lets Chuck use the Intersect at full capacity , flashing on multiple moves at once .
Anyone want to call this one ?
Simple .
The Intersect is triggered by emotion .
Emotion is caused by the body producing certain chemicals in reaction to environmental circumstances and those chemicals reacting with a particular section of the brain .
Clearly , the chemical that is produced by emotion and the chemical produced by the pill have the same effect on the Intersect inside a Human brain , but the pill version works better .
Anyone want to call this one ?
There 's also " Chuck Versus the Beard " , in which telling Morgan everything relieves Chuck 's bottled - up feelings and lets him flash .
Honestly , I think the Intersect is affected by Chuck 's emotional state but not in any predictable way .
People keep telling Chuck he has to keep calm and suppress his emotions to be a better spy , but the only time the Intersect has worked perfectly so far is when Sarah was threatened .
It 's actually Chuck 's feelings that activate it in the first place .
Hannah works for The Ring , or some other spy organization
Hannah seems to be more capable than she 's letting on , and " had " a job as basically a cleaner for another organization .
Seems to fit for me .
Chuck and Sarah will have to use Just Friends as a cover for their rekindled relationship
Confirmed Jossed .
And I 've rarely been happier to be wrong .
Even Beckman was happy !
Jossed .
And I 've rarely been happier to be wrong .
They can't deny the incredibly obvious forever , and once they do get involved they 'll try to pretend to be the same old UST poster children to fool Casey and Beckman .
Sarah 's last name is ...
Samantha Lisa Kent , eh? ... huh ...
Not half bad of a ring to it ...
Kent , originally the character 's name was Sarah Kent but the writers changed her name to Sarah Walker for some unknown reason .
The Ring 's endgame is to create disposable Intersects .
Given the events of " Epitaph One " , this could be more evidence for the Dollhouse crossover theory above .
The Ring must be run by the Rossum Corporation !
With the introduction of the pill in " Chuck Versus the Tic Tac " , there is now a way to turn your average Joe off the street into a sociopath .
Combine that with FULCRUM 's research on a new Intersect , the portable kung fu glasses , and we got ourselves a problem .
Casey 's not out of the game .
Calling it now .
Casey 's dismissal in " Chuck Versus the Tic Tac " was cover for a larger mission .
Conversely ...
He was reinstated with full rank in " Chuck Versus the Other Guy " .
Laudanol was always meant to be tested on Chuck .
Why would The Ring smuggle in just one pill ?
Assuming they can create the drug , they could just take suitcases full to their plant to HQ .
Casey was at the tail end of a Ring op that wanted a proof of concept test on an active intersect , and who better than Chuck Bartowski ?
Unfortunately for them , it went horribly right , and Chuck kicked the Ring agents to the curb , but they know it works .
Chuck will be forced to kill Shaw
He can't kill a man on orders , but he will to protect Sarah .
How she will react is up in the air .
Confirmed in " Chuck Versus the Other Guy " .
But as WMGs go , it was a gimme .
Beckman will end up doing a Drayfus - Clouseau routine with Morgan
As of " Chuck Versus the Honeymooners " , it seems to be going that way ; in putting together intelligence and doing computer tasks he even puts Chuck to shame .
Morgan , though well - intentioned , has the common sense and physical abilities of a child .
Even so , he is incredibly perceptive , and twice as lucky .
In other words , much like Clouseau .
Beckman is a by - the - book general who always goes for the obvious answer .
Beckman will continually find herself looking for reasons to fire him , all while he bumbles upon the correct answers for cases .
After the insanity test that Operation Bartowski is already putting her through , this does not bode well .
The Director and the guy in the middle of the Ring Elders are the same person .
as a hologram
Think about it ... the Ring Elders is obviously a group of highly renowned leaders to the Ring , and the Director has been repeatedly said to be the agency 's big cheese .
There 's also the fact that the Director meets Shawin a room very similar to the Ring Council Chamber .
And when he speaks in " Chuck Versus the Mask " , it really sounds like he 's using a voice changer , so he obviously would n't have sounded like the Director we would " first meet " in " Chuck Versus the American Hero " .
He finally got back to the present and , deciding he'd had enough of time travel , switched to another top - secret project , the Intersect .
He was put in witness protection as " Stephen Bartowski " ( note the initials ! ) when Roark went rogue .
Shaw is a timelord
He 's been ' killed ' how many times now ?
Plus there 's a rule that someone has to be .
Stephen Bartowski is a timelord
He 's been " working for himself " for centuries due to his long timelord life and is regenerating as we speak .
No one is a Time Lord ...
... but they are Highlanders .
Chuck 's mother is a Ring member
Still unsure ... but in Season 4 , looks like we 're going to find out .
She 's being played by Linda Hamilton a.k.a.
Sarah Connor
She was kidnapped by the Ring threatening the lives of Ellie and Chuck , forcing her to work for them ; but when Chuck finds out , he puts her though a Heel  Face Turn
Daniel Shaw The Big Bad in Season 4 will be
As of " Chuck Versus the Living Dead " , he has downloaded an Intersect into his brain , pushing him into the position of Dragon - in - Chief .
, pushing him into the position of Dragon - in - Chief .
As of " Chuck Versus the Ring , Part II " , he 's out ( but probably not completely ) .
There are so many other bad guys now , that anyone could be the ' Big ' .
Alexei Volkoff is the fourth season 's Big Bad , though that does not necessarily preclude Shaw 's return .
Surprised that this one has not made it here yet .
He is presently The Dragon , but considering how the Big Bad has changed between seasons ( none in Season 1 , Roark in Season 2 , and Ring !
Mark Sheppard in Season 3 ) he could very well end up in the Big Bad chair come next season .
Stephen Bartowski is not dead .
Sub -WMG : Ellie had something to do with it .
Schwartz and Fedak have stated in multiple interviews that Stephen is really , truly dead .
But you never know ...
That " cellular regeneration " thingy is such a Chekhov 's Gun .
It worked for Shaw , bet it can work for Stephen .
Season 4 theories regarding Orion 's old enemies
Consider the elder Bartowski's words on this .
" For the last twenty years , I 've been a spy ... for myself " , which implies that , while he did work for the CIA , he may have been involved in several other personal endeavors ( possibly involving many private interests and rival agencies ) that may be more directly related to his constant paranoia and disappearances than just his involvement in the Intersect project .
Whatever they are , they likely personally involve Chuck and Ellie as more than just pawns , since Mr. Bartowski mentioned that he had been actively protecting them from those involved with their mother
Hydra was marked " Identity : Hydra , " just like Orion was .
This implies that Orion was not the only code name Stephen Bartowski used - he may have had different identities for dealing with different opposing forces .
As this identity 's connection to Orion is presumably unknown in the spy community , and given Mr. Bartowski 's tendency to avoid showing his face when operating under his code name , Chuck may take up the mantle to utilize Hydra 's connections in his search for his mother .
" Hydra " looks to be Volkoff 's network .
I got the impression these " old friends " of Orion we saw the codenames for ( Hydra , Phase Two , CYGNUS , The Aries Papers , The Triangulum ( CAPTURED ) , The Fornax Group and that ) were n't specifically a big bad evil group like the Ring but brilliant scientists / tech engineers etc who were going to use the intersect technology and whatever else they came up with for their own purposes .
That they are currently all working separately on projects along with each hunting for Mrs. B. , especially now that Orion is dead .
Chuck 's Mother
I disagree .
The search for Stephen Bartowski / Orion began with very little to go on .
The end of Season 3 seems to give indication of a lot of information that 's being imparted to Chuck right off the bat about their mother , if the files being seen at the end are any indication .
Seeing as she 's being played by Linda Hamilton a.k.a.
Sarah Connor odds are she 's going to be an extremely difficult person to catch up to .
Kind of like Carmen Sandiego .
odds are she 's going to be an extremely difficult person to catch up to .
Kind of like Carmen Sandiego .
She returned home with Team Bartowski in " Chuck Versus the Push Mix " .
The hunt for Chuck 's mom and her joining Team Bartowski may start off seeming like a repeat of them finding his dad but I think she 'll probably have some " darker " motives and possibly try to " save " them by having them be with her as she joins the enemy .
Anna will be turned against Morgan and Chuck by whatever group ends up being the Season 4 Big Bad
I like the idea but I think she 'll turn back to the good side at the end of the episode .
" The Ring was eliminated ! "
Casey 's recommendation to have her tested resulted in her being recruited , but by an agent of The Ring , likely by the chef she ran off with in Hawaii .
She came back to the Buy More to get back together with Morgan , and worm her way into Team Bartowski .
Shaw will finally get Killed Off for Real by Chuck .
If the decapitation happens , it will be the perfect chance to make a Highlander reference .
AND IT WILL BE AWESOME .
It 's as obvious as what we all thought was going to happen in the first place , but hey .
I vote for Chuck to decapitate and / or gut him like a fish with a samurai sword .
The Intersect is an early version of Snow Crash
It can impart vast amounts of information to human beings through purely visual stimulus , but usually results in insanity or a comatose state .
Even those who can handle the information overload will lose their mind before long without a device to regulate their system for them .
By the time of the events in Snow Crash , it will either have been weaponized or become corrupted due to being tinkered with by people who did n't know what they were doing some time after the United States government fell apart .
Casey is Jewish .
Or at least knows Yiddish .
He said oy gevalt , after all .
Sarah 's spy will is a Chekhov 's Gun that has yet to be fired
We get an entire episode where spy wills are a big plot element , and we not only see Sarah give hers to Chuck , but see him write his own .
Given what is in a spy will , there is a very good chance that there will be something in there that Chuck flashes on .
The writers can also be extra sadistic by adding something in there that might shake up the Chuck / Sarah relationship .
Sure Chuck will have to believe Sarah is dead in order to bring it out , but hey , there are plenty of ways for that to happen without her actually being dead .
Possibly confirmed , if you consider Agent X's Spy Will being recovered and revealing him to be Alexei Volkoff to be ' firing ' the spy will gun .
And then in Chuck Versus the Last Details Vivian kills Sarah .
Well , probably not , but if they do want to do the whole ' everyone thinks Sarah 's dead ' bit , now would be the time to do it
Chuck 's mom is on ...
Her own side .
She just does n't know if she wants the family , and her country , or if she wants to helm Volkoff 's group instead .
The box under the car Ellie is left is ...
" Chuck Versus Phase Three " reveals that it 's one of Orion 's laptops .
In " Chuck Versus the Leftovers " , Ellie solves the data storage problem her dad posed , Devon gives Chuck the computer , and Chuck subsequently re-Intersects himself with it .
A supercomputer containing a gestalt of Orion as an AI .

Sally grew up , married a con artist who reminds her of her dad , and produced a spy baby who looks almost exactly like Grandma Betty
If the show is given the opportunity to have a proper series finale , the show will end with a Distant Finale And the Adventure Continues where one of either Chuck / Sarah or Capt .
Awesome / Ellie 's grown up kids gets sucked into the spy life in a manner meant to echo how it began for Chuck back in season 1 .
Chuck and Vivian have got the same mom .
And their eyes , too .
And anyways , Vivian is , what , twentysome , and Mama B. has been working with Volkoff for a little over 20 years , so ...
The actress that plays Chuck 's mother supports this as a possibility .
Stephen J. Bartowski is not dead .
Something about Clyde Decker 's laugh at the end of " Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger " when Chuck points out that he is just seems to say , " Oh , does he reeeeally believe that ?
Interesting .
Either that , or ...
Perhaps he 'll show up in the series finale , or a few episodes before that ?
It is the last hurrah for the show , and having Papa Bartowski show up for one more ( or few ? ) appearance likely makes sense .
Spy life is kind of the family business , what with both the elder Bartowskis being spies and the way all of Chuck 's family has gotten sucked into it at one point or another .
I would n't be all that surprised if Chuck 's grandparents were all spies , too .
So it would make sense that their kids would get in on the action when they become old enough .
It might be a stretch to actually show this all happening , but they could at least leave the show on a note where the audience is given the kind of spark needed to imagine what kind of adventures the next generation of Bartowskis might have .
In order to infiltrate the next carnation of Volkoff Industries , Beckman needed someone relatively inexperienced to take the job and actually knew more about Vivian and the safe deposit box than she was letting on .
Beckman chose Chuck 's team because she knew Chuck had similarities to Vivian and could get her to work with the CIA .
But then she purposely screwed her over by not letting her meet her dad ( despite promising it earlier ) so Vivian would decide to work for Volkoff Industries .
The ages do n't quite work out , but seriously — look at that hair !
And if not , who is her mother ?
Stephen J. Bartowski is dead , but will be revived .
He IS dead , but , he 's brought back similarly to Shaw .
alternatively , his consciousness is uploaded into a new body via Intersect .
In the upcoming season , the Intersect will react poorly with Morgan 's brain , which will be a problem because the team no longer has access to government resources
I like this idea a lot .
Its true to canon , reminds us that Morgan is a pretty normal guy , and adds a lot of tension and conflict .
Bonus points if Morgan does n't tell anyone until its serious because he does n't want them to worry about him
Kinda / sorta half - confirmed in " Chuck Versus the Frosted Tips " , but apparently invoked by whomever really sent those Intersect glasses .
In the final episode , Chuck will deliver a Badass Boast to Clyde Decker .
Jossed .
Given that Decker 's dead now , the boast would be pointless .
He 'll start it with , " Hi. I 'm Chuck .
Here 's a few things that you might need to know . "
Those bugged Intersect glasses were sent not by Decker but Daniel Shaw .
Which would furthermore mean , of course ... we have n't seen the last of him ...
Casey was the one
Who sent that hitman to kill Morgan at the end of " Chuck Versus the Frosted Tips "
Decker visiting Chuck & crew and asking for Casey .
Jossed .
Decker 's visit was because Casey murdered his hit ( wo ) man .
After all , the trailer for the next episode shows
The series will end with the Intersect passing to Jeff .
Morgan is following the same arc as Chuck , which ended ( sorta ) with Chuck as a competent spy in his own right who does n't need the Intersect .
Carmichael Industries would n't pass up a chance to have an Intersect on the team , since it 's such an awesome resource .
Captain Awesome has been helping Jeff to stop being ... you know , Jeff and start being a normal human being .
and start being a normal human being .
Ipso facto , Jeff will join the team as the new Intersect in the series finale .
Alternatively , Captain Awesome will become the new Intersect .
By the time series concludes , Casey & Gertrude will be a couple and be on good terms with Chuck & Sarah .
Plus , Gertrude will " leave " Verbanski Corp. and join Carmichael Industries .
It would just be heartwarming to see that the winking and hints and nudges that we 've seen every time the topic pops up pay off in this manner , and we see that the two become a couple by the end .
The person about to be let out of prison at the end of Chuck Versus the Curse is n't the man behind the overall plot to get Chuck and the team ...
Yes , it may be Shaw being let out , and yes , he 's been consistently a large threat to Chuck , but , let 's consider the below points ...:
He 's at least The Dragon to whoever the real mastermind is .
Seems kinda early for the show to reveal the real Big Bad and rather blatantly in the " Next Time " promos ...
Let 's face it , a computer virus that plans to wipe out all technology just to get Shaw out of prison , something not impressive on its own has to have a larger strategy behind it .
Word of God states that next week 's episode will have " the craziest cliffhanger ever done on the show " , and it 's doubtful that the NBC promo department would just spoil that cliffhanger in the teasers .
If anything , it 's possible that the real architect of the plan to terminate Chuck is just using Shaw as one part of the plan , while he formulates his ultimate strategy , which will take up the final few episodes after .
There 's a line in Versus the Curse where the Enemy Spy of The Week mentions that Gen.
Beckman is " not her general ' ' .
Could the real Big Bad be another high - ranking CIA official ?
Chuck still has the original home - brewed Intersect in his brain
Near the end of season 2 , Stephen sabotages Roark 's attempt to create an Intersect by building a device to remove the Intersect from Chuck 's brain .
This does n't remove the early Intersect from Stephen 's brain , even though his eyes were unprotected .
When Chuck " reboots " in his battle with Shaw in season 3 , it 's revealed that he had an early Intersect in his brain from witnessing Stephen 's work when he was a child — meaning that Intersect has been in his head since childhood and was n't removed by Stephen 's removal device either .
It appears that Intersect removal is at least somewhat dependent on the specific version of the Intersect , so it 's possible — even probable given the indications — that when the CIA forcibly removed the Intersect from Chuck they missed Stephen 's original version , which they did n't even know was there .
And since Chuck 's " reboot " in his fight indicated that the original can have a supportive effect on later versions , this may be important .
The " baby " that 's alluded to at the end of Chuck Versus the Santa Suit is ...
An orphaned baby that 's with another family after Sarah ( unintentionally ) orphaned the baby by killing their birth parents during a mission in Hungary .
The one Kidnapper in Chuck Versus The Bullet Train is Colonel Mitchell
The SGC is infiltrating Quinns Organisation to steal the Intersect and then load it with an Ancient Repositorium of Knowledge or ( Atlantis Database ) to create a safe way to access it .
They just do n't ask the CIA for a pristine copy because after the whole NID stuff they do n't trust the intelligence community .
In the finale they will also send in SG - 12 and trying to switch Casey for Colonel Dixon for this purpose .
They only do n't know yet who will get the Ancient Intersect ( O' Neill already said " No ! " repeatedly and they all are ignoring McKay )
That drawing of Sarah and Chuck 's post - spy life is a Chekhov 's Work of Art
Under Quinn 's orders , Sarah will come after Chuck , who then shows Sarah the drawing , which will help in restoring her memories to normal .
They really emphasized the fact that she remembers the drawing the most , even with the tainted Intersect erasing her other memories , which makes one wonder .
Given the circumstances presented at the end of Chuck Versus the Bullet Train , my guess is that
The whole show is Just a Dream Chuck is having after being exposed to the intersect .
Because it just would n't be a WMG page without this theory .
It is obvious that after having both his parents leave , being framed for cheating by his best friend , being kicked out of college and having his girlfriend stolen by his best friend , he would have some big psychological issues , working with Lester and Jeff for 5 years can't have helped either .
When Chuck opens Bryce 's email , the intersect overloads his brain and sends him into a coma , the intersect data mixes with the psychological issues in Chuck 's head and his Carmichael fantasy to create the show .
Carina is Sarah 's sister
Sarah 's bridesmaid
In the episode where Carina first appears , Sarah mentions having a sister during her sunburn story .
They have an antagonistic relationship yet know each other extremely well , including their past identities , and are close enough that Carina becomes .
Even her line to Chuck , " I love taking what Sarah wants " , sounds like The Glorious War of Sisterly Rivalry
Over at The Huffington Post , Russ Belville notes that the Obama administration 's new drug control strategy urges states to adopt " per se " laws for driving under the influence of drugs ( DUID ) :
Fifteen states have passed laws clarifying that the presence of any illegal drug in a driver 's body is per se evidence of impaired driving .
ONDCP [ the Office of National Drug Control Policy ] will work to expand the use of this standard to other states and explore other ways to increase the enforcement of existing DUID laws .
Under these laws , a driver who has marijuana metabolites in his urine is automatically considered impaired , even though he probably is n't .
Because marijuana metabolites can be detected in urine long after the drug 's effects have worn off ( up to two weeks for occasional users , months for frequent users ) , a " zero tolerance " DUID standard punishes pot smokers who have not harmed or endangered anyone .
It is a way of imposing an extra punishment for marijuana use under the guise of traffic safety , sending unimpaired drivers to jail as public menaces because they smoked pot days or weeks before getting behind the wheel .
It 's like arresting someone for drunk driving on a Wednesday because he drank a few beers the previous Saturday .
And it is completely unnecessary , since a standard based on THC in the blood ( analogous to the standard for DUI ) would be a much better indicator of impairment .
In fact , since " the presence of metabolites for THC tells you the body has already broken down the THC , " Belville says , " you could actually call a urine screening for metabolites a non-impairment test ! "
This is exactly the sort of mindlessly draconian policy that a president with any interest in dialing back the war in drugs would avoid .
I explained the problems with " per se " DUID laws in a 2006 column .
Sen . Bob Bennett loses nomination battle at Utah GOP convention
Sen. Bob Bennett ( R - Utah ) lost his bid for a fourth term today after being eliminated in the second ballot of Utah 's Republican convention .
Bennett came in third with 26 % of the vote behind businessman Tim Bridgewater with 37 % and lawyer Mike Lee with 36 % .
The strong showing for Bridgewater came as a surprise , as national conservatives -- including FreedomWorks -- have strongly supported Lee .
But Cherilyn Eagar , a Republican activist who was knocked out on the first ballot , had vocally opposed Lee , and her votes largely went to Bridgewater .
But Bennett was never able to overcome an anti-incumbent sentiment in the GOP base .
In his speech after coming third in the first round , Bennett pleaded for delegates to consider which candidate had the most influence in Washington .
" Do n't take a chance on a newcomer , " said Bennett .
" There 's too much at stake . "
That message fell flat with Utah Republicans , who now face a choice between two conservative activists who have never held elective office .
Bennett 's only option to continue his political career is , as he told the Associated Press , an unprecedented write - in campaign .
At this hour , it 's unclear if he 'll proceed .
Bridgewater and Lee will battle it out at the convention for the right to a flat - out win .
If one candidate gets 60 % of the vote , he is the nominee .
If neither candidate does , they will face each other in a June primary .
Notably , Lee gave his one - minute time for a pre-ballot speech to a video from Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) , who called Bennett a " friend who 's made a difference " before endorsing the lawyer and first - time candidate .
Below the fold is the reaction of Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , chairman of the NRSC .
I commend my colleague Bob Bennett for his tremendous service to the people of Utah during his 17 years in the United States Senate , and I thank him for his professionalism , integrity , and friendship .
Senator Bennett has long exemplified the strong values and deep work ethic of his state , and he has fought tirelessly for lower taxes and limited government on behalf of Utah ’s best interests .
This has been an open and spirited process and I want to be clear that the NRSC will wholeheartedly support the Republican candidate that primary voters in Utah ultimately choose as their nominee .
I am confident that this Senate seat remains in Republican control this November .
Many older cities rapidly expanded during the Industrial Revolution , as workers flocked to the urban centers .
As the towns and cities expanded , the residential areas for the workers tended to be in the east , with the middle and upper - classes in the west .
The reason for this is that
in much of the northern hemisphere , the prevailing winds are westerlies – blowing from west to east .
The massive , unchecked pollution from these early industries would therefore drift eastward , making the air quality much lower in the east end of cities , lowering the desirability ( and price ) of the housing .
Middle classes preferred the cleaner west ends .
The issue was probably even pre-Industrial Revolution , as smoke from personal chimneys would still have caused problems to the east .
In many cities , this will have been compounded – or confused – by the direction of the main river in the environment , which would have been relied on for many uses , including sewerage .
London , as an example , displays a massive east / west divide , caused in large part by both early industry and the west - to - east flow of the River Thames .

The Seahawks also acquired the versatile Washington , who is recovering from a broken right leg , and a seventh - round pick from the Jets for a fifth - round pick .
Washington recently re-signed with the Jets , for whom he has starred as a kick returner , runner and receiver .

Oregonians who install solar panels will soon be eligible to receive checks from utility companies at premium rates for the power they generate .
A pilot program unveiled Friday -- the first of its kind in the nation -- is designed to guarantee homeowners and businesses a long - term stream of income to cover their costs .
Ratepayers of participating utilities will fund the program through higher monthly bills ; that spooks utility - customer advocates who say expanding the program could push rates to unaffordable levels .
Overseen by the
, the system will increase electricity rates by an undetermined amount for customers of
and
-- and Oregon customers of
.
The five - year program is limited to a maximum 25 megawatts of production , roughly enough energy to serve 2,500 homes .
It draws from approaches in Europe , where demand for solar systems soared as a result .
" For the first time , we wo n't be trying to fund renewable energy from state tax credits , which make renewables compete for the same dollars that fund schools and public safety , " said Judith Barnes , a co-founder of
.
The organization helped shape a bill in the Legislature last year adopting the approach .
Advocates say the system will help Oregon lead the nation in democratizing solar energy , allowing homeowners to cover the costs of bank loans they might need to pay for residential systems .
It will also reward energy production instead of subsidizing installation .
But ratepayer representatives , who in many cases welcome trial projects to boost renewable energy , say solar - equipment prices remain too high to make such programs universal .
" You can't expand this at broad levels at those prices and still have affordable electricity for folks , " said Bob Jenks , executive director of the
.
The new system , which goes into effect July 1 , does not replace an existing Oregon program that offers state tax credits and cash incentives for installing solar equipment .
In the current program , homeowners and businesses can claim the benefits , as well as a federal tax credit , and then save money by generating power .
Under the new program , utility customers can still claim the 30 percent federal tax credit .
But it 's an either - or situation with the previous and new Oregon programs .
They can't join the new program and still be eligible for the state tax credit and cash incentive .
Instead , they 'll receive payments as high as 65 cents a kilowatt hour -- minus residential retail rates of about 10 cents a kilowatt hour -- for the energy they generate and use themselves .
The checks from a utility company are designed to help a customer pay off a loan and at least break even within 15 years .
Churches and other nonprofits -- which have n't been able to benefit directly from tax credits , because they do n't pay taxes -- are among those planning to apply for the program .
" We believe a lot of customers will be attracted to the program , " said Bruce Barney , PGE project manager in customer energy resources .
" It 's a pretty neat thing to receive a premium check for energy that you produce yourself , rather than just say , ' Oh , my bill went down by $ 20 a month . ' "
Pacific Power , which is also gearing up for the program , will work to make it easy to understand , said Pat Egan , the company 's vice president for customer and community affairs .
That could be a challenge .
The program comes with so many unknowns that the Public Utility Commission , mandated by the Legislature to iron out the details , wo n't estimate how much rates will rise to fund it .
" There are too many variables , " said Bob Valdez , commission spokesman .
" It 's a mandate from the Legislature .
The commission is trying to do it in what we hope is the most cost - effective manner . "
Valdez said Commission Chairman Ray Baum could not comment Friday because he was taking a furlough day .
The other commission members could not comment , Valdez said , because only the chairman speaks for the commission .
A key variable is the amount utilities will pay customers for each kilowatt hour generated .
The rate for an individual customer will be guaranteed for 15 years .
But every six months , the commission will re-evaluate the rates , which will also differ among four regions of the state .
At the outset , a Portland - area homeowner , for example , can sign up to receive 65 cents per kilowatt hour .
But a resident of sunny Central Oregon will receive less : 55 cents per kilowatt hour .
The staggered rates are designed to avoid overcompensating owners of systems in sunny areas , where panels are more productive .
A typical 2,000 - watt residential solar system can cost roughly $ 15,000 , installers say .
Adding to the variables of the new system , utilities will pay customers differing amounts for energy according to the size of solar systems .
Owners of medium - size systems will get less per kilowatt hour than owners of small - scale installations .
Rates for large - scale systems will be determined by competitive bidding .
The Public Utility Commission has yet to determine what the program will cost utilities .
Barnes said her Renewable Energy policy organization will argue during public proceedings that the new system will actually save utilities money by cutting costs of building power plants and transmitting electricity .
" We 'll be making the case that distributed generation brings large savings to the utilities , " Barnes said , " so ratepayers should n't pay for those . "
Oregon is the first state to launch a system of this type that sets aside capacity for smaller - scale projects , advocates say , and that finances the program without state tax credits .
Vermont recently introduced a similar system , which will mainly be used for large solar - panel arrays .
Washington and California use aspects of the approach .
Ontario leads governments in North America in pioneering the strategy .
The Canadian province operates its program as part of an initiative to eliminate traditional coal - fired power generation by the end of 2014 .
In Oregon , the approach is so new that banks in the forefront of lending for green projects have yet to gear up for the system .
" We 're just learning about this program as of , like , today , " Steve Rice ,
commercial - banking executive vice president , said Thursday .
" We would love to hear more .
The whole concept makes a lot of sense . "

DAVID CAMERON is in many ways a rather traditional Tory .
Unlike some of his more ideological colleagues , he prefers to take the world as it is rather than rage that it is not as he would like it .
He quickly concluded after May 6th that allying himself with the cause of modest electoral reform was a price worth paying for power .
For the Liberal Democrats , changing the first - past - the - post voting system that discriminates against them has long been the holy grail .
The Conservative promise of a referendum on the alternative - vote ( AV ) system trumped a superior , but ultimately undeliverable , offer by Labour of more radical reform .
A coalition was born .
AV is not proportional representation .
It allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference .
If no candidate gets more than 50 % of first - preference votes , the second choices of those who supported the weakest candidate are redistributed repeatedly until one gets an absolute majority .
The Electoral Reform Society , a pressure group , points out that AV can produce results as perverse as first - past - the - post .
But if it had been used in this year 's election , the group thinks the Lib Dems would have won 22 more seats than the 57 they got — all of them , interestingly , from the Tories .
Labour offered to enact AV and conduct a referendum on a much more proportional system , the single transferable vote ( STV ) .
Under STV votes are cast for candidates in big , multi-member constituencies , by order of preference .
If the voter 's first choice does not need the ballot , either because he can be elected without it or because he has too few votes to get in with it , the ballot is transferred to the voter 's second choice , and so on .
STV would virtually guarantee that no single party could achieve an overall majority at Westminster .
If it had been in operation for this election , the Conservatives would have won 246 seats , Labour 207 and the Lib Dems 162 , the Electoral Reform Society estimates .
Though the prize was considerable , as was the enticing prospect of a more or less permanent coalition government based on a “ progressive alliance ” of the centre - left , the Lib Dems did the maths ( together with Labour they do not have a majority ) and calculated the cost to their reputation of putting electoral reform ahead of the expressed wishes of the electorate .
At the end of the day , said one Lib Dem negotiator , the Tories were “ the only game in town ” .
Changing the Westminster voting system , more or less radically , is now on the political agenda .
So too is a much broader look at reforming institutions .
And here all three main parties agree on a lot , although the devil is in the detail .
All want the House of Lords to be wholly or largely elected under a proportional voting system .
All have similar ideas for cleaning up MPs ' expenses and lobbying , giving voters the right to recall MPs who have broken the rules and forcing lobbyists to operate more transparently , with particular restrictions on former ministers .
Labour and the Lib Dems both promised fixed - term parliaments in their election manifestos and the Tories , as part of the agreement with their new partners , have now come into line .
The prime minister will no longer have the power to call an election when it suits him : parliaments will run for five years and will only be dissolved if the government loses a no-confidence or dissolution motion by a “ supermajority ” — a safety valve that may be particularly necessary when a potentially fractious coalition is in power .
In other areas , it is the Lib Dems and Tories who are closest , for example in their zeal for decentralising power and defending civil liberties ( the latter a relatively new departure for the Tories , who used to be thought of as the authoritarian party ) .
More specifically , both are keen to cut the cost of politics , reduce the number of MPs and reform campaign finance by limiting the size of individual contributions — all issues that cause problems for Labour .
In short , while they will continue to differ about electoral reform , when it comes to wider political reform more unites the coalition partners than divides them .
Former jerk NYPD officer Patrick Pogan was instantly villainized after a video showed him shoving a rider off his bike in Times Square .
But Pogan was a victim , too ; the victim of a good videographer .
John Eligon points out in the NYT that a year before Pogan smashed a Critical Mass rider for fun , another cop was caught on video doing the exact same thing .
But while Pogan was forced to resign and later convicted of a felony in a high profile trial , the other bike - shove cop , Sgt. Timothy Horohoe , was n't charged with any crime , and is still on the job .
The only real difference in the two cases : Pogan was caught on a crystal - clear , easy - to - see video , while Horohoe 's shove was barely captured on the edges of a shaky , murkier video .
The inescapable conclusion :
Make sure you capture the cop beating your ass on a well - produced video , or you 're fucked .
See for yourself — the Pogan video is first , followed by the Horohoe video below .

UPDATE : Ooo , a tipster points us to this even more damning Horohoe video :
NEW YORK / ATHENS ( Reuters ) - Moody ’s cut Greece ’s credit rating to junk status on Monday over risks to an EU / IMF bailout package , highlighting persisting doubts over the country ’s ability to exit a severe debt crisis .

Analysts expect little impact from the widely anticipated multi- notch cut , which pushed the euro down but left other markets unchanged .
Greece will not need to return to markets soon and the ECB will still accept its bonds as collateral .
Moody ’s had repeatedly said it was considering such a steep cut for Greece , which has been hammered by markets and suffered series of rating cuts since it revealed in October that its finances were in a much worse state than previously thought .
“ The macroeconomic and implementation risks associated with the ( EU / IMF ) programme are substantial and more consistent with a Ba1 rating , ” Moody ’s senior analyst Sarah Carlson said to explain the four - notch rating cut .
Moody ’s also downgraded the country ’s short - term issuer rating to not - prime from Prime - 1 .
After coming within a breath of $ 1.23 , its highest since early June , the euro slipped after Moody ’s cut Greece ’s credit rating to about $ 1.2215 before recovering somewhat .
Other markets were little affected by the move , with CDS unchanged at 740 basis points according to Markit Intraday .
“ We ’ve been trading with this for a long time now and just the fact that the agencies finally recognize reality does n’t have too much impact , ” said Sebastien Galy , senior currency analyst at BNP Paribas .
Analysts said they were more concerned by risks of contagion from Greece ’s debt crisis , which has sent shockwaves through markets worldwide , to other indebted euro zone countries such as Spain and Portugal .
Greek government bonds will remain eligible as collateral for loans despite Moody ’s move after the European Central Bank decided last month to suspend its minimum threshold for Greek debt .
The EU / IMF aid package assumes that Greece will not need to borrow on markets before 2012 .
RISKS
Moody ’s said the 110 - billion euro ( $ 134 billion ) “ pain for gain ” package agreed with the EU and the IMF last month was not enough to prevent the ratings cut .
The rescue package “ effectively eliminates any near - term risk of a liquidity - driven default and encourages the implementation of a credible , feasible and incentive - compatible set of structural reforms , which have a high likelihood of stabilizing debt service requirements at manageable levels , ” Carlson said .
But she added : “ There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the timing and impact of these measures on the country ’s economic growth , particularly in a less supportive global economic environment . ”
The firm said Greece ’s credit ratings will now depend on its future economic growth and it still saw a low probability of Greece restructuring its debt .
Fitch has no immediate plans to follow suit and cut Greece ’s debt to junk , a senior analyst at the ratings firm said .
“ We ’ve already said that unless there was a major , unforeseen development we would wait for the last months of the year to take a view on how successful the Greek government has been in implementing the agreed policies , ” Fitch Ratings ’ senior analyst for Greece Chris Pryce told Reuters in a phone interview .
“ This is still our view .
We feel comfortable having it on the edge of the investment grade . ”
Fitch currently rates Greece at BBB - minus , the lowest investment - grade level , with a negative outlook .
Standard & Poor ’s cut Greece ’s debt rating to junk status in April .
Greece said Moody ’s cut was not justified , considering progress in shoring up its public finances .
Two Countrywide mortgage servicing companies will pay $ 108 million to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that they collected excessive fees from cash - strapped borrowers who were struggling to keep their homes .
The $ 108 million represents one of the largest judgments imposed in an FTC case , and the largest mortgage servicing case .
It will be used to reimburse overcharged homeowners whose loans were serviced by Countrywide before it was acquired by Bank of America in July 2008 .
“ Life is hard enough for homeowners who are having trouble paying their mortgage .
To have a major loan servicer like Countrywide piling on illegal and excessive fees is indefensible , ” said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz .
“ We ’re very pleased that homeowners will be reimbursed as a result of our settlement . ”
According to the complaint filed by the FTC , Countrywide ’s loan - servicing operation deceived homeowners who were behind on their mortgage payments into paying inflated fees – fees that could add up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars .
Many of the homeowners had taken out loans originated or funded by Countrywide ’s lending arm , including subprime or “ nontraditional ” mortgages such as payment option adjustable rate mortgages , interest - only mortgages , and loans made with little or no income or asset documentation , the complaint states .
Mortgage servicers are responsible for the day - to - day management of homeowners ’ mortgage loans , including collecting and crediting monthly loan payments .
Homeowners cannot choose their mortgage servicer .
In March 2008 , before being acquired by Bank of America , Countrywide was ranked as the top mortgage servicer in the United States , with a balance of more than $ 1.4 trillion in its servicing portfolio .
When homeowners fell behind on their payments and were in default on their loans , Countrywide ordered property inspections , lawn mowing , and other services meant to protect the lender ’s interest in the property , according to the FTC complaint .
But rather than simply hire third - party vendors to perform the services , Countrywide created subsidiaries to hire the vendors .
The subsidiaries marked up the price of the services charged by the vendors – often by 100 % or more – and Countrywide then charged the homeowners the marked - up fees .
The complaint alleges that the company ’s strategy was to increase profits from default - related service fees in bad economic times .
As a result , even as the mortgage market collapsed and more homeowners fell into delinquency , Countrywide earned substantial profits by funneling default - related services through subsidiaries that it created solely to generate revenue .
According to the FTC , under most mortgage contracts , homeowners must pay for necessary default - related services , but mortgage servicers may not mark up the cost to make a profit or charge homeowners for services that are not reasonable or appropriate to protect the mortgage holder ’s interest in the property .
Homeowners do not have any choice in who performs default - related services or the cost of those services , and they have no option to shop for those services .
In addition , in servicing loans for borrowers trying to save their homes in Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings , the complaint charges that Countrywide made false or unsupported claims to borrowers about amounts owed or the status of their loans .
Countrywide also failed to tell borrowers in bankruptcy when new fees and escrow charges were being added to their loan accounts .
The FTC alleges that after the bankruptcy case closed and borrowers no longer had bankruptcy court protection , Countrywide unfairly tried to collect those amounts , including in some cases via foreclosure .
Settlement Terms
The FTC ’s complaint and settlement order name two mortgage servicers as defendants : Countrywide Home Loans , Inc. and BAC Home Loans Servicing LP , formerly doing business as Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP .
The settlement requires Countrywide to pay $ 108 million , which will be refunded to homeowners who Countrywide overcharged before July 2008 .
In addition , the settlement order prohibits Countrywide from taking advantage of borrowers who have fallen behind on their payments .
The defendants continue to service millions of mortgage loans , including tens of thousands of loans involving borrowers in bankruptcy and foreclosure .
In the servicing of loans , the defendants are permanently barred from :
Making false or unsubstantiated representations about loan accounts , such as amounts owed .
Charging any fee for a service unless it is authorized by the loan instruments , by law , or by the consumer for a specific service requested by the consumer .
Charging any fee for a default - related service unless it is a reasonable fee charged by a third party for work actually performed .
If the service is provided by an affiliate of a defendant , the fee must be within limits set by state law , investor guidelines , and market rates .
Defendants must obtain annual , independent market reviews of their affiliates ’ fees to ensure that they are not excessive .
In addition , Countrywide must advise consumers if it intends to use affiliates for default - related services and , if so , provide a fee schedule of the amounts charged by the affiliates .
The settlement also requires Countrywide to make significant changes to its bankruptcy servicing practices .
For example , Countrywide must send borrowers in Chapter 13 bankruptcy a monthly notice with information about what amounts the borrower owes – including any fees assessed during the prior month .
The defendants also must implement a data integrity program to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data they use to service loans in Chapter 13 bankruptcy .
This case was brought with the invaluable assistance of the United States Trustee Program , the component of the Department of Justice that oversees the administration of bankruptcy cases and private trustees .
This action represents the FTC ’s continuing work to help consumers who have been hurt by the economic downturn .

The Commission vote to authorize staff to file the complaint and settlement was 5 - 0 .
The complaint and settlement were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California .

DETROIT -- Detroit Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch said he expects the team to remain at Joe Louis Arena next season .
" They ( the Red Wings ) will probably play their games again at Joe because it takes time to get things done and things are pretty complicated , '' Ilitch told 97.1 The Ticket 's Morning Show on Thursday .
" There 's some options in what we can do , we 've been thinking about them .
The market is pretty bleak out there as far as building .
But we 're still going to get it done ( new arena downtown ) .
Just have to show a little bit more patience . ''
The team had considered a temporary move to The Palace of Auburn Hills , but now it appears it will finalize a short - term lease with the City of Detroit to remain at Joe Louis Arena .
The current lease expires after the season .
Red Wings general manager Ken Holland , though not part of the decision - making process on where the team plays , has been working on next season 's schedule with the NHL under the assumption the Red Wings will remain at JLA .
" That 's my understanding , unless something 's going on that I 'm not aware of , '' Holland said .
" I 've always presumed we'd be playing at the Joe next season . ''
Reporters Without Borders called on the Thai Army and the Red Shirts to guarantee the safety of journalists covering ongoing clashes in Bangkok after three reporters were injured : a cameraman for France 24 , a photographer for Thai newspaper Matichon , and a photographer for the Thai daily The Nation .
“ The confusion reigning in various parts of Bangkok do not suffice to explain the shooting injuries sustained by several Thai and foreign journalists since April , ” Reporters Without Borders said .
“ Both camps must comply fully with the requirements of international law , according to which journalists cannot be military targets .
We also call for an investigation to establish who gave the orders to shoot a rebel general as he was being interviewed by journalists . ”
The press freedom organisation added : “ We note that Thailand has just got itself elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council , and we urge the government to guarantee the safety of civilians and put an end to news censorship , in particular , the blocking of the Prachatai website . ”
Nelson Rand , a Canadian reporter employed by the French TV news station France 24 , was badly injured today by automatic gunfire near the Suan Lum night bazaar .
Cyriel Payen , France 24 ’s Bangkok bureau chief , said he was hit in an exchange of shots between soldiers and Red Shirts .
A photographer with the Thai newspaper Matichon also sustained a gunshot injury in the same place .
“ He underwent a very long operation and came out of the operating room at about 6 pm , ” Payen said about Rand .
“ He is slowly recovering consciousness .
He was hit three times by shots from an assault rifle .
Once in the leg , causing the loss of a lot of blood .
Once in the abdomen and once in the hand , causing multiple fractures .
The doctors say his condition is now stable . ”
A third journalist , working for The Nation , Chaiwat Pumpuang , was shot in the right leg on 15 May as the army tried to disperse Red Shirts blocked a road at Din Daeng in Bangkok .
Continued shooting in the area prevented the photographer from being taken to hospital for half an hour .
A journalist working for Voice TV , a Thai cable station that supports the Red Shirts , was also reportedly injured in Bangkok .
Red Shirt protesters harassed a TV crew working for Thailand ’s Channel 3 , accusing them of supporting the government .
After an argument , the journalists were able to leave the scene .
Hiroyuki Muramoto , a Japanese cameraman working for the Reuters news agency , was fatally shot and a France 24 cameraman was injured in clashes in Bangkok on 10 April .
The results of the official investigation into Muramoto ’s death have still not been released .
Reporters Without Borders is also shocked by the methods used by the army to eliminate the pro-Red Shirt general Khattiya Sawasdipol , who was shot in the head yesterday while being interviewed by International Herald Tribune reporter Thomas Fuller .
Another journalist who was there said the shot appeared to have been fired by a sniper .
Fuller told CNN : “ I was facing him , he was answering my questions , looking at me and the bullet hit him in the forehead , from what I could tell .
It looks like the bullet came over my head and struck him . ”
At least three people have been killed and more than 60 have been injured in the past 24 hours in Bangkok .
New York 's fury at plans for Ground Zero mosque
Outraged protesters are planning a massive rally to try to block plans to build a giant mosque near New York 's Ground Zero .
Angry relatives claim the move is an ‘ insult ’ to the victims of the World Trade Centre atrocity .
The mosque is part of a proposed 13 - storey Muslim community centre , which will include a swimming pool , gym , theatre and sports facilities .
' Sacred ' ground ' : The World Trade Centre attacks claimed 3,000 lives .
Plans to build a mosque at Ground Zero site have been described as a ' slap in the face '
Rebuilding : The Ground Zero site earlier this year , as reconstruction continues
The building , which was damaged by the fuselage of one of the hijacked planes , is at 45 Park Place - just two blocks from Ground Zero .
It formerly housed a Burlington Coat Factory store .
The store 's two selling floors were destroyed when the landing gear from one of the planes tore through them during the attacks .
Construction is due to begin on September 11 next year – the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack .
A massive rally protesting the plans has been scheduled for June 6 as anger grows .
Rosemary Cain , whose fireman son was killed , said : ‘ I think it ’s despicable .
That ’s sacred ground .
It ’s a slap in the face .
' How could anybody give them permission to build a mosque there ? ’

A mosque and Islamic cultural center is planned to replace the building
Bill Doyle , whose son was also among the 3,000 victims , said : ‘ What I ’m frightened about is that it ’s almost going to be another protest zone – a meeting place for radicals . ’
Paul Sipos , a member of the New York community board , said the £ 68 million community project should be located somewhere else .
‘ If the Japanese decided to open a cultural centre across from Pearl Harbour , that would be insensitive .
If the Germans opened a Bach choral society across from
Auschwitz , even after all these years , that would be an insensitive setting , ’ he told the New York Post .
‘ I have absolutely nothing against Islam .
I just think , why here ? ’
But the organisation behind the mosque has said they picked the spot precisely because of its location near Ground Zero .
Building a mosque ' where a piece of the wreckage fell .... sends the opposite statement to what happened on 9/11 , Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf , the cleric leading the project , told the New York Times last year .
' We want to push back against the extremists , ' Feisal , 61 , added .
Director of the mayor 's Office of Immigrant Affairs Fatima Shama told the New York Times : ' We as New York Muslims have as much of a commitment to rebuilding New York as anybody . '
The FBI has also given Feisal its seal of approval after he helped them reach out to the Muslim population in the wake of the attacks .
' We 've had positive interactions with him in the past , ' a spokesman was quoted as saying .
Since the attacks , Ground Zero has become a shrine to the victims , with millions of visitors paying their respects every year .
Pamela Geller , executive director of the Stop Islamisation of America activist group , is organising the June 6 rally in protest against the development , which will be called Cordoba House .
She said : ‘ What could be more insulting and humiliating than a monster mosque in the shadow of the World Trade Centre buildings that were brought down by an Islamic jihad attack ?
‘ Any decent American , Muslim or otherwise , would n’t dream of such an insult . ’
But Daisy Khan , executive director of the American Society for Muslim Advancement , said : ‘ The time for a centre like this has come because Islam is an American religion .
‘ We need to take the 9/11 tragedy and turn it into something very positive .
It will also serve as a major platform for amplifying the silent voice of the majority of Muslims who have nothing to do with extremist ideologies . ’
She added that up to 2,000 Muslims would be expected to pray at the mosque every Friday .
Herbert Ouida , whose son died in the attacks , said : ‘ I understand the anger , the bitterness and hatred , but it only generates more hatred . ’
A community board backed the project last week , but organisers are still seeking funding .
Microsoft ’s freshly redesigned Xbox 360 slim console has struck the right chord with buyers as it is flying off shelves at multiple retailers .
The first sign of the console ’s popularity came a couple days ago when pre-orders at Amazon.com temporarily sold out .
Pre-orders has since started back up but the console wo n’t be in stock again until Sunday .
Further evidence comes from Xbox 360 ambassador Major Nelson who yesterday tweeted that his followers are telling him about sellouts at Target and Gamestop .
He even went as far as to tell his followers where to buy an Xbox 360 slim : the official Microsoft store , of course .
Have any of you been able to walk into a retail store and easily pick up an Xbox 360 slim ?

Britain has denied a report in The Daily Telegraph of a British plan wherein Israel will ease the Gaza siege in exchange for decreased world pressure for an international probe into the events of the Gaza flotilla , the British Embassy in Tel Aviv said in a statement on Wednesday .
Open gallery view Pro-Palestinian protesters denounce Israel 's raid of the Gaza flotilla , in India on June 2 , 2010 Credit : Reuters
" We do n't know where the idea of a quid pro quo came from the Foreign Secretary has made clear that the current restrictions on Gaza must be lifted in line with UNSCR 1860 , " the statement read .
" In this context , we are of course giving some thought to how this might be done , and discussing with our partners , including Israel .
Other partners are doing the same , and we hope that all such discussions will lead to rapid progress on this issue , " the statement continued .
The Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday that Israel is expected to agree to a British proposal in which it will ease the Gaza blockade in exchange for international acceptance of Israel 's internal investigation into the events that led up to the deaths of nine Turkish activists aboard a Gaza - bound flotilla last week .
According to the report in the conservative British daily , Britain has taken upon itself a central role in mediating the crisis that has erupted following the Gaza flotilla events and has drawn up a confidential document proposing ways of easing the blockade on Gaza .
Israeli officials said that in light of growing international criticism over Gaza 's humanitarian situation , they would agree to permit a substantial amount of aid to pass through Israel 's land crossing into the Gaza Strip , the paper reported .
According to the Telegraph , Israeli officials denied any direct link between their readiness to cooperate over the blockade and the decrease in international support for the UN - led proposal for an international probe .
However a Western source involved in the discussions with Israel said that there are talks of a mutually beneficial deal .
" A quid pro quo deal is in the offing , " said the Western source .
Moreover , British Foreign Secretary William
Hague also hinted that pressure for a UN investigation was easing after he said that a probe with simply international presence may also be acceptable .
U.S. : International probe into Gaza flotilla raid is ' essential '
Echoing countless calls on Israel to subject itself to an international investigation of the events that led up to the deaths of nine Turkish activists aboard a Gaza - bound aid ship last week , the U.S. on Tuesday demanded that some international body be involved in the probe of the events .
This , after a senior official said earlier Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has nearly completed a draft of guidelines for the establishment of a commission of inquiry comprised of Israeli jurists .
The future commission would investigate the clash between Israeli navy commandos who were rappelled onto a Turkish ship , participating in a flotilla attempting to break Israel 's three - year blockade on the Gaza Strip and deliver aid , and Turkish activists aboard the ship .
The incident sparked harsh criticism against Israel and international calls for an independent investigation .
Israel has so far rejected any external investigation , insisting that any investigation by an external body would be biased against Israel .
" International participation in investigating these matters will be important to the credibility that everybody wants to see , " said U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley on Tuesday .
" We are discussing with Israel and others the prospective nature of international participation in the investigation .
And we 're sharing different ideas on how to best accomplish that . "
" We want to see an impartial , credible , prompt , thorough investigation .
We recognize that international participation , which lends itself to countries and entities being able to vouch for the results of the investigation - will be an essential element to putting this tragedy behind us , " he went on to say .
Meanwhile Tuesday , Netanyahu demanded that he and his forum of seven senior ministers be allowed to testify before the investigation committee that will be established , comprised of Israeli jurists , and said that he and his top ministers would supply any future committee with all the required information .
In drafting the guidelines for the future investigation , Netanyahu insisted that Israel Defense Forces soldiers will not be personally interrogated , and asked that the investigation committee use instead the findings of internal military investigations already conducted .
Netanyahu added that IDF Chief of Staff would testify .
According to the senior official , the guidelines for the panel of investigation have been almost finalized by the forum of seven during a meeting they held Monday morning .
However , the forum is expected to convene an additional meeting on the topic on Wednesday .
The draft of the guidelines has been approved unanimously by the forum ministers , who supported Netanyahu 's demands .
The Prime Minister 's Bureau has neither made the draft public nor the names of the individuals who will serve on the committee .
The reason , according to the official , is the fact that the cabinet has yet to complete coordinating the investigation with the U.S. administration and other Western countries in order to ensure their support .
The aim , he said , is that these countries will send observers to oversee the investigation .
In addition , the official added , conflicts of interest must be examined in regard to the possible members of the investigation panel .
The Prime Minister 's Bureau approached several top litigators to inquire whether they would be interested in taking part in the work of the committee .
Several of the candidates are former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. Meir Rosen , former legal adviser to Israel 's Foreign Ministry Alan Baker , and Bar - Ilan University professor Yaffa Zilbershatz , who is also a candidate to become Israel 's next ambassador to the United Nations .
Russia 's Digital Sky Technologies might be the toast of Silicon Valley , but the investment firm gives the Russian founder of Chatroulette the creeps .
Sometimes it takes a teenager to say the obvious , rude things adults can't bring themselves to utter .
Digital
Sky recently invested big money in social networking companies Facebook and Zynga , and is thought to be considering an investment in the likes of Foursquare and Twitter .
CEO Yuri Milner is a featured speaker at the upcoming TechCrunch Disrupt conference .
But Milner and Digital Sky have had no luck seducing a fellow Russian , the 18 - year - old founder of Chatroulette .
Although they hired a driver to chauffeur young Andrey Ternovskiy around during a recent visit to the New York , the teen wants nothing to do with them , according to the New Yorker :
" I am not planning anything with him , " [ Ternovskiy ] said , flapping his fingers against his thumb to imitate Milner talking .
" I want to meet with American investors . " ...
Ternovskiy had told no one he was taking the Sunday - afternoon flight out of Moscow 's Sheremetyevo airport .
But when he arrived in New York he found a car from Digital Sky Technologies , the Russian company , waiting for him at the airport ...
Andrey , ensconced in a New York hotel , was scornful .
" Is that even appropriate for an investor ? " he asked me .
" Harassing and hounding are the only words which come to mind . "
" Creepy " comes to mind , too .
And we 've learned plenty about Digital Sky over the past year to reinforce Ternovskiy 's instinct that American investors are preferable to Russian ones .
The case against Digital Sky starts with its co-owner Alisher Usmanov .
CEO
Milner has dismissed his influence , but Usmanov 's stake in the investment firm amounted to 32 percent last year , according to Usmanov 's own newspaper , making him , by simple math , a big fish among DST 's five known investors .
In fact , he may well hold a bigger stake than any other owner , given than Milner himself shares a 50 percent stake with partner Gregory Finger , as of last year .
A summary of what we know about Usmanov , aka " the hard man of Russia : "
Usmanov has been dubbed a " gangster and racketeer , " rapist and mafia drug trafficker by Britain 's former ambassador to Uzbekistan .
Usmanov denies the charges .
To fight the aforementioned accusation , Usmanov 's lawyers launched a much - derided legal campaign to keep British bloggers from even talking about the charges .
There 's more in the video report " Blogs vs. Usmanov , " from British Channel 4's cable network .
A subsidiary of the De Beers diamond cartel named Usmanov in a suit alleging fraud and " unjust enrichment " in a fight over a diamond mine in northern Russia .
Usamov 's people denied this publicly in strong terms .
There are clues Usmanov could have been part of a violent plot to acquire mobile - phone operator Megafon .
A former co-owner of Megafon disappeared from his bloodstained vacation home in Latvia after telling a U.S. federal court he had been physically coerced into selling his Megafon stake to IPOC , a Bermuda entity , as part of a " plot by high - profile individuals to secretly take over Megafon . "
Two months after he disappeared , it was announced Usmanov had acquired 39 percent of Megafon , in part by buying IPOC 's Megafon shares .
You can read more in our Usmanov Field Guide and later coverage of him .
Of course , no one does business in Russia without getting their hands dirty , and it 's possible Milner is telling the truth when he insists that Usmanov has no influence over Digital Sky , holdings be damned .
Plus it 's an awfully long trail from Usmanov , in Russia , through to Digital Sky , Digital Sky's U.S. investments , and the actual American offices of those investments .
It would seem tough for Usmanov to do too much damage at such a great distance .
Perhaps we should be grateful Digital Sky is plowing so much money into otherwise illiquid technology startups which , by the way , are owned and operated in America and stand to enrich this country .
But it 's worth at least asking why the nefariousness of Digital Sky seems plain as day to the company 's fellow countryman and the internet entrepreneur of the moment , Mr. Chatroulette Andrey Ternovskiy .
And it 's worthwhile to throw some tough questions at Milner when he's up on the American tech conference dais — alongside all the desperate funding pitches .

Stephen Taylor was caught red -handed when his fingerprints matched his watches photo
Stephen Taylor , 29 , took the photo on his mobile phone , hoping it would help him sell the watches , worth £ 4,000 .
But intelligence led police to quiz Taylor .
They seized his phone and experts were able to compare enhanced pictures on the phone with his fingerprint records from previous crimes .
It took them less than an hour to spot tell - tale ridges on his fingers and palm and secure a perfect match .
Yesterday , at Manchester Crown Court , Taylor pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods .
He was jailed for 10 months .
Judge Andrew Lowcock told him : “ You were caught largely because of the ingenuity of the investigating police officers . ”
The items had been stolen during a violent robbery at a house in Stalybridge , Greater Manchester , where a student house - sitter was punched in the face and £ 10,000 in valuables were taken .

Your ways are rather harsh on the religious community and it only makes them put their defences up , if you wish for more effective converting I would suggest that you
present the religious with psychological factors in religion which gives personal comfort and behaviour lessons in exchange for utterly unquestionable belief and that if you weigh both sides and the religious do n’t , what you get is a very bad bargain .
I believe the religious are not necessarily content but taught to be content , suppressing their innate freedom absolutely , instead of guiding it .
Hope you spread the faith , great prophet Dawkins .

The Greeks call it “ Generation 700 " : a mass of highly educated twenty - and early thirtysomethings stuck in amiable insolvency , living with their parents , drifting from coffee shop to coffee shop with companions they ca n’t afford to marry .
From their settled perches , the elders criticize and cluck .
The young , they say , have either no initiative , a dearth of opportunities , or some combination of the two .
They fear that young people will be unable to start their own families and they fret over the prospect of Greece ’s demographic undoing .
The catchall nickname for Greek young adults comes from the sum that had been , before sweeping austerity measures , a typical entry - level monthly salary — 700 euros , or about $ 860 .
But Generation 700 is more than a pay grade ; it ’s also , in the Greek imagination , a question that demands an answer from an overburdened government .
Many Greeks say this generation is the first in decades that faces fewer jobs at lower pay , leading to a declining standard of living and less upward mobility than their parents enjoyed .
Even before the crisis came to a head this spring , economists estimated that about a quarter of this generation of Greeks was unemployed .
“ Parents dream of their children becoming doctors or lawyers , so they made a lot of sacrifices for education , ” said Paulina Lampsa , international secretary for the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement party .
“ Now they have a lot of degrees but no jobs . ”
It ’s a predicament that spans the continent , a quiet underside to the perception of stability and growth brought by the creation of the European Union .
In Italy , unemployment among the young is comparable to that in Greece , and the figure in Spain tops 40 % .
Even Britain and Germany are logging significant struggles against a similar rising trend .
Economists talk about a “ lost generation ” searching for a toehold in the workforce , weighed down by advanced degrees and even higher expectations .
Olga Stefou is 20 .
She speaks passable English and studies political science .
These days she goes into the streets to shout slogans against the government and the International Monetary Fund .
She has no choice , she says :
She believes that upon graduation she ’ll be lucky to land a job that pays $ 500 a month .
“ I ’ll be forced to live with my parents and work three jobs , ” she said , pausing among the throngs trickling into the street as a recent demonstration got underway .
“ I ’ll be doomed to a fate I have n’t chosen .
This is the state of my generation . ”
Stefou believes that the government is bound to respond to her discontent .
And she has suggestions : Greece should make up its budget shortfall by pulling its 122 troops from Afghanistan and levying steep taxes on the Orthodox Church rather than squeezing the workers , she says .
The government is “ in some way afraid of us , ” Stefou said with a shrug .
“ There are too many of us . ”
A hot spring night was creeping over Athens .
Thousands of demonstrators packed the street ; many of them looked to be about Stefou ’s age .
They marched in a slow circle down Stadiou Street to Parliament and then back again , yelling slogans : “ Down with the junta of the IMF ! ” “ Euro is here and it makes you poorer ! ”
“ Thieves , thieves , banks , stockbrokers and politicians ! ”
Doormen in uniforms stood on the stoops of fancy hotels and watched the protesters pass .
A few hapless tourists struggled to wheel their suitcases through the crowds .
Riot police trailed behind , keeping their distance .
Last of all came the street sweepers , scrubbing away any lingering signs of the demonstration .
After a couple of hours , the streets were back to normal , packed with tourists , merchants and homemakers .
To hear some critics tell it , the discontented young are a living metaphor for what ails Greece in general : fattened on the indulgences of a doting system , unwilling to make hard sacrifices , lacking in self - starting spirit .
“ What I ’m really worried about is that you have a culture totally bereft of entrepreneurial ideas , ” said Takis Michas , a prominent Greek journalist and longtime critic of what he has called “ the last Marxist state in Europe . ”
“ People , especially young ones , are not taught to love entrepreneurship , but to hate it , ” he said .
Last year , Michas did a study of Greek marriage agencies .
He found that the top attribute sought by middle - class young women in a potential mate was a job in the civil service or the military .
Government service has long been prized because of the elaborate set of benefits attached to the position .
“ This is the mind - set now , ” Michas said .
“ It ’s a culture of dependency , first on parents , and it becomes a dependency on the state . ”
Tell that to Nick Tsiagkas , 33 , who left a full - time job and used his savings to open a boutique hotel in the mountains a few months ago .
The hotel caters mostly to Greek tourists .
But they are n’t showing up anymore , he says ; they ’re not even calling to ask about rates .
“ People are afraid , and they want to be safe , ” Tsiagkas said .
“ I ’m afraid , too .
I started this business and now I ’m dreaming of having my laptop and just sitting at my office .
I used to have money coming in , and now it ’s just money going out . ”
Each generation has its own maladies .
Greece is also suffused with guilt over pensioners who are watching their monthly payments wither .
But in the malaise of its young adults , many Greeks see the prospect of an impoverished future .
Panos Stamboulidis used to sit around with his friends and dissect the political and social underpinnings of the low wages and lack of opportunity his generation faced .
The heated discussions eventually gave rise to a blog , g700 .
blogspot.com , which has emerged as a forum for generational angst .
On the blog , pro bono legal advisors counsel young people about workplace disputes and government benefits .
Social issues are also tackled :
The site recently mounted a successful push to extend the working hours of the Athens subway so the less - than - wealthy young people could get home inexpensively .
“ Our purpose was to struggle to gain some more rights for this generation , ” Stamboulidis said .
“ We have to fight through the mentality that the previous generation put into place , and also make up for their missed opportunities . ”
Now 30 , Stamboulidis works 13 or 14 hours a day as a freelance food safety inspector , and he says he is grateful for the long hours .
And maybe , he says , government austerity will bring about a change in the country ’s mentality .
“ We are not being fatalistic , ” he said .
“ It ’s a dark policy , but it ’s also necessary to get Greece out of the situation it ’s in . ”

Last week , I joined what must be millions of other technology nerds ( if my Twitter and Facebook friends are any indication ) in getting rid of my iPhone 3G * in favor of an Android - based phone .
Why on earth would I do such a thing ?
Are n't iPhones basically the best smartphones on the market ?
Increasingly , I 'm not sure that 's the case .
Besides , it 's not simply about overall phone quality .
The reasons I switched closely mirror those than Daniel Lyons outlined in his piece at Newsweek .
Here 's the breakdown of the reasons I jumped ship , and why I think many formerly loyal iPhone users might be jumping ship , too .
First , there 's AT&T .
I live and work in San Francisco , which is basically ground zero for crappy AT&T service .
I was tired of the dropped calls , but I do n't talk on the phone all that much .
The bigger problem was having " four bars " of 3G service , trying to go to a website , and being told there was no network connection .
I can't count the times I 've reloaded a web page or TweetDeck trying to get my seemingly well - connected phone online .
My contract with AT&T was over , so this was a good opportunity to jump ship to Verizon .
I do n't really care if Verizon 's 3G is n't quite as fast as AT&T 3G .
Slightly slower but reliable beats faster and spotty every time .
( This , by the way , is why carriers and phone vendors should cut it out with the exclusivity deals .
When AT&T loses a customer , so does Apple .
When Apple loses a customer , chances are high that AT&T does , too . )
Then we have Apple 's app store policies .
Apple is changing the terms in their OS 4 update to the iPhone ( coming this summer ) to basically disallow any intermediate software layers in the creation of iPhone apps .
This means devs can't use Adobe 's popular Flash - to - iPhone compiler , nor products like MonoTouch .
The Unity 3D engine may or may not be affected .
Is it Apple 's right to do this ?
Maybe , but I do n't really care .
Apple 's official reason is that intermediate software layers produce sub -standard products .
The sorry state of iTunes on Windows , which uses CoreFoundation and CoreGraphics , might prove their point .
But should n't developers and consumers be the ones to decide if software is crappy or not ?
And if Apple is so concerned about software quality , how come so many Apps make it to the App Store in an almost unusably buggy state ?
How come there are so many completely worthless junk apps ?
Apple 's quality concerns are demonstrably B.S.
Apple also refuses to support Flash in its browser .
Fair enough .
Maybe the future of web video and interactive entertainment is HTML5 , but the now of web video and interactive entertainment is Flash .
Video sites that rely on protecting content can't use HTML5 video yet , and HTML5 is a long way from having the tools or penetration necessary to make the equivalent of Flash 's incredibly popular web games .
Google went ahead and demonstrated how well Flash can run on a phone - Apple claims they give you the " whole web " on iPhone and iPad , but Google is actually delivering it .
Which brings me to Froyo ( Google 's cute name for Android 2.2 ) .
I 'm mighty impressed by what Google is doing here .
It 's very fast , has some great new developer features , integrated honest - to - goodness Flash 10.1 without compromises , tethering , and more .
Of course , iPhone OS 4 brings with it a host of big changes , and it looks like video chat will probably be part of that .
But I 'd have to buy a new iPhone , and that may mean sticking with AT&T .
The only problem is , I do n't have any confidence that Apple will implement video chat in some sort of standards - compliant way .
I feel like video chat is likely to be iPhone - to - iPhone only , or maybe to Macs with iChat .
Ultimately , my reason for switching can be summed up thusly : I used to feel that , to get the best smartphone software and hardware experience , I had to live in Apple 's walled garden .
Now , the walls are getting higher , and life outside the garden looks better and better .
I can get a really great smartphone without some company telling me I can't switch out the keyboard , or the dialer , or the voice mail program , or the browser .
I can get a world - class smartphone without putting up with AT&T 's spotty network .
I do n't have to put up with supporting a company that enforces its restrictive App Store policies in a seemingly arbitrary and draconian manner .
I 'm not sure I agree with those who say Google has " leapfrogged " Apple in phone development , but I certainly think they 're doing a comparably good job .
So , last week , I walked into Best Buy and bought an HTC Droid Incredible , and so far I 've been more than happy with it .
Now if only more game developers would flock to Android as customers seem to have done .
Oh well , I still have my iPad for that ( I 'd buy someone 's else 's tablet if anyone was making a tablet nearly as good as the iPad ) .
Follow Jason Cross on Twitter .
* I did n't actually get rid of it .
I still have it , it 's just not my phone .
I 'll hang on to it as a portable game machine , for now .

Half of those surveyed say some beaches will never fully recover , and even more predict some species of fish and birds will never return to normal levels .
Eight in 10 expect the spill to hurt the U.S. economy and drive up the cost of gas and food .
" It 's going to take time for things to return to normal , " Obama said Monday as he made his fourth visit to the region .
But he pushed back against the idea that the problem would prove unsolvable , and he urged Americans to go ahead with vacations in unaffected areas .
" In the end , I am confident that we 're going to be able to leave the Gulf Coast in better shape than it was before , " he said in Theodore , Ala .
In the speech at 8 p.m. ET , his first from the Oval Office , Obama will outline plans for BP to establish an independently run , multibillion - dollar fund to reimburse businesses and individuals for financial losses from the spill .
Spokesman Bill Burton says the White House and BP are " working out the particulars " of the fund .
LIVE CHAT WEDNESDAY : USA TODAY 's Brian Winter talks about the Gulf oil spill RELIEF WELL : Aims at pipe 18,000 feet deep BP : Can the company clean up its image ?
OBAMA : President to push BP for damage fund
That suits the public 's get - tough mood .
Nearly six in 10 of those surveyed say BP should be forced to pay for financial losses , including lost wages , even if it drives the British oil giant out of business .
What 's more , 71 % say Obama has n't been tough enough in dealing with BP , though by a narrow margin Americans are inclined to keep the company in charge of efforts to control the spill rather than having the federal government take over .
The low ratings that the president and the company received in a USA TODAY survey in late May have worsened a bit .
Now half of respondents give BP the lowest possible rating , saying it has done a " very poor " job .
One in four say that of Obama .
Who 's to blame for the oil spill ?
Three out of four say BP deserves a " great deal " of the blame .
Close to half , 44 % , say the federal agencies that were supposed to be regulating the offshore drilling bear a lot of responsibility , too .
White House aide David Axelrod says the public 's downbeat mood is understandable but that the reality is less grim — a message Obama will make .
" This is a huge environment catastrophe , there no question about it , but will it drag our economy down , will it send gas prices soaring , will it send food prices soaring ?
The answer to that is ' no , ' " Axelrod said in an interview .

Despite heightened tension with Turkey , and a voluntary boycott of Turkish resorts by Israeli tourists , the Israeli Defense Ministry has approved two large contracts for leasing thousands of Turkish - manufactured cars .
Last week , the Defense Ministry published the results of a tender for the leasing - purchase of cars for IDF officers .
Officers with the rank of lieutenant colonel and higher will receive Hyundai Accent subcompacts that are manufactured in the South Korean company 's plant in Turkey .
Financial publication Globes estimated that the deal will pump 22 to 25 million dollars into the Turkish economy .
In addition , IDF officers with the rank of major will receive Hyundai i20s , also manufactured in Turkey , at a plant that was transferred there from India in order to cut costs .
The Defense Ministry issued a clarification , noting that the cars are not being bought but leased , and that the contract was awarded to Israeli companies that lease the cars , but do not import them themselves .
“ The IDF does not buy Hyundai vehicles or any other kind of vehicle , ” the ministry explained .
“ This is a leasing contract in which car models were selected based on parameters of quality and price . ”
The ministry added that there is no government decision banning purchases in Turkey , and thus “ trade between the nations continues despite recent events . ”
Sick Businessman Lodges Physical Abuse Complaint Against Ryanair
Rome man suffers from myeloma .
Police intervened .
“ They broke my shoulder ” .
Civil aviation authority inquiry .
Ryanair says company policy was adhered to
MILAN – A man suffering from multiple myeloma claims he was physically abused , and his shoulder broken , on Monday ’s Ryanair flight FR9186 from Girona to Rome .
The low - cost operator counters that he failed to comply with the instructions given by the crew for his own safety .
GUARANTEED ASSISTANCE
–
But let ’s start at the beginning .
Rome - based businessman Angelo Pietrolucci , 57 , suffers from multiple myeloma , a painful tumour that progressively weakens the bones until they fracture .
He had asked Ryanair for assistance with boarding .
“ The flight was an hour late and the assistant left me in the waiting area .
In the meantime , boarding had started and when the assistant turned up to accompany me on board , the other passengers had been on the plane for a quarter of an hour
The front rows were occupied so I sat in row three .
But they told me I had to move to the second - last row , number thirty - two ” .
Angelo Pietrolucci , who was travelling with his wife and grandson , says that he went to row thirty - two very slowly because of his physical condition .
And he was complaining .
“ They might have taken me to the rear entrance .
After all , thirty - two is one row from the back ” .
A ROW ISSUE – Ryanair maintains that any delay in assistance is not the point at issue .
Quite the reverse .
The company insists that row thirty - two was the right choice .
“ Angelo Pietrolucci booked assistance for reduced - mobility passengers , who are assigned seats near the exits ” , explained Stephen McNamara , Ryanair ’s communications officer in reply to Corriere .
it ’s email .
Despite what Mr Pietrolucci claims , the first rows are not the ones that ensure the safety of passengers requiring assistance , says the airline .
PERSONA NON GRATA – Mr Pietrolucci says that he went to the seat indicated .
“ When I got to row thirty - two , I was asked to disembark .
They said I was a ‘ persona non grata ’ .
I asked the cabin crew what the reason was and they said they did n’t know .
‘ The aircraft is the captain ’s territory and he gives the orders ’ .
They also told me that if I refused to disembark , they would call the police , and the police duly arrived .
Three officers told me to leave the plane .
If I refused , they were going to handcuff me .
And they showed me their handcuffs as they said it .
When I ‘ passively resisted ’ , one officer yanked my arm , just where I was operated recently .
On landing in Rome , I went to accident and emergency , where they diagnosed a fractured humerus ” .
THE AIRLINE –
The airline maintains that Mr Pietrolucci and his party refused to sit in the seats assigned when asked to do so by the crew .
They were warned that the airport police would be called in should they refuse to comply with the safety instructions .
They did refuse , says Ryanair , and the Spanish police was invited onto the aircraft to make the group leave the aircraft .
We asked Ryanair what actually happened .
Mr McNamara replied that the three assured the police officers that they would comply with the crew ’s safety instructions and on that basis , the police allowed them to travel .
Mr McNamara said there were no further problems during the two hour fifteen minute flight and none of the passengers complained of pain or discomfort .
With regard to the alleged physical abuse and fracture , Mr McNamara said that at no time were Ryanair cabin personnel made aware of , nor did they note , any discomfort on the part of this passenger as a result of the altercation with the Spanish police .
He denied any physical contact between the three passengers and cabin crew , adding that Ryanair instructs staff to call the airport police to deal with passengers who become offensive or refuse to follow safety instructions .
Mr McNamara said the policy was applied in this case .
It was only when the aircraft landed at Rome Ciampino that the passenger requested medical attention , which Ryanair staff requested from the airport .
Mr McNamara concluded by expressing Ryanair ’s regret that the issue with the group had caused a two - hour delay for the 150 passengers on the plane .
WITNESSES – Angelo Pietrolucci ’s response was vehement : “ The passengers protested and shouted at the police to leave me alone .
Many of them gave me their names and details so they could back up my version ” , says Mr Pietrolucci , who is currently being treated with stem cells under the distinguished Professor Franco Mandelli .
“ It ’s not just the broken shoulder .
It ’s the consequences ” .
ENAC INQUIRY –
In the meantime , the civil aviation authority , ENAC , has set up an inquiry .
ENAC ’s president , Vito Riggio , has asked the director general , Alessio Quaranta , to take appropriate action to establish precisely what happened on the aircraft to the seriously ill passenger Angelo Pietrolucci , announced ENAC in a communiqué , which adds that ENAC is keen to see the results of the inquiry as soon as possible .

Continental - United Airlines Merger Could ' Send Airfares Skyward ' United and Continental 's marriage will benefit the airlines but not passengers .
May 3 , 2010 -- Airline passengers across the country should brace for higher ticket prices and fewer flight options if the merger of United and Continental goes through , analysts say .
The merger announced today still has to clear regulatory approval .
The combo would create the world 's largest carrier and unseat Delta Air Lines , which recently completed its merger with Northwest .
The airline , which would take United 's name , would theoretically eliminate redundant routes and would have more control over prices .
" For consumers , that improved pricing power may translate to higher prices , perhaps reversing the record since deregulation of declining real prices for air travel , " said airline analyst Robert Mann .
In a news conference this morning , executives from both airlines said they did n't set prices before and wo n't set prices after such a merger .
Stay Up to Date on the Latest Travel Trends from ABC News on Twitter
Travelers might also find it harder to get from one place to another as the airlines reduce the frequency of some flights and even decide to pull out of some markets .
For instance , Harrisburg , Pa. to Minneapolis , Minn. used to be served by seven airlines : AirTran , Delta , Northwest , American , US Airways , United and Continental , according to George Hobica , president of airfarewatchdog.com .
Thanks to the Delta - Northwest merger and a United - Continental 's combination that route would now be served by five airlines .
" In general , as consolidation progresses , there will be fewer flights between small cities and these will be operated by regional jets , if at all , " Hobica said .
" But nature abhors a vacuum and Southwest , AirTran and other discounters will come to the rescue on some routes if other airlines eliminate service . "
Ticket prices are going to go up merger or not , according to Rick Seaney , CEO of airfare - search site FareCompare.com and an ABCNews.com columnist .
" Last year we were at decade lows so they have no place but to go up -- the question is how much , " Seaney said .
" The pendulum on supply and demand has swung in the airlines favor as summer bookings are very strong and corporate travel continues to perk back up to 2008 levels . "
That said , ultimately , consumers will pay more because of a merger .
" One of the main factors in the price an airline ticket is competition , the lack thereof after this merger is likely to send airfares skyward , " Seaney said .
The Push for Airline Mergers
The airline business has never been easy but in recent years the industry has suffered dramatic losses from high oil prices and the near - disappearance of business travelers , who often pay steep prices for last - minute tickets or first - class seats .
Legacy carriers ( United and Continental being two of them ) have also fought so - called discount carriers like Southwest , AirTran , Frontier , Virgin America and JetBlue who fly younger , more - fuel efficient aircraft and have less debt .
The solution has been to merge with the competition .
" Airlines have lost billions , even in good economic times , and they 've tried everything to become profitable : wage cuts , capacity cuts , new fees , and higher fares .
Consolidation may be their last hope to stop losing money , " Hobica said .
" The only ones who are making tons of money are the top brass at the airlines . "
Delta and Northwest are just the latest in a string of recent mega-mergers .
In 2005 , America West acquired the bankrupt US Airways and took on the US Airways name for the newly - combined airline .
The year before , Air France acquired KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and changed its name to Air France KLM .
While the two coordinate on routes , they still operate two separate brands .
In the case of United and Continental , the two airlines ' routes do n't have a lot of overlap and would complement each other .
Chicago - based United currently has hubs in Chicago , Washington , Denver , San Francisco and Los Angeles .
While Houston - based Continental has hubs are in Houston , Newark , N.J. , and Cleveland .
United 's domestic routes are concentrated in the Midwest and Western states .
It dominates the market in flights from the mainland to Hawaii and has a major foothold in routes to Asia and Australia .
Continental focuses domestically on the South and East , has a strong presence in Mexico and the Caribbean and operates a southern Pacific hub out of Guam .
United flies to 100 cities that Continental does n't and Continental flies to 136 cities that United does n't serve .
FareCompare 's Seaney said that minor overlap -- " basically a few flights in and out of each other 's hubs " -- is so small that smaller cities wo n't be hurt " overly hard unless the combined airline sees fit to pull back capacity . "
" Continental has been relatively stubborn about cutting capacity compared to United , " he added .
United and Continental 's Merger History
This is not the first time the two airlines have considered merging .
In 2008 , the United and Continental were close to a deal but Continental pulled out at the last minute , wary of United 's debt load .
After emerging from bankruptcy in 2006 , United has put its financial house in order .
Its losses are significantly less than past quarters and revenue is up 15 percent .
United also now has $ 4.5 billion in cash on hand .
The new company would be based in Chicago but Continental 's chairman , Jeffery A. Smisek , would be the new chief executive .
Frequent fliers wo n't see much of a change since Continental recently switched its frequent flier and marketing alliance from Delta 's SkyTeam to United 's Star Alliance .
Mann , the aviation analyst , said the combined airline would give Smisek a chance to write the next chapter in the Continental story , the prior one being " From Worst to First . "
For United 's CEO , Glenn F. Tilton , Mann said , the merger would be vindication of his efforts to reorganize United after bankruptcy and " and his ' urge to merge ' , though perhaps not across borders as he originally hoped . "
Would Boeing Benefit from United - Continental Merger ?
The merger could also mean a victory for Chicago - based aircraft manufacturer Boeing .
United brings 386 planes to the table , a mixture of Airbus and Boeing aircraft .
Continental 's fleet of 351 is exclusively Boeing .
The merger leaves American and US Airways as the only remaining legacy airlines and Seaney said a merger between them is " very unlikely . "
US Airways had flirted days ago with United but broke off those talks as the separate United - Continental discussions progressed .
Seaney said that the relatively small US Airways also probably wo n't be able to merge with the low - cost carriers who have a completely different business model : point - to - point route networks compared to the hub - and - spoke system the legacy airlines use .
" Unfortunately , " Seaney said , " it looks like US Airways is the odd person out in merger musical chairs . "
With reports from ABC News ' Matt Hosford
The last decade has brought a flood of discoveries of disease - causing mutations in the human genome .
But with most diseases , the findings have explained only a small part of the risk of getting the disease .
And many of the genetic variants linked to diseases , some scientists have begun to fear , could be statistical illusions .
The Human Genome Project was started in 1989 with the goal of sequencing , or identifying , all three billion chemical units in the human genetic instruction set , finding the genetic roots of disease and then developing treatments .
With the sequence in hand , the next step was to identify the genetic variants that increase the risk for common diseases like cancer and diabetes .
It was far too expensive at that time to think of sequencing patients ’ whole genomes .
So the National Institutes of Health embraced the idea for a clever shortcut , that of looking just at sites on the genome where many people have a variant DNA unit .
But that shortcut appears to have been less than successful .
The theory behind the shortcut was that since the major diseases are common , so too would be the genetic variants that caused them .
Natural selection keeps the human genome free of variants that damage health before children are grown , the theory held , but fails against variants that strike later in life , allowing them to become quite common .
In 2002 the National Institutes of Health started a $ 138 million project called the HapMap to catalog the common variants in European , East Asian and African genomes .
With the catalog in hand , the second stage was to see if any of the variants were more common in the patients with a given disease than in healthy people .
These studies required large numbers of patients and cost several million dollars apiece .
Nearly 400 of them had been completed by 2009 .
The upshot is that hundreds of common genetic variants have now been statistically linked with various diseases .
But with most diseases , the common variants have turned out to explain just a fraction of the genetic risk .
It now seems more likely that each common disease is mostly caused by large numbers of rare variants , ones too rare to have been cataloged by the HapMap .
Defenders of the HapMap and genome - wide association studies say that the approach made sense because it is only now becoming cheap enough to look for rare variants , and that many common variants do have roles in diseases .
The criminal corporations
An armed revolt against the corporations ?
More dangerous than terrorists
The extinction of the human race
( Natural News )
What 's most striking about the present BP oil catastrophe is not that it is an aberration but rather part of a dangerous pattern of mankind 's propensity to destroy nature .
To destroy life in a large region of an ocean is n't even new :
The world already has over two hundred " dead zones " where fish can't live because the ocean water has no more oxygen left thanks to the runoff effects of man-made chemicals .
Not content with mere deforestation and the vast destruction of biodiversity on land , Man has now expanded to destroy the oceans through overfishing , ocean acidification from CO2 emissions , agricultural runoff , flushing pharmaceuticals down the drain and unleashing crude oil directly into the ocean waters .
It almost seems as if mankind were somehow bent on destroyingby first destroying everything else on the planet just to see what happens .
Human beings , by any honest accounting , are repeat offenders engaged in .
This article , by the way , is n't some clever way to try to push us all toward a U.N. - controlled world government where every human action is regulated by environmental cops ; it 's merely an observation of what 's really happening right now on our planet .
I'm a Constitutionalist and remain strongly opposed to UN control as much as any properly - informed American .
In no way do I support suppressing our individual freedoms or liberties .
In fact , the problems here are not with the People but rather withIt is the corporations that are committing these crimes against nature : Big Pharma 's mass poisoning of the waters , BP's oil catastrophe crime against the planet in the Gulf Coast , the manufacture of Depleted Uranium shells by wealthy " defense " contractors , factory farming by meat producers , the poisoning of our farms by Monsanto and its campaign to dominate nature with genetically modified seeds ... you get the picture .
If you really look hard at the issues , it 's the corporations who are destroying our planet and thereby destroying future survivability for the rest of us .
It is the corporations , in essence , that are the criminals who are now destroying the very world around us , and if We the People continue to let these corporations engage in such actions , it wo n't be long before we wake up and find ourselves enslaved in a Corporatocracy that has stolen from us the very world in which we had hoped to raise our children .
What is abundantly clear now is thatto make money , from the cruel and inhumane factory farming of cows to dumping millions of gallons of toxic chemicals in the ocean to try to sink the dead sea animals in the Gulf .
Corporations would set fire to the entire planet if that act could somehow boost profits by 50 % next quarter .
The unbridled greed that drives these corporations is simply incompatible with sustainable life on our planet .
Through their careless , greed - driven actions , and the lives of your children .
I say enough is enough .
There is already some mainstream talk about arresting the CEO of British Petroleum for his crimes against nature .
It will never happen , of course , because these corporations wield too much power over government entities .
We 've seen it time and time again : Corporations are almost never held accountable for their crimes .
It is becoming increasingly clear that any action to hold these corporations accountable for their actions must come -- most likely in the form of a dedicated revolt , or perhaps even an armed " mass citizens ' arrest " of the corporate criminals .
Imagine ten thousand armed , angry citizens from Texas , Louisiana and Florida converging on the BP headquarters in Houston , led by a local Sheriff , marching in and arresting all the top CEOs of British Petroleum .
That 's the kind of action that needs to start taking place if any justice is ever to be found in our modern world of corporate corruption and government collusion .
When it comes to corporate crimes , the justice system has utterly failed .
The corporations that commit crimes are almost never held responsible .
Consider the aftermath of the Goldman Sachs fiasco in 2008 - 2009 , when Wall Street banksters ripped off the American people to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars , and then got bailed out by the U.S. government withof dollars in gift money .
How is that justice ?
Similarly , after drug giant Pfizer was found to have committed massive marketing fraud that violated federal law , the company was deemed " too big to fail " and was simply given a free pass by the government to stay in business , defrauding customers , states and nations .
Pfizer set up a shell company to take the fall for its crimes , then went right back to business as usual .
Read the story on CNN if you want to learn more : http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/04/02/pfizer....
As CNN reports : Whether it 's Big Pharma , Big Oil , Big Food or Big Agriculture , every large and powerful corporationsbecause laws are never properly applied to them .
BP is destroying an entire ocean -- and the livelihoods of millions of people -- and will probably get off with a large fine and a slap on the wrist .
In two years , it will all be back to business as usual , polluting the oceans , destroying life and ignoring safety rules and regulations once again while the American people suffer ..
That much should be clear by now :
When corporations poison our food supply with toxic chemical ingredients ; when they poison our bodies with fraudulently - marketed pharmaceuticals ; when they poison our oceans with careless oil drilling ... they are threatening our lives and our livelihoods .
They are destroying the only world we know , and they are proving themselves to be far more dangerous to our collective future than any terrorist organization .
The real terrorists , it turns out , have " Inc. " after their name .
And if we really want to go after the terrorists who present a clear and present danger to our health and lives , we must rise up against the corporate machine that now controls our media , our food , our sick - care system , our patents , our elected officials and our energy .
We must gather our forces to make legally - justified citizens ' arrests of those at the top who are responsible for these atrocities against nature and the People .
We must unite out of a common desire foragainst the corporate criminals who are destroying our very futures as we speak .
We must seek the aid of the local Sheriffs , Constables and community law enforcement officials who would join us in making these arrests , and then we must march on the corporate headquarters of these criminal corporations , right through their front doors and into their corporate offices where arrests will be made at gunpoint .
And why gunpoint ?
Because corporations do not respect law , nor ethics , nor morality , nor compassion towards others .
They only respect one thing : .
So we must reluctantly use force -- backed by the common sense of common law -- to make these corporations stop destroying our planet and our livelihoods .
I 'm not saying we march in there and shoot them ; I 'm saying we march in andand bring them to trial in local courts , with local jurors who can make local commonsense decisions about what to do with these criminal corporate executives .
The feds can not be trusted on this .
We must deal with these corporations on a local level , with the widespread support of the everyday people whose lives are being destroyed by these corporations .
This is more than just holding corporations accountable for specific crimes such as poisoning the Gulf Coast ; it 's about .
We 're not merely talking about small , local damage to specific regions or industries here -- we are talking about the possibility of the extinction of the human race .
If the world 's powerful corporations are allowed to continue operating as they have done , .
We cannot survive when suffocated under a cloud of chemical toxicity , financial fraud , genetically - modified seeds and widespread environmental destruction .
Corporations are incapable of acting within the guidelines of long - term sustainable living .
Their power and reach are now so great that they have the capacity to destroy modern civilization ( which is quite fragile already ) ..
What BP has made as clear as day is that we must now make a choice :
We can choose to appease powerful corporations and exempt them from any real enforcement of rules , regulations or common sense ; or we can take a stand against them , arrest their top executives , shut down their operations , revoke their corporate charters and set course in a new world without the destructive influence of endless greed backed by incessant profit - taking .
The worship of profit has become a scourge on human civilization .
Unbridled greed is now our curse .
" Economic activity " , taken as a lone figure without the context in which it was generated , holds no measure of real value , and it should never been pursued for its own sake .
We must now shift our consciousness to a new era of .
We must value , not imaginary numbers in a bank account , and quality of life is a complex , interdependent equation that necessarily involves the sustaining of all the diverse ecosystems that now remain on our planet .
For humans to live sustainably , happily and abundantly , we must stop destroying nature and start protecting it .
We must be its steward , not its exploiter .
And those corporations engaged in the mass destruction or poisoning of living ecosystems must be courageously arrested as criminals and prosecuted for their crimes against both the People and the planet .
There is no other way that we will survive the next century .
Poisoning our planet on such a massive scale in an inexcusable act .
We the People will either rise up against it , or we shall be destroyed by it .
I , for one , am willing to fight for our survival .
Because I do n't want human civilization to just be a sorry footnote in the history of life on planet Earth .

As crews dismantle the massive security fence from the G20 summit , questions are piling up about a secret cabinet decision giving police immense power to search and arrest anyone within five metres of the barrier .
Legal experts say a regulation authorizing the searches could be vulnerable to attack not just for potentially violating Charter protections against unreasonable search and seizure .
It could also be challenged on the grounds the public was not given adequate notice of the sweeping changes that required them to identify themselves to police officers or agree to be searched .
“ I think it ’s beyond question it is a major intrusion into what is ordinarily thought to be a fairly basic right to move around the city without having to justify your presence or submit to a search , ” said Jonathan Dawe , a Toronto lawyer who has argued before the Supreme Court of Canada on the scope of police search powers .
Dave Vasey , a York University student who was arrested and jailed last Thursday for refusing to produce identification outside the fence , plans a Charter challenge to the provincial cabinet ’s decision to quietly pass a regulation under the Public Works Protection
Act that extended police powers .
The constitutionality of the legislation was upheld in a 2005 decision by the Ontario Court of Appeal .
But at that time , the court was only looking at whether police have the right to search someone entering a courthouse .
Insisting a citizen walk through a metal detector at a court building is a far cry from authorizing police to stop and search people on a sidewalk , demanding they produce identification or risk being thrown in jail , Dawe suggested Monday .
“ There is something quite different about the idea of cordoning off an entire section of a city and declaring it to be off limits , ” he said .
A key issue in any challenge to the regulation under the Charter ’s search provisions would be whether the public could reasonably expect to walk through the downtown core within five metres of the fence without being stopped and asked for identification or to submit to a search .
One way of measuring that is to consider how surprised everyone was to find out about the regulation after Vasey ’s arrest made the news last Friday , said Dawe .
Known as “ Ontario regulation 233/10 , ” it was simply posted on a government web page known as “ e- laws ” without any public debate .
This Saturday — six days after the end of the summit — is when the public was to have found out about the regulation , when it gets published in the July 3 edition of the Ontario Gazette .
For something that had “ such a dramatic impact on our civil liberties , it ’s something that should not have occurred without a public announcement and a public debate to ensure the government is acting in a reasonable and measured way , ” said Bruce Ryder , director of the Centre for Public Law and Public Policy at Osgoode Hall Law School .
Ryder said he ’s surprised the province had n’t learned , as did the federal government , from the fallout over the War Measures Act , invoked by former prime minister Pierre Trudeau ’s cabinet in 1970 in response to the FLQ crisis in Quebec .
The War Measures
Act was subsequently repealed and replaced by new federal emergency powers legislation , designed to deal with situations such as the recent summit , Ryder noted .
But the legislation requires a public debate in Parliament within seven days of the powers being proclaimed in force , along with a vote to confirm that the use of emergency powers is necessary , he said .
“ That would have been the appropriate way to proceed in this case , when the government decided to invoke this ( Public Works Protection )
Act in an unprecedented way . ”
Adam Dodek , a former senior policy adviser to Ontario ’s attorney general and now a law professor at the University of Ottawa , said that in the usual course , it is rare for regulations to be publicized before being passed by cabinet .
The standard procedure is to publish them two weeks later .
But while that system “ makes sense for . . . the 20th century , ” Dodek said the public should be provided with better advance notice of proposed legislation , with an opportunity to submit online comments , following the lead of U.S. jurisdictions .

Dawe said in considering whether the new regulation was justified , much will turn on what alternatives were available to police .
If police have reasonable grounds to believe someone is about to commit a crime , the Criminal Code already gives them the power to make an “ anticipatory ” arrest .
Another potential avenue of legal challenge is to question whether Toronto ’s streets and sidewalks could even be defined as “ public works ” under the legislation , and therefore places where people could be stopped and searched , Ryder said .

A Post - apocalyptic film is a sub - genre of science fiction , and is set in a world or civilization after nuclear war , plague , or some other general disaster .
This list looks at ten of the ultimate films in this genre and it hopefully differs from the usual films found on these lists by introducing a few films that are less well known these days .
10 Quiet Earth 1985
The Quiet Earth ( based on the novel of the same name ) explores how a person can go mad when he realizes he ’s the only one left on Earth following a terrible catastrophe that he helped cause .
The portrayals of Hobson ’s madness and how he pulls back from the brink are both satisfying — especially because the latter happens before Hobson realizes that he ’s really not alone .
The Quiet Earth ends on an uncertain note ( a real WTF ?!? moment ) that makes you think long after the movie ends .
9 Mad Max 2 1981
The second film in the Mad Max trilogy begins with a classic prologue back - story ; a narrator informs us that the world has “ crumbled and …
The cities have exploded ; ” and that the world had gone to ( Nuclear ) war .
The survivors roam the countryside in feral biker gangs with oil the main commodity , the film ’s comic - book post - apocalyptic / punk style has been copied endlessly .
Max ( Mel Gibson ) is an ex police man with a suped up sports car and sawn off shotgun who defends a band of settlers working an oil refinery against the crazed gang .
8 Dawn of the Dead 1978
This was the second film of George A Romero ’s Living Dead series and shows , in larger scale , a zombie epidemic .
In the film the dead have risen and prey on human flesh .
The film follows a group of survivors of the outbreak who barricade themselves inside a shopping mall .
As time passes the undead try to get in to the mall as the outside society has collapsed .
The novelty of their situation begins to wear and one of the women becomes heavily pregnant .
By this time , all emergency broadcast transmissions from the outside world have stopped which gives a real sense of claustrophobia and isolation .
Their end comes as a gang of bikers break into the mall and , in the process , let in the zombies .
7 Delicatessen 1991
This story is centered on a microcosm of a post - apocalyptic society where food is so rare it ’s extremely valuable and used as currency .
The story centers on an apartment building with a delicatessen on the ground floor .
The owner of the eatery also owns the apartment building and he is in need of a new maintenance man since the original “ mysteriously ” disappeared .
A former clown applies for the job and the butcher ’s intent is to have him work for a little while and then serve him to quirky tenants who pay the butcher in grain .
The clown and butcher ’s daughter fall in love and she tries to foil her father ’s plans by contacting the “ troglodytes ” , a grain eating sub - group of society who live entirely underground .
The “ trogs ” are possibly the most sensible of the lot , as they see food as food and not money .
This movie reflects a type of science fiction called la Nouvelle Vague .
6 On The Beach 1959
In the aftermath of an atomic war , much of humanity has been destroyed .
Only Australia remains , but time is short as the winds will inevitably spread nuclear fallout and everyone knows they have only a few months to live .
Among those coming to terms with the inevitable is a U.S. navy officer , Cmdr. Dwight Towers , whose submarine and crew were at sea when the holocaust occurred ; Moira Davidson , a free - spirit who develops a close attachment to Towers ; Julian Osborne , whose dream is to win the Australian Grand Prix automobile race ; and Lt. Cmdr. Peter Holmes , who is as concerned about his wife and newborn child ’s future as his own .
5 La Jetée 1962
In a devastated Paris in the aftermath of WWIII , The few surviving humans begin researching time travel , hoping to send someone back to the pre-war world for food , supplies and maybe a solution to their dire position .
One man is haunted by a vague childhood memory that will prove fateful .
This is the film that stands here in place of 12 monkeys , which borrows heavily from it .
Everyone has seen 12 monkeys , not everyone has seen La jetée – but they should .
4 Logan ’s Run 1976
This was one of the great 70 ’s sci fi classics before the before the big FX of Star Wars and Close Encounters made it cheesy by comparison .
After a Nuclear war , people live in a domed city of the future where everyone dies ( “ Renewed ” ) at age 30 .
Anyone who disagrees and tries to escape the city is tracked down by Sandmen and murdered .
Logan , a Sandman is forced to search for “ Sanctuary ” – a place to which people have apparently escaped .
Classic ’70s stuff that also spawned a TV show .
3 Day of the Triffids 1962
Day of the Triffids is a 1962 British film unusual at the time for being in colour .
It has had a huge influence on future classics like 28 days later and many Zombie films .
Triffids are giant plants with the ability to kill with a poisonous sting ; a man wakes up in hospital with his eyes bandaged and has missed an unusual meteor shower that has blinded most people on Earth .
He finds the population struggling to stay alive with this sudden affliction , some cooperating , and some fighting : after just a few days society is collapsing with the Triffids preying on the survivors .
This is a classic must - see film .
2 The Omega Man 1971
Made in 1971 based on the novel I Am Legend and ten times better than the recent Will Smith remake despite some cheesy make up and effects , the Omega man is the classic last man on Earth story .
A Biological war has killed most of the world ’s human population .
Army Colonel Robert Neville ( Charlton Heston ) is immune and rules Los Angeles by day trying to track down and kill the other survivors who have joined together as “ The Family ” – a cult of night dwelling mutants infected with a plague from the fallout of the war .
At night he is a prisoner in his own fortified home as the Family seeks to destroy him .
1 Planet of the Apes 1968
A sci fi legend , Planet of the Apes won many awards in its day and was one of the first sci - fi franchises with 4 sequels and a TV show .
3 Astronauts Led by Taylor ( Charlton Heston ) crash - land on an unknown planet in the year 3978 A.D. after a 2006 - year voyage ( during which the crew ages only 18 months ) .
The three set off through a desert and find an oasis .
They decide to go swimming and then the fun begins : they are captured by Gorillas on horseback .
The gorillas take Taylor to “ Ape City , ” where he discovers that the apes , who can talk , are in control and humans , who cannot talk , are hunted and enslaved .
Taylor manages to escape the Ape City to “ The Forbidden Zone ” where he discovers the apes ’ world was , at one time , controlled by humans , but at some point in history , apes developed and the roles reversed .
The ending is one of the great twists of cinema :
As chuck rides on the beach with his new mate a familiar object comes into view and Heston sinks to his knees bellowing “ they finally did it & god dam you all to hell ! ” the picture zooms out to reveal the remains of the Statue of Liberty , half buried in the shoreline – showing that all along , they were actually in Earth ’s future .

The Devils completed their coaching staff today , naming former Lighting assistant Adam Oates to the same position with the organization .
Oates will fall under the role of “ offensive assistant ” that new coach John MacLean spoke about during his introductory press conference .
With the Lightning , Oates helped improve the power play , something the Devils desperately need to improve .
General manager Lou Lamoriello had nothing but praise for the assistant coach .
“ Throughout his career , Adam was without question one of the top playmaking centers , particularly on the power play , and was considered one of the top face - off players in the game , ” Lamoriello said in a statement released by the team .
“ These attributes bring a different dimension to our coaching staff and both John and I are delighted that Adam is joining our organization . ”
Oates , 47 , played in 1,337 NHL games , registering 341 goals and 1,079 assists for 1,420 points and 415 penalty minutes .
The former center played for Detroit , St. Louis ( where he was teammates with Scott Stevens in 1990 - 91 ) , Boston , Washington , Philadelphia , Anaheim and Edmonton .
Oates played in five NHL All - Star games , and reached the 100 point mark on four occasions .
He ranks sixth all - time in assists .
Oates retired from playing on April 3 , 2004 , and took his first NHL assistant job last season with the Lightning .
Oates joins Larry Robinson and Chris Terreri on MacLean ’s staff .
***************
I think Oates could do well with the Devils this season .
Clearly , the power play needs help .
If he can do something to get solid production night in and night out , then I ’ll be happy .
Too many times over the past few years we ’ve watched the Devils look really sharp with the man advantage on night and unorganized the next .
The team needs stability , and it seems Oates can bring this to the organization .
I also think his influence will be good for the young centers on this team , especially a guy like Travis Zajac .
We all saw Zajac take a step forward last season , and Oates may be able to continue to improve Zajac ’s overall play .
Oates ’ assist numbers are stellar , and I ’m sure he can help Zajac to develop better on - ice vision and playmaking skills .
While Zajac is one of the better centers in the league , I ’m sure he ’ll benefit from some time with Oates .
The continuing disaster in the Gulf of Mexico helps one see other regulatory controversies in a different light .
Take , for example , the battle in California over the use of the pesticide methyl iodide , a chemical so toxic , according to the San Francisco Chronicle , “ that even chemists are reluctant to handle it . ”
Methyl iodide , which according to chemist and pesticide expert Susan Kegley can cause neurological damage and fetal death in laboratory animals even at low doses and has links to thyroid disease , including cancerous tumors of the lungs and brain , is about to be approved for widespread use in the Golden State .
It ’s a soil - sterilizing chemical meant as a replacement for the now - banned methyl bromide , an ozone - depleting chemical that ’s a key pesticide for conventional strawberry growers .
The Bush EPA approved methyl iodide in 2007 over the objections dozens of scientists ( including 5 Nobel laureates ) , in what Grist ’s Tom Philpott decried as an example of “ unchecked crony capitalism . ”
And now that tragedy is being replayed as a western farce .
As Kegley told the Chronicle , “ The state ’s own scientists concluded that the chemical posed a potential risk to public health .
The department then appointed an outside review panel , which essentially came out with the same results . ”
But no matter , says California ’s Department of Pesticide Regulation .
They ’ve got this whole thing under control :
[ State spokesperson Lea ]
Brooks said the department incorporated many of the review panel ’s suggestions in the final risk assessment .
“ However , the members are experts in assessing pesticide risks , not in regulatory risk management that leads to decisions on registration , ” Brooks wrote in an e-mail to The Chronicle .
“ Panel members were not familiar with the many options and measures that can be put into place by risk managers to avoid unsafe exposure levels . ”
“ Risk managers ? ”
You mean , like BP had to make sure all the safety protocols were followed ?
Or maybe she means the risk managers like the big banks used ?
In the 21st century , we ’ve learned that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are , “ I ’m from Risk Management , and I ’m here to help . ”
The plan is to use tarps and plant buffer zones and stuff .
So chill out , people .
It ’s not like anyone might ignore the rules , or take a shortcut , or something unexpected might happen , like a gust of wind kicks up and blows a tarp away .
Not gonna happen .
Kegley , for her part , expects thyroid cancer rates to increase if methyl iodide is approved .
The most likely victims will be migrant farm workers and small children living near agricultural areas .
Small price to pay , no doubt , for bumper strawberry crops , would n’t you say ?
Dianetics Book review by Martin Gumpert August 14 , 1950 DIANETICS , by L. Ron Hubbard ( Hermitage House ; $ 4 ) .
It is not so much the content of this book which deserves analysis as its effect on the average reader 's mind .
" Dianetics " has been steadily climbing on the best - seller list since its publication , and , next to the spectacular success of the Velikovsky book , its popularity is the most frightening proof of the confusion of the contemporary mind and its tendency to fall prey to pseudo - scientific concepts .
The book opens with the statement : " The creation of dianetics is a milestone for Man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his invention of the wheel and arch . "
Dianetics , we learn ( from the Greek " dianoua " -- thought ) , is the science of mind .
" The hidden source of all psychosomatic ills and human aberration has been discovered and skill have been developed for their invariable cure . "
With the help of these skills everybody can achieve " release " within less than 20 hours , and can grow into a " dianetic clear , " or an individual with intelligence considerably greater than the current norm .
A few lines later we learn : " It is new that life has as its entire dynamic urge only survival . "
The dianetic prophet , L. Ron Hubbard , a civil engineer and science - fiction writer , has revealed " as an established scientific fact " that man is uniformly and invariably good .
He claims as one of his great discoveries " a hitherto unsuspected sub- mind . "
The concept of the unconscious mind is replaced by the " reactive mind . "
The reactive mind receives its recordings as cellular " engrams " when the " conscious " mind is " unconscious . "
These engrams disturb our thought processes .
No physical or emotional pain is ever forgotten unless it is removed by dianetic therapy .
The dianetic patient " returns " to his pain and changes into an individual full of memories but without pain .
Lying in a quiet room he falls into a state of " dianetic reverie " and his " auditor " ( and everybody can be everybody else 's auditor ) tells him " to go to rather than remember " various periods of his life , including his prenatal existence .
So he travels on his " time track " back to his mother 's womb and draws checks on his " standard memory bank , " reaches his " cellular level engrams , " and -- in the re?xperiencing of them -- they are finally erased and refiled automatically as " standard memory . "
The result of this treatment is the dianetic " clear , " who " is to a current normal individual as the current is to the severely insane . "
I must confess I have never been confronted by such a bold and immodest mixture of complete nonsense and perfectly reasonable common sense , taken from long - acknowledged findings and disguised and distorted by a crazy , newly invented terminology .
Most revolting is the repeated claim of exactitude and of scientific experimental approach , for which every evidence is lacking .
The author lives continuously on borrowed concepts , though at the same time he attacks them most ungraciously and ungratefully .
Whatever makes sense in his " discoveries " does not belong to him , and his own theory appears to this reviewer as a paranoiac system which would be of interest as part of a case history , but which seems quite dangerous when offered for mass consumption as a therapeutic technique .
Hubbard 's concept of psychosomatic disease is definitely wrong .
Psychosomatic ailments are not simply caused by emotional disturbances ; they are diseases in which the emotional and the organic factor are closely involved and interdependent .
But the author does not stop at the usual group of recognized psychosomatic ailments .
He announces ( p. 93 ) : " At the present time dianetic research is scheduled to include cancer and diabetes .
There are a number of reasons to suppose that these may be engramic in cause , particularly malignant cancer . "
He prescribes that " the pre-clear should take a daily dose of ten to twenty milligrams of vitamin B1 while in therapy , " because otherwise he might have nightmares .
And , of course , like the leader of any crackpot movement , he suspects and condemns the skeptic and disbeliever : " Should the pre-clear discover that anyone is attempting to prevent him from starting or continuing dianetic therapy , the fact should be communicated immediately to the auditor .
Anyone attempting to stop an individual from entering therapy either has a use for the aberrations of the individual or has something to hide . "
This physician has no use for the aberrations of dianetics - addicts , but he earnestly hopes to prevent readers of the book from trying their luck with its methods .
There can be no doubt that many will feel helped by the new fad , and unfortunately , it was only to be expected that somebody would get the idea of inventing some kind of home - psychoanalysis .
No method of psychotherapy exists -- however bizarre it may be -- which will not exert a temporary effect in the hands of disciples who are haunted by anxiety and despair .
However , the harm that may be done by dianetics - auditors and their victims should not be underestimated .
Hubbard says : " A pre-clear should not be disheartened or dismayed to find himself with a flicker of " coronary trouble " on Tuesday , the shadow of a " migraine " on Saturday and a cough on Wednesday .
. . .
Anything so restimulated by therapy cannot reach any dangerous heights and is of passing duration . "
The flicker of coronary trouble may be a serious occlusion , the psychosomatic ulcer may be a disguised cancer , and the cough a tumor of the lungs .
While the patient is spending his hours in dianetic revery , precious time for saving his life may be lost : it may prove fatal to have put too much trust in the promises of this dangerous book .
The examples of dianetic auditions which are quoted are of fantastic absurdity , especially where they are concerned with the poor patient 's pre-natal life and his mother 's sex habits and abortions .
I wish there were enough space to reprint some of them .
This reviewer , in exploring the book , suffered a most painful " cellular engram " -- to use the author 's language .
And he ardently wishes that something could be done to prohibit the activities of psycho- therapists of this sort .
Our exploiters of mass anxiety are a serious menace to public health .
Dr. Martin Gumpert , born in Berlin , studied medicine at Heidelberg and Berlin Universities and practised for a decade in his native land before coming to the United States .
Especially interested in the problems of old age , he has written many books in that and other fields .
He is a member of the staff of Goldwater Memorial Hospital , New York City .
Letters to the Editor The New Republic November 9 , 1950 No Authority SIR : To Dr. Martin Gumpert and to all who may be disposed to take seriously his tirade against " Dianetics " ( the NR , August 14 ) I commend the words of advice attributed to Oliver Cromwell : " I beseech ye , in the bowels of Christ , to consider whether ye may not be mistaken . "
In vain I warned the Literary Editor of the NR a month ago NOT to submit this book to review by an " Authority " unwilling to put its postulates to a test .
Dr. Gumpert has not only put them to no test , but has carefully refrained from asking the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth , New Jersey , for documentary evidence and case studies -- now being prepared for later publication .
He also " hopes to prevent " others from testing the postulates and believes ( shades of the AMA on socialized medicine ! ) that dianetics should be " prohibited . "
Happily , his efforts will be futile .
The only thing " dangerous " or disgraceful in this matter is that the " New Republic " should print such utterly ignorant and irresponsible statements , under the editorial delusion that they constitute a critical evaluation , and thereby make itself the laughingstock of the rapidly growing throng of people who know what dianetics is about .
Not the book , but the review , is " complete nonsense , " a " paranoiac system " and a " fantastic absurdity . "
There are no authorities on dianetics save those who have tested it .
All who have done so are in no doubt whatever as to who is here mistaken .
FREDERICK L. SCHUMAN Williamstown , Mass .
[ While Dr. Schuman is a distinguished authority on political science , we do not feel that on issues involving psychiatry he is entitled to any more respect than any other layman .
His suggestion that no one should write about dianetics without having experienced it seems to us like saying that no one can be an authority on cyanide of potassium unless he has eaten some .
-- THE EDITORS ]
Jonathan Weber , the editor in chief of The Bay Citizen , writes a weekly column .
For Tom Campbell , the moderate Republican who was thrashed in the California Senate primary last week , it must be tough seeing Carly Fiorina , his victorious opponent , and Meg Whitman , the Republican candidate for governor , anointed as the new political vanguard of Silicon Valley .
This is a prize that by all rights should belong to Mr. Campbell .
For more than three decades , the one - time law professor and member of Congress has positioned himself as just the kind of smart , socially liberal and fiscally conservative politician whom high - tech business leaders could love .
When Silicon Valley computer chip makers needed someone in Washington who “ got it ” in the late 1980s , as they fought for their survival against Japanese imports , Mr. Campbell stood up .
More recently , when green - energy entrepreneurs needed credibly pro-business advocates for environmental protection , Mr. Campbell was there .
At a time when the Republican Party is riding anti-immigration , anti-abortion and anti-gay - rights platforms to victory around the country , Mr. Campbell mostly rejected those themes , which are anathema to the creative class that drives Silicon Valley .
There ’s very little setup or background for the characters of Knight and Day and the audience is left to interpret most of the characters ’ pasts .
It all begins with the chance meeting between Super Secret Agent Roy Miller ( Cruise ) and classic car enthusiast June Havens ( Diaz ) who meet early in the film at the small but somehow busy Wichita Airport in Kansas .
Miller is an agent who ’s on the run after taking out a number of fellow agents and escaped with a revolutionary piece of tech .
He runs into the unsuspecting Havens various times while at the airport and later after they both board a plane curiously populated by a slew of agents sent to kill Miller and retrieve what Miller stole .
In typical super secret agent fashion , Miller makes short work of these merchants of death and then lands the plane in a cornfield ( they are in Kansas after all ) .
The day after , Havens wakes up in her apartment feeling a bit like Dorothy back in Kansas wondering if she just got back from the Land of Oz only to find a serious of notes from Miller around her apartment .
Unsettled by this ,
Havens seeks out the counsel of her recently exed boyfriend who curiously takes her to a diner for pie .
Miller shows up revealing to the unsuspecting Havens that she is in danger , takes off with her at gun point , and the action picks up again .
The rest of the film is made up of a series of action sequences stitched together by Director James Mangold and his team .
Mangold , who practically re-envisioned the western with 3:10 to Yuma , knows how to make an action film .
Yet in Knight and Day the action scenes are too fast , somewhat jerky and the stunts seem a bit unreal .
In a world where even super secret spy Jason Bourne suffers several injuries during his movies , seeing a visibly older Cruise get by nearly unscathed through most of the film did nothing to make me buy that Agent Miller was not a super hero in disguise .
Although , there are a number of antagonists in the film , they play their role with minimal notice and merely serve as plot devices .
Knight and Day works as an action film , something that Cruise has been very successful with .
( i.e. the Mission Impossible franchise and Minority Report ) .
Unfortunately there are too many super secret spy stories out there with more believable plots and stunts and this film gets lost in the mix .
I found myself watching this movie and expecting it to have a climax , but it never came .
For those looking to just have a night of plot - less action and a few laughs , Knight and Day fits the bill .
Otherwise , skip the theater and wait for the DVD .
If you had unlimited funding , and were forced to own a car from the year that you were born , what would it be ?
For me , the year is 1982 .
As you may or may not remember , this was a black hole of automotive design , horsepower , handling , and overall driving excitement .
Luckily , one manufacturer did n’t care what the other guys were doing , and stuck to what they do best , building fantastic sports cars .
That company ’s name is Porsche .
The model that I would procure is the 930 , and I would obviously need it with the twin turbo ~300 horsepower engine .
Oddly enough , I found the exact one I want on eBay today !

So which car would you buy ?
When not knocking back gin martinis or sipping " Platform Heinekens " while waiting for the train home , Wired.com NY Bureau Chief John C Abell is quite the handyman .
Not only is he the Foursquare mayor of his local Home Depot , he has also put together the best iPad typing stand yet seen .
Professional to the last , Mr. Abell even took time to load up the Wired.com front page before knocking out this video clip .
The stand itself is made of a pair of " designer " steel doorstops , with rubber strips on top .
And that 's it .
As you can see , the doorstops , which are off - the - shelf items , are rock - solid when holding the iPad at the perfect angle for typing , but can also be scooped up and tossed in your bag where they 'll take up almost no space .
John was planning on somehow joining together the two wedges to save on readjusting their positions every time he set them down .
In the end I convinced him that portability was more important , and he conceded that I had made an " excellent point . "
Rubber doorstops would work just as well , of course , but the steel ones come in at just $ 6 for the pair , will last forever and will match the black - and - silver color scheme of the iPad .
The only problem is that they do n't appear to be in the online Home Depot store , so you 'll have to pay a visit to a real store .
But then , you own an iPad , so what fear could the outside world hold for you anyway ?

WASHINGTON --
The Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday sought to defuse the uproar over reports of senior agency staffers surfing porn sites during the economic collapse by noting the story is old news and that reforms have already been instituted .
The SEC was responding to a new report from SEC Inspector General David Kotz that revives the details of senior agency staffers spending hours surfing pornographic websites on government - issued computers while they were supposed to be policing the nation 's financial system .
SEC spokesman John Nester issued a written statement saying the memo by Kotz shows that every instance of inappropriate use of the Internet " was detected by the SEC 's own surveillance and referred to the inspector general .
" Each of the offending employees has been disciplined or is in the process of being disciplined .
Some have already been suspended or dismissed , " Nestor said .
" While any misuse of government resources is always a concern , since February we have further increased penalties .
We will not tolerate the transgressions of the very few who bring discredit to their thousands of hardworking colleagues . "
The memo comes at an inopportune time for the agency , which is already under suspicion by Republicans about the timing of the SEC 's lawsuit last week against Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs Group Inc .
News of the suit surfaced as the Senate prepared to take up a sweeping overhaul of the rules governing banks and other financial companies that has caused more partisan bickering .
The memo was written in response to a request from Republican Sen. Charles Grassley .
Rep. Darrell Issa , the top Republican on the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said it was " disturbing that high - ranking officials within the SEC were spending more time looking at porn than taking action to help stave off the events that put our nation 's economy on the brink of collapse . "
He said in a statement late Thursday that SEC officials " were preoccupied with other distractions " when they should have been overseeing the growing problems in the financial system .
The SEC 's inspector general conducted 33 probes of employees looking at explicit images in the past five years , according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press .
The memo says 31 of those probes occurred in the 2 1/ 2 years since the financial system teetered and nearly crashed .
The staffers ' behavior violated government - wide ethics rules , it says .
It summarizes past inspector general probes and reports some shocking findings :
-- A senior attorney at the SEC's Washington headquarters spent up to eight hours a day looking at and downloading pornography .
When he ran out of hard drive space , he burned the files to CDs or DVDs , which he kept in boxes around his office .
He agreed to resign , an earlier watchdog report said .
--
An accountant was blocked more than 16,000 times in a month from visiting websites classified as " Sex " or " Pornography . "
Yet he still managed to amass a collection of " very graphic " material on his hard drive by using Google images to bypass the SEC 's internal filter , according to an earlier report from the inspector general .
The accountant refused to testify in his defense , and received a 14 - day suspension .
-- Seventeen of the employees were " at a senior level , " earning salaries of up to $ 222,418 .
--
The number of cases jumped from two in 2007 to 16 in 2008 .
The cracks in the financial system emerged in mid-2007 and spread into full - blown panic by the fall of 2008 .
About 16 percent of men with Internet access at work admit to looking at online porn while at the office , according to a 2006 survey by Websense Inc .
Former SEC spokesman Michael Robinson said he shares the public 's outrage about SEC staffers who enjoyed porn on the taxpayers ' expense when they were supposed to be keeping the markets safe .
" That kind of behavior is just intolerable and atrocious , " said Robinson , now with Levick Strategic Communications .
He said he expects the head of the SEC , Mary Schapiro and her team , are " very focused on " the issue .
Schapiro has been parrying Republican complaints about the Goldman Sachs lawsuit , which agency officials hoped would mark a new era of tougher oversight of Wall Street .
They followed high - profile embarrassments including the failure to catch pyramid scheme kings Bernard Madoff and R. Allen Stanford .
Republican lawmakers also accused the SEC of being influenced by politics .
The SEC 's commissioners approved the Goldman charges on a rare 3 - 2 vote .
The two who objected were Republicans .
Schapiro is a registered independent who has been appointed by presidents of both parties .

The attack on private sector pensions is not new .
Private pensions in the U.S. and Canada have been eroding for over a quarter of a century .
In 1980 , some 40 percent of U.S. private sector workers and 35 percent in Canada had pension plans ; today the number is under 20 percent in the U.S. and about 25 percent in Canada .
At the same time , these pensions have steadily shifted from defined benefit plans ( guaranteed pension levels ) to defined contribution plans ( essentially savings plans that provide indeterminate benefits , shifting the risk to workers ) .
What is new is the self - assured aggressiveness of the corporate elite as they move to accelerate that erosion .
Speaking to a recent gathering of the U.S. corporate elite to address “ transformational change at a critical time in our nation ’s history ” and “ define America ’s future ” ( the heads of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Council of Chief Executives were also present ) a prominent U.S. leader offered a straightforward piece of advice : “ Eliminate the entitlement mentality that is so pervasive in today ’s American culture . ”
At the same time , but narrowing its focus to pensions , The Economist , and one of global capital ’s most prominent and influential magazines , provocatively lead with an editorial entitled “ The End of Retirement . ”
Referring back to Bismarck , the German Chancellor credited with introducing the first pension system in 1889 , the London - based editors proclaimed that “ Whether we like it or not we are going back to the pre-Bismarckian world where work had no formal stopping point . ” ( June 25 , 2009 ) .
For Bismarck , as for U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression , pensions had been a concession to workers , reluctantly made under pressures from below that were seen to threaten the legitimacy of capitalism ( pensions in Canada only came later , after World War II ) .
The promise of pensions was that , at least in the last years of their lives , workers might receive an income that allowed a degree of dignity that compensated for the dignity denied them during their working years .
This is , apparently , another promise that capitalism can “ no longer afford . ”
Beyond Private Pensions
It is hardly surprising that business recognized the current crisis as an opportunity to marginalize or end a benefit they ’d come to view as a barrier to future success .
With growth expected to remain sluggish even after the economic crisis ends , and with returns on the monies put into pension funds expected to be low and uncertain – and so requiring more current funding to meet future obligations – worker pensions were all the more identified as an expensive “ diversion ” from future investment and stockholder returns .
But more than corporate tactics were involved .
As the GM and Chrysler bankruptcies so dramatically highlighted – and business itself now readily admits – private sector pension plans suffer from a definitive contradiction : as an insurance plan , they depend on the survival of specific corporations while the world has changed so that even the viability of the largest corporations can no longer be taken for granted .
Yet crises represent opportunities for labour as well as business .
Rather than building on the discrediting of the private sector ’s ability to meet social needs and moving the argument for a universal public pension , unions and workers have themselves absorbed the erosion of private pensions , accepting dramatic cutbacks including the exclusion of future workers .
And faced with inferior pensions or no pensions at all , workers are increasingly themselves “ choosing ” to solve the problem individually through , in the U.S. , cashing in their 401 ( k ) plans ( their equivalent to Canadian Registered Retirement Savings Plans ( RRSP ) ) in order to pay for health insurance when unemployment took that away or , in both the U.S. and Canada , working past sixty - five .
By letting business off the hook in this way , this has essentially eased the pressures for reform , made business all the more confident in its demands , and left public sector workers increasingly isolated and vulnerable to seeing their pensions cut as well .
In this regard , it is crucial to emphasize that the prospect of a revised universal pension plan set at adequate levels is not a second - best option but the superior alternative .
Unlike the private option , it offers universal coverage and thereby provides a foundation for the larger solidarity we need for allour struggles .
The structure and levels of the benefits would depend on the vigour and priorities of the working class as a whole , not the strength or weakness of our separate employers .
With pensions not dependent on particular employers , the threat of competitiveness and unemployment would not be a vehicle for other concessions to save our pensions ( or concessions in pensions themselves so as to not lose them entirely ) .
And the social use of the substantive accumulated pensions funds , being in public hands , would be more open – though not automatically so – to democratic pressures .
Among the questions this raises is that of the transition to a public plan .
What happens to private plans in the interim ?
Do the workers covered by such plans just give up on the possibility of keeping their benefits ?
Or do they soldier on trying to hang on to what they can ?
Neither of these options gets to the heart of the problem – an appropriate economic and political transition to public pensions .
This would have to include private sector workers joining – if not leading – the struggle for public pensions while fighting to hold employers to as much account as possible for their pension obligations so that corporations will themselves have some self - interest in socializing pension costs .
( Another direction that takes us to a new integration of private and public plans , but may limit the goal of equality , would move corporate contributions into the more reliable existing public pension plan , the Canada Pension Plan . )
Choices
One critical point raised by The Economist directly challenges public as well as private plans – the demographic implications of living longer .
When the U.S. Social Security
Act , providing for retirement at age sixty - five was passed almost three quarters of a century ago , life expectancy was sixty - two .
A good many workers would therefore never see retirement , and of those that did , they would likely get a pension for only a few years .
So a public commitment to pensions seemed “ practical . ”
Today , however , with life expectancy in the early eighties , a person retiring at age sixty ( after forty years of work ) would draw a pension for a period ( twenty plus years ) equal to almost half their working life .
Is this still practical ?
Or is it now necessary to move to both increasing the retirement age substantially and reducing the annual pension income .
This is a real dilemma and it requires choices to be made .
But we should not be overwhelmed by the demographics .
Alongside the increase in life expectancy since the 1930s has come a remarkable increase in productivity – real output per hour has increased some six - fold .
The choices to be made do therefore not revolve around whether we ’re rich enough to afford retirement , but the extent to which we value freedom from work over consumption , the form that freedom from work might take , and – above all – how society ’s wealth is distributed ( i.e. these issues ca n’t be abstracted from questions of power ) .
In regards to the last point , whatever choices are made , a central principle must be that they do not become another vehicle for reinforcing inequality .
A measure of equity should be introduced at least during the last years of people ’s lives and this means structuring pensions so that pension levels would be heavily weighted toward a universal guarantee rather than being linked to income .
Here is one example of such an alternative structure built on the current public pension system .
Canadian public pensions now consist of two parts : the Canada Pension Plan ( CPP ) which is based on 20 percent of earnings up to the current national average ; and Old Age Security ( OAS ) which provides an amount independent of income ( about 15 percent of the average per capita income ) .
If the CPP were left as is and the OAS set at three quarters the average income , then :
Someone who lived their life in poverty with no income would get a pension of 75 percentage the average income rather than 15 percent of that average ;
Someone who toiled at half the average income would get a pension of some 87 percent of the average income ;
Someone who had earned an average income would get a retirement income equal to their pre-retirement income .
This would represent the maximum public pension .
For a unionized worker who earned 50 percent above the average , this would mean a pension of two - thirds their former income ) .
The funding of such a plan would be generated through progressive taxes – including wealth taxes to limit the reproduction of inequalities into future generations but also including taxes on all of us ( this could not be financed by only taxing the rich ) .
It may also be that we might prefer to move toward phased retirement rather than the abrupt change retirement has come to mean .
For example , rather than retiring at sixty - five , workers might go on shorter work time at age sixty – a four day week for three years then a three day week for two years , the time off partially supplemented by the pension fund – and thereby more gradually adjust themselves to a new life .
A more fundamental question remains : if we are going to take time off equivalent to half our working life , should this be entirely concentrated at the end of our lives or should we take a significant portion of that paid time off during our working years ?
The case against putting it all into retirement – over and above the possibility of dying and losing the banked time – begins with the fact that to postpone all benefits until retirement is to essentially give up the struggle to change the everyday and greater part of our lives .
There is something deeply disconcerting , if not tragic , about not sharing in the productivity of society during our youth and middle age in the hope of compensating for those lost years in old age ( a version of suffering on earth for a reward in heaven ) .
Moreover , that very trade - off weakens us collectively and so makes the possibility of decent future pensions less , not more likely .
With workers accepting current degradations and families working such long hours , where will the self - respect and collective will – and the time – come from to generate the struggle for better pensions ?
And does n’t the present moment warn that decent pensions , even where achieved , ca n’t be sustained absent struggles around a broad range of immediate issues ?
Next Steps
The labour movement needs to be as clear about what it is up against as business has been in launching its assault on worker rights and benefits .
To that end , it must combine fights for immediate needs with building the collective capacities – the class power – to expand future possibilities .
To that end , we might begin by :
Moving toward some internal consensus that the redistribution of work - time is a top priority for the labour movement – the next great arena for struggle and gains , and the kind of priority around which our movement can be rebuilt as a social movement .
Within that focus , we need to initiate the widest discussions around the relative merits of gaining greater access and flexibility over our work time during our working lives versus at the end of our lives ( for many workers – such as part - timers – the problem may , however , be not enough work time and this adds to the importance of thinking in terms of the “ redistribution ” of work time rather than just “ fewer hours ” ) .
Rather than waiting for the government to come up with some modifications in pensions , the labour movement – in consultation with its base and with other movements – should confidently frame and develop its own detailed alternative pension plan , including the age of retirement , early retirement options , pension levels , flexible options and funding .
( See CLC Proposal in this issue of CD . )
On this basis labour and its allies can initiate an educational and mobilizing campaign to ensure that no politician , nor business as a class , can ignore our issues .
The issue of pensions is too large to be separated from broader issues of power that will sooner or later emerge .
This is particularly the case in regards to the social role of private finance , the issue underlying the current economic crisis .
Though moving to a public plan will not eliminate private finance – governments , barring a much more radical socialization of finance , will still continue to operate through financial markets – public pensions will limit the dominance of private finance and its scope for profits ( and in the process , leave finance very wary about where this might go next ) .
And so we will ultimately have to confront the question so far avoided in this crisis :
How to eliminate the power private finance has over our lives and replace it with finance as a democratic public utility – rather than just trying to technically “ fix ” it so “ normal ” life can continue .

In a surprise decision Tuesday morning , the United States Supreme Court vacated an earlier ruling by a lower court in the case of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman , who was convicted of bribery and honest services fraud in 2006 in a case that has widely been criticized as politically motivated .
The ruling was vacated in light of a ruling last week in the case of former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling which partially struck down the so - called “ honest services ” fraud statute .
On the heels of that decision , the Supreme Court issued a surprise ruling in the Siegelman case on Tuesday morning :
ADVERTISEMENT
09 -182
SCRUSHY , RICHARD
SIEGELMAN , DON E. V. UNITED STATES
The petitions for writs of certiorari are granted .
The
judgment is vacated , and the cases are remanded to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for further
consideration in light of Skilling v. United States , 561 U.S .
___ ( 2010 ) .
Siegelman ’s attorney for the Supreme Court appeal , Sam Heldman , told Raw Story , “ We are very pleased with the Court ’s ruling .
This is an important step towards a complete victory for Governor Siegelman . ”
Siegelman ’s case will now be remanded back to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for a second consideration .
It does n’t mean , however , that Siegelman is out of the woods .
In March 2009 , the Eleventh Circuit upheld bribery , conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges against Siegelman and refused a request for a new trial .
They could easily do so again .
In what many have alleged was a politically - motivated prosecution orchestrated from the top echelons of the Republican PartyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s power structure , Siegelman , a Democrat , was convicted in 2006 of selling a seat on an Alabama hospital regulatory board for $ 500,000 to former HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy , by way of donations to a 1999 Siegelman sponsored state lottery campaign , for which Siegelman received no profit and no campaign financing .

The case has come under public scrutiny because of allegations that former Bush White House Deputy Chief of Staff , Karl Rove , was behind the prosecutions for political motives .
Leura Canary , the US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama and who prosecuted Siegelman is married to RoveÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s long - time friend and business partner William Canary .
Siegelman ’s gubernatorial opponent at the time of his indictment , Bob Riley , had hired William Canary as a campaign advisor .
Rove , who was subpoenaed three times by the House Judiciary Committee as part of their investigation into the Siegelman case , failed to show for each of the hearings and only agreed to testify on the condition that he be not under oath and not in public , which the Judiciary granted .
In March 2009 , a three - judge panel from the 11th Circuit Court reversed two out of the seven charges of corruption and bribery relating to SiegelmanÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s conviction .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Supreme Court decision today vacates the Circuit Court ’s ruling and remands the case back to them to reconsider in light of last Thursday ’s ruling in the Skilling case .
Scott Horton , Columbia University law professor and contributor to Harper ’s is not surprised by today ’s ruling , telling Raw Story early this morning that if the Circuit Court approaches the Siegelman case fairly , they will vacate the conviction entirely .
ADVERTISEMENT
‘ This is not surprising , indeed , it ’s the outcome I anticipated , ” wrote Horton in an email Tuesday morning .
“ The Supreme Court ’s majority allowed honest services fraud to continue on seriously narrowed grounds , basically reduced to clear cases of bribery , while a powerful minority wants to strike it altogether expressing sharp dissatisfaction with the Justice Department ’s management of honest - services fraud , particularly in ‘ political ’ cases , ” he added .
“ The Eleventh Circuit should now apply this to the Siegelman case .
If they do so fairly , the Siegelman case is over .
Moreover , the Justice Department should read the Skilling decision carefully .
If they do and follow the spirit of the ruling , they will simply abandon the Siegelman case , which they should have done long ago . ”

A spectacular new image taken by astronauts on the International Space Station shows the various layers of Earth 's atmosphere duringsunset over the Indian Ocean .
A brilliant sequence of colors in the image denotes each ofthe layers of Earth 's atmosphere , which are visible here because the picturewas taken while the space station hadan edge - on , or limb , view of the Earth .
From this vantage point , the Earth ' scurvature can also be made out .
The troposphere ?
the lowest layer of Earth 's atmosphere and the one in which humans dwell and weather occurs ?
appears in deep oranges andyellows .
The troposphere can extend from the planet 's surface to a heightbetween 3.5 to 12.5 miles ( 6 and 20 km ) .
This lowest layer contains more than 80 percent of the massof the atmosphere and almost all of the water vapor , clouds , and precipitation .
Several dark cloud layers are visible within this layer inthe image .
Variations in the colors are due mainly to varying concentrations ofeither cloudsor aerosols ( airborne particles or droplets ) .
Next up is the stratosphere , which appears as a pink towhite region above the clouds .
This atmospheric layer generally has little orno clouds and extends up to approximately 30 miles ( 50 km ) above the Earth ? ssurface .
The stratosphere is also home to the layerof ozone that protects the Earth 's surface and the creatures that live onit from the sun 's harmful ultraviolet rays .

( CNN ) -- BP reported problems controlling the undersea well at the heart of the largest oil spill in U.S. history and won a delay in testing a critical piece of equipment in March , according to documents released Sunday .
" We are in the midst of a well control situation on MC 252 #001 and have stuck pipe .
We are bringing out equipment to begin operations to sever the drillpipe , plugback the well and bypass , " Scherie Douglas , a BP regulatory advisor , told the district engineer for the U.S. Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service in a March 10 e-mail .
In a follow - up e-mail to the district engineer , Frank Patton , Douglas reported the company wanted to get a plug set in the well before testing the blowout preventer , the massive device used to shut down the well in case of an emergency .
" With the give and take of the well and hole behavior we would feel much more comfortable getting at least one of the two plugs set in order to fully secure the well prior to testing BOPs , " she wrote .
When Patton told BP he could not delay a test any longer than it took to bring the well under control , the company won a postponement from David Trocquet , the MMS district manager in New Orleans , Louisiana , the documents show .
Trocquet ordered BP to make sure its cement plug was set up and to verify its placement , according to his reply .
The messages do not indicate how long the test was postponed .
The exchange was among the documents released Sunday by leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , which is looking into the disaster that killed 11 workers aboard the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon and uncapped a gusher that is now fouling the northern Gulf of Mexico .
BP has been unable to activate the well 's blowout preventer since the explosion , resulting in up to 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) spewing into the Gulf every day .
Appearing on ABC's " This Week , " BP Managing Director Bob Dudley said those questions are being addressed by an investigation led by the Coast Guard and the MMS , which oversees offshore oil drilling .
BP , rig owner Transocean Ltd. and oilfield services company Halliburton have blamed each other for the disaster
" There were issues of well control , signs out there , and there are strict procedures that are written , " Dudley said .
Those procedures allow the rig owner " to walk through well control , " he said .
" That 's what the investigation will take minute by minute , " he said .
But he said the failure of the well 's blowout preventer is a " very troubling " issue that will have repercussions throughout the oil industry .
" It is the piece of equipment that is not expected to fail , and that 's going to have implications for everyone around the world , " Dudley said .
BP 's design of the well has also come under scrutiny in the New Orleans hearings held by MMS and the Coast Guard .
BP drilling engineer Mark Hafle testified Friday that he made " several changes to the casing designs " to address problems with the well 's cement walls and leaking drilling fluid .
But he said the problems had been addressed .
" No one believed there was going to be a safety issue with pumping that cement job , " he said .
Halliburton performed the cementing work on the well , and Halliburton worker Christopher Haire told the New Orleans hearings Friday that BP kept changing the dimensions of the well 's casing .
Meanwhile , BP 's investigation " raised concerns about the maintenance history , modification , inspection , and testing " of the blowout preventer , committee chairman Henry Waxman , D - California , reported earlier this month .
The New York Times reported Sunday that BP documents indicated the company had " serious problems and safety concerns " with the rig's well casing and blowout preventer for months .
Rep. Ed Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat who leads an Energy and Commerce subcommittee , said he has seen documents that confirm the Times report .
Other witnesses at congressional hearings into the spill have raised concerns as well .
Stephen Stone , a laborer on the doomed rig , told the House Judiciary Committee last week that the Transocean crew had to stop drilling four times in the space of 20 days because of the loss of drilling " mud " -- " either because the underground formation was unstable , or because drilling too quickly caused the formation to crack , " he said .
And Doug Brown , the rig's chief mechanic , told the Judiciary Committee that cuts to Deepwater Horizon 's engineering staff left the crew with a backlog of preventive maintenance to perform .
When they complained , he said , " We were always told , ' We will see what we can do . ' "

As lawmakers make plans to leave Congress , so do their aides .
Despite pledges by congressional leaders to cut ties between Capitol Hill and special interests , some former congressional staffers are moving swiftly into lobbying posts , federal records show .
Rules instituted in 2007 in the wake of lobbying scandals bar former senior House staffers from lobbying their former bosses and co-workers for a year .
High - ranking ex-Senate aides cannot lobby anyone in the Senate for a year .
But nothing stops former congressional aides from immediately advising clients on the topics with which they are intimately familiar , such as the financial regulation bill now moving through the Senate .
They also are free to lobby officials in the executive branch or in the legislative chamber in which they were not previously employed .
" Public service now — especially for congressional staffers — clearly has become viewed largely as a road to riches , " said Craig Holman , of Public Citizen , a government watchdog group .
A total of 149 former members of Congress were registered to lobby in 2009 , according to data compiled by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics .
Similar figures are not available for former staffers .
However , a 2006 examination by National Journal found that 107 of 635 top - salaried aides who worked in Congress from October 2003 through March 2004 — or nearly 17 % — had taken lobbying or government - relations jobs .
Among the former aides to departing members of Congress working in government affairs : • Vickie Walling , who served as chief of staff to retiring Rep. John Tanner , has begun work as managing director for Prime Policy Group .
The lobbying firm 's website boasts that 54 Senate and House members " have staff alumni at our firm . "
Walling 's lobbying clients include the American Psychological Association and drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline , both of which sought to shape health - care legislation that passed Congress recently , lobbying reports show .
Tanner , a Tennessee Democrat who in December said he would retire at the end of this term , is a long - time member of the Ways and Means Committee that helped craft the legislation .
Walling said there 's nothing " nefarious " about her work .
" I think if you approached your job on Capitol Hill in an ethical manner that you are going to continue to approach your job on the outside in an ethical manner . "
• Julie Jolly , a legislative assistant to retiring Sen. Kit Bond , R - Mo. , and a leading Senate appropriator , recently joined Lewis - Burke Associates , a Washington lobbying firm .
The firm 's clients include universities and research institutions .
She did not respond to interview requests .
• Jay McCarthy was a senior adviser to Sen. Edward Kennedy , D - Mass. , who died in office in 2009 .
McCarthy also worked for Kennedy 's appointed successor , Paul Kirk , who left office in February .
Now , McCarthy is a lobbyist with the Liberty Square Group , and his clients include a coalition of Massachusetts - based biotech companies ; a policy institute named for Kennedy ; and an environmental group that opposes plans to build an offshore wind farm in Nantucket Sound , records show .
McCarthy did not return phone calls .
Earlier this year , Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , criticized a former committee aide , Peter Roberson , for joining an industry lobbying group after working on a sweeping financial regulation bill .
Roberson went to IntercontinentalExchange , a clearinghouse for derivatives , which would be subject to regulation under legislation now in Congress .
" It never occurred to me that he would jump so quickly from the committee staff to an industry that was being affected by the committee 's legislation , " Frank said in a statement .
He banned aides from communicating with Roberson for the remainder of his committee chairmanship .
Intercontinental spokesman Lee Underwood declined comment and said the firm would not make Roberson available for interviews .
Sen. Michael Bennet , D - Colo. , recently introduced legislation that would impose a lifetime ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and would increase the cooling - off period for congressional staffers to six years before they can lobby .
" There is a perception … that people are trading on relationships , " Bennet said in an interview .
Dave Wenhold , president of the American League of Lobbyists , said it 's unlikely many lawmakers would support a bill that limits their future employment .
" The bottom line is that you hire people with expertise , " Wenhold said of lobbying firms .
" The people who come off the Hill know the political process . "

The social psychology of linguistic naming and shaming
There 's something stirring in the online New Media sections of the world 's newspapers .
At the New York Times , Dick Cavett 's inaugural blog post " It 's only language " now has 761 comments .
And across the Atlantic , on the Telegraph's web site , readers have devoted more than 1,270 comments to ( as Christopher Howse put it yesterday )
... naming and shaming some of the most irritating phrases to have insinuated themselves into the English language .
( " What is the most annoying phrase in the English language ? " , 2/23/2007 )
Looking around quickly on the web sites of those two newspapers , I do n't see any non-linguistic discussions that are generating as many comments as these are .
For example , on the Telegraph Speakers ' Corner site , " Is the Anglican Church obsessed with sex ? " has gotten 44 responses ; " Who were the real winners and losers at the Oscars ? " has gotten 35 ; " Should Prince Harry be sent to Iraq ? " has gotten 205 ; " What would a world without America be like ? " has gotten 232 .
Since I have n't done a systematic survey , let 's just say that the reader interest in linguistic matters is strikingly large .
Of course , the theme of this flood of linguistic interest is mostly griping .
Some of the items in this gripefest just list words , phrases , pronunciations or structures that readers find annoying ; but in many cases , a guilty group is also named : politicians , rugby commentators , Americans , Californians , BBC announcers , South Africans , the youth of today , estate agents , footballers , the military , management , and train attendants , among others .
Contributions often cite or imply one of a few standard reasons for being annoyed : overuse , redundancy , inconsistency , novelty , and failure to observe an allegedly traditional distinction .
There 's a topic here for a social psychologist or a sociologist , I think .
I 'm neither one , but here 's how it looks to me .
Social annoyance and public griping reinforce one another .
By social annoyance I mean a distaste for the way someone looks or acts that sees its object as an instance of a type .
Someone 's appearance or behavior gets under your skin , and it's not just that particular person , it 's the whole class of people who look like that or act like that .
And usually it 's not just a random set of people , it 's kids today , or jocks , or German tourists , or 30 - something suburban women in Hummers , or those people who hang out with so - and - so .
You associate the irritant with some salient combination of social features : race , ethnicity , age , sex , class , location , occupation , clique .
By public griping I mean the process of sharing your annoyance with a sympathetic group .
You might trade anecdotes around the coffee machine or the dinner table , or write a letter to the editor .
People enjoy listening in groups to skillful expressions of social annoyance , and so stand - up comedians do a lot of this .
Cartoons and newspaper columns often express similar feelings , and allow you to join in by putting a clipping or printout up on your refrigerator or your office door .
These days , you might send a copy to your friends by email , or chime in on your weblog .
In some places and times , linguists might have been presiding over the speech and language sessions of this ritual reinforcement of group identity .
But these days , our reaction is generally to observe that most of the gripes are arbitrary and many of the explanations are false .
For example , one of the hundreds of word - usage gripes on the Telegraph 's site is :
Our house was robbed instead of burgled .
Only people can be robbed .
Sez who ?
Not the OED , which gives sense 3.a. as " To plunder , pillage , rifle ( a place , house , etc. ) " and cites examples from 1230 forwards that include Shakespeare and Macaulay :
c1230 Hali Meid . 15 Wes helle irobbed , & heuene beð ifulled .
1599 SHAKES .
Hen .
V , III .
vi. 106
One that is like to be executed for robbing a Church .
1855 MACAULAY Hist . Eng. xii .
III .
221 In the country his house was robbed .
Another gripe , typical of the type that claims logic as its basis :
One in particular is
AT ABOUT
As in at about 1030 pm
It is surely either
at 1030 pm or about 1030 pm .
How can it be both at the same time .
But at about is listed in the OED as a sequence of prepositions meaning " at approximately " -- a useful and not intrinsically inconsistent concept -- with citations from eminent authors over the centuries :
a 1882 TROLLOPE Autobiogr . ( 1883 ) I. ix .
214 , I have been paid at about that rate .
1915 V. WOOLF Voyage Out iii. 37
At about that hour he reappeared .
1929 D. H. LAWRENCE
Paintings sig .
B1r , At about the time of our Elizabethans .
1945 E. WAUGH Bridesh .
Rev. II . v. 272
My divorce case ..was due to be heard at about the same time .
We can take it back a bit further with a quotation from Jane Austen 's Northanger Abbey ( 1818 ) :
At about half past twelve , a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window , and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being two open carriages at the door , in the first only a servant , her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second , before John Thorpe came running .
This kind of gripe - debunking could go on for a long time , but it 's really beside the point .
Linguistic sins , real or imaginary , are not really what 's driving this process .
And the original emotion of irritation , though sometimes expressed in colorful displays of ( mock ? ) disgust and anger , is also secondary , I think .
The real key is the public ritual that Christopher Howse called " naming and shaming " , which helps the group to converge on a set of norms .
( While giving everyone a good deal of pleasure along the way , apparently . )
As we gripe - debunkers relentlessly demonstrate , these are n't the usual norms of linguistic usage .
They 're not even the norms of the standard language or the norms of elite users .
These days , those accused of offending against these odd , artificial norms are as likely to be high - status people -- politicians , business managers , journalists -- as members of ( linguistically ) lower - status groups -- blacks , young people , Americans , athletes .
Often there 's a political dimension , though it 's rarely as explicit and hostile as it is in this example from the Telegraph :
The current expression which causes great irritation is " Carbon Footprint " .
Should anyone of those namby pamby , nerdy , mummy 's boys ( known as greens ) utter that expression in my presence it would give me great pleasure to plant a large Carbon bunch of fives up his mandibles .
( if you will forgive an earlier expression )
While social annoyance is sometimes an original emotion , public griping reinforces it and in many cases creates it out of nothing .
This is especially true for the linguistic forms of this process .
Sentence - initial however , for example , annoys many people who would never have noticed it if they had n't been trained to do so by the public griping about this alleged abuse that Will Strunk started a hundred years ago .
( See " The evolution of disornamentation " , 2/21/2005 ; " Fossilized prejudices about ' however ' " , 2/22/2005 , " If they do it too much , they should be told not to do it at all " , 10/31/2006 for details . )
Arnold Zwicky has observed ( " Tolerating variation , or not " , 2/24/2007 ) ,
I 'm often puzzled why some usages get such opprobrium ( in the face of the actual practice of good writers ) while others go unnoticed and uncommented on .
Recently , I 've been looking at preposition + of ( out / outside / inside / alongside / off of ) versus plain preposition ( I intend to post on this eventually ) ; many usage advisers are hostile to the versions with of : the of is said to be " superfluous " ( Omit Needless Words ! ) ; the usage is ( in most cases , incorrectly ) labeled " colloquial " , or even " non-standard " ; it 's believed to be more recent than the alternative ( the of has been , inexplicably , added ) ; and it 's less frequent than the alternative .
Meanwhile , nobody seems to pay any attention to except for vs. plain except ( " Nobody talked , except ( for ) Kim " ) , though you could try to mount a case against this for similar to the case against of .
Once a proscription -- even a silly one , like Dryden 's Rule , banning stranded prepositions -- is in the marketplace , it tends to persist .
But where do the proscriptions come from ?
Here , there 's an enormous amount of randomness : somebody in the usage community happens to notice something that offends him ( it 's almost always a man ) in some way -- often because he views it as colloquial or innovative or regional or used by the wrong sort of people , occasionally because that 's not the way you do things in Latin -- and writes or teaches about it .
We then end up with a collection of personal quirks and accidents of history , a big grab - bag of assorted stuff .
Speaker - oriented hopefully gets excoriated , while speaker - oriented frankly and so on get a free pass .
Sentence - initial linking however is judged to be poor style , while sentence - initial linking consequently and so on escape the red pencil .
I could go on like this for quite some time .
There 's has always been a sort of black market in populist usage peeves .
Thus Arnold has shown elsewhere ( " However , ... " 11/1/2206 ) that the " No Initial Coordinators " rule ( NIC ) has become widely accepted and taught without even the crankiest and most idiosyncratic of language mavens ever having preached it :
Mark notes that the AHD note for and rejects NIC out of hand , and he provides a smorgasbord of cites ( and statistics ) from reputable authors .
Similarly MWDEU .
Paul Brians , collector of common errors in English , labels sentence - initial coordinators a " non-error " .
Bryan Garner denies , all over the place , that NIC has any validity .
Even the curmudgeonly Robert Hartwell
Fiske tells his readers that there 's absolutely nothing wrong with sentence - initial coordinators .
A point of usage and style on which Liberman and I and the AHD and the MWDEU stand together with Brians and Garner and Fiske ( and dozens of other advice writers ) is , truly , not a disputed point .
NIC is crap .
But still it lives on , as what I 've called a zombie rule .
It 's been lurking in the grammatical shadows for some time -- at least a hundred years , to judge from MWDEU .
Hardly any usage manual subscribes to it , but it is , apparently , widely taught in schools , at least in the U.S. , with the result that educated people tend to be nagged by a feeling that there is something bad about sentence - initial and ( and but and so ) .
( It might well be that this sense of unease rises with level of education .
Someone should look at this possibility . )
The internet has made it possible for this populist ferment to emerge in widely - read group gripe sessions , like the one organized and summarized on the Telegraph 's site by Christopher Howse , or the flood of comments on Dick Cavett 's first NYT blog post , or the many web forums where usage debates have been taking place for some time .
Will this result in an explosion of pet peeves enshrined as artificial linguistic norms , an epidemic of what I once called the " infectious form of obsessive - compulsive disorder " afflicting some sectors of the usage industry ?
Or will lowering barriers to entry , and flooding the market with usage gripes , cause the whole industry to crash ?
Or will language mavens and their audience find some unanticipated new equilibrium ?
Although people have been worried about correct speech for thousands of years , it 's apparently the status anxieties of modern societies that create the market for usage advice in which artificial " rules " can spring up and spread , independent of the genuine norms of speaking and writing .
But the cycle of social annoyance and public griping seems much older and more fundamental .
As the internet turns up the gain on this paleolithic social feedback loop , will something new arise ?

WASHINGTON — Elena Kagan deflected questions about her own views on gun rights and abortion during her Supreme Court confirmation hearings on Tuesday , instead describing Supreme Court precedents .
She declined to say whether terrorism suspects must be warned of the right to remain silent , saying the issue was “ quite likely to get to the courts . ”
And Ms. Kagan , the solicitor general and former dean of Harvard Law School , refused to say whether the Supreme Court was correct to take on the 2000 case of Bush v. Gore , telling senators that the issue of when the court should intervene in disputed elections is “ an important and difficult question ” but one that could come before her should she be confirmed .
Ms. Kagan ’s responses , during a long and sometimes tense day of parrying with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee , were similar to those of Supreme Court nominees past .
But unlike her predecessors , Ms. Kagan wrote a 1995 article calling for judicial nominees to be more forthcoming .
On Tuesday , minutes into her testimony , she backpedaled , saying she now believed it would be inappropriate even to answer questions that might “ provide some kind of hints ” about her views on matters of legal controversy .
“ I think that that was wrong , ” she said .
“ I think that — in particular , that it would n’t be appropriate for me to talk about what I think about past cases — you know , to grade cases — because those cases themselves might again come before the court . ”
AMMAN , Jordan —
As European country after European country banned Muslims from wearing the burqa , niqab or other Islamic clothing that covers a woman ’s face completely , several Arab nations stood quietly by .
Few , if any , Arabs support such bans and the prohibitions raise questions among them about anti-Muslim sentiment in the West .
However , many people in Jordan can at least understand where European countries are coming from , especially regarding security concerns .
In most cases , European politicians in support of banning complete facial covering avoided making religious arguments , instead arguing that clothing of any kind that hid a person ’s face constituted a security threat .
“ It ’s understandable why some countries are not too happy with the niqab because it does not reveal the true identity of a person , the face of a person .
Now whether this should be introduced as a law or not , I ’m not sure , ” said Moneef Zou ’bi , director general of the Islamic World Academy of Science in Amman .
“ I think it ’s a matter of choice at the end of the day . ”
In France , the most recent country to ban the niqab and burqa , Jean - François Cope , the majority leader of the French National Assembly , went so far as to compare the niqab to a ski mask in an editorial piece published in The New York Times in which he defended the law .
“ The visibility of the face in the public sphere has always been a public safety requirement .
It was so obvious that until now it did not need to be enshrined in law , ” he wrote .
“ But the increase in women wearing the niqab , like that of the ski mask favored by criminals , changes that .
We must therefore adjust our law , without waiting for the phenomenon to spread . ”
Though accepted by most Arabs , the niqab and burqa are still relatively uncommon outside the Arabian Gulf .
Most Arab women tend to view such coverings as too extreme or unnecessary .
In Jordan , where only a handful of women wear such clothing , police have noted a sharp increase in the amount of crime committed by people , sometimes even men , wearing the niqab as a disguise .
The number of criminals apprehended while wearing such Islamic dress climbed from a combined total of 170 in 2007 and 2008 to 104 in 2009 alone , according to police officials .
Though there were a few cases of homicide , most of the incidents involved theft or other petty crimes .
Still few Jordanians are ready to jump to the conclusions of right - wing European politicians or take legal action against the facial covering .
“ Most of the people are not concerned about it .
In general we accept that sector of our society .
It is not a masking behavior to cover your face , ” said Hani Hourani , the founder and director of Al - Urdun Al - Jadid Research Center in Amman .
“ We have a lot more important things to worry about in this part of the world than women ’s code of dress . ”
Aside from France , Belgium banned facial coverings last month .
In Germany , Italy , Switzerland and the Netherlands , there are also laws regulating full facial covering at the local level or right - wing politicians who strongly advocate for it .
Referencing the 1966 film about the French fighting the Algerian insurgency in which veiled women are used to smuggle weapons , Jennifer Heath said : “ This is like someone has figured out that we can get rid of the niqab by sort of pretending it ’s going to be the Battle of Algiers again .
I find it a little sensationalist . ”
Heath edited " The Veil : Women Writers On Its History , Lore , And Politics , " a collection of essays about veiling .
Still , during the peak of the insurgency in Iraq , the niqab became a serious issue .
Many women were not thoroughly searched at checkpoints , so militants began recruiting them for suicide bombings or to smuggle weapons under their clothes .
Authorities in turn began creating female police officers and a community policing organization called the Daughters of Iraq was also created to search women at checkpoints .
Most Jordanians agree that female police and normal security measures are enough to stop the niqab from becoming a serious security issue here and elsewhere in the region .
“ We need a combination of freedom of religion , freedom of expression , personal freedoms on one hand and [ on the other ] the necessary measures for security and the normal appearance of a person in society , ” said Asma Khader , general coordinator for the Sister is Global Institute in Jordan .
She added that measures designed to limit the wearing of the niqab or other forms of dress would most likely result in more people wearing them as a form of protest , as they might start to feel that their beliefs were under attack .
“ It will be a symbolic political use , rather than being a personal choice or a personal religious belief .
It should not be this way , ” she said .
Though some Catholics saw room in that language for admitting celibate gay men , the Vatican followed up in 2008 with a clarification .
“ It is not enough to be sure that he is capable of abstaining from genital activity , ” ruled the Vatican ’s Congregation for Catholic Education , which issued the initial guidelines .
“ It is also necessary to evaluate his sexual orientation . ”

The screenings could be “ very intrusive , ” said Msgr. Stephen Rossetti of Catholic University .

Some seminary directors were baffled by the word “ orientation , ” said Thomas G. Plante , a psychologist and the director of the Spirituality and Health Institute at Santa Clara University , who screens seminary candidates for several dioceses in California and nationwide .
Could a psychologically mature gay person , committed to celibacy , never become a priest ?
Dr. Plante said several admissions officers asked .
Could the church afford to turn away good candidates in the midst of a critical priest shortage ?
The Vatican permits every bishop and leader of a religious order to make those decisions , which vary from stricter to more liberal interpretations of the rules .
But the methods of reaching them have become increasingly standard , experts say .
Msgr. Stephen Rossetti , a psychologist at Catholic University who has screened seminarians and once headed a treatment center for abusive priests , said the screening could be “ very intrusive . ”
But he added , “ We are looking for two basic qualities : the absence of pathology and the presence of health . ”
To that end , most candidates are likely to be asked not only about past sexual activities but also about masturbation fantasies , consumption of alcohol , relationships with parents and the causes of romantic breakups .
All must take H.I.V. tests and complete written exams like the 567 - question Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory , which screens for , among other things , depression , paranoia and gender confusion .
In another test , candidates must submit sketches of anatomically correct human figures .
In interviews by psychologists  who are usually selected because they are Catholic therapists with religious views matching those of the local church leadership  candidates are also likely to be asked about their strategies for managing sexual desire .
If you ’re a small business owner , you probably do n’t need all the bells and whistles of a full - fledged customer relationship management ( CRM ) application , but you still do need a solid platform from which to automate common business tasks such as managing materials and generating invoices , ideally at little cost .
Linux and KDE make a great free platform , and Kraft makes a great application for businesses like handicrafters and web designers .
German developer Klaas Freitag says Kraft is aimed at small companies , driven by a boss and maybe a few people .
He started working on the software in 2005 after having worked on similar applications for many years .
He says , “ The KDE platform under C++ is the most effective platform to build native GUI applications I have ever worked with , and KDE has a strong , friendly , open , and helpful community that ’s fun to work in . ”
Freitag recently moved Kraft to KDE 4 .
“ Migrating from KDE 3 to KDE 4 is hard work because a lot of APIs and concepts have changed , ” he says , “ which requires rewrites of code .
On the other hand one gets so much functionality for free .
KDE 4 is a very up - to - date , stable , and fast platform , so all the work pays off . ”
The migration was a big task , so Freitag has n’t yet begun to think about additional program enhancements , but “ I will start to think about that soon .
Kraft is a member of the KDE Financial Apps working group , which met in Frankfurt last month .
I plan to come up with a roadmap based on some of our discussions .
I ’d like to make releases two or three times a year roughly . ”
Kraft is not a solo effort .
“ We really lack good , task - oriented documentation that helps people solve problems like ‘ How do I write an invoice ? ’ , so writers are welcome .
Coders of course as well , because we still have a long way to go to implement everything that might be useful for this kind of software .
Last but not least we like users who test and give feedback about bugs . ”

" You are your brain , " insists Baylor University neuroscientist and best - selling writer David Eagleman .
It 's an insight that he argues should radically transform all aspects of our criminal justice system , from how laws are written to how punishments are levied to how juries are selected .
Reporting back from the bleeding edge of brain research , Eagleman takes viewers on a tour of the latest technological insights into how humans make decisions and whether free will exists anywhere but the pages of philosophy books .
The findings do n't exculpate individuals from responsiibility for their actions , the libertarian author of Sum : 40 Tales From The Afterlives says , but they certainly complicate things .
And they help to explain why governments double or triple down on failed policies such as drug prohibition .

This strange fish is named Macropinna microstoma .
A deep - sea fish with a transparent head and tubular eyes .
When filming his critically acclaimed documentary Waterworld , Kevin Costner became interested in cost - effective technologies for separating oil from water ( such as in the aftermath of an oil spill ) .
Today , he appeared in front of a House committee to drum up interest in the oil - water separator he 's been developing over the years in partnership with Louisiana 's Ocean Therapy Solutions .
It is claimed that the device can process some two - hundred gallons of water a minute , using a centrifuge processing technology that sucks in polluted water , separates the oil , and stores it in a tanker before sending the water itself ( now some 99.9 percent purified ) back into the gulf .
( A company called Enviro Voraxial has a machine that relies on a different technology to process some 500 gallons per minute , which BP is also looking into . )
BP has reportedly ordered thirty - two of Costner 's machines for testing , although it will be a matter of time before it 's determined whether they do the job safely enough to aid in the gulf clean - up effort .
What can we say ?
Our man 's come along way since he starred in Sizzle Beach , USA .
Initial estimates had the amount of oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico at 25,000 barrels a day .
This clip , made using the same engine that powers many of today 's biggest games , shows how much oil that really is .
And that 's only 25,000 .
When you consider that , a few months later , the best guess is that the total is at least twice that amount , things get really scary .

Academic disputes usually flare out in the safety of obscure journals , raising no more than a few tempers , if not voices .
But a paper published this week by the American Psychological Association has managed to raise questions of censorship , academic fraud , fair play and criminal sentencing — and all them well before the report ever became public .
The paper is a critique of a rating scale that is widely used in criminal courts to determine whether a person is a psychopath and likely to commit acts of violence .
It was accepted for publication in a psychological journal in 2007 , but the inventor of the rating scale saw a draft and threatened a lawsuit if it was published , setting in motion a stultifying series of reviews , revisions and legal correspondence .
“ This has been a really , really troubling process from the beginning , ” said Scott O. Lilienfeld , a psychologist at Emory University and a collaborator with one of the paper ’s authors .
“ It has people wondering , ‘ Do I have to worry every time I publish a paper that criticizes someone that I ’ll get slapped with a lawsuit ? ’ ” The delay in publication , he said , “ sets a very dangerous precedent ” and censors scientific discourse .
The inventor of the clinical test , Robert D. Hare , an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia , sees a different principle at stake .
Idiot / ˈidēət /
Noun : 1 ) A person possessing low intelligence .
2 ) A person who does something incredibly stupid or dangerous , regardless of intelligence level .
3 ) People who think Star Wars is better than Star Trek .
4 ) The average teenager that believes that Johnny Knoxville is cool .
5 ) The average impression that a father has about his daughter ’s boyfriend or husband .

Hearn said the event would help to " regenerate a new era for snooker " Snooker boss Barry Hearn has promised " non-stop breathtaking action " after announcing a new one - frame shoot - out event for the world 's top 64 players .
Hearn said the World Snooker Shoot - Out was a key part of his plans to overhaul the sport and draw in a new audience .
" It will be snooker at full throttle , " said the World Snooker chairman .
The tournament , which will have a random draw , will feature a 20 - second shot clock and frames will not be allowed to take more than 12 minutes .
The event will run from 28 to 30 January , 2011 at a venue to be announced , and will be screened live on Sky .
" It will test players to the limits of what they can do under pressure , " added Hearn , who said the champion would win £ 32,000 for their efforts .
It 's one of a variety of new events on the calendar which will help to generate a new and wonderful era for snooker
World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn
" They will have to make quick decisions and show their natural ability and plenty of bottle - with the chance to double their money for every game they win .
" There will be a very lively atmosphere so it might not be one for the purists , but we want to appeal to new and younger audiences and this is the perfect format to trial .
" This is among the most exciting ideas I 've had since coming back into snooker and I can't wait to see it realised .
" It 's one of a variety of new events on the calendar which will help to generate a new and wonderful era for snooker . "
Sky has not screened any World Snooker - sanctioned events since 2004 , with its coverage of the sport limited to the Premier League event .
Since returning to the sport , Hearn has helped set up a new ranking event in Germany , extended the deal to hold the World Championship at the Crucible and announced plans for a World Seniors Championship .
Hearn intends to take a 51 % stake in World Snooker , with players and other stakeholders in the sport owning the remaining 49 % of what would become an independent business .

He stopped the vehicle , and " I could smell the strong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle . "
He began writing the report , and upon returning to Ms. Bishop 's car , " She had sprayed perfume in the car to hide the smell . "
He says she refused his request to search the vehicle , so he called an officer to bring a K - 9 drug dog .

After a turbulent development history that has involved possibly being canceled and uncanceled multiple times , a sequel to the 2003 cult favorite action - adventure gameis publicly in the works , but series creator Michel Ancel says the game will " take time " because he is deliberately keeping the team size small to " preserve creativity . "
" On this game , we 're keeping the team small , to preserve creativity and so the game does n't become a commercial product , so that is has soul , " Ubisoft designer Ancel said this week , according to a Eurogamer translation of comments made in French at the Montpellier in Game conference Last week at E3 , Ubisoft announced the development of , the latest 2D game in the Ancel - originated platforming series .
It is being developed by a team of only five , using tools intended to reduce the number of technical hurdles between artists and game development .
The team plans to eventually release those tools to the public .
Ancel indicated that theteam is using similar tools for its own game .
" It takes a bit longer , " he admitted , " but we 're very keen to use this system with this game , because it 's an ambitious game and we want to create something exceptional . "
Some reports have indicated that the designer , like theteam , hopes to release those tools to the public .
was originally released for PC , PlayStation 2 , GameCube , and Xbox .
Although it was not a major commercial success , it received a positive critical reception and generated a passionate fan base .
In the seven years since its release , Ancel has frequently expressed his desire to return to the game 's universe .
In 2008 , a teaser trailer for a sequel surfaced , but Ubisoft later claimed it was merely a concept video , and was not confirmation of a new game .

Choose Simplicity
Thoughts on Voluntary Simplicity
Welcome to Clay and Judy
Woods ' homepage .
Many simplicity gurus urge us to become " tightwads " as the true path to a simple life .
But voluntary simplicity and frugality are not really the same thing .
To be sure , frugality is a vehicle for achieving simplicity , but the driving force is a vision , a philosophy , a world view .
If life were a poem , simplicity would be the poet , frugality the line and meter .
If life were a painting , simplicity would be the artist , frugality the paint and brushes .
If life were a building , simplicity would be the architect , frugality the hammer and boards .
Voluntary simplicity is about freedom .
It s about owning your own life .
Frugality is living with less of what money can buy .
Voluntary simplicity is wanting less .
Soon after beginning our partnership more than 35 years ago , we made a revolutionary discovery .
It changed our lives then and it continues to make us " different " now .
Youve heard it before : " time is money . "
What we discovered is that s not true - time is better than money !
This revelation has allowed us to be content in our work or to change that work when it no longer satisfies .
It has permitted us to spend less time acquiring things and more time acquiring experiences , insights , and relationships .
It has encouraged us to lend a helping hand in our community , whenever the need arises , because we can make the time to do it .
It has given us freedom and control of our lives .
For some reason , it seems to us that many people have failed to grasp this simple truth .
They trudge off to work every morning to put in their time at jobs they despise so they can buy things .
Have you noticed ?
The more a person hates his or her job , the more money he or she spends on toys , time - shares , new cars , the latest trendy clothes , jewelry , etc .
And the more one spends , the more one needs to hang on to that job , no matter what .
Is there a way out ?
We think so .
If you re already addicted to conspicuous consumption , it will take some getting used to .
But it IS possible to own your own life if you are determined to do it .
How ?
Simplify !!
Youll be surprised to discover how much you can do without and still have more than enough to eat , stylish clothes to wear , a reliable car , a comfortable home - and time to do the things you really want to do .
When the need for cash is reduced , it s possible to pursue work that s rewarding - the work youve always dreamed of doing - even though it pays less than the high pressure , low satisfaction job you thought you were locked into .
At the beginning of our own journey down a simpler path , we made a direct link between time and costs .
When we asked ourselves , " Is it worth x hours of work to buy this ? " it often wasnt !
If wed rather spend those x hours doing something else , instead of earning funds for the purchase , we didnt buy it .
Because , of course , time is better than money .
Try this simple exercise .
Make a list of the ten activities you enjoy most .
Then make another list of the ten activities that occupy most of your time .
Compare the two lists .
This little self test may be all you need to convince you to jump off the merry - go - round .
Stop going around in circles and head straight toward what you really want to do .
It s the wanting that counts .
Doing what you want can make having things you want seem a lot less important .
When having fewer things leads to having more time to do what you choose , you just may find you want fewer things !
And youll discover that voluntary simplicity makes frugality easy .
Because time really is better than money .

Gov. Linda Lingle today signed into law two important bills preserving 2nd Amendment rights passed by the recently adjourned 25th Hawaii State Legislature .
SB 358 , SD1 , HD2 , which I introduced , is now known as ( Act 96 ) .
This bill establishes provisions relating to prohibition against seizure of firearms or ammunition during emergency or disaster , suspension of permit or license .
Prohibits any person or government entity to seize or confiscate , under any civil defense , emergency , or disaster relief powers or functions conferred , or during any civil defense emergency period , or during any time of national emergency or crisis , any firearm or ammunition and permit or license of any individual who is lawfully permitted to carry or possess the firearm or ammunition and who carries , possesses , or uses the firearm or ammunition in a lawful manner and in accordance with the criminal laws of this State . —
Amends provisions relating to civil defense powers , in general .
Section Affected : 134- ( 1 SECTION ) , 128-6 .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
As a Trustee and Secretary of the Bellevue , Washington - based Second Amendment Foundation , I introduced the legislation in part as a result of Hurricane Katrina ’s aftermath in New Orleans when law enforcement officials went door - to - door and seized legal firearms from legally registered owners .
The court subsequently overturned the state ’s actions .
Worried constituents called this year during the Hawaii Tsunami alert .
Citizens were concerned that the police would not be able to protect everyone and their property during a major emergency .
I emphasize this law applies to legally owned and registered firearms .
This is a good bill and Governor Linda Lingle should be thanked for her prompt attention to this important legislation which passed the Senate unanimously .
Hawaii now joins 30 other states with similar legislation .
The other bill signed today ( Act 97 ) is SB0532 SD1 HD1 CD1 RELATING TO LIMITING CIVIL LIABILITY .
Also known as the “ CASTLE DOCTRINE ” , and originally introduced by Slom , the version that passed was sponsored by Senate Judiciary Chairman Brian Taniguchi ( D - Manoa ) , By Request .
Current Hawaii law requires a homeowner to “ retreat ” from his or her own home when invaded by a criminal engaging in a felony .
The new law establishes provisions relating to owner to felon ; limited liability .
Provides that any owner of any other interest in real property shall not be liable to any perpetrator for any injury or death that occurs upon the real property during the course or after the commission of certain felony offenses .
— Section Affected : 663- ( 1 SECTION ) OWNER TO FELON .
This bill represents common sense and confirms in Hawaii the old adage , “ A man ’s ( or woman ’s ) home is his ( her ) castle . ”
It should put potential criminals on notice that they no longer can break in , commit a felony , threaten the owner and escape with no risk of personal harm .
Both laws are about taking back our individual , Constitutional rights .

Introduction
Mr Speaker ,
I move that the Appropriation ( 2010 / 11 Estimates )
Bill be now read a second time .
On election day 2008 , New Zealanders voted for a more prosperous , ambitious New Zealand , where Kiwis have opportunities to get ahead .
The National - led Government came into office with the New Zealand economy well into recession and with the world 's financial system experiencing its worst crisis since the Great Depression .
By necessity , last year 's Budget was focused on getting New Zealand through the global crisis .
Budget 2009 maintained the nation 's credit rating , preserved income support entitlements and fulfilled commitments from the 2008 election .
To help sustain economic activity and support jobs , the Government absorbed much of the shock of the recession on its own balance sheet , thereby significantly increasing its borrowing .
The worst of the global crisis has for now passed and the economy has begun to grow again .
In fact , New Zealand has weathered the economic storm better than many other developed economies .
Government policy struck the right balance between blunting the sharp edges of recession and maintaining control of public finances .
But we have work to do .
That 's why Budget 2010 is about building the recovery , creating jobs and helping Kiwi families get ahead .
Creating and passing through this House a budget each year is at the heart of stable government .
I want to especially thank the Government 's support parties , ACT , the Māori Party and United Future , for their contributions .
I am pleased to tell the House that this Budget will fund improved services to the public , will produce a lower track for future debt , and will deliver a tax package that will be good for the economy and good for families .
Mr Speaker ,
I now turn to four main objectives of this Budget .
The first is lifting the long - term performance of the economy .
The second is reform of the tax system , to make it fairer , more sustainable and more supporting of economic growth .
The third is better delivery of public services , to make them better for users of those services and better for taxpayers .
The fourth is to maintain firm control of the Government 's finances , so we can return to budget surpluses and pull back our rising debt .
Lifting the Long - term Performance of the economy
Mr Speaker ,
Growth matters .
It is the only way that we can lift incomes , create permanent jobs and build the kind of country we aspire to be .
Lifting the long term performance of the economy will require considered and consistent change over the next decade because the challenges are significant .
It is convenient to blame sluggish growth on the global recession , but that is not the sole cause .
Our economy entered recession well before the financial crisis began in late 2008 .
Growth in the three years prior was below one per cent per annum .
This was less than half our trading partner average , and less than one - third of Australia 's growth rate .
From mid-decade on , growth had been fuelled by a mix of rising household debt and ballooning Government expenditure , which grew 50 per cent in the five years to 2009 .
By contrast , output from exporters and import competing industries had been in decline since 2005 .
These include sectors such as agriculture , horticulture , mining and resources , forestry , fishing , food manufacturing and tourism , all areas where New Zealand should be benefiting from its natural advantages .
Too many New Zealanders have discovered that growth driven by debt , Government spending and property speculation does not create permanent , worthwhile jobs .
The consequences of this decline in our earning capacity are now clear : too few jobs created , a balance of payments deficit over 8 per cent of GDP until its recent decline , and negative productivity growth between 2000 and 2009 .
The economy has spent more than it earned and borrowed to make up the difference .
New Zealand 's largest single vulnerability is now its large and growing net external liabilities .
New Zealand owes the world $ 168 billion , or around 90 per cent of GDP .
Private sector debt to foreign lenders has grown steadily over the last decade and our vulnerability will be increased by growth in government debt to foreign lenders over the next five years .
The dangers of too much debt are well illustrated by a number of European nations who are currently undergoing painful changes , involving increasing taxes , cutting public services , or both .
The Government is committed to policies that will reduce our vulnerabilities by tilting our economy away from debt and consumption toward savings , investment and exports .
Mr Speaker ,
These policies underpin the updated Treasury forecasts showing steady growth of around 3 per cent over each of the next four years .
The forecasts also show that this growth will raise real incomes of the average household by about $ 7,000 over the next four years , and create 170,000 jobs .
Unemployment has already fallen to 6 per cent .
We share with both ACT and the Māori Party a common desire to help New Zealanders move off welfare and get ahead under their own steam .
Global developments highlight the opportunity for New Zealand to stand out .
We will emerge from recession with sound finances , quality public services and low and stable tax rates .
We will naturally appeal as a place people want to live and do business .
Mr Speaker ,
The Government 's growth strategy has identified six key drivers of stronger economic performance - a better regulatory environment for business ; skills and education ; quality infrastructure ; science , innovation and trade ; improved public sector performance ; and tax reform .
These jointly form a programme to address economic imbalances and lift growth .
The Government is making progress in all six areas .
Reform of the Tax System
Mr Speaker ,
I now turn to the Budget 's second objective , that of improving the tax system .
Tax reform is a centrepiece of this Budget .
We want a system that rewards effort and helps families get ahead .
One that attracts and retain skilled people in New Zealand .
One that encourages savings and productive investment .
And we want to make the tax system fairer .
Mr Speaker ,
Tax has a powerful influence on savings and investment decisions .
Uneven tax rates have been a major drag on growth .
Sectors with low effective tax rates have expanded at the expense of the rest of the economy .
The Government is strongly of the view that investments should stand on their own merits , and not be unduly influenced by tax .
There is also compelling evidence of widespread avoidance , mostly brought about by taxpayers exploiting differing effective tax rates .
The system lacks integrity and fairness .
The Tax Working Group of 2010 echoed the findings of the earlier McLeod Tax Review of 2001 on these matters .
We also required any changes to be broadly fiscally neutral .
Given the increase in public debt of recent years , it would be irresponsible to saddle the next generation to pay for tax cuts now .
Over four years the package delivers around $ 15 billion of tax cuts .
This is matched by a similar level of revenue increases from less economically damaging sources .
The total package has a cost of $ 460 million in the first year due to some revenue initiatives which cannot be immediately implemented .
The main elements of the tax package are a shift towards lower and more uniform rates of income tax , more indirect taxation and broadening the existing tax bases .
It represents the most thorough and beneficial overhaul of the tax system in 25 years .
From 1
October 2010 we will lower personal income tax rates , and increase the rate of GST to 15 per cent .
The increase in GST has been estimated by Statistics New Zealand to raise the level of prices by about 2 per cent .
To put this in perspective , this is less than actual CPI inflation in each of the past six years .
The Government is concerned to protect the vulnerable and those less well off from this one - off rise in the general level of prices .
This continues the approach taken in last year 's Budget , which preserved income support and entitlements in the face of the global recession .
The tax package will protect the incomes of New Zealanders in two ways .
First , for income earners at all taxable income levels , the reduction in personal income tax will be sufficient to match the increase in GST .
Second , the package will provide , from 1 October 2010 , an immediate lift in the levels of New Zealand Superannuation , all main benefits , student allowances and Working for Families payments .
This will be sufficient to offset the estimated impact on prices due to the rise in GST .
The payments will be adjusted to ensure the full CPI effect is captured , excluding the CPI impact of the tobacco excise increase .
Revenue raised , from GST and other base broadening measures , will be used to fund an across the board reduction in all income tax rates .
The changes to personal income tax rates , to apply from 1 October 2010 , will be as follows :
The initial income tax rate applying up to income of $ 14,000 will reduce from 12.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent .
The tax rate applying to income between $ 14,000 and $ 48,000 will reduce from 21 per cent to 17.5 per cent .
The tax rate applying to income between $ 48,000 and $ 70,000 will reduce from 33 per cent to 30 per cent .
The tax rate applying to income over $ 70,000 will reduce from 38 per cent to 33 per cent .
These are substantial and worthwhile tax reductions .
They mean that , for example , a typical two earner family , with two children who earns the average household income , will , after allowing for the increase in GST , be better off by $ 25 per week , or $ 1,285 per year .
When combined with the tax cuts already delivered from 1 April 2009 , that family will be better off by over $ 43 per week or $ 2,245 per year .
The changes also mean that since March 2009 the marginal rate of income tax faced by taxpayers earning between $ 40,000 and $ 48,000 , just below the average wage , will have almost halved from 33 per cent to 17.5 per cent .
Taxpayers wanting to know how their own position is changed by today 's tax package can consult our website , www.taxguide.govt.nz and make this calculation .
Mr Speaker ,
The Government believes that in a world of mobile capital , business income is particularly sensitive to tax rates .
When New Zealand 's company tax rate was set at 33 per cent more than 20 years ago that rate was competitive by world standards .
Since then company tax rates show strong downward momentum around the globe .
The tax rate applying to New Zealand companies will reduce from 30 per cent to 28 per cent .
This will apply from the start of the 2011 / 12 income year .
28 per cent will also become the standard tax rate applying to most savings vehicles .
It will apply to vehicles taxed as companies , including Group Investment Funds , unit trusts , life insurance and superannuation funds .
It will also be the maximum tax rate applicable to Portfolio Investment Entities , known as PIEs .
Lower income taxpayers will still have access to lower rates via imputation credits from companies and electing lower PIE rates .
The tax rate applying to trusts will remain at 33 per cent , the same as the new top personal rate of income tax .
The previous gap between the 33 per cent tax rate for trusts and the 38 per cent rate for higher income individuals has spawned widespread use of trusts as tax planning vehicles .
Trusts have an important role in our economy , but this should not be driven by tax advantages .
Applying a lower and more uniform tax rate to most forms of capital income will improve the durability and integrity of the tax system .
It will encourage individuals to save and companies to invest .
Mr Speaker ,
The Tax Working Group also reported that anomalies arise through the use of taxable income as a means of determining eligibility for certain Government assistance .
Taxable income may not always be a good measure of true economic circumstances .
As an initial step , from 1 April 2011 investment losses will be added back to taxable income for the purpose of determining a family 's eligibility for Working for Families assistance .
Further changes of eligibility for Government assistance , including student allowances , covering areas such as distributions from trusts and income from cash PIEs , will follow after the Budget .
Officials will release a paper setting out the issues and proposed solutions later this year for implementation from 1 April 2011 .
Building the Recovery
Mr Speaker ,
The Budget will also introduce a range of measures to broaden tax bases .
These measures are being introduced to improve the fairness and efficiency of the tax system , and to improve the economy .
The existing 20 per cent loading on depreciation for new investments will be removed for assets acquired after today .
Assets already purchased will continue to receive the loading .
This allowance explicitly departed from the principle of allowing deductions for true economic depreciation .
It results in other taxpayers effectively supporting investments that might not stand up on their own merits .
In addition , the Government is not convinced that all buildings actually depreciate .
It is clear that some do .
But many New Zealanders live happily in houses constructed over 100 years ago .
Allowing tax deductions for depreciation provides an unfair tax advantage for these assets .
Accordingly , the depreciation rate for most buildings with an expected life of 50 years or more will be set to zero from the start of the 2011 / 12 income year .
Those buildings where the current depreciation schedule is consistent with a useful life of less than 50 years will be unaffected .
Building owners who believe that , under these rules , a class of buildings should qualify for depreciation , may seek a provisional rate from Inland Revenue as they do at present .
Following the Budget , the treatment of commercial building fitout will be reviewed and if necessary amended prior to 1 April 2011 to clarify the law on the split between buildings which will not be depreciable and separate assets which will continue to be depreciable .
Taxpayers will , of course , still be able to claim deductions for repairs and maintenance .
Many investors hold property through Loss Attributing Qualifying Companies , or LAQCs .
After a short period of consultation , legislation will be proposed so that from 1 April 2011 all LAQCs will be taxed as limited partnerships .
The main impact of this change will be to ensure both profits and losses are assessed at the marginal tax rate of the investor .
The Government has also reviewed taxation of inward investment into New Zealand .
International tax law generally provides that income should be taxed in the jurisdiction where it is earned .
However , it is relatively easy to transfer income between jurisdictions by use of debt , often between related parties .
New Zealand , like most countries , operates “ thin capitalisation ” rules to limit this practice .
The current “ safe harbour ” limit for gearing on foreign owned investments , will be reduced from 75 per cent to 60 per cent from the 2011 / 12 income year .
Mr Speaker ,
This package of tax changes represents a major step forward .
By improving incentives to save , and evening up effective tax rates across sectors and across vehicles , it directly addresses some of the problems that have beset the economy in recent years .
The package improves fairness and the integrity of the tax system .
It ensures that taxpayers with similar circumstances and true economic incomes will have similar tax positions .
The package is broadly neutral in terms of income distribution .
While higher income earners pay more tax and therefore receive larger personal income tax reductions , these groups also bear most of the impact of the tax base broadening measures .
In addition , the compensation package is targeted to those on lower incomes .
On average most New Zealanders receive roughly a half to one per cent average increase in real disposable income .
The impact of the tax changes on economic growth will be positive , though only a small allowance has been made for this in the fiscal projections .
Finally , I thank my colleague , the Hon Peter Dunne , who as Minister of Revenue has worked tirelessly to help deliver the tax package before the House today .
Mr Speaker ,
Budget 2010 also contains a range of other initiatives that will promote growth .
We have focused funding on investing in innovation and encouraging growth in selected productive sectors .
The Budget allocates $ 321 million over four years for a range of science and R&D incentives , lifting total spending to $ 750 million per annum .
This includes business R&D grants and assistance for firms to access new ideas , science and technology from Public Research Organisations , stronger commercialisation within CRIs and universities , and research infrastructure .
The global financial crisis was a setback for tourism .
The Budget allocates $ 30 million of new spending in 2010 / 11 , mostly to increase the marketing of New Zealand as a tourism destination internationally .
The Government will legislate this year to support the aquaculture sector 's objective of becoming a billion dollar industry by 2025 , working with industry and other stakeholders to lift regulatory barriers .
Late last year the Government agreed to most of the recommendations of the Capital Market Development Taskforce , and is in the process of implementing them .
The Government released a plan to unlock New Zealand 's petroleum and mineral potential in November 2009 and has begun implementing it .
This Budget funds implementation of that plan .
Water is also a key strategic resource .
The Government is currently working on improving the regulatory regime , including those parts that impact storage and irrigation , as part of an efficient and sustainable water management programme .
Better Delivery of Public Services
Mr Speaker ,
Another important leg of our growth plan is to improve access for New Zealand exporters to world markets .
China has recently and rapidly become our second largest trading partner .
Given the increasing importance to New Zealand of trade with Asia and the Pacific Rim , we have also recently signed Free Trade Agreements with Hong Kong and Malaysia , and are negotiating with Korea and India .
Our Agreement with the 10 countries of ASEAN recently came into force .
We are working with the Trans - Pacific Partnership regional grouping , including the United States , to open further markets and opportunities for New Zealand exporters .
Mr Speaker ,
To ensure that these and related initiatives continue to benefit the economy , we have established the Productivity Commission .
This will be a standing body with high level expertise , operating independently with a wide brief to undertake inquiries into productivity - related matters .
It will be in place by April 2011 .
The Government also intends to release a discussion document on ways to ensure that all new and existing regulation is subject to proper scrutiny .
This will help avoid proliferation of red tape .
For both of these initiatives the Government is grateful for the leadership shown by the Hon Rodney Hide and the ACT Party .
Mr Speaker ,
I now turn to how the Government can ensure better delivery of services to the public .
A more efficient public sector will deliver better quality services , while reducing fiscal and tax pressures on the rest of the economy .
The Government determined that rather than spread new spending resources thinly , it would focus on those few high priority areas that really mattered .
Three quarters of the new spending allowance has been allocated to improving health and education services , and to lifting science and innovation .
Most of the other votes received either small or no increases .
Many will see no additional funding for several years .
The Government is working with public sector chief executives to deliver higher quality services more efficiently , as every other organisation in the community has had to do over the past two years , and I thank them for their efforts .
We will continue to scrutinise every dollar of public spending .
As we committed a year ago , Budget 2010 lives within a new operating spending allowance of $ 1.1 billion per year .
In addition , a further $ 1.8 billion has been made available between now and 2014 by redirecting resources into higher priority areas , including within health and education spending .
Core Crown expenditure also increases due to rising benefit and superannuation costs , increased finance costs and expenditure on the emissions trading scheme .
In total , core Crown expenditure is forecast to increase by $ 5.9 billion , to over $ 70 billion , in 2010 / 11 .
Better Delivery of Public Services
Mr Speaker ,
The largest share of new spending has been dedicated to improving core Government services .
In total , Health has been allocated an additional $ 2.1 billion over the next four years , including an extra $ 512 million in 2010 / 11 to cater for ongoing demographic and price pressures .
This includes $ 93 million for disability support and $ 60 million to boost elective surgery over the next four years .
The Government 's commitment to education remains strong .
This Government wants all young New Zealanders to reach their potential and be given the opportunity to succeed .
The Budget provides an extra $ 1.6 billion for education over four years .
This will fund a 4 per cent increase in operating expenditure for schools .
It also includes $ 349 million for school property , $ 92 million to raise participation in Early Childhood Education for families in areas currently under- represented , and $ 48 million to extend the Youth Guarantee .
Social services are also a priority .
Building on the success of the Government 's Community Response Fund , the Budget provides $ 91 million over the next four years for Non-Government Organisations to deliver extra services .
Justice receives $ 147 million in new operating expenditure , as well as significant capital expenditure .
This will fund a lift in prison capacity , legal aid restructuring and increase Family and Youth Court professional services .
Our commitment to Whānau Ora is matched by funding of $ 134 million over four years .
The first wave of 20 Whānau Ora providers will be selected through an Expressions of Interest process that begins next month .
The Budget provides almost $ 20 million for two new Whare Oranga Ake reintegration units .
I particularly thank the Hon Dr Pita Sharples and the Hon Tariana Turia as the Ministers responsible , together with the rest of the Māori Party .
The Government retains an on - going commitment to growing the supply of affordable housing for New Zealanders and their families .
$ 20 million has been provided to extend Housing New Zealand 's Housing Innovation Fund for another year .
Mr Speaker ,
The Government is determined to improve management of government owned assets .
Too often Government assets have been poorly managed and liabilities poorly monitored .
As at 30 June 2009 , the Crown balance sheet showed $ 217 billion of assets and $ 118 billion of liabilities .
The Crown has wide range of holdings , and is by far the largest asset owner in the country .
It holds around $ 100 billion of what could be termed social assets , including roads , national parks , state housing , schools and hospitals .
It holds around $ 70 billion of financial assets , comprising a wide range of local and overseas investments , all of which produce commercial returns .
And it holds over $ 50 billion worth of commercial assets , comprising mainly SOEs and KiwiRail .
These assets have been funded by New Zealanders paying taxes and fees over decades .
The Budget forecasts show that over the next four years the value of Government owned assets is expected to increase by some $ 32 billion .
This represents growth in taxpayer wealth .
This level of investment demands a high standard of stewardship by Government .
Since taking office the Government has been working hard to understand the capital demands of its operations , and to allocate capital to where it can best be used .
We have produced the first National Infrastructure Plan , tightened commercial disciplines on SOEs and started to introduce better disciplines on procurement processes .
New capital spending decisions in this Budget reflect this increased emphasis on managing the public 's resources to promote growth .
We continue to invest in our $ 7.5 billion infrastructure programme over the next four years .
The Budget funds major investment in the rail network .
The Government has committed in principle to investing $ 750 million over the next three years , as its contribution to KiwiRail 's $ 4.6 billion turnaround plan .
This is in addition to $ 500 million over four years to purchase electric commuter trains .
Another major investment is the Government 's ongoing investment in ultra-fast broadband infrastructure through Crown Fibre Holdings .
Budget 2010 allocates a further $ 200 million of capital funding , in addition to the $ 248 million allocated last year , as part of a total expected investment of $ 1.5 billion .
This funding will enable Crown Fibre Holdings to start making substantial contract commitments with the private sector to start rolling out the new fibre network .
A further $ 48 million has been allocated for ultra - fast broadband in schools .
Funding has been set aside for a new prison , potentially delivered via a Public Private Partnership .
Maintaining Firm Control of the Government 's Finances
Mr Speaker ,
I now turn to the Government 's fourth objective , that of maintaining firm control of the government 's finances , so we can return the budget to surplus and reduce our rising debt .
The fiscal outlook has improved from last year , due to the economy returning to growth and the positive impact of Budget 2009 decisions .
The projected operating deficit for the next financial year is $ 8.6 billion or 4.2 per cent of GDP .
It is projected to improve steadily in each subsequent year , and to reach surplus in 2015 / 16 , three years ahead of last year 's projection .
As a result of this improved outlook the debt projections have also become more favourable .
Net core Crown debt is now projected to peak at 27 per cent of GDP in 2014 / 15 and then decline steadily .
This is both a lower and earlier peak than was projected in last year 's Budget .
It contrasts strongly with the outlook of ever rising debt which the Government was presented with in late 2008 .
By 2024 , net core Crown debt is projected to be back to 14 per cent of GDP , or about the level before the crisis struck .
However , it will require at least a further decade of disciplined fiscal management to deal with the effects of the global financial crisis and the huge lift in Government spending during the boom years leading up to that crisis .
Financing new and maturing debt will require the Government to borrow around $ 240 million every week over the next three years .
Debt is projected to reach $ 68 billion by 2014 / 15 .
This substantial rise in debt will mean that interest costs more than double .
Our long term fiscal objective remains to ensure that net debt is brought back to no more than 20 per cent of GDP by the mid 2020s .
The current projections show this being achieved by 2022 .
If possible it would be preferable to return to this low level of debt earlier .
Mr Speaker ,
The improvement in the debt outlook gives the Government some flexibility to absorb part of any future shocks , as it did in the last recession .
Our intention is that any favourable surprises will be used for deficit reduction and debt consolidation .
When the books are balanced and debt has stopped rising the Government will have more choices about where to invest , spend or reduce taxes .
Conclusion
Mr Speaker ,
Budget 2010 is about building the recovery and helping New Zealanders prosper .
The Prime Minister has made clear this Government 's aspirations for an economy that values enterprise , rewards people for effort and encourages them to get ahead .
New Zealand has successfully navigated the worst global crisis in a generation .
The challenge now is to build growth and create new jobs .
Sustained growth provides opportunities for New Zealanders to achieve their aspirations .
Budget 2010 drives the New Zealand economy forward , moving away from debt and consumption while increasing investment and exports .
We set a path for responsible Government spending last year , and we maintain that path in this Budget .
We have changed the tax system to rebalance the economy , to put cash into people 's hands and to encourage them to save more and consume less .
This will have a long term benefit .
We now have our debt under control and unemployment is beginning to fall .
We will emerge as one of the countries that other nations aspire to be more like .
There are risks to the recovery .
A mountain of debt hangs over a number of our export destinations , and will also influence the markets that lend to New Zealand .
We cannot take for granted the contribution that the Australian and Chinese economies have made to our growth .
However , we are on track to a position most developed economies will envy .
This includes more new jobs , falling unemployment , rising family incomes , quality public services and sound public finances .
Mr Speaker ,
This Budget continues to build a platform for a much more ambitious New Zealand .
Mr Speaker ,
I commend this Budget to the House .
In Wisconsin , we say " utes " , but nevertheless , the good people of Saskatchewan have done an incredible amount of work about their youths .
In 2007 at the Congress , we learned about a unique project on sex education that was aimed primarily at the at-risk ( read impoverished ) first nation peoples .
This involved a community center and the public health department .
Today , we heard about the efforts on the part of co-operatives to deal with generational issues .
The depopulation of Rural Saskatchewan ( and the prairies in general ) is a very real issue .
It is also happening in the prairies the United States .
As jobs left these rural towns to foreign countries or to re-align along the new supply lines of highways and airports instead of rail , the jobs left .
In addition , as the work of rural America ( Canada and the US ) has become more mechanized the jobs available for young men and women has also disappeared .
Of course , the young leaving for greener pastures is a natural part of life , but the difference here is that they take with the the ability to sustain the rural community and its aging population .
We are n't talking about a 20 % of the kids going off to seek their fortune ( or just because they do n't want to do farm work ) , but larger amounts and even if they are n't leaving , they still do n't have available work ( or the type of work ) to support the community .
This puts greater stress on the government to provide services without a tax base and can end up creating a vicious circle that could cost the elderly their homes .
Of course , unemployed ( or underemployed ) youth can create their own set of problems as they play the hand dealt to them and this can create even more stress on the community through depression , drug abuse , and crime .
The first presentation was byand was entitled " Sustaining Rural Communities " .
He is from the .
Hamm asked " What makes your " community " home to you ? "
He looked at the connection between cooperative values and the sense of community .
One of his questions : " how might stronger connections between youth and adults affect co-operatives ? "
He considered three areas : rural youth migration and mobility , understanding the social economy , and creating the context ( the loss of industry / farming jobs ) .
In terms of connection to co-operatives , his study examined the rural co-operatives of Alberta , determined if the younger generation was aware of co-operatives , and examined how the current situation might create new opportunities for youth and co-operatives .
Connection place is a critical part of this study .
In addition , how social connections and networks in rural communities enhance youth engagement and create opportunities .
They conducted the research using on - line surveys , focus groups , individual structured interviews and policy document analysis .
They found that youth have a very strong connection to their communities ( a connection to the land , ties to family , community resources , and a core group of friends ( people who " get me " ) and a reliance on faith .
People would return for a " dream job " but how can those be created ?
Countering these forces are the direct message that youth receive from school , the media , and their own experience .
That message is to " leave " .
This message needs to be turned around to encourage people to " return " .
This can be done , perhaps , through co-operative structures that create intergenerational activities and information about local opportunities .
I was thinking that worker co-operatives could easily create decent jobs in these communities providing goods and services , manufacturing , or even regional niche markets .
of Quentin Burdick Center for Co-operatives presented his work on creating a new generation of co-operators by engaging the high schools of North Dakota .
His motivation comes from the pending retirement of the so - called " baby boom " generation .
Anyone who has been to a co-operative conference in the upper midwest of the United States sees this problem quite directly .
In addition , McKee saw the general need to improve co-operative literacy of future members and improving that among the Executive Directors and their boards and finally between that of the policy makers and community leaders .
McKee wanted to see what effect curriculum would have on co-op attitudes .
His team looked at the large amount of information on education and co-operative education .
They considered Bloom 's Taxonomy , Powell 's structure and content , and even the USDA Rural Development work .
Without going into all of the details , they tested their hypothesis by inviting North Dakota teachers to participate .
They held a two - day training session with eight teachers .
They developed a lesson plan and then the teachers brought it into their classroom .
My notes get a little fuzzy here .
There was an increase in general appreciation of co-operatives by the students .
In general , it was successful result ; however , it may not have had enough participants to be significant .
In any event , Prof .
McKee has made the course an open - source .
You can download it from the Center ' website or hit this link : Co-operative Curriculum .
They seem to be focused towards the Agriculture co-ops , but this is still a neat idea .
McKee noted that there was some reluctance on the part of teachers as it would cause them to have to amend or change their lesson plans .
The last presentation came fromof the ( home of the Centre for Co-operatives ) .
She discussed the work of the Northern Saskatchewan Trappers Association Co-operative ( hit the link and go to the page for the study , not the coop ) .
The primary mission of the co-op is to be sustainable , engage aboriginal youth and build human capacity through regaining traditional knowledge .
This project integrates traditional trapper work and co-operative governance .
It promotes member participation , learning and cultural development .
It reconnects generations .
This last bit is important as this reconnection has also helped the at - risk youth find themselves .
The rate of suicide among this group is quite high and part of the idea of this co-operative was to provide a connection to these youth who might otherwise fall into depression .
Becoming a cooperative has given trackers , Dr. Findlay noted , another " language " along with that of sustainable development and their livelihood of trapping .
This , in turn , helped to re-tell the story on trapping in lieu of the colonial legacy and voice -- the Cree do n't have a " word " for trapping , the word that they use ( Pinchowil ) means " making a living " in English .
Pre-contact notions refer to the idea of sustainability , not growth .
Part of this project involved forcing the government to respect the treaties and protecting their right to " make a living " .
The youth of this community have a higher incarceration rate and tend to receive longer sentences than the English counter parts .
Canada , despite its " niceness " , is the world 's largest incarcerator of youth and # 3 for per capita incarceration ( after the United States and New Zealand ) .
This co-operative works with at - risk youth by teaching them the traditions and customs of trapping .
They do this in a co-operative context by creating ( my notes are a bit fuzzy here as well ) trap - lines which I think are autonomous work teams and consist of elders and youth by design .
The effect of this co-operative on this population has been amazing : youth involved in this program had a 50 % less chance of incarceration and an 85 % lower chance of suicide .
As with the project on sex education , the trapper 's co-op shows something very neat about co-operative in the Prairies of Canada .
They see social problems and think " how can we use a co-operative or mutual model to address this problem ? "
The more common approach in most areas tends to be to either use the police or social workers to effect change .
What a difference !
Using the co-operative model allows people to organically change their culture .
It is the basic message of teaching people to fish and feeding them for a lifetime .
Rather than the top - down , judgmental and elitism of social workers , politicians and the apparatus of the state effecting change through the system which ( despite the best intentions of the social workers ) only perpetuates oppression and leads to a population that becomes incarcerated in their minds and hearts whether or not they live behind physical bars .
I finished this workshop feeling pretty upbeat .
To see such great activity among the co-operative world in terms of engaging the next generation was fantastic .
Even more to see the success and willing to share the models made be believe even more in the Co-operative Difference .
Now the question will be to see how we can build off of this great work .
Hero worship at the expense of historical accuracy ?
Surely not .
It has been portrayed as the story of the lone genius who solved the greatest scientific problem of his day despite the hindering efforts of those ranged against him , saving thousands of lives .
On the one side was John Harrison , the self - taught clockmaker from a humble Yorkshire background .
On the other , the 18th Century ’s wealthy elite charged with the task of presiding over the problem of longitude – the knotty task of working out how far west or east a ship has sailed .
Harrison ’s story has been the subject of a best - selling book and an award - winning film but science historians believe that the true account of how the problem of longitude was solved has yet to be told .
To uncover the full story , they have started dusting off the forgotten archives of the British Board of Longitude , the panel of distinguished experts set up in 1714 to sit in judgement over proposed solutions to the Longitude Problem .
The Board was responsible for awarding the £ 20,000 prize – equivalent to about £ 3 m today – to the first person to come up with a way for ships to navigate safely at sea by knowing longitude .
“ Think of The X Factor , but much more money and much more important , ” said Professor Simon Schaffer of the University of Cambridge .
He is the principal investigator on the archival research project which is being jointly conducted with the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich .
The prize was the first time the government had used legislation to address a specific scientific problem .
In Dava Sobel ’s 1995 book Longitude , and the later film based on it , carpenter ’s son Harrison is depicted as the solitary virtuoso pitched against the scientific establishment of a society suffocated by class , exemplified by the eminent gentlemen who sat on the Board of Longitude .
But Professor Schaffer and his colleagues believe that the important role of the Board of Longitude in finding a solution has been largely forgotten or downplayed in the rush to promote Harrison as the unsung hero of the popular story .
Far from being a force of conservatism , the board , they believe , did much to generate the climate of open inquiry that allowed pioneering scientific research to flourish – a climate that fostered Harrison ’s historic achievement .
“ The Board of Longitude has had a pretty bad history because it has either been forgotten or condemned .
Its creation was a turning point in British history , but after it was abolished in 1828 it was largely forgotten and its impact was never properly assessed , ” Professor Schaffer said .
Indeed , Professor Schaffer goes as far as to suggest that British science today owes the Board a debt of gratitude rather than contempt , because in effect it laid much of the groundwork for the kind of state - funded scientific research that we now take for granted .
The precedent of the Board of Longitude may indeed have led Britain to become one of the global leaders of modern science .
“ It has been forgotten , I think , because we do n’t like remembering how important the state is in promoting science and technology in British history .
And we ignore or condemn the Board of Longitude because there is a hero in this story and his name is John Harrison . ”
He added : “ We still like to believe that we are a nation of enthusiastic amateurs like Harrison , making huge breakthroughs against the odds and in spite of a state hostile to scientific progress .
In fact , we have a long history of state - sponsored ingenuity which made Britain into a military and technological world player .
The Board is in many ways that history . ”
It was a naval disaster in 1707 that led to the Board of Longitude being set up in 1714 .
A fleet of four large ships led by Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell foundered on the rocks of the Isles of Scilly , with the loss of nearly 2,000 lives .
An investigation later concluded that it was the inability to determine longitude accurately that caused the disaster , and this led the Parliament of the day to establish a substantial Longitude Prize to be given “ for such person or persons as shall discover the Longitude ” .
Although it was easy to determine latitude on a ship ’s rolling deck by analysing the height of the midday sun , determining longitude was far more difficult using classical astronomical techniques .
Another way was to have an accurate clock that could keep the time of the home port , where the longitude is known , and compare this time with the time on board the ship – as determined by another clock set regularly to the local midday sun .
As Dava Sobel describes : “ The two clock times enable the navigator to convert the hour difference into geographical separation .
Since the Earth takes 24 hours to revolve 360 degrees , one hour marks 1 /24 of a revolution or 15 degrees .
And so each hour ’s time difference between the ship and the starting point marks a progress of 15 degrees of longitude to the east or west . ”
The problem in the 18th Century was getting accurate enough clocks that could work at sea .
Pendulum clocks would speed up or slow down with the motions of the ship , and the lubricants used by clockmakers performed differently in various temperatures and humidities .
Harrison ’s genius was to make a marine chronometer that was compact enough to take on a ship ; that worked on springs rather than a pendulum ; and that did not require the lubricants used by standard clockmakers .
His fourth prototype , the H4 chronometer that resembled an oversized pocket watch , eventually led to him winning most of the money assigned to the Longitude Prize .
But this was despite the considerable delay and fudge by the Board , which suggested the chronometer ’s success in two transatlantic sea trials – when it determined longitude to within one nautical mile – was down to luck .
The popular account of the episode makes much of the role played by Reverend Nevil Maskelyne , a member of the Board and the Astronomer Royal .
Maskelyne was a proponent of the lunar distance method of determining longitude .
Sobel ’s account portrays him as obstructive to the point of being unfair on Harrison .
Indeed , Harrison had to petition both Parliament and King George III to get the full amount he rightly felt he deserved – but he never received the official award , which in fact was not given to anyone .
As part of the new investigation into the archives of the Board of Longitude , experts will also dismantle the chronometers made by Harrison in pursuit of the prize .
Richard Dunn , curator of the history of navigation at the National Maritime Museum , said that it is clear from earlier work on some of the prototypes that Harrison was not working alone .
“ One of the things we will be doing is taking apart the timekeepers Harrison made , which can give us an alternative version of the story .
If you look inside the first clock , it quickly becomes clear that several people were involved in making it .
Clearly this was n’t just about a lone genius working by himself , ” Mr Dunn said .
As for the Board , longitude was not its only scientific success .
It was also involved in stimulating interest in other fields of research , such as the expeditions of Captain Cook , which led to the discovery of Australia , the invention of the sextant , the global survey of geomagnetism , the building of the first overseas astronomical observatory and the search for a North - West passage .
Professor Schafer said that we live in a culture were we prefer to see success as the achievement of a unique author rather than the fruits of collective action .
Yet without the board , British science could have been very different today .
“ Essentially the Board represents the germs of our national science policy , ” Professor Schafer said .
“ State - backed science is still an issue which matters a lot now , whether it ’s on stem cell research or climate change .
We do n’t know whether to trust it , and we do n’t know how to respond when scientists and the state fall out .
It does n’t matter if you only have a few products or thousands of products , we can set up the store for you .

WASHINGTON 
When is the word “ British ” an international insult ?
When officials in the Obama White House combine it with another word : “ petroleum . ”
Outrage is brewing on the other side of the Atlantic over the Obama administration ’s repeated use of the name “ British Petroleum ” for BP , the oil company responsible for the spill that has devastated the Gulf of Mexico .
British Petroleum is actually the former name of the company , which now officially goes by BP  a fact that seems to have escaped some of the White House ’s most prominent spokesmen and other high - ranking Washington officials .
Mr. Obama himself seems mostly to use BP .
But the White House press secretary , Robert Gibbs , and the Coast Guard commander in charge of responding to the spill , Adm .
Thad W. Allen , have been using British Petroleum interchangeably with BP in their public remarks .
So have the House speaker , Nancy Pelosi , and the House majority leader , Representative Steny H. Hoyer .
This does not sit well with some ink- stained wretches ( or clean - fingered bloggers ) across the pond , who are wondering aloud just how special the “ special relationship ” between the two countries still is .

An energy plant that burns thousands upon thousands of tons of garbage , twenty - four hours a day , and converts it into heat and electricity .
Sounds like a dream , does n't it ?
A feasible solution to ending landfills as we know them , whilst simultaneously moving away from fossil fuel dependency ...
In Denmark , it 's a reality .
Denmark now has 29 of these new " waste - to - energy " plants , which convert local household garbage and industrial waste using filters to catch pollutants that would have otherwise found themselves released into the atmosphere .
The plants are not only cleaner than conventional incinerators , but they are allowing Denmark 's cities to consider garbage as a clean alternative fuel .
In effect , this kills two birds with one stone ; it aids in the disposal of a problem for many urban areas , and it provides a resource for clean energy .
And the plants achieve both of these things whilst reducing greenhouse gas emissions and local pollution .
Denmark 's waste - to - energy plants currently serve 98 municipalities in a country of 5.5 million people ; ten additional plants are being planned or are currently under construction and will join the 400 plants that exist today across Europe .
The United States has no plans to build waste - to - energy plants , according to the EPA .
Nearly half of the nation 's states , however , classify and burn waste to create renewable fuel .
In the past , states and individual municipalities have decided the process and methods for waste management .
But based on the scale of our country compared to the nations leading waste - to - energy practice in Europe ( Denmark , Germany , and the Netherlands ) , the numbers are embarrassing ...
There are only 87 trash - burning power plants in the United States , a country of more than 300 million people , and almost all were built at least 15 years ago .
It 's important to note that nearly all of those 87 plants are in high density areas , like the North East .
Much of the trash Americans generate is easily put out of sight and out of mind , because we have the land and space to do just that .
Why , then , is Uncle Sam hesitant to develop these plants that could reduce waste in water , landfills , and dumpsters and convert it to heat and electricity ?
This seems like a no- brainer ...
Converting unsightly trash would eliminate rats , disease , and otherwise unpleasant effects of landfills and dumpsters piled high with household garbage — the result of many people sharing a small living space ; harnessing the fuel to create heat and electricity would counter the high cost of energy from fossil fuels that citizens currently struggle to afford .
There are two main sides of the argument against waste - to - energy plants in the U.S. of A .
The first lies among those who support recycling ; they believe that creating a purpose for trash would encourage people to generate trash and not be as aware of buying recyclable materials and reducing and reusing their waste .
These plants could potentially sabotage recycling programs many states have worked hard to institute and enforce in the last decade .
" Once you build a waste - to - energy plant , you then have to feed it .
Our priority is pushing for zero waste , " said an environmental associate with the New York Public Interest Group , who strongly opposes building a waste - to - energy plant in Manhattan .
But in many of the European cities that have embraced burning garbage for energy — that are currently expanding their plants — only what cannot be recycled goes to the plant as " fuel . "
Thus , recycling rates are quite high .
The other is ( surprise ! ) the money argument .
Landfills are cheaper , and from sea to shining sea , there is an abundance of places for us to bury our trash in the sand .
Landfills remain the final resting place for most Americans ' trash .
According to the New York Times : New York City alone sends 10,500 tons of residential waste each day to landfills in places like Ohio and South Carolina .
The cost to build these plants is high ... and the United States is already so far in debt , it seems that this method of waste management — while sustainable , clean , and efficient — should take a back seat to the many other bills to be paid , so long as we have other methods of disposing of garbage ... even if that means putting it in landfills .
But like most clean technology , the upfront costs are surpassed by the savings amassed over time .
Trash removal and hauling is expensive .
The NYT reported the Big Apple 's trash bill in 2009 at over $ 300 million to export trash and send it to faraway landfills via rail to Virginia and landfills in Middle America .
It would be unfair to ignore the fact that the incinerators and waste management methods of today are n't a vast improvement of their ancestors .
Emissions and pollution have decreased significantly and energy is generated in traditional landfills from methane that results from the breakdown of garbage .
But methane is twice as potent as carbon dioxide and is the primary warming gas released in the process of burning garbage .
Waste - to - energy plants produce lower levels of pollutants as they generate energy from incineration .
There are many arguments for and against a national plan to consider and build these plants in the United States .
Some feel that ignoring the waste - to - energy plant option as a viable way to manage waste and create clean energy is , put simply , irresponsible .
I can't help but wonder if the same arguments were voiced 15 years ago , if the hybrid and electric vehicle was regarded much like this method of plant treatment for trash is today , during a time when there was enough foreseeable oil to gas up the Chevy .
Why would someone want to spend a higher upfront cost for a vehicle if he or she did n't have to ?
Why market a vehicle that could compete with our traditional automobiles ?
Does the case for waste - to - energy plants fall under the If it ain't broke , do n't fix it philosophy ?
And if so , maybe it 's time we redefined " broke . "

Speaking at a conference in Taiwan , Asustek Computer chairman Jerry Shen recently announced that the device will get its official introduction at Computex 2010 , the first week of June .
With any luck , the thing will hit retail channels the third quarter of this year -- possibly as early as July , a DigiTimes ' source reports .
Shen said that the device is meant to be all the things that the iPad is not : expect Google Android , USB , an integrated webcam , and Flash , for starters .
The aforementioned source went on to state that , after wireless provider subsidies are taken into effect , the thing should cost around $ 15,000 - 16,000 TD ( or about $ 480 -510 ) .

Since the 1970s , France ’s commitment to nuclear energy has been axiomatic and based on a societal consensus that it provides energy independence as well as a source of energy which is both clean and green .
The green component of the argument rests on the assertion – taught to all engineering students as gospel – that 97 % of spent nuclear fuel in France is recycled and transformed into re-usable fuel .
That myth was shaken last week by a documentary broadcast on Arte entitled “ Déchets – le cauchemar du nucléaire ” ( Waste : the nuclear nightmare ) which showed that EDF , which is France ’s main electricity provider , sends nuclear waste to Siberia where most of it is not recycled , but instead is laid to rest in the atomic security complex of Tomsk - 7 , Siberia .
The documentary provoked disarray in parliament , where the Junior Minister for the Environment , Chantal Jouanno , said she would order an internal enquiry .
Speaking on France Info radio , she said : “ For my part , I have n’t been able to confirm or deny this information , so there has to be an enquiry . ”
The main argument of the documentary is that Areva and EDF run a fuel “ cycle ” where after first use in nuclear power plants , the fuels are treated and transformed into 3 % of of nuclear waste which has to be stored , 1 % of plutonium which is re-used to make MOX ( a mixture of uranium oxide and plutonium ) and 96 % uranium which is enriched to produce new combustible fuels .
Whereas in fact , of the 96 % of the uranium which is sent to Russia to be enriched , only a tiny fraction is actually re-used ( in 4 out of France ’s 59 nuclear power plants ) .
This means the real rate of re-use is closer to 10 % .
Areva and EDF maintain that under French law , it is illegal to send nuclear waste overseas , and therefore the 96 % of uranium which goes to Russia is recyclable fuel .
Now , the fact that this used uranium is sent to Russia is not news .
An official overview of France ’s nuclear policy is available online , and the pdf entitled “ L’énergie nucleaire en 110 questions “ , on page 45 , states the following : “ The volumes of URT ( uranium issu du retraitement ) used today in France do not justify the extension of or the creation of a specific industry dedicated to the manufacture of URT fuel , this is why it has relies on existing installations overseas , for example in the Russian Federation . ”
The semantics of this debate clearly illustrate the chasm between France ’s elite engineering corps – notably graduates of the Ecole Des Mines – and the political class and civil society , both of whom have probably fallen victim to a kind of consensual blindness in wanting to believe the myth of a perfectly clean , green and safe nuclear industry in the competent hands of the country ’s best and brightest , who themselves have operated behind the veil of their techno - scientific jargon which few have sought to explain clearly to the man in the street .
Earlier this year , Areva withdrew the use of its corporate slogan “ L’Energie au sens propre ” ( “ Energy in the literal sense of the term ” with a play on the word “ propre ” which means clean ) following action by the ARPP ( France ’s watchdog for advertising standards ) based on a complaint filed by the Green party that the claim that nuclear energy was clean was inconsistent with the production of nuclear waste .
Watch this short video ( set , oddly , to “ Funky Town ” ) to get a sense of the corporate message Areva is trying to get across – the offending slogan has been replaced by “ Experts en énergie ( Energy Experts ) .
Labour May the 1st has erupted in pitched battles in Athens with many arrests and two people seriously injured .
Labour May the 1st ( May Day ) is a day for token trade union parades in greece , but the IMF related austerity measures that have cast their long shadow on the country made sure no one was expecting a peaceful demonstration today .
Four different demos had been called in Athens , reflecting existing class and political differences .
One by PAME , the Communist Party controlled trade union umbrella , gathered at Syntagma square and marched to the American embassy .
A second , by GSEE , the private sector trade union umbrella controled by the ruling Socialist Party , staged a protest concert in Klafthmonos square .
A third , by the Radical Left Coalition and extreme - left groups gathered at Victoria square and marched to the Ministry of Labour .
And the forth , by anarchists and autonomous grassroots unions , gathered outside the Archaeological Museum and marched to the Parliament .
The first signs of unrest appeared when the anarchist - autonomous march numbering around 4,000 people reached Klafthmonos square chanting slogans against GSEE like " Scum , filth , union - bosses " and attacked the concert scene with red and black paint interrupting the performances .
Upon reaching the Parliament and attempting to march towards the EU offices , the protesters were confronted by riot police forces and clashes broke out .
Protesters attacked the prestigious ruling class hotel " Great Britain " with the clashes spreading across Panepistimiou street where banks and shops came under attack .
Reaching Propylea , protesters torched a State TV van , and closed against the ex-president of the Parliament who happened to be on Korai square .
The senior PASOK politician took refuge to a cafe while heckled and was rescued by strong police forces .
At the same time , the General State Accountancy came under attack by protesters .
The march proceeded towards Omonoia square where upon meeting up with the march of the extreme left returning from the Ministry of Labour it came under brutal attack by motorised police forces .
In the battle that ensued many protesters were injured and many more detained , while hundreds of protesters took to a barricaded retreat into Exarcheia and the Polytechnic from which more clashes ensued .
As a result of the clashes some 10 people are reported arrested ( with people gathered outside the National Police Headquarters demanding their liberation ) , and two men are reported as injured , one with serious cranial wounds .
Meanwhile , journalists are accusing the police as not allowing them to film , and one journalist was reported as being detained .
The police claims seven of its officers were injured .
At the same time , more limited clashes erupted in the May Day protest march in Salonica with many banks and shops attacked .
Protest marches also took place in many smaller cities and towns like Heraclion , Patras , Rethimnon , Corinth and Ioannina .
Sound of Voice May
Predict Sexual Behavior
New research findings suggest that the sound of a person 's voice may predict his or her level of sexual activity .
Men and women whose voices were given higher ratings in attractiveness reported having more sex partners and were younger at first intercourse than those whose voices were considered less attractive .
" Thus , the sound of an individual 's voice can reveal important information to potential mates , " study author Dr. Susan M. Hughes of Vassar College in Poughkeepsie , New York told Reuters Health .
In the study , 149 men and women listened to recorded voices of anonymous individuals and rated the voices on a five - point scale , from " very unattractive " to " very attractive . "
On average , six men and six women rated each voice .
Study participants also underwent measurements of their shoulders , waists and hips and some anonymously reported various details about their sexual history .
When the researchers compared voice ratings with sexual histories , they found that men and women whose voices were considered more attractive by opposite sex raters reported younger ages at first sexual intercourse , more sex partners and more sexual affairs than did those with less attractive voices .
Voice attractiveness predicted promiscuity in women better than did their waist - to - hip ratio , Hughes and her colleagues report in the September issue of Evolution and Human Behavior .
Among men , however , the shoulder - to - hip ratio was a better predictor of promiscuity .
That said , not all women with attractive voices are promiscuous , but " promiscuous females tend to have more attractive voices , " co-author Dr. Gordon G. Gallup Jr. , of the University at Albany , State University of New York , stated .
Women with the most attractive voices , according to opposite sex raters , tended to have smaller waists relative to their hips , whereas men whose voices were rated as more attractive -- regardless of the sex of the rater -- tended to have broader shoulders and narrower hips .
" Voice is shaped and modified by certain hormones , such as testosterone , and these same hormones also play a role in influencing both sexual drive as well as the sex - specific changes in body shape that occur during puberty , " Hughes said .
" Therefore , the link between voice , body configuration , and sexual behavior may be due to similar hormonal influences , attractiveness promoting sexual opportunity , or both . "
During human evolutionary history , voice may have also played a role in how men and women made reproductive - related decisions , particularly at nighttime , the report indicates .
" The sound of a person 's voice could have become an important indicator of other biologically relevant information , " Gallup Jr. said .
Other researchers have reported an association between facial attractiveness and sperm quality in men and facial attractiveness and longevity in men and women .
That is , men who were judged to be more attractive tended to have a higher number of sperm and more mobile sperm than their less attractive peers .
The most attractive men and women were also found to live longer than those considered less attractive .
Thus , the authors write , " voice attractiveness may be an indicator ( albeit indirect ) of other fitness - related features as well . "
As men and women search for Mr. or Ms. Right , the current findings suggest that people should not " combine a ' blind ' date with a ' deaf ' date , " Gallup said .
" Given the importance of voice as a dimension along which important features may vary , " he said , men and women should not agree to a blind date without first having at least one telephone conversation .

Gold surged to a record high on Wednesday as investors sought safety from the risk of Greece 's debt crisis spreading to other countries , with demand for coins , bars and bullion - backed exchange - traded funds all climbing .
Spot gold hit $ 1,244.45 an ounce , a gain of nearly 20 percent since early February .
It was bid at $ 1,238.45 an ounce at 10:41 a.m. EDT from $ 1,232.05 late in New York on Tuesday .
U.S. gold futures hit a record $ 1,245.40 an ounce .
Investor buying this week was triggered by doubts that a $ 1 trillion rescue package to contain an escalating debt crisis in Europe would be enough to cut the chances of sovereign default in the euro zone .
Gold priced in euros extended its record high to 982.51 euros an ounce on Wednesday , and has risen 28 percent since early February , outstripping dollar gold 's climb .
" The recent move in gold has been all about the gradually , and then more rapidly escalating fiscal crisis in Europe , " said Nic Brown , an analyst at Natixis .
" Clearly , the largest move has taken place in euros .
For me , this is a classic illustration of gold being a store of value in times of crisis .
In particular , it is useful for investors in the particular currency which is suffering the crisis . "
Investors and many traders think the scale of Greece 's fiscal problems could make it tempting for the country to default , despite the package , which could start a run on the debt of countries such as Spain , Portugal and Italy .
Gold priced in sterling hit a record 835.49 pounds ( $ 1,240.95 ) , and in Swiss francs a record 1,381.16 francs ( $ 1,243.87 ) .
The scale of investor buying can be seen in the holdings of the world 's largest gold - backed exchange - traded fund , the SPDR Gold Trust , which said its holdings stood at a record high of 1,192.150 tonnes as of May 11 .
Sales of smaller gold investment products like coins and bars also jumped .
The Austrian Mint , which produces the popular Philharmonic gold coin , said it sold more gold in the two weeks from April 26 than in the entire first quarter .
Elsewhere Swiss refinery Argor - Heraeus said investor demand for small gold bars and minted products had jumped tenfold since the start of the year .
" Our trading desk has seen a marked increase in demand - especially for allocated gold and physical gold coins and bars .
Demand for silver coins and bars has risen as well , " bullion dealer Goldcore said in a note .
" The significant uncertainty in currency markets ... is what is driving demand and leading to higher prices . "
Spot silver rose to $ 19.68 an ounce , its highest since March 2008 .
It was last at $ 19.57 from $ 19.28 late on Tuesday .
The world 's largest silver - backed exchange - traded fund , the iShares Silver Trust , said its holdings rose to 9,115.15 tonnes as of May 11 , up 27.43 tonnes from the previous business day .
Platinum was bid at $ 1,731.50 an ounce from $ 1,702 and palladium at $ 537.50 from $ 532 on Tuesday .

A " psychic " octopus is said by its aquarium owners to have predicted the country 's football team will knock England out of the World Cup .
When consulted , Paul the octopus chose a mussel from a jar with the German flag on it ahead of one in a similar jar bearing the cross of St George .
The two - year - old cephalopod has a record of predicting past German results in this manner , his owners say .
Paul has so far correctly predicted all of Germany 's results in South Africa .
His keepers say he correctly predicted nearly 70 % of Germany 's results during the 2008 European Championship .
Paul 's prediction was phenomenal Tanja Munzig , Oberhausen Sea Life Aquarium
In that contest , Germany finished as runners - up in their qualifying group , having lost only once to Croatia .
They then progressed to the final , where they were beaten by Spain .
If keepers at the Oberhausen Sea Life Aquarium are right , he correctly predicted the outcome of four of the six games in that competition .
National celebrity
" Paul 's prediction was phenomenal , " said aquarium spokesman Tanja Munzig .
" He swam straight over to the German glass , climbed in and even put a lid on top once he was sitting inside . "
The octopus , which was born in the UK and was moved to the German aquarium , has become a national celebrity after correctly predicting Germany would beat Australia in their opening match , then lose to Serbia , and then beat Ghana .
His latest prediction was flashed all over the German media .
The container that Paul opens first is said to be his pick for who will win the impending match , keepers say .
Germany finished the initial stage of the World Cup top of Group D , and face England , the runners - up from group C , in Bloemfontein on Sunday .
An apology to my readers
I 'm a member of an off - the - record list - serv called " Journolist , " founded by my colleague Ezra Klein .
Last Monday , I was deluged with angry e-mail after posting a story about Rep. Bob Etheridge ( D - N.C. ) that was linked by the Drudge Report with a headline intimating that I defended his roughing - up of a young man with a camera ; after this , the Washington Examiner posted a gossip item about my dancing at a friend 's wedding .
Unwisely , I lashed out to Journolist , which I 've come to view as a place to talk bluntly to friends .
Below the fold are quotes from me e-mailing the list that day -- quotes that I 'm told a gossip Web site will post today .
I apologize for much of what I wrote , and apologize to readers .
- " This would be a vastly better world to live in if Matt Drudge decided to handle his emotional problems more responsibly , and set himself on fire . "
I apologize to Matt Drudge for this -- I was incredibly frustrated with the amount of hate mail I was getting and lashed out .
If he wants to link to this post with some headline accusing me of wishing death on him , I suppose he can do so .
But I do n't wish that .
I was tired , angry , and hyperbolic , and I 'm sorry .
- " Follow - up to one hell of a day : Apparently , the Washington Examiner thought it would be fun to write up an item about my dancing at the wedding of Megan McArdle and Peter Suderman .
Said item included the name and job of my girlfriend , who was not even there -- nor in DC at all . "
I stand by this -- I was offended by the way that item was written .
I do apologize for reacting like this against the entire Washington Examiner , as my gripe was with one reporter , and the person who gave them this item was apologizing to me .
- " I 'd politely encourage everyone to think twice about rewarding the Examiner with any traffic or links for a while .
I know the temptation is high to follow up hot hot Byron York scoops , but please resist it . "
I stand by that reaction but apologize for belittling Byron York .
- " It 's all very amusing to me .
Two hundred screaming Ron Paul fanatics could n't get their man into the Fox News New Hampshire GOP debate , but Fox News is pumping around the clock to get Paultard Tea Party people on TV . "
I stand by this , although I apologize if people find the word " Paultard " offensive .
It was a neologism coined during the 2008 campaign to describe fanatical supporters of Paul -- I used it in this case to convey how Fox covered those supporters in 2008 .

Apple may soon find itself the subject of a federal antitrust inquiry over its stance on Flash - built iPhone apps , if a report in the New York Post pans out .
The newspaper says the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission are discussing which of the two agencies would handle the inquiry , which would focus on changes to Apple 's iPhone developer license agreement , disclosed last month , that require iPhone apps to be written in Apple - approved programming languages .
The inquiry would investigate whether Apple 's policy is anticompetitive .
The Post cites " a person familiar with the matter " as its source for the rumored inquiry .
A few boulder - sized grains of salt should accompany this news .
Besides the fact that a rumored federal inquiry is not the same thing as an actual federal inquiry , an actual inquiry is not the same as a full - scale investigation .
Rather , as the Post report notes , an inquiry would allow the feds to determine if there 's enough evidence to merit a formal investigation .
The Post story also reports that Apple 's new policy requires iPhone and iPad app makers to " only use Apple 's programming tools , " which is not precisely what the developer agreement says .
Rather , here 's how section 3.3.1 reads :
Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs .
Applications must be originally written in Objective -C , C , C++ , or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine , and only code written in C , C++ , and Objective - C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs ( e.g. , Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited ) .
That 's not strictly a requirement that developers use Apple programming tools ; it does require software to be written in languages that are supported by Apple 's Xcode programming environment , however .
Apple announced the policy change in advance of Adobe 's Flash CS5 release .
The updated software promised to allow developers to build apps in Flash and then deploy them to multiple platforms , including Apple 's iPhone OS .
Apple contends that such an approach creates lower - quality apps that fail to take advantage of iPhone OS - specific features .
Nevertheless , a federal inquiry -- if one were to wind up happening -- would raise the temperature on the already boiling Adobe - Apple feud over Flash .
Last week , Apple CEO Steve Jobs spelled out his company 's objections to Flash in an open letter posted on Apple 's Website .
That prompted a response from Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen , who contends that Apple 's decision to bar mobile developers using Flash is a restrictive move that hurts developers and consumers .
This story , " Report : Feds May Launch Inquiry Into Apple 's Flash Stance " was originally published by Macworld .

Doctor Juliana Tainer was a female Human geologist who lived during the early 24th century .
Contents show ]
History
Born in 2303 , Juliana O'Donnell lived at the Omicron Theta colony .
She met Doctor Noonian Soong on the colony , and the two fell in love .
However , her mother disapproved of their relationship due to the age gap , so they met in secret .
They boarded the SS Wisconsin in 2328 to get married in secret on Mavala IV .
Though they had no biological children , she treated each of the Soong - type androids like children .
Juliana assisted Noonian Soong in his work on artificial lifeforms , and helped create the android Data , as well as his four predecessors , including Lore and B - 4 .
Juliana viewed each android as akin to a child ; after Lore 's personality problems forced his deactivation , she was incredulous that Noonian wanted to try again .
When creating Data , Juliana was responsible for giving Data the capability to later play music and paint , as well as other creative outlets , feeling that he deserved a chance to express himself even if he lacked the emotional capacity to explore that side of himself .
When the Crystalline Entity attacked the colony in 2338 , the Soongs fled the planet .
Juliana , fearing that Data would eventually become unstable like Lore , insisted that he be left behind , though this caused her great guilt .
The two made their way to the Terlina system ; however , Juliana had been seriously injured in the attack , and fell into a coma .
Unable to stand the thought of losing the only woman he ever loved , Noonian built a new android and transferred his wife 's memories into it , using a synaptic scanning technique .
He made several modifications from his earlier androids : skin with the appearance of veins , capillaries , tear ducts , and sweat glands .
He also included a feedback processor that sent out a false bio-signal , self - adjusting to mimic Human aging .
She was programmed to eventually deactivate , her positronic matrix self - destructing , giving her the appearance of a natural death .
Juliana was designed to be unaware of her android nature , and programed to shut down if the truth about her android body was ever discovered .
She was fitted with an internal information module with a holographic interface so a holographic program of Noonian could answer any questions people may have about what happened to her .
The program responded variously depending upon the identity of whoever was accessing it .
A few days after Juliana 's death , Soong activated the android .
When Noonian activated her , he recalled that " she looked up at me and smiled .
She recognized me .
It had worked !
Here was a life not two minutes old , and as far as she knew I was her husband .
She 'd just recovered from a terrible injury .
It was incredible . "
The relationship between the Soongs continued for a while , eventually souring due to the isolation of Terlina III .
Juliana left Noonian – something that Noonian noted the ' original ' Julianna would have done as well .
She eventually made her way to Atrea IV , where she met and married the Atrean scientist Pran Tainer , becoming his assistant .
In 2370 , the USS Enterprise - D arrived at Atrea IV to assist in planetary core experiments .
Data and Juliana were reunited , although Data was unaware of her possible role in his life as his formative memories of those days had been erased .
Although Data was initially uncertain about how he should feel about Juliana 's claims regarding her role in his initial design and early development , a conversation with Geordi La Forge convinced him that he should not avoid Juliana due to his inability to remember her .
From this point he began to spend time with Juliana , addressing her as his mother .
Data and Juliana bonded over their mutual creative outlet , Data playing violin and Juliana , the viola .
Juliana shortly revealed that she was responsible for leaving Data behind on Omicron Theta because she was afraid of him turning out like Lore .
During the mission , Juliana was injured and her true nature as an android was discovered .
Data noted that he had observed clues about her android nature before this point , such as that the intervals between her blinks were governed by the Fourier system , the same mathematical formula Dr. Soong used to give Data blinking pattern the appearance of randomness , and as well , her viola performance was identical to her practice .
Data interacted with the personalized version of the Soong holoprogram meant for himself , which ultimately asked him to not reveal the truth to Juliana .
From this , Data chose not to reveal her status as an android to her .
Data 's decision regarded the happiness he believed she obtained from her belief in her humanity .
Data prioritized this over whatever satisfaction he may have received in the shared knowledge of their android nature , although he noted that had he come to the conclusion that knowing the truth would have been the best path for her and her wellbeing , he would have done so in spite of Soong 's wishes .
Before Juliana departed , Data told her that Noonian Soong had once told him that he only ever had one great love in his life , expressing his certainty that she was the object of that love .

Valve Corporation has today rolled out their Steam Mac OS X client to the general public and confirmed something we have been reporting for two years : the Steam content delivery platform and Source Engine are coming to Linux .
This news is coming days after we discovered proof in Steam 's Mac OS X Client of Linux support and subsequently found more Linux references and even the unreleased Steam Linux client .
The day has finally come and Linux gamers around the world have a reason to rejoice , as this is the biggest news for the Linux gaming community that sees very few tier - one titles .
Those enthusiasts within the Phoronix community even managed to get the unreleased Steam Linux client running up to a partially drawn UI and other modifications , but now that work can stop as Valve is preparing to officially release the Steam Linux client from where they will start to offer Linux native games available for sale .
For all those doubting our reports that Source / Steam would be coming to Linux , you can find confirmation in the UK's Telegraph and other news sites .
An announcement from Valve itself is imminent .
Found already within the Steam store are Linux - native games like Unreal Tournament 2004 , World of Goo , and titles from id Software such as Enemy Territory : Quake Wars and Doom 3 .
Now that the Source Engine is officially supported on Linux , some Source - based games will be coming over too .
Will we finally see Unreal Tournament 3 surface on Linux too ?
Only time will tell , but it is something we speculated back in 2008 .
Postal III is also being released this year atop the Source Engine and it will be offering up a native client .
We have confirmed that Valve 's latest and popular titles like Half - Life 2 , Counter - Strike : Source , and Team Fortress 2 are among the first of the Steam Linux titles , similar to the Mac OS X support .
The released Linux client should be available by the end of summer .
Similar to Valve 's strategy with Mac OS X , it 's expected that they too will be providing Linux game releases on the same day as Windows / Mac OS X for their new titles and that there will be first - rate support across all platforms .
Portal II should mark the first of these efforts .
This is terrific news considering the last major tier - one game release with a native Linux client was Enemy Territory : Quake Wars back in 2007 .
There was also supposed to be Unreal Tournament 3 for Linux with claims of it still being worked on , but two years later that has yet to see the light of day , except now it could with the release of the Steam middleware .
In the past few years there has just been less - known game releases like Shadowgrounds : Survivor via Linux Game Publishing ( LGP ) and then the community - spawned open - source games like Alien Arena 2009 , Nexuiz , and Sauerbraten , but what Valve has just done should prove to forever revolutionize the Linux gaming scene .
Our friends at Unigine Corp though will now face greater competition in the area of developing the best game engine that is supported on Linux .
The Unigine developer is quite visually advanced ( and at the same time , very demanding on the hardware ) while their developers are quite friendly towards Linux , but to this point besides a couple of great OpenGL benchmarks ( found in the Phoronix Test Suite ) , they have yet to really touch any Linux gamers -- but that will change once Primal Carnage and other titles are released .
We are so grateful that Valve has finally publicly confirmed via the Telegraph ( and another pending announcement is likely ) that they are bringing Steam and the Source Engine to Linux as this should provide a huge opportunity for the Linux distributions and other Linux stakeholders to prove their viability against Windows and can begin attracting gamers if successfully leveraged .
We have already shown that in terms of OpenGL performance , Ubuntu 10.04 is on par with Windows 7 for ATI / AMD and NVIDIA graphics and that Linux is a faster gaming platform to Mac OS X .
Stay tuned for plenty more coverage .
Of the six years that Phoronix has been around providing many exclusive news stories and Linux hardware / software coverage , Valve 's move with the Steam Linux client / Source engine will likely prove to be the most significant event and opportunity that the Linux desktop has been provided at least since the time of the initial Linux netbook push , if not since the entire time we 've been around .
Only time will tell though if Linux vendors and stakeholders will fully capitalize upon the opportunity that has the potential of greatly expanding the Linux desktop user - base .

Image caption Caste leaders frown upon marriages within the same sub-caste
Police in the Indian capital , Delhi , say a teenage girl and her boyfriend have been murdered in what they suspect is a gruesome case of " honour killing " .
Aisha Saini and Yogesh Kumar , both 19 , were beaten with metal rods and then electrocuted , police say .
The girl 's father and uncle have been arrested .
According to police , the girl 's family disapproved of the relationship because her boyfriend was from another caste .
Cases of suspected " honour killing " are rare in the Indian capital .
Correspondents say the killings - long a taboo subject in India - are now being reported more often .
There have been a number of recent cases in regions near Delhi .
' Bleeding '
The couple 's mutilated bodies were recovered early on Monday after neighbours complained of a foul smell emanating from the uncle 's house in Swaroop Nagar area in north - west Delhi .
" When we found the bodies - the couple 's legs and hands were tied and they were bleeding , " Delhi 's deputy police commissioner NS Bundela told a news conference .
" The couple had been electrocuted as well , but we will wait for the full post - mortem report . "
He said the girl 's father and uncle had been arrested " but three suspects still remain at bay " .
Police say Ms Saini 's family feared she would elope with Yogesh and he was called to her uncle 's home on Sunday on the pretext of discussing the relationship .
According to the Hindustan Times , neighbours went to the house on Sunday but were told that a family matter was being discussed .
A police official quoted in the newspaper said the assault went on for hours .
The couple were beaten with " iron rods and other blunt weapons " before being forced to sit on iron trunks to which live wires were attached and they were electrocuted , he said .
" This is a barbaric act of violence and should be condemned .
It is my duty to get the perpetrators punished , " Delhi's Women and Child Development Minister Kiran Walia said .
So - called " honour killings " are fairly common in parts of northern India , but rarely heard of in the Indian capital .
In April , five men were sentenced to death and one jailed for life over the 2007 murder of a young couple who married against the wishes of village elders in Haryana state , not far from Delhi .
Elders said they had violated local customs by marrying within the same sub-caste .
Social activists say many young men and women die every year in northern states like Punjab , Haryana and Uttar Pradesh .
Some commit suicide , others are killed - often with the approval , tacit or otherwise , of village councils that still wield considerable power .
I love Android but I really hate Eclipse , and the whole IDE paradigm in general .
I prefer to do development using Vim , screen , and a few shells running whatever commands are relevant for the project I 'm working on .
However , the Android project make it pretty clear that they support Eclipse +ADT first and foremost , so I gave it a try , if only to see what magical features I would need to figure out how to replace .
Thankfully , doing so is pretty easy .
Here 's what you need to do to develop for Android with just a shell and your favorite text editor .
Bootstrap Ant
Ant is the build tool you 'll use to build and deploy your project while developing , and to make a release when ready .
But you can't run
Ant in a project created in Eclipse with ADT , because ADT does n't give you the necessary build files .
But they 're easy to populate , using android update project .
Before running android update project , you need to find out the ID of the target you want to use for your project .
Run android list targets and find the ID for your target .
Now run android update project -- target your - target - id -- name your - project - name -- path / path / to / your / project .
It will populate your project with build.xml and local .
properties .
It 'll also say that it 's updating default .
properties , but it left it unchanged for me .
Bonus tip :
If you want to avoid Eclipse completely and start your project from scratch on the command line , you can simply run android create project with the -- target , -- name , -- path , -- activity , and -- package options populated appropriately .
This is the more direct route , instead of starting a project in Eclipse and then later running android update project like I did .
Building and Installing
This part is simple .
See ant help for more details .
ant compile will compile your code and re-generate R.java .
will compile your code and re-generate .
ant debug will do the above , plus build and sign a package ( apk ) file .
will do the above , plus build and sign a package ( apk ) file .
ant install will do all of the above plus install it to the emulator / phone .
Automated App Launching
I do n't like Eclipse but I do like that it automatically launches my app on the emulator when I build it .
It took some asking in IRC to figure out how to do this , but here it is :
adb shell 'am start - n your.package.name/.YourActivityName '
So a full build +run command might look something like :
ant install && adb shell 'am start - n your.package.name/.YourActivityName '
Watching Logs
See what your app is saying with adb logcat .
Ctags for Autocompletion
Install exhuberant - ctags and run ctags - R src gen in the root of your project to generate a tags file that many editors will automatically use for autocompletion .
Further automation
I 'm planning on eventually writing a script that uses inotify ( inotifywait - m - r ) to watch for source code changes and automatically rebuild and re-scan the code with ctags .
( Although I 'm not sure if editors will detect changes to the tags file on the fly ... must research that . )
Other Stuff
There are some parts of Eclipse / ADT that do n't really have direct replacements ; for example , the wizards for editing AndroidManifest.xml .
In this case you 'll just have to edit it by hand , but if you 're reading this then you 're probably okay with that .
If there 's anything I 've missed , please leave a comment .
Further Reading
The Other IDEs page of the Android development documentation will fill in some of the simplifications I have made here and is recommended reading .
This Linux Magazine article is also worth looking through .
Following weeks of debate over Facebook and privacy , the company is announcing new features to address the criticism that has emerged since the launch of the Open Graph and Instant Personalization .
CEO Mark Zuckerberg — who penned an op -ed in The Washington Post on Sunday promising new privacy options — is doing the presenting at a live event at the company 's headquarters .
After opening his presentation with a brief history of how Facebook and its privacy features have evolved , Zuckerberg described a number of upcoming changes to the social network .
Facebook is n't going to remove the dozens of privacy controls that let you customize settings for very specific elements of your profile .
However , the company is rolling out :
One simple control for changing content viewing permissions to friends - only , friends - of - friends , or everyone — it applies to everything you 've published on Facebook in the past .
This setting will also apply to everything you publish in the future .
A simple way for determining how people can find you on Facebook , and what users that are n't your friend can see .
A simple way for turning off the Facebook Platform , specifically , being able to opt- out of Facebook 's new instant personalization features and providing third - party sites with information .
A way to opt - out of sharing your friends list and the Pages that you like .
The theme here is clearly " simple " — an easier way to stop sharing information with people , websites and applications that you do n't want to have access .
That said , it looks like instant personalization instant personalization will remain on by default .
The new privacy controls will go live in the next few weeks , and Facebook will be inserting a message on user homepages alerting them to the new options .
Stay tuned to Mashable for more news and analysis on Facebook 's latest privacy moves .

Incapacitated with a broken ankle , reader lithium017 decided to spend his time doing something a bit more productive than spying on neighbors from his bedroom window :
He built a Super Mario Bros. 3 beer pong table .

To be more accurate , the six - foot - long table can serve as both a surface for playing Beer Pong on and for playing Flip Cup , both at the same time if you 'd like .
In this video , lithium017 walks us through the 100 - hour process to create the table , which features the eight worlds from the game , all enemies ( each world has ten enemies , two items and a Mario ) , seven Koopa Kids and Bowser on a castle at either end of the table and the seven Kings in the center of the table .

To play Flip Cup , players take up residence on each of the worlds , facing off against one another .
To play Beer Pong , players set up at opposite ends of the table , placing the cups over the castles , starting with Bowser 's face .
lithium017 created the table by printing out the images of the worlds , the items and the creatures as 4x6 photos and then manually cutting each out , ensuring that he followed the erratic lines created by the pixels .

MAY 24 -- For the second time in recent weeks , a chapter of the Pi Beta Phi sorority is being accused of drunkenly trashing a facility during a formal dance .
At a March 6 party sponsored by the group 's Ohio University chapter , attendees engaged in sex acts , used plates as " missiles " during food fights , vomited on carpets , defecated in urinals , and tried to tear off the clothes of a female bartender , according to a letter written by the director of the West Virginia art center where the formal was held .
In her April 6 letter to the sorority , a copy of which you 'll find here , Abby Hayhurst , head of the Parkersburg Art Center , reported that catering staff witnessed " a couple engaging in sexual congress , while surrounded by a cheering throng , " and that a bathroom sink was broken as a result of " one of your members and her date attempting to have sexual relations on it , an act which was witnessed by the event 's caterer , who walked in on them . "
The art center , which reported the damage to the Parkersburg Police Department , is seeking about $ 47,000 from the sorority , which contends that the art center has exaggerated its damages .
Last month , the Pi Beta Phi chapter at Miami University was suspended after a wild April 9 spring formal at a lakefront Ohio lodge .
In a letter detailing damages and the sorority 's wild behavior , lodge owner Lyndsay Rapier - Phipps noted that the students were " totally obliterated and behaving like immature children . "
In her letter , Rapier - Phipps mistakenly identified the rampaging sorority as Phi Delta Pi. ( 6 pages )
Senate climate legislation unveiled last week would spark a decade of multibillion - dollar investments to help overhaul how the nation produces and consumes energy , adding 200,000 jobs per year in the construction of new power plants and through greater demand for biofuels , according to a nonpartisan study ( pdf ) released today .
The Peterson Institute for International Economics said in its 18 - page report that the bill from Sens. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) creates the new jobs between 2011 and 2020 because of its mandatory limits on greenhouse gases , which will prompt $ 41.1 billion in investments per year as the nation shifts away from traditional fossil fuels like coal and oil and toward new nuclear power and renewables .
That is $ 22.5 billion more than what the country would otherwise be spending on new electricity sector investments .
But the economic boom could be short - lived .
After 2025 , as energy prices increase and certain industry - friendly provisions of the legislation phase out , employment gains would be " clawed back " to their current , business - as - usual projections .
The Peterson Institute study marks the first comprehensive review of the Senate proposal since its release last week .
Trevor Houser , a visiting fellow at the center and the report 's lead author , said his work differs from other analysis due out next month from U.S. EPA and EIA because it factors in how the Senate legislation would affect the U.S. economy at its current 10 percent unemployment rate , and by considering investments needed for an aging U.S. power system .
According to the report , the Kerry - Lieberman bill would prompt a significant reshuffle in U.S. energy supplies thanks to its greenhouse gas caps and many other complimentary policies , including stronger vehicle efficiency and renewable energy standards .
For starters , fossil fuels would fall from 84 percent of the current U.S. energy supply down to 70 percent in 2030 .
By contrast , renewables and nuclear energy would soar by 2030 from their current 8 percent rates for U.S. energy consumption , to 14 percent and 16 percent , respectively .
Compared with business - as - usual scenarios , the Senate proposal would prompt 24 gigawatts of new renewable power generation over the next 20 years , with the majority in wind ( 58 percent ) , followed by biomass ( 23 percent ) and solar ( 13 percent ) .
By 2030 , the report said renewables would account for 18 percent of all power generation capacity , up from 12 percent today , and 21 percent of all electricity production , up from 10 percent today .
The bill would spawn 68 gigawatts of new nuclear power production due to $ 36 billion in loan guarantees and a 10 percent investment tax credit for plants that are in operation by 2025 .
That means nuclear power would account for 15 percent of power generation capacity by 2030 , compared to 10 percent today .
And it also would push nuclear power to account for 30 percent of the entire country 's electricity generation in 2030 , up from 20 percent today .
Carbon capture and sequestration technologies also would get a boost from the Senate bill because of provisions that give the low - carbon option extra bonus allowances as industry ramps up its use .
According to the report , the nation would see 72 gigawatts of new CCS capacity installed between 2008 and 2030 , with 53.7 gigawatts on coal - fired power plants and 18.3 gigawatts on natural gas plants .
Natural gas also would have another 40 gigawatts deployed by 2030 because it emits less carbon than coal .
Transportation , energy efficiency
On the transportation end , the Peterson Institute report said that a combination of improved efficiency upgrades and fuel switching to ethanol , biodiesel , natural gas and electricity would help reduce U.S. oil imports by 33 percent to 40 percent below current levels and 9 to 19 percent below business - as - usual levels by 2030 .
U.S spending on imported oil also would fall by $ 51 billion to $ 93 billion per year , which cuts global oil prices and reduces oil producer revenues by $ 263 billion to $ 436 billion annually by 2030 .
Like other studies , the Peterson Institute report found that the Senate climate bill would increase the prices of fossil fuels for energy consumers and business .
Households would see an average 3 percent increase in their electricity rates and a 5 percent increase in gasoline prices ( 11 to 24 cents per gallon ) between 2011 and 2030 .
Home hearing oil prices would also average about 13 cents more per gallon compared to business as usual between 2011 and 2020 , and 25 cents more between 2021 and 2030 .
But according to the analysis , the Senate climate bill could mitigate the higher energy prices through energy efficiency improvements and emission allowances that are recycled back to consumers .
Depending on vehicle efficiency upgrades , the study found that the Senate legislation could lead to between a $ 136 increase and a $ 35 decrease in average household annual energy expenses .
The Peterson study predicts carbon prices will start at $ 16.47 per ton in 2013 , growing to $ 55.44 per ton in 2030 .
That will reduce greenhouse gases from covered industrial sources -- power plants , transportation , major manufacturers -- by 22 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 42 percent by 2030 .
Better energy efficiency and incentives for non-fossil fuel energy sources also would curb traditional air pollutants and lead to savings in water consumption .
Toxic mercury emissions would fall 43 percent below business as usual by 2030 , while nitrogen oxides drop 34 percent and sulfur dioxide by 6 percent .
Water savings are projected at 11.7 billion gallons per year through 2030 , which is nearly 2 times the nation 's annual consumption of bottled water .
Prospects for the Kerry - Lieberman legislation remain unclear .
Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) said earlier this week he will huddle next month with key committee leaders and the entire 59 - member Senate Democratic caucus to determine what type of energy and climate bill has the votes to pass off the floor this year .
Kerry welcomed the Peterson Institute 's findings .
" What greater incentive for action is needed than creating jobs and reducing our foreign oil dependency ?
This nonpartisan , hard - headed study by an institute committed to fiscal truth - telling should be an economic and security wakeup call , " he said .
The Peterson Institute 's study is the first it has done on any specific piece of Capitol Hill climate legislation .
The group is funded in part by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation .
More studies are planned on the state - by - state implications of the legislation , as well as how lower oil production revenue influences the economies and politics for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC countries .

The presence of Tariq Ali at the “ Socialism 2010 ” conference
By David Walsh
18 June 2010
If a political meeting is to be judged by its featured speakers , then the presence of Tariq Ali at “ Socialism 2010 ” is pretty definitive .
Ali is a political opportunist of the worst sort , as demonstrated by his decades - long political record .
Born into a prominent family in Lahore , his uncle the chief of Pakistan ’s military intelligence , Ali went to England to study at Oxford .
He became part of the International Marxist Group in 1968 .
The IMG was the British section of the Pabloite movement , a group specializing in political provocation , with more than its share of ‘ naughty schoolboys . ’
Dressed in Mao caps and the latest gear , they would occasionally show up at picket lines or in working class neighborhoods .
Mostly they stayed on the university campuses .
Their supporters helped produce journals such as the Black Dwarf and the Red Mole .
At a time when the Labour Party and the trade unions continued to find support in the working class and Marxists had to adopt sober tactics to dispel the illusions workers had in these organizations , the IMG opposed any such effort .
During the general election campaign in 1970 , famously , the IMG ’s Robin Blackburn advocated breaking up Labour Party meetings .
These were the most light - minded people .
In June 1974 , the adventurism of the IMG played directly into the hands of the police and the state .
At Red Lion Square in London , in a demonstration against the fascist National Front , the IMG organized a skirmish with the police , who were only too eager to oblige .
The confrontation led to the death of student Kevin Gately , 20 , the first fatality in a British protest in 55 years .
Equally damning , at the inquiry into the affair , which was headed by Lord Justice Scarman , an unidentified IMG member — who remained anonymous with the agreement of the organization ’s leadership , including Tariq Ali ! — supplied the tribunal with information contradicting the previous testimony of IMG members .
The statement was a political windfall to the state , leading to the police being absolved of responsibility for Gately ’s death .
Ali ’s brief spurt of leftism fizzled out as the radicalism of the 1970s waned .
The IMG dissolved itself as an independent organization in 1981 and its members attempted to enter the Labour Party , which it had suggested assaulting a decade earlier .
Ali joined the campaign supporting longtime left reformist Tony Benn as Labour deputy leader .
Looking for greener pastures , Ali turned to a career in publishing and the bourgeois media .
His “ Street Fighting Years ” ( the title of his boastful autobiography ) now over , Ali became a novelist and a political pundit .
He told the Guardian in May 2010 : “ It ’s a problem people have had to come to terms with at different times in history : what do you do in a period of defeat ? ”
This is the response of a middle - class freebooter who has lost his audience .
Now officially “ a former Marxist , ” Ali had even less responsibility toward the working class than when he was a member of the International Executive Committee of the “ United Secretariat ” of the Pabloite “ Fourth International . ”
Ali has never offered an explanation , anywhere , for any of his political peregrinations :
Why he supposedly adopted Trotskyism in the later 1960s , or why he abandoned it some years later ; why he wanted to disrupt Labour Party activities at one moment and later tried to install himself as a member .
He embodies the French expression , “ Before 30 a revolutionary , after 30 , a swine ! ” — except , in his case , the swinishness developed early on , and just grew .
Ali was revived somewhat by Gorbachev and perestroika in the Soviet Union in the late 1980s , which he considered a great advance for socialism .
He dedicated his book Revolution From Above : Where Is the Soviet Union Going ? , published in 1988 , to Boris Yeltsin , the man who later presided over capitalist restoration in the USSR .
His tribute declared that Yeltsin ’s “ political courage has made him an important symbol throughout the country . ”
He argued that “ The scale of Gorbachev ’s operation is , in fact , reminiscent of the efforts of an American president of the nineteenth century : Abraham Lincoln . ”
It should be noted that Ali maintained a relationship with Benazir Bhutto , the daughter of Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and a leading bourgeois politician in her own right , over the course of decades .
In his 2008 book , The Duel : Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power , Ali wrote , “ I knew [ Benazir Bhutto ] well over many years . ”
In the 1980s , after she had taken refuge in London from the Zia dictatorship , Ali acted as an unofficial advisor and continued to do so even after she became prime minister in 1988 .
As he noted in his obituary for Bhutto published in the Guardian , “ She changed again after becoming prime minister . ” ( December 29 , 2007 )
That article concludes with this effort by Ali to promote illusions in the Pakistan Peoples Party , one of the country ’s leading bourgeois parties , and the venal Pakistani ruling elite :
“ It is difficult to imagine any good coming out of this tragedy , but there is one possibility .
Pakistan desperately needs a political party that can speak for the social needs of a bulk of the people .
The People ’s party founded by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was built by the activists of the only popular mass movement the country has known : students , peasants and workers who fought for three months in 1968 - 69 to topple the country ’s first military dictator …
“ The People ’s party needs to be refounded as a modern and democratic organisation , open to honest debate and discussion , defending social and human rights , uniting the many disparate groups and individuals in Pakistan desperate for any halfway decent alternative , and coming forward with concrete proposals to stabilise occupied and war - torn Afghanistan .
This can and should be done . ”
By 2000 , Ali was writing that “ Capitalism ’s triumph at the end of the last century was sensational .
The collapse of all systemic alternatives is plainly visible . ”
In 2004 , he endorsed the Democrats ’ pro-war candidate John Kerry , arguing : “ A defeat for a warmonger government [ George W. Bush ] would be seen as a step forward …
I do n’t go beyond that , but there is no doubt in my mind that it would have an impact globally . ”
No one at the “ Socialism 2010 ” conference , we predict , will be rude enough to ask Ali about Red Lion Square , Boris Yeltsin or his role as adviser to Pakistan ’s ruling political circles .
Newzbin gossip May 18 , 2010
Posted by deepsharer in usenet
Things are moving fast at everyones favourite Usenet indexer Newzbin .
A Newzbin Editor let slip some interesting gossip to me on IRC .
Apparently Newzbin has been put into administration yesterday because it could n’t pay its debts .
Word is that they owe the MPA £ 230,000 just in interim costs , and that ’s without a full costs ruling or a decision on damages .
Apparently they also owe a software development house over £ 500 k .
They also stopped taking payments a few weeks back .
Fucking ouch .
I predict Newzbin is toast .
Does it mean the end of the service for users ?
Maybe not .
While I ca n’t see how Newzbin can dig themselves out of this hole or carry on , there have been odd developments .
Users have been pressing Newzbin to Opensource the site code but they ’ve refused .
However the rumour is that someone hacked their servers and grabbed the code and several databases .
I PM ’d a Newzbin guy and he denied knowing anything about this but the rumours are strong .
Added to which Newzbin have been hacked before : about 5 years ago a database of their Paypal transactions ended up on Usenet !
( Oh the irony ) And another Usenet indexer also turned up running , ahem , similar looking code .
If that is right I ’m guessing a clone site will spring up soon , or maybe several .
Update :
Wow .
Slightly freaked that Newzbin has both closed AND linked to this blogpost to give an explanation .
Just to say , I am nothing to do with Newzbin but I am ( OK , was , it would seem ) an editor and I knew the original guys fairly well via IRC .
I ’ll see if I can get answers to questions asked below and post the replies in new blogposts .
As someone in comments said , there is a newzbin users group on irc.freenode .
net #newzbin
Update 2 – 19th May
New story : privacy , source code refunds .
Update 3 – 19th May
The original site owners have confirmed that , based on source code fragments examined by them , and supplied by a third party , the site source code does appear to have been stolen and is in the hands of unknown parties .
An Attack of the Clones imminent ?

This was supposed to be the easiest week in the tumultuous tenure of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu .
He had settled key differences with US President Barack Obama , received an invitation for a kiss - and - make - up session at the White House and come to Canada for a large pro-Israel rally and a meeting with Stephen Harper , perhaps the world ’s most pro-Israel prime minister .
Instead , he had to deal with American support for a UN resolution supporting a Middle East nuclear free zone , IDF commandos under fire on the , and the international condemnation that came in reaction to the lives lost on the flotilla .
He spent the night at Harper ’s official residence in Ottawa but ended up convening marathon meetings with seven advisers and got no sleep .
It is no wonder that Netanyahu concluded his week frustrated , delivering an exasperated address in which he accused the world ofhypocrisy .
Officials in the Prime Minister ’s Office pointed out that heconcluded his speech differently when he read it in Hebrew and English .
The Hebrew version ended with a plea for unity , which was important tostress when the blame game was getting into high gear .
The Englishversion concluded with an appeal to the international community totreat Israel fairly , which was Netanyahu ’s reaction to the UN HumanRights Council ’s vote for an international commission of inquiry hoursearlier .
“ This may sound like an impossible plea , or an impossible request , oran impossible demand , but I make it anyway : Israel should not be heldto a double standard , ” he said .
“ The Jewish state has a right to defenditself just like any other state .
” The speech came exactly 48 hours after the first broadcast of belatedlyreleased footage showing soldiers being beaten .
The hope was thatduring those two days , the international pressure that had built upwhen the available evidence pointed to Israel as the aggressor woulddissipate .
The clip convinced even the most skeptical Israelis thattheir first impression was wrong and that the people the commandosfought were anything but human rights advocates , but its impact on theworld was disappointing .
The most obvious reason why the film failed to fix Israel ’sinternational imbroglio was that the world is obsessed with numbers .
Nomatter who was right or who attacked first , ninepassengers and no Israelis are dead .
Another reasonis that by the time the clip was broadcast , the world ’s mind wasalready made up .
Sources close to Netanyahu gave a deeper explanation .
They said that Israelis see the situation in Gaza in a more nuanced manner than theinternational community .
ISRAELIS DIFFERENTIATE between the Hamas and the people of Gaza , whothey see as victims of Hamas aggression just like Israelis in the South .
The fact that the flotilla organizers who have ties to Hamasrefused to allow the humanitarian aid on the ships to be transferred toGaza via Israel or Egypt and that Hamas has not allowed the aid intoGaza since then reinforces that for Israelis .
But much of the international community has not internalized thatanything that helps Hamas hurts both the Israelis and the Palestinians .
That ’s why the declared aim of the flotilla organizers to push forlifting the blockade on Gaza was echoed around the world , while noJewish Israeli politician called for lifting the blockade all week .
Meretz issued two statements this week , one condemning the handling ofthe flotilla and lamenting the loss of life and the other calling for acommission of inquiry .
The party would prefer a different solution thatwould encourage Gilad Schalit ’s release and preventing rocket fire fromGaza , but even it did n’t call for lifting the blockade this week .
The international community ’s condemnations suggested that Israel ’shandling of the flotilla would harm the proximity talks with the Palestinians , while Israelis understand that it was those verycondemnations that make it harder for Palestinian Authority PresidentMahmoud Abbas to withstand pressure from Hamas to break off the talks .
In a week in which Netanyahu ’s decision - making has been questioned , onemove he made proved to be prescient .
He asked his spokesman for theforeign press , Mark Regev , to remain in Israel and not accompany him onthe trip .
Normally , it would be obvious that a prime minister ’s English - languagespokesman comes with him to Canada and Washington DC .
But not in a weekin which boats of supposed humanitarian activists were bound for Gaza .
“ He told me I had to stay back because there was potential for aproblem , ” Regev said .
“ I enjoy travelling with the prime minister , buthe was 100 percent right .
The s--t hit the fan , and I was here .
” Regev , who weathered very aggressive questions from the foreign pressfrom the moment the flotilla raid began , said on Thursday that thequestions have started becoming easier and much of the internationalcommunity has finally internalized Israel ’s side of the story .
He pointed out a story in the notoriously anti-Israel British
Mexican police say 55 bodies have been recovered from an abandoned mine that appears to have been used as a mass grave by drugs gangs .
Human remains were first discovered in the silver mine near Taxco in Guerrero state at the end of May .
The bodies appeared to have been thrown down a 200 m ( 650 ft ) ventilation shaft over a period of time , police said .
Earlier reports that 77 bodies had been recovered were mistaken , officials said .
Only six have so far been identified - one was the director of a local prison .
Guerrero state is a focal point for drug - related violence that has claimed more than 22,000 lives in Mexico since 2006 .
Police are now checking other mineshafts in the area to see if bodies have also been dumped there .
Morgues overwhelmed
Police and civil defence workers used breathing equipment to descend deep underground to recover the bodies .
Image caption Recovering the bodies is proving difficult and dangerous
They are taking photos and DNA samples in the hope of identifying the dead .
Some corpses have tattoos associated with the drugs gangs , police said .
Local morgues have been overwhelmed by the number of bodies .
While most of the drug - related violence over the past four years has been concentrated in northern Mexico along the border with the US , other regions have not been immune .
Guerrero , in the south and with a Pacific coastline , has also seen bloody turf wars for control of drug smuggling routes .

For more than 25 years , our understanding of terrestrial space weather has been partly based on incorrect assumptions about how nitrogen , the most abundant gas in our atmosphere , reacts when it collides with electrons produced by energetic ultraviolet sunlight and " solar wind . "
New research published today , Tuesday 8 June , in IOP 's Journal of Physics B : Atomic , Molecular and Optical Physics describes how scientists from NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) at the California Institute of Technology have fired electrons of differing energies through a cloud of nitrogen gas to measure the ultraviolet light emitted by this collision .
The researchers have found that well - trusted measurements published in a 1985 journal paper by researchers Ajello and Shemansky contain a significant experimental error , putting decades of space weather findings dependent on this work on unstable ground .
The difference between these contemporary findings and the 1985 researchers ' work stems from the 2010 team 's improved ability to create and control the collisions and avoid the analytical pitfalls that plagued the 1985 findings .
The new results from the team at JPL suggest that the intensity of a broad band of ultraviolet light emitted from the collision changes significantly less with bombarding electron energies than previously thought .
As the ultraviolet light within the so called ' Lyman - Birge - Hopfield ' ( LBH ) band is used by the likes of NASA and the European Space Agency to better understand the physical and chemical processes occurring in our upper atmosphere and in near - Earth space , the results will give some immediate cause to reflect .
With near - Earth space playing host to our ever - growing satellite communication systems , the new more accurate measurements might unleash a greater understanding of space weather and help us better protect our space - based assets .
The findings will also help further our understanding of phenomena like Aurora Borealis ( the Northern Lights ) and similarly the Aurora Australis ( Southern Lights ) , which are caused by collisional processes involving solar wind particles exciting terrestrial oxygen and nitrogen particles at the North and South Pole .
The researchers are hopeful that their findings will also assist the Cassini project understand happenings on Saturn 's largest moon , Titan , as LBH emissions have been detected by the orbiting robotic spacecraft .
Author Dr Charles Patrick Malone from JPL said , " Our measurement of LBH energy - dependence differs significantly from widely accepted results published 25 years ago .
Aeronomers can now turn the experiment around and apply it to atmospheric studies and determine what kind of collisions produce the observed light . "

In the fall of last year The Pirate Bay took its tracker offline .
Luckily , for the stability of the BitTorrent ecosystem several new trackers emerged to take its place .
Time for us to provide an overview of the largest public BitTorrent trackers currently around .
The BitTorrent landscape has changed dramatically in the past 12 months .
The two largest BitTorrent trackers today did n’t exist a year ago , and the top tracker of last year has shut down .
The upside is that all these changes went by relatively unnoticed to the millions of downloaders .
Despite claims that millions of BitTorrent downloads would cease to work if a major BitTorrent tracker closed down , most downloaders today do n’t even notice when a tracker stops working .
Thanks to technologies such as DHT and PEX central trackers have become a luxury good to some degree .
Indeed , larger torrents with thousands of peers will work just fine without a central tracker .
But the majority of torrents out there only have a handful of peers and for these files a central tracker is still an essential part of the downloading process .
It ’s therefore good to know that several new players took the place of The Pirate Bay ’s tracker when it shut down last year .
Below we show a list of the five largest public BitTorrent trackers based on the number of torrents and peers ( downloaders +uploaders ) they track .
5 Largest BitTorrent Trackers , June 2009 # Tracker Torrents Peers Software torrentfreak.com 1 PublicBitTorrent 2,484,145 21,694,091 Opentracker 2 OpenBitTorrent 2,388,738 21,186,589 Opentracker 3 Denis .
Stalker 1,614,356 10,527,993 Opentracker 4 1337x.org 302,799 4,889,991 XBT 5 Torrent.to 326,467 3,205,170 Opentracker
The first thing that stands out in the top five above is that the first three spots are taken by standalone trackers that do not have a torrent index or search engine attached to them .
These three trackers are responsible for the coordination of millions of public downloads on BitTorrent but do not provide any torrents on their sites like The Pirate Bay used to do .
PublicBitTorrent and OpenBitTorrent , number one and two in the list , are both relatively new trackers that emerged after The Pirate Bay announced that it would sell the site last year .
This sale eventually failed to go through , but The Pirate Bay did close its tracker so both trackers became a very welcome addition to the BitTorrent ecosystem .
Another observation is that there is a lot of weight on the shoulders of the top three trackers .
Although there are close to 50,000 known BitTorrent trackers , only a fraction of these are active , and of these only a few dozen track more than 1,000 torrent files .
Without the five trackers in the list above most of the smaller public torrents could quickly become unavailable .
Although trackers in the top five are all public ones , there are a few private ones that should be in this list if it was only based on the number of torrents tracked .
The music tracker What.cd , for example , currently tracks more than 800,000 torrents alone .
A dazzling number that puts the site in fourth place based on the number of torrents , not peers .
For BitTorrent ’s long tail content reliable public trackers are still invaluable .
The good news is that the ecosystem is better off than a year ago when The Pirate Bay was carrying this burden alone , but it ’s far from bulletproof yet .
The game of Blackjack originated in France in the eighteenth century and is the most popular game in casinos around the world .
The basic rules of Blackjack are quickly and easily assimilated , the objective of Blackjack is to reach a score of 21 or beat the dealer ’s score , trying to get as close as possible to the sum of 21 are just showing , otherwise you bust .
It is played with 6 decks of 52 cards each and the rules are the following : the cards are shuffled at the beginning of each new game , the Ace is worth 1 or 11 chosen by the player , each figure is worth 10 points , cards 2 to 10 are worth their face value .
The minimum score is 17 the dealer , then the dealer is obligated to call card with 16 points or less as it is forced to stay with 17 points or more .
The minimum score of the player is 12 , so it must take another card when the total is less than 12 , it is forbidden to ask when the total is equal to 21 , in all other cases , the request is at the discretion of the player .
Configurations and game options
Blackjack
The player who gets 21 with the first two cards have made Black Jack ( which takes 21 ) and the payment of the winning is in the ratio of 3 to 2 or 1.5 times your bet .
Push
In case of a tie with the dealer the shot is null ( Push ) , and the bet on that hand is returned .
The Ace in the dealer is always 11 except when it involves overcoming 21 .
Double
If the player ’s first two cards totaling 9 , 10 or 11 he can double the mail ( if you have enough credit ) , even if already at the top , but with the right to pull a single card ( Double Pay ) .
In the case is doubled with an 8 and with an Ace ( 11 ) , receiving a 2 , is obtained 11 and not 21 , that is the eventual Ace of the pair of opening that leads to the Double is always 1 , any 2 ?
obtained as 3 ^ ace card is worth 1 or 11 depending on the best score .
Split
The player who receives two cards of the same numerical value can be separated into two hands ( Split ) always the claim and ‘ enough ; must then focus on the second hand a sum equal to the initial bet and ask the number of cards you want for each .
In this release , you can ‘ do split once , only the first hand .
If the player splits a pair of aces receive one card on each of them .
If the received card is a 10 or Figure , the maximum score achievable is always 21 ( 21 Natural ) and Black Jack ever .
Insurance
When the Dealer ’s first card is an Ace , the player can insure themselves against the eventuality ?
the dealer face Black Jack by performing Insurance with a bet equal to half the initial bet always the claim and ‘ enough .
If the dealer gets blackjack insurance is paid 2 to 1 , if you do not shape Black Jack insurance is lost .
Game dynamics
The Dealer serving the cards from a shoe containing 6 decks .
Before the cards are served , the player must choose the BET LIMIT , limit the minimum and maximum bet ( 0.2 to 2 ? , From 2 to 20 € from 10 to 50 ? ) ,
And must place his bet by clicking on the chips from 10 ?
cent to € 100 until it reaches the desired digit to bet .
Once the papers are served , the bet can not be changed .
The player receives two cards face up while the dealer one card face up .
The player can take all the cards he wants to get high , provided ? has not reached 21 .
Once the player has reached the score that considers sufficient and stops , the dealer takes another card and start playing , according to the rules .
( WOMENSENEWS ) –I now have the luxury of closing the office door while I pump .
But it ’s not always been that easy .
I ’ve pumped in bathroom stalls , in empty rooms and in front of open windows .
I ’ve searched in vain for outlets while my breasts were bursting .
There were also times I ran out of batteries mid-pump .
I had to learn the hard way not to wear a dress to work .
And I do n’t even want to talk about those damn breast pads .
The worst of it all came last week , when I left two half - sealed bags of breast milk in a paper shopping bag overnight on the top shelf of the office refrigerator .
I logged in to my work e-mail account the following morning only to discover that my milk had spilled all over the fridge–and a co-worker had already cleaned up the mess .
Sigh .
A recent online discussion explored further and possibly worse miseries .
One woman wrote of having to pump in an empty room with no lock , no chair , one eye - level plug and the occasional intruder bursting in .
Another recalled pumping in a clearly - labeled supply closet across from a conference room because it ’s the only private space available to her at work .
" I ’ve gotten more than one odd look when I come out of there after at least 15 minutes , " she wrote .
Another told of having to pump in the bathroom stall for seven months .
A younger coworker was so mystified by the " whirring machine " in the bathroom stall that she asked a colleague if she was self - administering chemotherapy .
Our ever - worsening horror stories remind me of the Monty Python sketch about the privations of childhood , where the characters keep topping each other until we get to the absurd recollection of waking up in the morning a half an hour before going to bed and working 29 hours a day .
Health reform to the rescue !
Victory for Working Mothers
A little - mentioned provision in the new health reform law requires employers to provide workers with a reasonable amount of time and a private space–other than a bathroom –to express milk .
The break time is unpaid and it lasts only a year , but still , this is a significant , long - awaited and much - needed victory for working mothers .
Hallelujah !
Two other sweet provisions for mothers are also tucked into the health reform bundle .
One is the $ 1.5 billion for nurse home - visitation programs such as the Nurse - Family Partnership , based in Denver , which for three years will send registered nurses to the homes of first - time mothers who are low - income .
I can’t imagine money better spent .
It ’s hard enough for women of means to keep up with the stream of prenatal visits , which , if I recall , start out at a reasonable rate of once - a - month but by the ninth month take place every week .
My two boys are now nearly 3 and 1 , but it used to take a huge chunk out of my workday when I was pregnant to get to the hospital , park , wait in the doctor ’s office , see the doctor and then drive home .
It also took a huge chunk out of my wallet to pay for gas , parking and child care for at least three hours , not to mention the co-pays and other insurance fees .
After my deliveries the doctor visits seemed endless .
They start at birth and then take place at two days , four days , one week , two weeks , one month , three months , six months , nine months , one year , 18 months and two years–or something like that , according to my blurred memory of it all .
Throw in all the countless visits for everything from newborn acne to ear infections to feeding problems and new parents practically live at the doctor ’s office .
Postpartum Depression Support
Another provision of the law provides $ 3 million for 2010 to support programs serving women suffering from postpartum depression and psychosis .
Congress also authorized the secretary of Health and Human Services to supplement this funding with other available resources for 2011 and 2012 .

Mogadishu , Somalia ( APA ) - slamist militants of the Hezbal Islam rebel group have killed two football fans and arrested ten others after attacking a house where fans were watching the World Cup game between Argentina and Nigeria in the Huruwaa neighborhood north - east of the capital Mogadishu on Saturday .
Residents say that heavily armed militants stormed a house where football fans were secretly watching the match , which has been prohibited in the Islamist - controlled regions in Somalia .
“ Two young men who tried to jump over the wall were shot and killed while ten others including my husband and my teenage son were taken to Islamist custody in the village ” Halima Ahmed , a mother of five children said in a telephone interview with APA on Sunday morning .
Islamist militia leader Sheikh Mohamed Abu Abdalla said that those in custody have broken the law and will be dealt with in accordance with Islamic law .
Prior to the World Cup opening , the Islamists in Somalia warned people against watching the matches , saying that it was not compatible with Islamic law and that those founding watching football will be brought before Islamic courts .
“ Football descended from the old Christian cultures and our Islamic administration will never allow watching it .
We are giving our last warning to the people , ” Sheikh Abu Yahya Al Iraqi said , while addressing crowds in the Suqa Holaha village north of Mogadishu , hours before the World Cup kick off on Friday .
The president of the Somali Football Federation Said Mahmoud Nur who was reached for comment while in South Africa , declined to comment on the matter because of security reasons .
Meanwhile , residents in the southern Jubba regions have sent a complaint letter to the Al Shabab administration in the regions demanding permission to watch the world ’s largest sporting event .
Reports say that representatives from the community including elders went to the Al Shabab administrative office in the southern port town of Kismayo Saturday requesting permission to watch the World Cup , but they were denied and told that they will be arrested if they ever again come with such demands .
In 2006 , the Islamic Courts Union who were then controlling most of Somalia banned watching the World Cup , describing football as a “ satanic act ” and as a result , two football fans were also killed and scores arrested in the city of Dhusamareeb in central Somalia when heavily armed militants raided a cinema where they were watching a World Cup game .

Thanks ,
Diane , for sending me this .
By the time I saw it , it was all over the news .
Ugly , is n’t it ?
BP probably held it back , because analysis of the video reveals that the leak is over 70,000 barrels a day .
The original estimate from the Coast Guard , based on BP data was 5,000 barrels per day .
So what we have is one Exxon Valdez disaster every four days .
Democrats in the Senate are trying to raise the liability cap from $ 75 million to $ 10 billion .
That ’s still too low .
BP annual profit is double that .
The only cap for a disaster of this magnitude is $ infinity .
But even the overly lax cap of $ 10 billion is too much for the GOP .
Alaska ’s senior senator blocked legislation Thursday that would have dramatically increased liability caps on oil companies , in the wake of one of the industry ’s biggest disasters .
Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R - Alaska ) objected to a voice vote request by Sen. Robert Menendez ( D - N.J. ) on the bill , which would have spiked the maximum liability for oil companies after an oil spill from $ 75 million to $ 10 billion .
The legislation has significant support from Democrats , and the White House has indicated it backs an increase in liability caps .
But Murkowski said the legislation is “ not where we need to be right now ” and would unfairly advantage large oil companies by pricing the small companies out of the market .
Murkowski did signal that she would be open to " look at the liability cap and consider raising it . ”
Just not at this moment .
Menendez , speaking to reporters after the bill was halted on the Senate floor , said the opposition indicates that Republicans are on the side of the oil companies , not the American people .
There had been no formal floor debate or roll call vote requested on the legislation .
“ It ’s straightforward , it ’s common sense , ” Menendez said .
“ Either you want to fully protect the small businesses , individuals and communities devastated by a man-made disaster — this is not a natural disaster ; this is a man-made disaster — or you want to protect multibillion - dollar oil companies from being held fully accountable .
Apparently there are some in the Senate who prefer to protect the oil companies . ” … [ emphasis added ]
Inserted from < Politico >
Murkowski offered two main arguments .
First is that Big Oil has unlimited liability already , because anyone can sue them .
Tell that to the victims of Exxon Valdez spill .
After twenty years , many have died of old age waiting to see the first penny .
The people whose livelihoods are gone need justice now , not 20 - 30 years from now … if the live that long .
Second , Murkowski argued that it would put “ mom and pop ” operators out of business by making the cost of their liability insurance so high that they could not afford to operate .
Earth to Murkowski !
Is anyone home ?
There are no mom and pop companies in deep offshore drilling .
If there were , any company that cannot afford liability for the damage they cause has no business being in business .
If I ca n’t afford auto liability insurance , I have no business driving a car .
Many in the GOP are shaking their heads in mock shock that one lone Senator could do such a thing .
Do n’t you dare believe that !
Theses greedy Republicans goose step in lock step .
Murkowski was assigned this role , because she does not face reelection until 2014 .
The GOP is seeking to help Big Oil avoid responsibility without appearing to do so .
The Twitter Devolution
Before one of the major Iranian protests of the past year , a journalist in Germany showed me a list of three prominent Twitter accounts that were commenting on the events in Tehran and asked me if I knew the identities of the contributors .
I told her I did , but she seemed disappointed when I told her that one of them was in the United States , one was in Turkey , and the third — who specialized in urging people to " take to the streets " — was based in Switzerland .
Perhaps I shattered her dreams of an Iranian " Twitter Revolution . "
The Western media certainly never tired of claiming that Iranians used Twitter to organize and coordinate their protests following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s apparent theft of last June ’s elections .
Even the American government seemed to get in on the act .
Former U.S. national security adviser Mark Pfeifle claimed Twitter should get the Nobel Peace Prize because " without Twitter the people of Iran would not have felt empowered and confidant to stand up for freedom and democracy . "
And the U.S. State Department reportedly asked Twitter to delay some scheduled maintenance in order to allow Iranians to communicate as the protests grew more powerful .
But it is time to get Twitter ’s role in the events in Iran right .
Simply put :
There was no Twitter Revolution inside Iran .
As Mehdi Yahyanejad , the manager of " Balatarin , " one of the Internet ’s most popular Farsi - language websites , told the Washington Post last June , Twitter ’s impact inside Iran is nil .
" Here [ in the United States ] , there is lots of buzz , " he said .
" But once you look , you see most of it are Americans tweeting among themselves . "
A number of opposition activists have told me they used text messages , email , and blog posts to publicize protest actions .
However , good old - fashioned word of mouth was by far the most influential medium used to shape the postelection opposition activity .
There is still a lively discussion happening on Facebook about how the activists spread information , but Twitter was definitely not a major communications tool for activists on the ground in Iran .
Nonetheless , the " Twitter Revolution " was an irresistible meme during the post- election protests , a story that wrote itself .
Various analysts were eager to chime in about the purported role of Twitter in the Green Movement .
Some were politics experts , like the Atlantic ‘s Andrew Sullivan and Marc Ambinder .
Others were experts on new media , like Sascha Segan of PC Magazine .
Western journalists who could n’t reach — or did n’t bother reaching ?
— people on the ground in Iran simply scrolled through the English - language tweets posted with tag #iranelection .
Through it all , no one seemed to wonder why people trying to coordinate protests in Iran would be writing in any language other than Farsi .
A pristine instance of this myopia was a profile , published in Britain ’s Guardian newspaper , of Oxfordgirl , a Twitter blogger who was described as " a key player " in Iran ’s postelection unrest .
" Before they started blocking mobile phones , I was almost coordinating people ’s individual movements — ‘ go to such and such street , ’ or ‘ do n’t go there , the Basij are waiting , ’ " she was quoted as saying .
It ’s a riveting story — but the reporter failed to ask how Oxfordgirl managed to communicate with residents of Tehran via cell phone when the Iranian government shut down the whole city ’s mobile network , as it always did on days of protest .
Oxfordgirl was ultimately more successful at gaining publicity for herself than at helping any protesters in Iran .
Compare her 10,000 Twitter followers with the 300 followers of a Karaj - based Green activist ( who prefers not to be identified or to have his Twitter page publicized ) .
The activist tweets in Persian , which few Western journalists can read , and he is often a source of valuable information about the mood in the country .
The story of Oxfordgirl gives a clue about the real role that Twitter played .
There is no doubt that she helped spread news about the Iranian protests — often very quickly .
Twitter played an important role in getting word about the events in Iran out to the wider world .
Together with YouTube , it helped focus the world ’s attention on the Iranian people ’s fight for democracy and human rights .
New media over the last year created and sustained unprecedented international moral solidarity with the Iranian struggle — a struggle that was being bravely waged many years before Twitter was ever conceived .
But an honest accounting of Twitter ’s role in Iran would also note its pernicious complicity in allowing rumors to spread .
It began with the many unsubstantiated reports from the protests .
In the early days of the post- election crackdown a rumor quickly spread on Twitter that police helicopters were pouring acid and boiling water on protesters .
A year later it remains just that : a rumor .
Other Twitter stories were quickly debunked , like the suggestion that circulated in late June that Mousavi had been arrested at his home in Tehran .
Twitter followers of #iranelection also helped quickly name Saeedeh Pouraghayi — who was allegedly arrested for chanting " Allah Akbar " on her rooftop , only to be raped , disfigured and murdered — a new " martyr " of the Green Movement .
Her tragic story quickly made the rounds on Twitter and other social networking websites .
Mouasvi and his aides even reportedly attended a commemoration ceremony that was held for her in Tehran .
Yet the whole story turned out to be a hoax .
Pouraghayi later appeared on a program on Iran ’s state television and said that on the night when she was supposedly arrested , she had escaped by jumping off her balcony .
In the intervening two months , she said was being treated at the home of the person who found her in the street .
A reformist website later wrote that the Iranian government had planted the story in order to cast doubt on opposition claims about the rape of post- election detainees and pave the way for further arrests of opposition leaders .
Twitter , it seems , can serve the purposes of Iran ’s regime as easily as it can aid the country ’s activists .
To be clear :
It ’s not that Twitter publicists of the Iranian protests have n’t played a role in the events of the past year .
They have .
It ’s just not been the outsized role it ’s often been made out to be .
And ultimately , that ’s been a terrible injustice to the Iranians who have made real , not remote or virtual , sacrifices in pursuit of justice .
AN artist has been paid $ 10,000 to float 10,000 paper planes in Victoria 's State Library .
Ross Coulter wants to track " thought patterns " in the La Trobe ( Domed ) Reading Room by releasing the planes from balcony " stacks " , and will use a Georges Mora Foundation Fellowship to pay for the project , the Herald Sun reports .
" It 's going to be part performance and part video artwork , " he said .
" A playful act of rebellion in a way .
But then creativity has always been bound up with rebellious acts . "
Yesterday Coulter was one of 11 writers , artists and researchers who were awarded $ 150,000 to " make scholarly , literary or creative use " of the library 's rich collections .
The Creative Fellowships , now in their seventh year , foster the creation of new work and provide office space for winners .
In his fellowship application for Ten Thousand Paper Planes , Coulter - a former library staff member - said he wanted to make " original use " of the Reading Room by releasing 10,000 paper planes into the space and video - taping their descent .
" While there is simplicity in this artwork , there are logistical , organisation and creative challenges that will further my development as an artist , " he wrote .
Fellowship judges saw merit in this and approved finance for six months .
A launch date has yet to be set for Ten Thousand Paper Planes .
In the meantime , Coulter will photographically document the Reading Room and do plane test runs .
" I 'm not so much going for speed and distance , " he said .
" I 'm interested in the aerobatic qualities . "

Stop NATO , June 11 , 2010
This week news about the U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization armed conflict in Afghanistan , the largest and longest - running war in the world , has begun to penetrate the wall of triumphalism and complacency erected by Washington during the past year�s unparalleled military escalation in the South Asian nation .
Between the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States on January 20 , 2009 and now , the number of American troops in the war zone has almost tripled , from 32,000 to 94,000 , with the total to reach 100,000 in upcoming weeks .
Late last month U.S. combat forces in Afghanistan for the first time outnumbered those in Iraq , 94,000 compared to 92,000 .
There will soon also be an aggregate of 50,000 armed forces provided by Washington�s NATO allies and NATO partnership nations .
The 150,000 U.S. and allied troops in place by this summer will exceed by tens of thousands the largest amount of foreign forces ever before stationed in Afghanistan :
An estimated 118,000 Soviet troops that constituted the high water mark of the USSR�s deployment between late 1979 and early 1989 . [ 1 ]
The territory of what is now Afghanistan was invaded in remote times by Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan among other conquerors , but the first two armed attacks against Afghanistan itself were in 1839 and 1878 , in both cases by English and colonial troops invading from British India .
In the First Anglo - Afghan War of 1839 �1842 over 20,000 British and Indian troops invaded the country , ending in an inglorious � a disastrous � rout for the aggressors .
In the Second Anglo - Afghan War of 1878 �1880 Britain invaded with a force of 40,000 troops and that incursion also culminated in a withdrawal to India .
The Third Anglo - Afghan War of 1919 was a three - month campaign waged by London against the government of Amanullah Khan which ended in a stalemate and in the effective independence of Afghanistan as a modern nation .
The 150,000 U.S. and NATO International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) troops in the country , then , represent the largest invasion , occupation and foreign warfighting force in Afghanistan�s history .
They are also the most diverse military force not only in Afghan but in any nation�s experience : Armed combatants from as many as fifty nations and all continents except uninhabited Antarctica .
On June 7 mainstream American media acknowledged that the war in Afghanistan is now their country�s longest one , with Washington having entered month 104 of a conflict that began on October 7 , 2001 .
The most protracted war before had been that in Vietnam .
Current calculations based on the beginning of the American role in major and independent combat operations in that Southeast Asian nation � from the Tonkin Gulf Resolution passed by the U.S. Congress on August 7 , 1964 � to the withdrawal of the last American combat troops in March of 1973 total 103 months .
In fact it took several months for the Pentagon to act on the resolution and as such the Afghan war has already been the lengthiest in America�s history , but the formal recognition of it as such is now a matter of public record .
As for Afghanistan itself , the first Soviet troops entered the country on December 24 , 1979 and the final troop withdrawal began on May 15 , 1988 and ended on February 15 , 1989 , a total of 102 and 111 months respectively .
By the beginning of next year U.S. troops will have been in Afghanistan longer than Soviet ones were .
On June 8 CNN ( Cable News Network ) featured an online report stating " The United States passed [ a ] grim milestone " on that date with the death of its 1001st soldier in Afghanistan .
The next day four more American soldiers were killed when a helicopter they were traveling in was shot down in Afghanistan�s Helmand Province .
The independent iCasualties website had already estimated 1,108 U.S. soldiers killed in and around Afghanistan ( that is , also in Pakistan and Uzbekistan ) and previous accounts had mentioned deaths in excess of 1,000 in the sixteen - nation greater Operation Enduring Freedom area of operations , but the acknowledgement of over 1,000 U.S. fatalities in Afghanistan alone by the commercial media is another landmark .
American deaths this year are now at least at the 165 mark , compared to 327 for all of last year and 155 in 2008 according to iCasualties .
Total foreign military losses since 2001 are over 1,800 .
Britain lost its 294th soldier on June 9 , the highest number of combat deaths the United Kingdom has registered since the counterinsurgency war in Malaya in the 1950s and 39 more than in the 1982 war with Argentina over the Falklands / Las Malvinas .
Two days before Canada lost its 147th soldier , the highest military death toll for the nation since the Korean War .
On the same day a Polish forward operating base in the province of Ghazni came under rocket attack and four Polish soldiers were wounded .
On June 1 Denmark announced the first - ever death of a female service member in an improvised explosive device attack in Helmand Province .
With the five American and British deaths on June 9 , NATO has lost at least 29 soldiers in the first nine days of this month .
Ten foreign soldiers were killed on June 7 alone , including two Australian and one French serviceman .
The deaths occurred both in southern and eastern Afghanistan .
Ahead of what has been planned as the largest military offensive of the nearly nine - year war , the assault against the southern province of Kandahar and in particular the city of the same name which is its capital , the initiative does not appear to be with the U.S. and NATO .
The campaign was scheduled to begin this month and culminate in August when combined U.S. and NATO troop strength in Afghanistan will reach 150,000 .
On the morning of June 9 fifty NATO tankers transporting oil and other supplies were attacked only fifty kilometers south of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad .
According to earlier reports , top U.S. and NATO commander Stanley McChrystal is amassing over 25,000 troops � American , NATO and Afghan government � for the offensive in the city of Kandahar .
The Daily Telegraph recently reported that " British military intelligence estimates there are between 500 and 1,000 insurgents who operate regularly in the area , " [ 2 ] which would mean as high as a 50 - 1 ratio of U.S. - led troops to Afghan insurgents , comparable to February�s attack on the town of Marjah in neighboring Helmand Province where 15,000 U.S. - and NATO - led forces faced as few as 400 armed fighters . [ 3 ]
The Kandahar operation is still scheduled to commence this month and " will focus on Kandahar city and the farmland around it , and could take from four to six months .
While Nato commanders are promising a low - key , Afghan - led approach to Kandahar city itself , international troops are preparing for combat operations in some of the areas around the city . " [ 4 ]
Despite the pledge by President Obama that after what was touted in advance as a victory in Kandahar and throughout the war - wracked nation to begin drawing down U.S. and NATO troops in 2011 , all indications are that Western forces will remain in Afghanistan long after that .
Far longer than any foreign military power has ever stayed in the nation before in a war that is already the longest in American history . [ 5 ]

Led by “ Gumus ” ( “ Noor ” in Arabic ) , a wave of Turkish melodramas , police procedurals and conspiracy thrillers  “ Yaprak Dokumu , ” “ Kurtlar Vadisi , ” “ Asmali Konak , ” “ Ihlamurlar Altinda ” and now the steamy “ Ask - i Memnu , ” the top-rated series in Turkey ( think Madame Bovary on the Bosporus )  are making their way onto Arab televisions , wielding a kind of soft power .
Through the small screen , Turkey has begun to exercise a big influence at Arab dinner tables , in boardrooms and bedrooms from Morocco to Iraq of a sort that the United States can only dream about .
Turkey ’s cultural exports , not coincidentally , have also advanced its political ambitions as it asserts itself on that front , too , sending a flotilla to Gaza , defying the United States over sanctions on Iran , talking tough to its onetime ally , Israel , and giving Kemal Ataturk ’s constitutionally secular state an Islamic tinge .
Politics and culture go hand in hand , here as elsewhere .
If most Arabs watch Turkish shows to ogle beautiful people in exotic locales , Arab women have also made clear their particular admiration for the rags - to - riches story of the title character in “ Noor , ” a strong , business - savvy woman with a doting husband named Muhannad .
Dr. Shafira Alghamdi , a Saudi pediatrician , was on vacation here the other day , shopping with two Saudi friends , and volunteered how Arab husbands often ignore their wives , while on “ Noor , ” within what remains to Arabs a familiar context of arranged marriages , respect for elders and big families living together , Noor and Muhannad openly love and admire each other .
“ A lot of Saudi men have gotten seriously jealous of Muhannad because their wives say , ‘ Why ca n’t you be more like him ? ’ ” Dr. Alghamdi said .
Meanwhile , she was illustrating another consequence of the show : the sudden , spectacular boom in Arab tourism to Turkey .
Millions of Arabs now flock here .
Turkish Airlines has started direct flights to gulf countries ( using soap stars as spokespeople ) .
Turkish travel companies charter boats to ferry Arabs who want a glimpse of the waterfront villa where “ Noor ” was filmed .
The owner recently put the house on the market for $ 50 million .
Until lately he charged $ 60 for a tour , more than four times the price of a ticket to the Topkapi Palace .

The show ’s finale drew millions of viewers .

Even fatwas by Saudi clerics calling for the murder of the soap ’s distributors have n’t discouraged a store in Gaza City from hawking knockoffs of Noor ’s sleeveless dresses ( long - sleeved leotards included , to preserve feminine modesty ) .
A recent cartoon in a Saudi newspaper showed a homely Saudi man visiting a plastic surgeon , toting a picture of Noor ’s husband , who is played by Kivanc Tatlitug , a blue - eyed former basketball player turned model turned actor who also plays the philandering Adonis in “ Ask - i - Memnu . ”
The man in the cartoon asks the surgeon if he can get Mr. Tatlitug ’s stubbled good looks .
It seemed like harmless fun when Steve and Marsha Voltz signed up as contestants on The Newlywed Game .
Now their appearance on the marginally popular GSN show has resulted in Chrislip ’s first murder in nearly eight weeks .
The trouble began when host Carnie Wilson asked the question : “ Gentlemen , fill in the blank .
‘ I love my wife , but her [ blank ] is just too big ’. ”
Marsha predicted that Steve would say “ her collection of ceramic unicorns . ”
She seemed taken aback when Steve turned over his card to reveal that he ’d written “ her genitals . ”
Since arriving back in Chrislip , Marsha has been the object of much teasing and wise comments from her fellow townsfolk .
Although the show revealed funny secrets about her cooking and housekeeping skills , most of the jokes , for some reason , have been directed at her private parts .
Last Saturday , Marsha took her revenge against the man who let the cat out of the bag .
Police say that she climbed into her Honda Civic and ran over Steve multiple times in their driveway .
Neighbors called 911 , but Steve was dead by the time paramedics arrived .
Marsha claimed it was an accident .
Police , however , found a message on her sister ’s voice - mail that seemed to indicate some measure of pre-meditation .
The message concluded with “ Gotta go kill Steve now .
Love ya.
Buh - bye . ”
Chrislip ’s sheriff hopes the incident will serve as a learning experience for other women .
“ They stressed this time and time again at the police academy .
If your down - belows look funny , you ’ve got one problem .
If you kill somebody because of it … sister , you ’ve got two problems . ”

As oil continues to spew into the Gulf of Mexico , there are fears about the potential for another smaller spill in Papua New Guinea .
Two big oil tanks are leaking heavy fuel oil close to the sea on the island of Bougainville .
The tanks used to fuel the massive Panguna copper mine before it was abandoned more than 20 years ago because of a bloody civil war .
The mine 's Australian owner says it wants to clean up the leaks , but Bougainville is still too dangerous for its workers to return .
It has been more than 20 years since the two large fuel tanks at the port of Loloho on Bougainville 's east coast had any maintenance .
Back then , the resentment local landowners felt towards the Panguna copper mine sparked a decade long - civil war that forced the mine 's closure .
Now the tanks are leaking and the ground around them is coated in thick heavy fuel oil .
A black lake lies between the tanks and there are fears it could get worse .
" There 's a faint crack down through there , " said Ron Blenkiron from South Pacific Environmental , a company that wants to clean up the leak .
" This is about 20 mil thick at the bottom here but these cracks will still open up in an earthquake or anything serious like that , so it 's definitely an issue . "
The tanks are only a stone 's throw from the ocean and Mr Blenkiron says the system put in place to contain leaks has broken down .
An oil - soaked pit , just metres from the water , is the last barrier preventing the fuel from leaking into the sea .
" During the wet season , when we first came here , this pit was basically full of water and the oil was about 50 mils from running into the sea , so it was pretty close , " Mr Blenkiron said .
" You 're living on the edge of a catastrophe here . "
More mess
Mr Blenkiron says the oil is not the only potential hazard left behind when the mine was abandoned in the late 1980s .
A few hundred metres up the road are the rusting remains of a storage area for chemicals used in the mining process .
Mr Blenkiron has written to the mine 's Australian owner , Bougainville Copper Limited ( BCL ) , and offered to clean up the area for a price .
But BCL has declined .
" I believe that BCL is morally responsible to clean up , " Mr Blenkiron said .
" I mean , sure they may have got chased out of here rightly or wrongly a number of years ago but there 's no danger in coming down here .
The people are welcoming .
They 're easy to work with . "
BCL 's chairman Peter Taylor , based in Port Moresby , does not believe the leaking tanks pose a danger to the environment .
" There 's no disaster there , " he said .
" There is what I call a relatively minor oil spill that 's been contained by the safety systems that were put in place .
And really it seems to me it 's just a case of going in and cleaning that up . "
Mr Taylor says vandals caused the leaks and most of the oil has already been stolen .
He rejects the claim there is other toxic chemicals in the area , saying New Zealand peacekeepers assessed the port in 1997 and removed anything dangerous .
Dangerous region
Mr Taylor says BCL wants to clean up the spill , but more than a decade after the civil war ended , he believes Bougainville is still not safe for his employees .
" Unfortunately there are a few people , and I think they 're now well and truly in the minority who refuse to allow us access and some of these people unfortunately have got guns , " Mr Taylor said .
There is no doubt law and order is still a problem in Bougainville .
Twice this year foreign ships have docked at Loloho without customs clearance and pumped oil out of the tanks , without approval from BCL .
There are also plenty of guns on the island that are yet to be disposed of in line with the Bougainville Peace Agreement that ended the civil war .
So why does n't BCL use South Pacific Environmental , who are already on the ground , to clean up the leak ?
" We 've done some research to try and find out what their credentials are and as far as I can see they have no experience in actually doing any sort of environmental remediation work , " Mr Taylor said .
Mr Taylor is hopeful BCL will be able to return to the island soon , not only to clean up but also to resume mining .
" The landowners are now approaching the company and saying ' we 'd like you to come back , we 'd like you to do various things including the remediation of anything that might be in any way dangerous ' , " he said .

A Prescott radio host embroiled in a controversy over a school mural is off the air , while the mural wo n't be subject to a whitewash order .
Steve Blair , who also holds a seat on the Prescott City Council , was let go from his talk radio show after drawing fire for his opposition to an environmental mural painted on an elementary school .
The " Go to Green " mural , based on the faces of children who attend the school , drew local criticism for featuring minority children .
The school district has reversed its request to lighten the faces of the students in the mural , after attracting national attention with the move .
" Shame on us if we can't say , ' We made a mistake and we 're sorry , ' " said Prescott Unified School District Superintendent Kevin Kapp on Saturday .
" From the very get - go , every time I drove by this beautiful mural , I got a wonderful feeling of pride and pleasure at the work these Mural Mice have done , " said Kapp at a rally in front of the mural .
" Miller Valley made a mistake .
When we asked them to lighten the mural , we made a mistake , " said Miller Valley Elementary School Principal Jeff Lane .
The mural artists should " go back to the original intent , which is to absolutely celebrate Miller Valley Elementary School and its efforts to go green , as well as celebrate the four beautiful children on this mural , " said Kapp .
" It is okay that this issue has become a major issue , " said Kapp .
" It 's good for the town to stand up once in a while and take a look at itself , and this mural has done that . "
With the loss of his radio spot , Blair may not hold the same opinion .
" I am no longer the KYCA 1490 p.m. guy , " Blair told PrescottENews.com .
" I 'm going to be the afternoon ' water my garden ' guy . "
" It was defacing a public building , of a historic nature , " Blair said when interviewed after losing his radio job .
" Nobody bothered to let the community know what that mural was supposed to depict , made it very difficult even to buy in on what the mission statement of that mural was supposed to be , " said Blair .
" It was too big , too in your face , wrong place , wrong time , " said Blair .
" It looked like a guy , in my opinion , a black guy , brown guy holding a stick , and flowers and stuff , what was it supposed to mean ?
If they say it means going green , what does that mean ? "
R.E. Wall , director of Prescott 's Downtown Mural Project , told USA Today that he and other artists heard slurs from passersby as they worked on the painting .
" We consistently , for two months , had people shouting racial slander from their cars , " Wall said .
" We had children painting with us , and here come these yells of ( epithet for Blacks ) and ( epithet for Hispanics ) . "
He said principal Lane pressed him to make the children 's faces appear happier and brighter .
Lane said in USA Today that he received only three complaints about the mural and that his request for a touch - up had nothing to do with political pressure .
" We asked them to fix the shading on the children 's faces , " he said .
" We were looking at it from an artistic view .
Nothing at all to do with race . "
Wall blames the controversy on comments by Blair on his local radio talk show , reports the Prescott Daily Courier .
On his May 21 show , for instance , Blair said , " I am not a racist individual , but I will tell you depicting a black guy in the middle of that mural , based upon who 's president of the United States today and based upon the history of this community when I grew up , we had four black families - who I have been very good friends with for years - to depict the biggest picture on that building as a black person , I would have to ask the question , ' Why ? ' "
On Wednesday , Blair again emphasized that " I 'm not a racist by any stretch of the imagination , but whenever people start talking about diversity , it 's a word I can't stand . "
Blair questions whether the mural is representative of Prescott , noting , " The focus does n't need to be on what 's different ; the focus does n't need to be on the minority all the time . "
Blair said he has received a number of calls from long - time Prescott residents who ask , " Who authorized that graffiti on the wall ? "
He added : " What these people do n't like is somebody forcing diversity down their throats . "
The “ Go on Green ” mural covers two walls outside Miller Valley Elementary School , and it aims to advertise a campaign for environmentally friendly transportation .
It features portraits of four children , and a Hispanic boy as the predominant figure .

Deputy Opposition Leader Julie Bishop has been forced to back away from comments in which she suggested Australian intelligence authorities had used forged passports .
Ms Bishop maintains the Government overreacted in deciding to expel an Israeli diplomat from Canberra over the use of forged Australian passports in the assassination of a Hamas leader .
She says it is naive to think Israel is the only country using forged passports in intelligence operations .
When she was asked if she believes Australia does , she replied yes .
" There is no actual proof that the Israeli government was involved , " Ms Bishop said on Monday .
" There is an assumption .
And in the absence of actual proof I believe that the expulsion of a diplomat is either an over - reaction or a calculated political decision .
" It would be naive to think that Israel is the only country in the world that has used forged passports , including Australian passports , for security operations . "
But Ms Bishop has now issued a statement saying she did not state that Australian intelligence authorities have forged the passports of other nations .
She says she was referring to the fact forged Australian passports have previously been used .
The statement did not stop Prime Minister Kevin Rudd launching a scathing rebuke of Ms Bishop , accusing her of acting against the interests of national security .
He says there is a long - standing convention that neither side of politics comments on intelligence activities .
" Today that convention has been breached , " he said .
" This is fundamentally contrary to Australia 's national security interests . "
Earlier in Question Time , Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said he was shocked by her statements and that she was not fit to occupy a position of trust .

The label on my shower spray cleaner claims it ’s supposed to smell like ylang ylang .
To me it smells like , well , chemicals .
I was curious to see whether any real ylang ylang actually made its way into my cleaner , so I looked up the ingredients online .
No ylang ylang ( or any other plant for that matter ) in sight .
Near the end of a long list of ingredients were the words “ fragrance oil . ”
Mysterious .
Is my shower spray hiding something ?
The environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice thinks it might be .
Turns out that despite a New York state law that requires manufacturers of cleaning products to disclose the ingredients in their products , very few manufacturers are willing to cough up the full list .
Earthjustice contacted dozens of companies and asked them to comply with the law , but four major manufacturers refused .
( Full list of companies and products below . )
Earthjustice and a coalition of other environmental groups responded by suing them ( PDF ) .
Jamie Silberberger is the director of programs and policy at Women ’s Voices for the Earth , another group in the coalition .
“ We know that there are chemicals in cleaning products that are linked to reproductive harm , asthma , and a whole host of other problems , ” says Silberberger .
“ But if consumers do n’t know what ’s in these products , they ca n’t make an informed decision about what to buy .
We have the right to know what we ’re being exposed to . ”
What we do know :
Many common ingredients pose risks both to humans and the environment .
Alkylphenol ethoxylates ( APEs ) , which are used as “ surfactants ” to make cleaning solutions spread over a surface smoothly , are an endocrine disruptor and are banned in Europe .
Ethanolamine , also a surfactant , can cause asthma attacks .
Most troubling : Even chemicals that are relatively innocuous on their own can combine to create toxic substances .
Ammonia and chlorine , for example , can form a toxic gas called chloramine , which can cause a whole host of respiratory symptoms .
When all those chemicals end up in waterways , it ’s bad news for wildlife .
A few companies ( including those being sued ) have set up a voluntary ingredient disclosure agreement , but Silberberger says it is incomplete : manufacturers are allowed to simply use the words “ dyes , ” “ preservatives , ” and “ fragrances ” instead of actually listing the ingredients in the additives .
Scary , considering fragrances often contain phthalates , among other potentially toxic chemicals .
Another problem : Companies are only required to list “ intentional ingredients , ” meaning substances created by combining two ingredients or added during the manufacturing process are n’t listed .
What ’s more , the website is controlled by the industry , meaning companies make their own rules .
Points out Earthjustice ’s Kathleen Sutcliffe , “ If they ’re listing their products on the website , then why are they still refusing to file them with New York state ? ”
There is some good news : S.C. Johnson has announced that it will list its product ingredients on a website .
The California - based eco-cleaner manufacturer Simple Green reported its ingredients to Earthjustice ( PDF ) .
Or you could make your own .
Earthjustice has a few recipes , and ( contain yourselves ) even instructions on how to host your own green cleaning party this week .
Are there mystery ingredients in your favorite cleaner ?

Colgate - Palmolive :
1. Ajax Fabuloso All - Purpose Cleaner
2. Dynamo
3. Murphy Oil Soap ( wood cleaner , soap spray , soft wipes )

Image caption Robert Gates said Turkey was being denied an " organic " link to the West
Turkey 's growing hostility to Israel may have been partly caused by its effective rejection by the European Union , the US defence secretary says .
Robert Gates said Turkey may have been " pushed by some in Europe " away from the EU and into closer partnerships with states like Iran .
Turkey has been put on the path to EU membership , but countries like France and Germany are openly opposed .
Turkey and Israel 's once - close alliance has come under severe strain .
Their relations were already deteriorating before Israeli troops stormed a ship carrying aid to Gaza last month , killing nine Turks .
' Matter of concern '
Turkey 's President , Abdullah Gul , said relations between the two countries would " never be the same " , while Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc accused Israel of " piracy " and " barbarism and oppression " .
I think we have to think long and hard about why these developments in Turkey [ occurred ]
Robert Gates , US secretary of defence
Turkey has also strengthened ties with Iran , firmly opposing sanctions over its nuclear programme .
" The deterioration in the relationship between Turkey and Israel over the past year - or - so is a matter of concern , " Mr Gates said during a visit to London .
" I think the two had a pretty constructive relationship and one that contributed to stability in the region , and I hope that , over time , that kind of constructive relationship can be re-established , " he added .
" I personally think that if there is anything to the notion that Turkey is , if you will , moving eastward , it is , in my view , in no small part because it was pushed , and pushed by some in Europe refusing to give Turkey the kind of organic link to the West that Turkey sought . "
" I think we have to think long and hard about why these developments in Turkey [ occurred ] and what we might be able to do to counter them . "
Migration fear
The issue of whether Turkey should join the EU strongly divides European governments .
It started formal membership talks in 2005 , but has only been allowed to open 12 of the 35 chapters that candidate countries must complete .
Some , like Britain , firmly believe Turkey should be encouraged to modernise and westernise , and that welcoming a big Muslim country would strengthen Muslim moderates .
The US has also supported this view .
But other countries , like Germany and France , fear Turkey could destabilise the EU , not least with mass migration , and think it should be offered no more than a " privileged partnership " .
A security researcher has warned of a vulnerability in older versions of the Windows operating system that allows attackers to take full control of a PC by luring its user to a booby - trapped website .
The flaw resides in the Windows Help and Support Center , a feature that provides users with online technical support .
Malicious hackers can exploit the weakness of Windows by embedding commands in web addresses that activate the feature 's remote assistance tool , which allows administrators to execute commands over the internet .
The exploit works in XP and Server 2003 versions of Windows and possibly others .
“ Upon successful exploitation , a remote attacker is able to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the current user , ” researcher Tavis Ormandy wrote in an advisory published Wednesday .
The attack works against most major browsers , including Internet Explorer 8 if the Windows Media Player is available .
The advisory said Microsoft 's security team was alerted to the vulnerability in the help and support feature on Friday .
“ I 've concluded that there 's a significant possibility that attackers have studied this component , and releasing this information rapidly is in the best interest of security , ” Ormandy wrote .
“ Microsoft is investigating public disclosure of a vulnerability affecting Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 , ” company spokesman Jerry Bryant said in a statement .
“ We will release more information as we determine the extent of the issue based on our investigation . ”
Microsoft engineers place tight restrictions on the remote assistance tools to prevent them from being misused by attackers .
But the advisory said it 's possible to bypass those protections by tricking the whitelist verification through the use of invalid hex sequences .
By combining that weakness with XSS , or cross - site scripting , holes in the Help and Support Center pages , attackers can take full control of a PC simply by exposing a browser to URLs with special commands in them .
“ It 's a great analysis , ” H D Moore , CSO and chief architect of the Metasploit project , told The Register in an instant message .
“ The core issue itself ( not checking the result of the hex decode ) is brilliant in how simple it is , and it looks like it took a lot of investigation to determine that it was actually exploitable . ”
The advisory provided a proof - of - concept that works for a variety of XP and Server 2003 configurations , but it went on to warn that techniques for exploiting other versions probably exist .
The most useful mitigation is to turn off the remote assistance tool , but the advisory provides several other temporary fixes for those who rely on the feature . ®
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs Group ’s U.S. government ties suffered a fresh blow on Monday , as a commission probing the financial crisis subpoenaed the bank , claiming the firm had flooded the panel with 2.5 billion pages of records .
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission had asked Goldman to provide documents and grant interviews in connection with the panel ’s probe .
In response , the Wall Street firm produced 5 terabytes of records , with each terabyte containing 500 million pages of digitized records , FCIC Chairman Phil Angelides told reporters on a conference call .
FCIC Vice Chairman Bill Thomas said Goldman , knowing the panel ’s limited resources , had sent commission staff hunting for a needle in a haystack .
“ We expect them to provide us with the needle , ” Thomas said .
The FCIC called Goldman ’s response “ abysmal . ” Angelides and Thomas said other banks had received and complied with similar FCIC requests .
Goldman spokesman Samuel Robinson said in a statement that “ we have been and continue to be committed to providing the FCIC with the information they have requested . ”
Goldman shares fell $ 3.72 , or 2.6 percent , to close at $ 138.68 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday .
Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein was on a panel with three other bank chiefs that testified before the FCIC in January .
Disclosure concerns have followed Goldman in recent months .
It has been criticized for not immediately telling investors that it received a so - called Wells Notice from the SEC last September , signaling the possibility of civil charges .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman in April for civil fraud in connection with the structuring and sale of a $ 1 billion collateralized debt obligation .
The FCIC has shown a willingness to use its subpoena power .
In April it issued a subpoena to Moody ’s Corp , saying it had failed to comply with a request for documents and interviews in a timely manner .
The FCIC also used a subpoena to compel Warren Buffett to testify after the Berkshire Hathaway Inc chief rebuffed earlier requests to submit to voluntary questioning .
The quality of a movie depends a great deal on its main characters , of course .
A movie with uninteresting or implausible protagonists might still do well at the box office — just ask Michael Bay — but it will never be much more than an empty shell .
What elevates a movie to greatness , though , is often the quality of its secondary characters .
There are two kinds of minor characters : the kind that are there for a good portion of the movie and help the plot along its way ; and the kind that appear in only one or two scenes but manage to make themselves instantly memorable .
The first kind of part has to be carefully apportioned throughout the film lest they become so interesting they distract from the main characters , but you 're often just enough intrigued by them that you 'd like to see more .
The second , since they 're only there for a brief time , often run away with their scenes , distracting completely from the main characters but only for a minute .
Here is our list of the top ten , of both kinds , from geeky movies , TV shows , etc. Enjoy !
10 . Winston " The " Wolf from Pulp Fiction - Being played by Harvey Keitel is a good start , of course , since he tends to be memorable no matter what his part .
But this is a guy who goes to black - tie cocktail parties at 8:00 in the morning but will readily leave them to clean up a messy situation .
Plus , just the mention of his name is enough to get Samuel L. Jackson to clam up , and that 's just badass .
9 . Bard the Bowman from The Hobbit - OK , so he's not in a movie yet , unless you count Ralph Bakshi 's version , which we do n't .
But he 's so intriguing : you get a few glimpses of him while Bilbo and the dwarves are in Lake - town , but then he becomes incredibly important later .
Suddenly he 's the dragon - slayer and the rightful king of Dale , and , if you 're anything like me , you 're left wondering about the parts of his story you 're not told .
8. Wedge Antilles from the original Star Wars trilogy -
You never find out much about him , but there has to be more to him : he 's the only minor character who regularly goes into perilous situations to survive all three movies !
The assault on the first Death Star is survived only by Luke , Han , Chewie , an anonymous Y - wing pilot , and Wedge .
And then he survives the assault on the second Death Star , too !
There has to be more to this guy , but we never find out what that might be .
7. Bad Horse from Dr. Horrible 's Sing - Along Blog -
He appears on screen for only a few brief seconds at the very end ( just enough , really , to show that he is in fact meant to be an actual horse ) , but his influence affects the whole story .
It 's his approval as the leader of the Evil League of Evil that Dr. Horrible covets , and his threat on Dr. Horrible 's life that sets the stage for the tragic climax of the story .
We hope to see more of Bad Horse in the sequel , and maybe even to hear his " terrible death whinny . "
6. Jordan Cochran from Real Genius - Michelle Meyrink deserves most of the credit for Jordan 's appearance on this list : she managed to elevate a character who could so easily have been a boring stereotype into one of he most memorable parts of a great movie .
Who can forget her coming into the men's room and talking with barely a pause to breathe while Mitch tries to pee ?
It was easy to see why Mitch liked her so much , though it did always seem a bit skeevy that the fact that he was only 15 was never brought up as an issue with their relationship .
5. Valerie from The Princess Bride - Quick exercise : Try to picture Valerie chasing Miracle Max around their hut hollering " Humperdinck , Humperdinck , Humperdinck ! ! " without at least smiling at the memory .
If you can do that , you have more self - control than I do , and I must have seen the movie at least a hundred times .
Carol Kane , almost unidentifiable under the movie makeup , still managed to thoroughly steal her scene from Billy Crystal — a Herculean task if ever there was one .
It was tempting to put the Impressive Clergyman on the list , because I still can't watch the wedding scenes without laughing , but Valerie gets the nod because she was more of an actual character .
4. Professor Filius Flitwick from the Harry Potter books and movies - His bizarre unexplained reverse aging between the second and third movies aside , Warwick Davis managed to create an intriguing on - screen presence with little time and very few lines of dialogue .
In the books , fortunately , the character is explored in much more depth , and it 's clear he is meant to be a brilliant wizard with exceptional skill at Charms ( of course ) and as a duellist .
He figures in many key Hogwarts scenes in the books , and acquits himself well in several of the battles .
Every time I reread the books , I think Flitwick , of all the secondary teacher characters , would make an excellent subject for a spinoff book or two .
3. Shepherd Derrial Book from Firefly / Serenity - Shepherd
Book could , and had he been created by a lesser writer probably would , have been steeped in stereotype .
Instead the character is far more than the audience , or indeed his fellow characters , would be inclined to expect .
We only get hints at his past : that he clearly holds some kind of authority with the Alliance ; that he has knowledge of and exceptional skill with weapons and hand - to - hand combat ; and that he has clearly been on one side or the other in criminal enterprises .
Sadly , we never really find out much more than that in the cruelly short TV series , and Joss Whedon even pokes fun at the audience about the subject : when Book tells Mal that he does n't have to tell Mal about his past , he 's really telling us .
2. Dr. Sherman " Doc " Cottle from ( the reimagined ) Battlestar Galactica -
In many ways he 's a typical gruff doctor , in the fine tradition of Leonard McCoy .
But Dr. McCoy never chain - smoked , and rarely had to deal with ethical considerations like treating humans and Cylons the same .
Cottle figures prominently in many crucial moments in the series , from saving Commander Adama 's life after he 's shot to delivering and participating in the faked killing of Athena and Helo 's daughter Hera .
He also provided just enough sarcasm to alleviate some of the tension in some of the more dramatic moments of the series .
1. Boba Fett ( from you - know - very - well - where ) - Boba
Fett falls into that strange category of characters who are glimpsed only rarely and heard from even more rarely , but who nonetheless manage to garner huge amounts of attention .
From the moment we first see him in The Empire Strikes Back ( I 'm ignoring the prequel trilogy , The Clone Wars , and such ) he is clearly a force ( no pun intended ) to be reckoned with .
His armor is just ... awesome , really , with its different colors here and there and the scuff marks making it clear he's not afraid to get his hands dirty .
You know he 's a badass before he even opens his mouth , and he manages to keep that impression going all the way until just before his ignominious end in the belly of the sarlacc .
All that while never actually showing the audience his face — impressive , most impressive .
There are plenty more where those came from , of course .

Retail sales tumbled 1.2 % in May , as a new poll indicates that the spending is primarily coming from wealthier and older consumers .
The government released its report on retail sales for May on Friday , and the Commerce Department said sales dropped from the previous month bucking expectations for a small increase .
Declines were pretty broad based among autos , gas stations and general merchandise stores .
Grocery and health - care stores posted increases , and there was some strength in companies that sell furniture and appliances , possibly boosted by government tax credits .
A new poll from Gallup may indicate that the mix of spending may have a hard time keeping retail sales buoyant .
The poll indicates that consumers who make more than $ 90,000 account for the bulk of that spending increase .
Upper-income Americans ’ self - reported spending rose 33 % to an average of $ 145 per day in May — up from $ 109 per day in April .
Meanwhile , middle - and lower - income Americans ’ self - reported spending averaged $ 59 per day in May , unchanged from the previous month .
Higher - income “ consumers seemed to be holding back on spending prior to May in response to the length and depth of the recession , the financial crisis , and a general feeling of economic uncertainty , ” wrote Dennis Jacobe , Gallup chief economist .
“ In May , this seemed to change .
It could be that many upper - income consumers are experiencing ‘ frugality fatigue . ' ”
Getty Images Luxury retailers are benefiting from ramped up spending by wealthier consumers .
The result is consistent with the picture in the U.S. labor market .
In May , the headline U.S. unemployment rate declined to 9.7 % from 9.9 % , but all of the gains came from workers with a bachelor ’s degree or higher , which tend to include the highest paid workers .
The jobless rate among college graduates dropped to 4.7 % from 4.9 % as the number of unemployed declined , compared to an increase among all other education levels .
The unemployment rate jumped to 15 % for those with less than a high school diploma and climbed to 10.9 % for high school graduates .
The increased spending by higher - income consumers also was reflected in monthly reports from companies .
Luxury retailers posted some of the best numbers last week in same - store sales .
Meanwhile , when you break Gallup ’s spending data down by age , all groups increased their spending from last year , a positive sign for economic recovery .
But the biggest jump — 45 % — came from consumers over 65 years of age .
Though down over the last month , the U.S. stock market rallied through most of the last 12 months , possibly boosting sentiment among retirees and those nearing retirement .
Hamish Jacobs is a graduating high - school student in Alberta , Canada .
In deference to his Scottish heritage , he proposed to wear a kilt to the graduation ceremony , but the principal has rejected this proposal as being " inappropriate . "
Evidently , principal Mark Beazer is unfamiliar with the formal attire of other nations , and people in Scotland are up in arms over the issue .
Me , I say that school graduations should have the same dress - codes as science fiction conventions : " Wear anything you like , but remember , ' no costume is NO COSTUME . ' "
Provided you wear at least a modest cache - sexe or equivalent garment , you 're clothed , and if you want to come as a superhero , a medieval blacksmith , a steampunk inventor , a tuxedoed gent , or a tentacled horror , that 's great too .
Just remember : it 's not a skirt .
The last man what called it a skirt got kilt .
The issue has stirred up a whirlwind of debate , with Mr. Jacobs 's story recounted in the Scottish Sunday Mail and on a Facebook page , launched by a family friend , that has attracted nearly 1,900 comments .
One compares Mr. Jacobs 's plight to that of an Ottawa high school student who had to fight to bring a gay partner to his Catholic prom .
Another howls : " This is PUBLIC school not a MORMON one . "
Another pledges to write human - rights authorities – Mr. Jacobs himself has told the school he believes his Charter rights are being violated in what his Facebook page calls an " unforgivable sin . "
Another suggests : " u should threaten them to go to the media .
That will scare them coz they wont want the bad publicity . "
No kilt at graduation , school tells Alberta teen
( Thanks , Mom ! )

American Apparel has recently come under scrutiny for alleged hiring discrimination with its " full body , head - to - toe " employment policy .
Customers , apparently , are not exempt : this skirt is among many items it refuses to sell to any woman over a size 6 .
Advertisement
The " Poly - Viscose Pleated Schoolgirl Skirt , " $ 60 , is only available in sizes XS , S , and M. Because a size 8 schoolgirl would offend the eyes of one Dov Charney , we suppose .
Among the other garments American Apparel does not make in any size above a Medium — which the company 's size guide defines as a dress size 4 - 6 — are these $ 20 tricot short - shorts , and these $ 46 nylon " Disco shorts " .
And do n't think that they just mysteriously ran out of the larger sizes — when certain sizes in a given style sell out , they are typically marked " Unavailable " on American Apparel 's website , as , for example , with these shorts .
The lack of any such mention of unavailability would seem to indicate that American Apparel never produced any of these styles in anything larger than a dress size 6 .

Almost a dozen of the comments on the " Schoolgirl Skirt " point out this oversight :
It 's so cute ... AA , please make this in size large !!!!
And :
Darling skirt ... please make this in a large !!!!
And :
the medium is just too snug for me to wear comfortably .
I would definitely buy it if AA starts selling it in size large .

And :
Like so many others on here I 'd love to have this skirt but I 'd need a large .
Three people asked for the skirt to be made in navy .
And — like magic — American Apparel obliged .
So why is all this other enthusiastic customer feedback being ignored ?
We 've asked the company why this skirt was produced in such a limited size range , and what American Apparel 's rationale is when deciding which sizes to manufacture a given garment in .
We 'll update if and when we hear back .

We already knew that American Apparel considers plus sizes " not our demographic . "
But a size 6 ? A 6 ? Are they out of their minds ?
The average American woman wears a size 12 - 14 .
American Apparel is ignoring a vast swathe of its potential customers — customers who , like those quoted above , would happily pay $ 60 for a synthetic mini-skirt , were one made available to them .
No wonder the company is in serious financial trouble .

But do n't worry , ladies - who - wear - size - 8 - or - larger : American Apparel will still sell you these unisex tri-color swim trunks .
Handsome , are n't they ?

Explanation : A meteor 's streak and the arc of the Milky Way hang over the imposing mountain fortress of Alamut in this starry scene .
Found in the central Alborz Mountains of Iran , Alamut Castle was built into the rock in the 9th century .
The name means Eagle 's Nest .
Home of the legendary Assassins featured in the adventure movie Prince of Persia , Alamut was also historically a center for libraries and education .
For a time , it was the residence of important 13th century Persian scholar and astronomer Nasir al - Din al - Tusi .
To identify the stars in a night sky Tusi certainly pondered , just slide your cursor over the image .

UK government spending cuts threaten over 700,000 jobs
By Jordan Shilton
14 June 2010
Just days after the Conservative - Liberal coalition government outlined its plans to slash public spending , a report has estimated that this could push up unemployment in Britain to 3 million , more than 10 percent of the workforce .
The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development ( CIPD ) predicts that over 725,000 jobs in the public sector will be in danger from the coming cuts , 12 percent of the 6 million public sector workers across Britain .
Unemployment , currently standing at 2.5 million , will rise to 3 million by 2012 and remain at this level until the end of the parliament in 2015 .
The CIPD said that the focus on spending cuts rather than tax hikes would exacerbate the jobs crisis .
Chancellor George Osborne intends to reduce the fiscal deficit by making close to 80 percent of “ savings ” through spending cuts , with only 20 percent coming from tax hikes .
To this end , Osborne will announce swingeing cuts in the emergency budget set for June 22 .
This will result in the elimination of 50,000 jobs this year , according to the report .
In all , the CIPD anticipates the loss of 175,000 jobs in managerial and administrative areas within the National Health Service ( NHS ) , 200,000 in the civil service and education , and 350,000 council posts .
John Philpott , the CIPD ’s chief economist made it clear that it would be the poorest in society who would suffer the greatest pain , saying , “ The prospects for the most disadvantaged seem particularly bleak ” .
Before the election , the Conservatives claimed that savings could be made by cutting costly IT projects and consultants while protecting frontline services .
Immediately on entering office , Prime Minister David Cameron cut £ 6.25 billion from public expenditure , which he claimed could be managed merely by doing away with “ wastage ” .
But such claims were entirely false .
They were part of a much broader campaign by all the major parties during the election to conceal the full impact of the measures to come from the population .
On Friday , the real nature of the £ 6.25 billion became clear .
Local authorities would lose £ 1.16 billion this year , while regulatory organisations such as the Equalities and Human Rights Commission would face a 15 percent cut .
The Food Standards Agency , established in the wake of numerous food safety scandals in the 1980s and 90s , looks set to disappear altogether .
When the extent of the budget cuts become clear on June 22 , the prospects for those regions , the north of England , south Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland , which depend to a greater extent on the public sector for employment , will be especially grim .
This led Brendan Barber , the general secretary of the TUC , to claim that government policy would create an even worse “ north - south divide ” .
In comments to the Guardian , Barber warned that if imposed too harshly , the cuts “ could lead to …very broad - based campaigns not just about the impact on the jobs and living standards of those that deliver public services ” , a clear warning to the ruling elite that the coming measures will increasingly provoke social struggles .
According to the Independent , the so - called “ star chamber ” of civil servants and ministers , unveiled by Osborne last Tuesday , will oversee spending cuts of up to £ 60 billion per year — a figure that approaches 10 percent of current public spending .
Reducing budgets by such levels will be catastrophic for hundreds of thousands of workers , including those outside the public sector .
There are an estimated 1.7 million workers contracted by various public services , carrying out such tasks as refuse collection , cleaning , managing leisure facilities and providing school meals .
The transport sector , particularly the national rail service and many local bus operations , is also heavily reliant on subsidies from government .
The removal of government support will mean that many of these workers will be laid off as contracts are reduced or cut altogether and subsidies done away with .
Already this year , the government has committed itself to cutting £ 1.7 billion by renegotiating contracts with suppliers and other organisations .
The knock - on effect of these cuts will also be felt in the private sector , where many firms depend upon business with public authorities .
This means a very real threat of much higher unemployment .
Workers who find themselves out of a job will face a much reduced welfare system .
The government intends to save £ 4 billion annually by freezing current levels of benefit , and much more is planned .
It has decided to include benefits and tax credits within its spending review , meaning that the already meagre levels of social support to the most vulnerable in society will be slashed .
Particular consideration is being given to child benefit , benefits for the disabled and unemployed .
Although the government may decide to means test some benefits in order to cut eligibility , it may also opt to cut benefit levels across the board .
In his speech on Monday , Cameron focused his criticism on the Department for Work and Pensions , which manages the benefits system , claiming that the overall cost of welfare had risen by £ 20 billion .
Osborne , announcing the spending review on Tuesday , warned that budgets for welfare benefits and tax credits would be cut by between 15 and 20 percent during the life of the current parliament .
In its drive to cut spending on public services and welfare , the government has received the backing of the Confederation of British Industry ( CBI ) , which called for the chancellor to announce even sharper cuts than currently being considered in order to avoid tax hikes .
The CBI argued in a statement Thursday , “ The business group welcomes the action taken so far by the government to tackle the deficit and urges it to use the budget to reinforce the UK ’s fiscal credibility by announcing a faster reduction in the structural deficit , based on more rigorous economic assumptions and backed by more detail on spending plans ” .
The Adam Smith Institute , a right - wing think tank , concurred , advocating the removal of the budget deficit within five years .
Along with spending cuts , it called for a new privatisation drive , with possible targets being the London Underground , Scottish water companies and Royal Mail .
The newly created Office for Budget Responsibility ( OBR ) , formed to provide “ independent ” forecasts on Britain ’s economy and advice on spending decisions , will release its borrowing and growth forecasts on Monday .
It is almost certain to downgrade Britain ’s economic prospects for 2011 and beyond , with speculation that the current estimate of 3.2 percent growth in GDP will be cut to around 2 percent , increasing relative size of Britain ’s debt .
Headed by people with close links to the City of London , the OBR ’s much - vaunted independence is its complete insulation from any democratic control .
As such , it is in a position to push for measures that are widely unpopular .
This underscores the fraudulent character of the government ’s claims that there will be widespread public “ consultation ” on the coming austerity programme .
Following similar programmes across Europe , including the announcement this week of cuts of 80 billion euros in Germany , the Cameron government is fully committed to making working people pay for an economic crisis for which they are not responsible .
To be sure , gold buyers have always been motivated by fear .
What has changed is that some of the most respected investors on Wall Street are now among the fearful .
“ In recent years , we have gone from one bubble and bailout to the next , ” David Einhorn , a New York money manager who was among the first to foretell the failure of Lehman Brothers , said in a speech last month .
“ Our gold position reflects our concern that our fiscal and monetary policies are not sufficiently geared toward heading off a possible crisis . ”
Since ancient times , gold has been deemed intrinsically valuable , holding its worth even as governments fell and currencies collapsed , while seemingly casting a spell on its owners .
Still , gold can go down  sometimes sharply .
After peaking in 1980 at more than $ 800 an ounce , gold sank over the next two decades , bottoming out at just over $ 250 an ounce in 1999 .
But unlike paper assets that can become worthless , gold always retains at least some value .
These days , gold is also something of a political Rorschach test .
On conservative talk radio , opposition to the Obama administration ’s economic policies and warnings that huge budget deficits will set off runaway inflation have made gold a hot topic of on - air discussion  and lured gold companies as advertisers .
Tongue only half in cheek , Glenn Beck advised his audience to consider “ Gold , God and Guns , ” while laying out three possible scenarios for the economy : recession , depression or collapse .
One major advertiser on Mr. Beck ’s show is Goldline , a huge California marketer of gold coins and bars that is also a sponsor of programs hosted by other prominent conservative commentators like Laura Ingraham and Mike Huckabee .
Mr. Beck has said he “ was a client of Goldline long before they were a client of mine , ” adding : “ I personally do n’t buy gold as an investment .
I buy it for protection . ”
The Terrafugia , a small airplane that can drive on roads and has been billed as the first " flying car , " is now one step closer to becoming street - and sky - legal .
The vehicle has cleared a Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) regulatory hurdle for craft classification by weight .
A full - fledged production prototype might be just around the corner , according to multiple reports .
At issue was Mass .- based company Terrafugia wanting its Transition vehicle to be classified as a " Light Sport Aircraft " by the FAA so people eager to fly it would need only 20 hours of flying time .

The flying car
Yet the two - seater vehicle came in 110 pounds ( 50 kilograms ) overweight in accommodating roadworthy - assuring safety items such as crumple zones .
The FAA said that so long as customers are advised about this extra weight , the car - plane hybrid can be sold .
The Terrafugia completed its maiden voyage last March in upstate New York .
According to its maker , the Terrafugia can transform from a roadable vehicle that can hit a highway speed of 65 mph to a winged aircraft in 30 seconds .
The plane version can cruise at about 115 mph ( 185 kph ) and cover about 400 miles ( 644 kilometers ) worth of turf before needing a refill of regular unleaded gas .
The price of a Terrafugia is expected to be around $ 200,000 and deliveries could start next year , assuming the vehicle passes crash tests .
The company has envisioned its vehicle as finding a home with amateur pilots who live near air fields , but as any Jetsons ' fan knows , flying cars might well be the wave of the future .

Supersexual fashion brand American Apparel was accused last year of having a policy of firing employees that management deemed too ugly .
According to some new inside information we received , hiring and firing is now largely based on employee photos .
Last July , a disgruntled AA store manager told us that AA CEO Dov Charney " made store managers across the country take group photos of their employees so that he could personally judge people based on looks .
He is tightening the AA ' aesthetic , ' and anyone that he deems not good - looking enough to work there , is encouraged to be fired . "
Charney later issued a conspicuously vague denial , saying only that AA hires employees who " have good fashion sense ... But this does not necessarily mean they have to be physically attractive . "
Clearly , that standard leaves a lot of wiggle room .
Now , a source tells us that American Apparel has a new hiring policy .
For the past several months , they say , job applicants at AA have had their photos taken — photos which are then sent to the email address work@americanapparel.net , where they are " approved " by a nameless person for hiring .
The applicant 's resumé is a distant second when it comes to hiring decisions , our source says .
Our source also tells us that a new policy now says that in order for current AA employees to be approved for a promotion or raise , they must also have their photos approved .
As they put it , " Your looks determine your position and pay rate , not how effective you are at your job . "
Indeed , this excerpt from an internal transcript of American Apparel 's May 18 conference call with retail managers references the need for " full body head to toe " photos in employee recruiting :
Our source says that these employee photos have become standard operating procedure , though the more objectionable aspects go unspoken ; for example , district employees who do n't like someone 's photo may refer to them as " off brand , " rather than overweight or unattractive , though the effect is the same .
Asked about this policy , American Apparel spokesman Ryan Holiday referred us to a statement that AA creative director Marsha Brady gave to The Cut blog a year ago :
We do screen , but not for beauty .
What we look for is personal style .
We carry year round basics that are easy to understand and pretty much sell themselves as basics .
But to really showcase the fashionability of our products , we have to rely on the way our in - store employees style themselves with our clothes .
The line consists of a tremendous number of colors that are more like art supplies than fashion , so when we 're hiring , one of the things we look for is an ability to take our products , make them exciting , and show how cool they can look , which does n't have much to do with just being pretty .
We see applicants who do n't have quite what we 're looking for in retail but are recommended for modeling all the time .
Every new hire contributes to our brand perception and it's very important to the success of the company to take it seriously .
Not to say that we have the perfect retail workforce , but it 's something we 're giving priority to .
Asked how often store managers are asked to send in photos of their employees for review , Holiday said , " From time to time , someone may occasionally make a photo request to offer styling tips to a store or to make sure that employees are featuring new products , but its infrequent .
More commonly , we send managers directly to stores to update staffs up on the latest developments in the brand . "
What does seem clear is that American Apparel employees are regularly evaluated on their appearance , and their employment and advancement in the company depends on it .
The line between judging employees on their " personal style " and judging them on their , you know , looks is one that exists only in the mind of American Apparel managers .
The employees themselves may not be so comfortable with it .

I love it !
It 's fantastic .
The first time I made it I used powdered crust mix and it too 15 minutes to cook , but the second time I used Pillsbury pizza crust and it refused to cook all the way through ... My advice is to use the powdered mix instead of the Pillsbury .
Also , this stuff does not keep well .
Make it all at once and eat it all at once .
It 's fabulous but does n't taste nearly as good the next day .
I thought I could make the whole recipe and store what I did n't use for another day .
It is still good , but not nearly as good as it was fresh .

Image caption British driver Hamilton won the world title in 2008
Formula 1 star Lewis Hamilton has been charged over a stunt he performed on a public road in Australia .
The British driver was stopped by police after performing a " burnout " , spinning his car to leave tyre marks on the road , in front of fans before the Melbourne Grand Prix in March .
His silver Mercedes road car was impounded after he was pulled over close to the Albert Park circuit .
He was charged with intentionally losing control of a vehicle .
At the time , police said Mr Hamilton 's rear wheels were skidding as he accelerated out of Albert Park on what was a public road .
McLaren 's 2008 Formula 1 world champion admitted after the incident : " I was driving in an over - exuberant manner and , as a result , was stopped by the police .
" What I did was silly , and I want to apologise for it . "
Court appearance
A court hearing has been set for 24 August at Melbourne Magistrates ' Court .
There is a Grand Prix race scheduled in Belgium on 29 August .
It is not clear whether Mr Hamilton will have to appear in court in Australia for the hearing .
Relations between Israel and its staunchest ally , the US , have suffered a " tectonic rift " , according to Israel 's ambassador to Washington .
Michael Oren briefed Israeli diplomats on the sharp deterioration between the countries ahead of Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu 's visit to the White House early next month .
According to those present , Oren said the situation had moved beyond a crisis that eventually passes .
" There is no crisis in Israel - US relations because in a crisis there are ups and downs , " he told the diplomats in Jerusalem .
" Relations are in the state of a tectonic rift in which continents are drifting apart . "
His analysis will alarm Israel 's political establishment , which is feeling isolated internationally and under intense pressure to take concrete steps over the blockade of Gaza and settlement building in the West Bank .
Oren said President Barack Obama made judgments about Israel on the basis of cold calculation in contrast to predecessors George W Bush and Bill Clinton , who were motivated by historical and ideological factors .
He suggested that Obama was less likely to be influenced by pro-Israel supporters inside or outside the White House .
" This is a one - man show , " he was quoted as saying .
Netanyahu and Obama are due to meet in Washington on 6 July after earlier talks were postponed following Israel 's lethal assault on the flotilla of ships attempting to break the blockade of Gaza .
Netanyahu is keen for the meeting to be seen as a success after a string of difficult issues have ruptured relations .
His last visit to Washington ended with what was widely interpreted as a snub when Obama declined to hold a photocall with the Israeli leader .
The agenda of next week 's meeting is unlikely to prove painless for Netanyahu .
As well as discussing the flotilla debacle , Obama is expected to press for further action to allow imports , exports and people to move more freely to and from Gaza .
In addition , Obama is expected to again raise the vexed issue of settlement construction .
The 10 - month partial freeze , wrung out of Netanyahu after months of pressure and negotiation , is due to end in late September .
Oren 's remarks , reported in the Israeli press and confirmed by officials , go further than comments he made in March after the crisis over an Israeli announcement of a big expansion to a Jerusalem settlement during a visit by US vice - president Joe Biden .
Then Oren told colleagues US - Israeli relations were facing their worst crisis for 35 years .
Netanyahu delivered a robust speech to the Israeli parliament last week , warning that the Jewish state 's legitimacy was under attack and criticising the UN and other international bodies for condemning Israeli policies and actions .
" They want to strip us of the natural right to defend ourselves .
When we defend ourselves against rocket attack , we are accused of war crimes .
We cannot board sea vessels when our soldiers are being attacked and fired upon , because that is a war crime .
" They are essentially saying that the Jewish nation does not have the right to defend itself against the most brutal attacks and it does n't have the right to prevent additional weapons from entering territories from which it is attacked , " he said .
Update : iOS 7 introduces a number of new app - icon sizes .
The specific sizes mentioned in this post may not be useful any longer .
However , feel free to read on for some basic theory about icons , regardless of size or intended use .
Let ’s say you ’re working on an icon for an iOS app .
The app is universal , so it should run on all iPhones ( and iPod touches ) , and on the iPad .
As a designer , you ’re used to drawing icons at various sizes ; this is a big part of what “ icon design ” is ( as opposed to other types of illustration ) .
Here ’s my PSD file for an iOS icon I drew the other day :
( Click for full size )
This is based on Sebastiaan de With ’s excellent iPhone icon PSD file , which is a living document and will be updated as things change in iLand .
You absolutely need this or something like it .
Note that your icons will have a rounded - rect mask applied to them , whatever you do .
So you can leave your icon totally square , but if you want a nice inline shadow at the top ( I do ) you ’ll have to bake the top of the rounded shape into your icon .
Let ’s walk through all the different sizes and how they ’re used :
57 px , iPhone – Good ol ’ classic .
114 px , Retina iPhone 72 px , iPad 144 px , Retina iPad 29 px , iPhone Settings / Spotlight , iPad Settings – Used in these table views .
Minor , but still important !
58 px , iPhone 4 Settings / Spotlight / Notifications –
That ’s right , you have to make both 57 and 58 px versions of your icon – d'oh !
Good luck aligning this if there ’s a line running down the middle of the icon. 48 px , iPad Spotlight – Yup , the iPad uses a different size for Spotlight and Settings .
Apple ’s docs actually say the icon is 50 px , but then there ’s this note :
The final visual size of this icon is 48 x 48 pixels .
i Phone OS trims 1 pixel from each side of your artwork and adds a drop shadow .
Be sure to take this into account as you design your icon .
So , leave extra room around your icon. 96 px , Retina iPad Spotlight .
See note 7 above , and remember the edge will be trimmed by 2 px on each side .
22 x 29 px document icon , iPhone 44 x 58 px document icon , Retina iPhone 64 px document icon , iPad 320 px document icon , iPad 640 px document icon , Retina iPad 512 px , iTunes – Used in iTunes and in the App Store , where it ’s sized down to 175 px .
Sadly , you ca n’t provide the 175 px version directly .
1024 px , Retina iTunes
( By the way , if you ’re working on a webapp icon , I ’m not aware of a way to specify different sizes for those .
Apple appears to provide a single , 128 px image which then gets scaled down .
Update : Apple has a dev document on specifying web clip icons . )
The jumble of files you ’ll end up with is not all that new .
On the Mac , we ’ve been creating icons at multiple sizes for decades .
They get wrapped in a .icns file ; this fact does n’t really help the designer much .
The difference is that while .icns files serve as a sort of mipmap , specifying sizes between which the icon should be scaled , iOS icon sizes are for the most part defined by their use : this size goes here , that one goes there .
How does all this relate to resolution independence ?
Well , RI is really a goal , not a technique .
It means having resources which will look great at different sizes .
This is partly accomplished by using vector art for shapes ( such as button icons ) which get styled by the system .
The typical tab bar or toolbar in an iOS app and Finder - style toolbar buttons are good candidates for PDF art ( though vector files are n’t actually used in iOS apps due to performance considerations . )
They ’re simple “ masks ” .
Even so , they are usually designed with a target size in mind .
It ’s simply not possible to create excellent , detailed icons which can be arbitrarily scaled to very small dimensions while preserving clarity .
Small icons are caricatures : they exaggerate some features , drop others , and align shapes to a sharp grid .
Even if all icons could be executed as vectors , the largest size would never scale down well .
Here ’s the icon for the Pictures folder in Mac OS X :
Note that scaling down works to about 64 px ; after that , shapes have to be redrawn , simpler and clearer , in order to read .
The sidebar version of the icon is entirely different , in fact ; since we know it will be shown in the sidebar , it ’s not so important that it look like a folder , and other features can be emphasized instead .
Creating the large icon as a vector shape – which , to be clear , you should be doing !
– wo n’t help where clarity is really needed : at small sizes .
High - resolution displays will in fact make this problem more urgent because today ’s 64 px is tomorrow ’s 128 px .
We ’ll have to refine ever larger icons .
Update : to make this point even clearer , here ’s what we ’d get if we simply scaled down the big version of the icon :
This is a very common method of using the “ same ” image at different sizes .
It has recently been popularized in the world of icons by various utilities that aim to make easier the task of creating various iOS icon sizes .
As shown above , this programmatic approach yields results noticeably worse than having a designer hint the shapes manually .
Another single - source - image approach one might consider is the reverse : creating a vector version optimized for a certain small size , then resizing that up infinitely , as needed .
Here ’s what that would give us :
I said you should be drawing the largest size as vectors – in Illustrator , or using Photoshop ’s shape layers – because this is the least destructive , most editable way to work .
Textures and frustrating little pixel adjustments can be done by hand .
You ’ll basically want to have one endlessly scalable version of the icon , full of glorious detail , but representing essentially the same shapes as the other sizes .
The reason for this is that some day , Apple may call and ask you for a large App Store banner , a printable poster for their retail stores , or a twenty - foot decal for WWDC .

France 's Thierry Henry has signed a deal to play for the New York Red Bulls of the MLS , according to media reports .
Henry , whose season with Barcelona finished Sunday , will play for the French team at the World Cup in South Africa next month before joining the Red Bulls , numerous media outlets have reported .
The team declined to comment , according to multiple media reports .
Henry , 32 , still has a year left on his contract with Barcelona .
He holds the mark for most French national team goals with 51 .
He has previously indicated a willingness to finish his career in New York .
But Henry said wants to concentrate on the World Cup before considering his next move in club football , according to a media report in Spain .
" For the moment , nothing is certain , " Henry told the Spanish sports daily Diario AS .
" I am a Barcelona player and have another year left on my contract .
" Currently , my only worry is preparing for the World Cup with France .
I will have time to reflect on my future later . "
The addition of Henry , which could come shortly after the World Cup , could boost the Red Bulls on the field , where they 're 5 - 3 ( 15 points ) and leading the MLS Eastern Conference despite scoring only eight goals .
His presence could also help fill seats at the team 's brand - new Red Bull Arena in Harrison , N.J .

If you ’re a Nokia fan as I profess to be I ’m sure by now you ’ve read the bad news — check here or here if you have n’t .
I ’d like to think that this a savvy move by the Finnish company to play the markets a bit — adjust expectations downwards then over - deliver when the time comes .
Sadly , their stock price does n’t indicate any prior success with such things .
It ’s an odd thing for yours truly to witness the Linux community , usually somewhat measured in their praise for any one thing , collectively wet themselves over Android .
This is n’t at all a knock against Google ’s mobile OS ( or the Linux community , necessarily ) , but quite the opposite — for FLOSS phone users Android is their saviour from the iPhone .
And these are the people that Nokia needs to reach .
Immediately .
The N900 showed great promise but with the announcement of MeeGo it has effectively become a living fossil .
Again , I ’m not knocking the N900 — it ’s an amazingly capable device — but there ’s no denying that at this point nobody ’s going to be buying it in great numbers because it wo n’t support MeeGo , and has therefore become a legacy product .
I had worried that MeeGo would be too dumbed - down to appeal to power Linux users .
But after trying out the 1.0 netbook version and confirming the following critical features :
a terminal
a proper package manager
SyncML ( which , for the moment , Android does not fully support )
I ’m hopeful that Nokia ’s first MeeGo device will offer the same .
I know it ’s on the way , but I wish Nokia would look a little further into the future and see the end - game to all of this .
I think it ’s inevitable that mobile handsets — at least the high - end ones — will become commodity items able to take on the open mobile OS of your choice , just like your desktop and laptop computer .
Standardizing internal components would make Nokia handsets more alluring to everyone , even if ( gasp ) some users wanted to run Android on a Nokia device .
Likewise , making MeeGo for mobiles widely available as an installable ROM would mean that at least a few brave souls would try to install it on the Android device they already own .
At this point it ’s not even a question of competing with Android , but rather to avoid having Google eat Nokia ’s lunch altogether in the high - end mobile space .
The clock is ticking …
Yesterday , with time melting away , Landon Donovan raced into the Algerian penalty area and took his shot .
It was one shot , his only shot on target for the day .
But it was enough ; he slotted it into the net to give the USA the win – for the game , and also for the group .
Winning the group might be reflexive for the world 's soccer powerhouses , but the USA had not achieved it since the advent of colour television .
Twenty years ago , the US had been almost ceremonial competition for the likes of Czechoslovakia and Austria .
Twelve years ago , they lost to assorted semi-professionals from Iran .
And now , they stand atop their group and are through to the last 16 .
Look no further than Major League Soccer .
It 's easy to poke fun at MLS , when people bother to consider it at all .
Bear in mind , however , that the man on the horse found it easy to laugh at the man trying to push his Ford Model A out of a muddy ditch .
While no one would argue that MLS has advanced as significantly as the automobile , there has nonetheless been serious progress .
By giving American players a place to play professionally , MLS would in turn serve as a springboard to the world at large .
A gifted young goalkeeper named Tim Howard signed with MetroStars ( now known as New York Red Bulls ) in 1998 , and his tenure would see him win the league 's top goalkeeping honour in 2001 before he signed for Manchester United in 2003 .
Now he plays for Everton , of course , where Donovan enjoyed a successful loan spell last season .
The league 's approach to talent allocation – the SuperDraft – would send Clint Dempsey to the New England Revolution in 2004 .
There , Dempsey would develop his diverse skill set to the point where Fulham came calling .
Dempsey 's move to the Premier League – from New England to Old England , if you will – culminated in an appearance in the Europa League final .
It 's difficult to imagine Fulham finding Dempsey at a college in South Carolina .
Major League Soccer would also operate as a destination for explosive young talent .
Gifted athletes such as Jozy Altidore might have turned to other sports without MLS , just as many skilled US teenagers did in the wilderness years .
If you can make a living through your athletic ability , trying to prove yourself overseas becomes a serious life gamble .
Being embraced by a professional league in your home country transforms that gamble into a project .
And other teenagers would find MLS as a useful incubator – such as Michael Bradley , who ran to the final whistle against Algeria in the style of his playing hero , Roy Keane .
The league was n't merely a launching pad .
In the case of Donovan , it was more of a lifeboat .
Donovan had bypassed the MLS experience altogether to play in Germany .
Thrown into the deep end , he found it difficult to keep his head above water .
Thankfully , he had a Fifa - recognised league back in the States waiting to take him in .
In MLS , he had a chance to mature as a player and as a man ; rather than disappear into history as a curio , the American would - be striker who had a cup of coffee in the Bundesliga .
MLS has a lot of work to do .
It 's much better at developing talent rather than spectacle , the officiating is frequently controversial , and the question of bringing in weathered stars from overseas still lingers .
However , the foundation for success has been laid – the same foundation that led to Donovan 's one shot , and the celebrations it begat .

USA Vs. Mexico - Border Volleyball
This is a photo taken in Naco , Arizona ( 1979 ) of a volleyball game between Mexican and U.S. citizens , using the border fence between Mexico and Arizona as the net .
What happened to you , Arizona ?
You used to be cool .
Last year the Obama administration updated Washington 's official position on what forms of expression are legal .
" Whether a given category of speech enjoys First Amendment protection , " Solicitor General Elena Kagan argued in U.S. v. Stevens , " depends upon a categorical balancing of the value of the speech against its societal costs . "
In April the Supreme Court treated this cost - benefit approach to the Bill of Rights ' very first proscription on federal power with the derision it deserved .
Writing for an 8 - to - 1 majority that overturned a 1999 law restricting depictions of animal cruelty , Chief Justice John Roberts called Kagan 's argument " startling and dangerous . "
The First Amendment , he explained , " does not extend only to categories of speech that survive an ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits .
The First Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs . "
Kagan 's claim was a timely reminder that government , everywhere and always , seeks to balance controversial speech against various counterweights : national security , concerns about the influence of money in politics , the desire to protect society from the coarsening effects of obscenity .
And if a child plays any role in the cost - benefit calculation — when school safety is supposedly at issue , or in a custody battle — the counterweight is deemed very heavy indeed .
Many , perhaps most , restrictions on speech are popular when they 're enacted .
The reasons are n't hard to understand .
When your overriding goal is to prevent something most decent people find abhorrent ( child pornography , corporate malfeasance , terrorism ) , and when distasteful speech is seen to obstruct that goal , that 's when people start to say , " Normally , I'm a First Amendment absolutist , but … "
So it was that the putative free speech champions on the New York Times editorial board praised the Supreme Court 's " respectful treatment of the First Amendment " in the Stevens case but in the very same editorial pilloried the Court 's 5 - to - 4 ruling in Citizens United v. FEC , which rejected federal censorship of a political documentary produced by a conservative group organized as a nonprofit corporation .
Why the support for crush videos but not for corporate - sponsored political speech ?
Because legalizing the latter " opened the floodgates for big business and special - interest dollars to overwhelm American politics . "
And catastrophic floods are no time for arcane constitutional debates .
Fortunately , the Framers understood that political passion too often trumps principle and that the natural reflex of people with power is to accumulate more .
That is why the courts ' enforcement of constitutional restrictions is so important .
If you read one article about the Supreme Court this summer , make it Associate Editor Damon W. Root 's cover story , " Conservatives v. Libertarians . "
While the mainstream press continues to shoehorn all legal philosophies into a right - left spectrum , Root explores an underappreciated but equally important fault line : the split between conservatives who champion " judicial restraint " and libertarians willing to toss out even decades - old precedents if they flout the Constitution .
As Root 's article details , the tensions between these two tendencies can be found not only between established wings of the conservative legal movement but even within the minds of individual justices , especially Antonin Scalia .
How those struggles play out on the Roberts court — including the unsettled question of Roberts ' own appetite and justification for overturning precedent — will go a long way in determining legal safeguards at a time of enormous government expansion .
This battle has repercussions far outside the courtroom , with echoes every time someone offers a consequentialist argument for limiting our freedom of expression .
The patron saint of conservative judicial restraint , Robert Bork , shares an important trait with The New York Times and other censorious voices on the left : a belief that citizens are powerless to protect themselves from the consequences of unpleasant speech .
" Liberty in America can be enhanced by reinstating , legislatively , restraints upon the direction of our culture and morality , " Bork wrote in National Review in 2005 .
" Censorship as an enhancement of liberty may seem paradoxical .
Yet it should be obvious , to all but dogmatic First Amendment absolutists , that people forced to live in an increasingly brutalized culture are , in a very real sense , not wholly free . "
Seeing individuals as powerless in the face of choice , or as empty vessels too easily overwhelmed by nefarious content , is a key component of paternalism .
This view denies citizens their basic agency and autonomy , reinforcing the long - discredited but still popular notion that mass behavior is dictated from the top down .
" What we are facing , " President Barack Obama hyperbolized about Citizens United in early May , " is no less than a potential corporate takeover of our elections .
What is at stake is no less than the integrity of our democracy . "
It was a gross if common overestimation of corporate influence on our minds , and a grosser underestimation of the American people 's ability to think for themselves .
Such a mindset explains how MSNBC blowhard Keith Olbermann could say something as profoundly stupid as his comment that Citizens United " might actually have more dire implications than Dred Scott v. Sandford . "
A similar note has been repeatedly sounded during the last two years of liberal anxiety over Tea Parties and allegedly resurgent right - wing violence .
In April , on the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing , former President Bill Clinton wrote a New York Times op - ed that echoed his unforgivably cynical reaction to the bombing when it transpired .
Then as now , he linked the murderous act with the words of nonviolent political commentators .
The bombers , Clinton wrote , " took to the ultimate extreme an idea advocated in the months and years before the bombing by an increasingly vocal minority : the belief that the greatest threat to American freedom is our government , and that public servants do not protect our freedoms , but abuse them .
…As we exercise the right to advocate our views , and as we animate our supporters , we must all assume responsibility for our words and actions before they enter a vast echo chamber and reach those both serious and delirious , connected and unhinged . "
Such talk does n't just serve the partisan purpose of marginalizing political opponents .
It reflects an unseemly condescension to the consumers of political media , and it suggests a path toward censorship .
Time 's Joe Klein has accused several critics of Obama — including Sen .
Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) , Sarah Palin , Glenn Beck , and Fox News in general — not just of " hate speech " but of the more legally serious " borderline sedition . "
After Coburn warned that some citizens might be saying , " ?' I give up on my government , ' and rightly so , " Klein charged that the senator 's statement " comes dangerously close to incitement to violence . "
Needless to say , Klein was n't talking about criminalizing dissent back in the Bush - Cheney years .
Suppressing peaceful speech to prevent potential violence is a kind of pre-emptive heckler 's veto .
We saw it in another context that same month , when Comedy Central heavily censored a South Park episode that depicted the prophet Muhammad .
We see it when partisans try to silence the opposition and when the government weighs the costs and benefits of free expression .
The good news is that the Roberts Court so far is shaping up as a strong defender of the First Amendment .
The bad news ?
Just before this issue went to press , Obama announced as his next Supreme Court appointment the same person who proposed that outrageous " categorical balancing " test for free speech : Elena Kagan .
Here 's hoping some vigorous political speech influences the selection process .
Matt Welch ( matt.welch@reason.com ) is editor in chief of reason .
Draper , Utah ( CNN ) -- Convicted killer Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed early Friday by firing squad , the Utah Department of Corrections said .
Gardner , 49 , is only the third person in 33 years to die by firing squad in the United States .
He was killed at 12:20 a.m. MST ( 2:20 a.m. ET ) , a Corrections Department spokesman said .
A hood was placed over Gardner 's head and a paper target pinned to his chest .
He was heavily restrained as a five - person firing squad took aim at the target and shot him , witnesses said .
Journalists who witnessed the shooting said it happend quickly .
One reporter said she noticed that Gardner moved after he was shot .
" It was over pretty quickly , " said Cheryl Worsley , a local radio reporter .
" It was cleaner than I expected .
It was fast .
But he moved .
He moved a little bit , and to some degree that bothers me . "
Outside the prison in Draper Utah , there was a candlelight vigil attended by members of Gardner 's family .
" He did things bad in the past , but now he realizes what he did and he changed the last couple of years , " said his granddaughter Darian Gardner , breaking into tears .
" I got to know him the last couple of years .
It sucks when you have to say goodbye to someone that is like your best friend . "
The execution came after Gardner 's last - ditch efforts to save himself had failed .
The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request Thursday to temporarily stay the execution .
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert rejected two appeals by Gardner 's attorneys to stop the execution , saying he had every chance to present his case .
Gardner , 49 , was convicted for the shooting death of attorney Michael Burdell during a botched escape attempt from custody in 1985 at a Salt Lake City , Utah , courthouse .
Among the claims Gardner raised in his appeals is that he has been a death - row inmate for too long .
" He asserts that executing him now , after nearly 25 years on death - row in Utah , so lacks retributive or deterrent value that it violates the Eighth Amendment , " Andrew Parnes , Gardner 's lawyer , told the high court .
A federal judge late Tuesday declined to block the execution , after Gardner claimed the procedures related to a two - day commutation hearing held by the state Board of Pardons and Parole last week violated his civil rights .
The parole board Monday declined to commute Gardner 's sentence to life in prison , and the Utah Supreme Court on Tuesday also denied his request for a stay .
Gardner was the third person to die by rifle fire , all in Utah , since the Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976 .
He had a long history of escapes and was slipped a gun before he fatally shot Burdell on April 2 , 1985 .
He was at the courthouse for a pre-trial hearing in the 1984 slaying of Melvyn Otterstrom , who was killed at the Salt Lake City bar where he was working to earn extra money .
Corrections officials announced Gardner had consumed his last meal Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m. , and chose to fast prior to the anticipated execution .
His dinner included steak , lobster , 7 - Up , apple pie and vanilla ice cream .
CNN 's Ashley Hayes and Bill Mears contributed to this report .
Barbara “ Cutie ” Cooper , 93 , speaks drolly to the camera , her words slurred from several strokes .
“ Dear Abby has had her day , it ’s my turn now .
Any problems … contact me … please call , do n’t write . ”
“ Oh my goodness , ” chimes in Harry , her squeaky - voiced husband of 72 years .
“ She ’ll either send them to the poor house or up to the White House ! ”
From behind the camera come snickers and snorts from Kim and Chinta Cooper , half - sisters who barely knew each other before a crisis with their grandparents brought them together .
When that happened , two years ago now , they decided Cutie and “ PopPop ” were so special they could n’t keep them to themselves .
So they bought a video camera , started a website and launched the “ OGs ” on the world .
The - OGs.com — short for Original Grandparents — has its own theme song ( lyrics : “ Oh wow , oh gee , it ’s the OGs ! ” ) and a handful of regular video features .
In “ PopPop ’s Adventure Corner , ” viewers look on as he discovers modern marvels like the iPod ( He calls it his “ music box . ” )
In “ Ask Grandma Anything , ” they get style advice from Cutie , a bold fashionista who was recently kicked out of the dining room at the couple ’s retirement home for wearing leggings that were , Kim admits , “ too sexy . ”
Thousands of fans from around the world have tuned in to watch the couple opine on such topics such as time travel ( “ it ’s possible ” ) , lesbians ( “ just do your thing ” ) and Michael Jackson ( “ He was a very unhappy young man who did n’t know if he was fish or fowl . ” )
They ’ve been like this practically since they met , in the 1930s on the tennis courts at Poinsettia Park in Los Angeles .
Cutie , who was born in Egypt and came to the United States as a child , did n’t think twice about PopPop when they were first introduced .
But when an aunt prodded her to reconsider the Philadelphia - born former Army private , “ I opened my eyes and saw him .
He had black curly hair and brown eyes — big , wide , brown eyes . ”
They married and built a house in Beverlywood , with a pool and plenty of room to raise a family .
They had a daughter , Carol , and a son , Jan .
At Hollenbeck Palms nursing home in Boyle Heights , they still sleep in the same twin bed and kiss more often than teenagers .
“ If I walk by , he kisses me , ” Cutie says .
“ We kiss when we say hello , goodbye , when we ’re going to bed and waking up . ”
Fellow residents attest that Cutie , slim and wide - eyed with bottle - blonde hair , is never far from PopPop , who , with his straight back and strong shoulders , has the figure of a younger man , his 98 years revealed only in the age spots on his face and the soft layer of fuzz on his head .
A recent video blog captures their reunion after Cutie ’s solo hair appointment in Echo Park .
“ How are you ? ” she asks after they kiss .
“ Lonesome , ” he replies .
“ Good , you ’re supposed to be when I ’m not there . ”
Nine decades of living may have slowed the Coopers down — last month Cutie broke her elbow in a fall — but they ’ve hardly dulled them .
“ Of course we ’ve got the spark , ” Cutie says to camera .
“ It ’s kind of rubbed off at the edges , but it ’s there . ”
It ’s a spark that charmed Kim , 43 , and Chinta , 21 , who for most of their lives shared a father but little else .
Jan Cooper was n’t around much for either of them , they say .
In 1978 , when Kim was 11 , he set off with her younger sister to sail the world , leaving Kim to live in Hollywood with her mom , who was more interested in punk music than parenting .
So Kim would escape to spend time with Cutie and PopPop , who had moved into a Camarillo retirement community called Leisure Village .
Her grandparents were “ straight shooters ” who talked to her frankly about life .
The drawers in their home were filled with candy and Cutie ’s collection of fancy , elbow - length gloves .
More than two decades later , Chinta also sought refuge at Leisure Village .
It was 2007 , and she had just finished her first year of college in San Diego .
She headed to Camarillo for the summer to avoid going home to her four younger brothers and parents in San Pedro .
Their house was crowded and hectic ; Jan had just decided on a whim to open an ice cream store .
At Leisure Village , Chinta could swim , putter around the golf course and listen to her grandparents weave tales about the past .
She could also help Cutie and PopPop out .
Their health was failing — both had had heart attacks — and that spring their daughter Carol had died of cancer .
Six months later , Jan died of a heart attack .
Bereft , Cutie all but stopped eating .
Always in sync with her , PopPop did the same .
Soon Chinta , reeling from the loss of her father , dropped out of school to care for them .
In the summer of 2008 , Cutie landed in the hospital with congestive heart failure .
Chinta desperately called everyone she could think of , finally dialing the number of the half - sister she hardly knew .
“ I really have no idea what I ’m doing , Kim , ” Chinta said , “ and I really need your help . ”
Kim , who lived in Los Angeles with her husband , Richard Schave , agreed to help Chinta move their grandparents here .
“ Their children were dead and they were all alone , ” Kim said .
“ That ’s when we stepped into our roles . ”
Together , they helped PopPop and Cutie settle into Hollenbeck Palms , where their health began to improve .
Chinta moved into Kim’s El Serrano home , and the sisters began to realize they had more in common than shy smiles and thick black hair .
They had a shared history .
At Leisure Village , Cutie had taught each of them to drive ( Kim ’s husband says this may explain their less - than - perfect driving skills ) .
And they had grown up hearing the same stories — like the one about their grandparents getting stranded up the Amazon during a trip to Brazil .
And both had a fondness for all things historical — in college , Chinta had taken an L.A. history class , and Kim and Richard run Esotouric Bus Adventures , showing guests landmarks of the city ’s criminal and literary past .
So they decided to preserve their grandparents ’ magic for the public and for posterity .
Every moment is potential fodder for the blog : Halloween parties , visits to the Jewish deli , trips to the dentist ( “ The office was unpretentious , ” Cutie notes ) .
Kim and Chinta do n’t have their camera out during a recent hamburger dinner at the retirement home , but maybe they should .
PopPop and Cutie banter like actors on a sitcom , he the exasperated Desi to her saucy Lucy .
“ He ’s very generous , ” Cutie says , “ and I ’m more feisty . ”
“ It ’s a give - and - take relationship , ” PopPop retorts .
“ I give , she takes . ”
Kim and Chinta — whom the OGs call their “ girls ” — visit at least three times a week .
They pass the time reading to their grandparents from “ Huckleberry Finn , ” introducing them to the wonders of Wikipedia and filming new segments for the blog .
“ We pat their hair down , fix her top and just throw questions at them , ” Kim says .
Cutie hates close - ups .
“ We visualize ourselves as more beautiful — and sometimes when we talk it ’s all nonsense , ” she says .
But she ’s always game .
Right now , she ’s planning a lip-sync performance of a Lady Gaga song .
PopPop , who grew up listening to dishwasher - sized radios in the 1930s , professes to not fully grasp his cyberspace stardom .
“ They ’re always taking our picture , ” he says .
“ I do n’t know why . ”
Kim and Chinta have set up a Facebook page for the couple , and Cutie has a loyal following on Yelp , a website where customers review restaurants , stores , salons and more .
She recently praised a restaurant in Thousand Oaks : “ The people who work there are very , very nice and put up with my husband and I splitting our meal , ordering hot water with lemon and needing extra Sweet N Low all the time . ”
For the Coopers ’ 73rd wedding anniversary ( their 72nd , technically , but Cutie and PopPop like to count from the time they met ) , Kim and Chinta urged fans to leave messages on a digital anniversary card .
“ You darling people , you are the role model of role models , ” one person wrote .
“ You should give lessons . ”
Another confessed her love of the Coopers and asked , “ Will they adopt me ? ”
Kim and Chinta are n’t quite sure why the website works .
Perhaps it reminds people of their own grandparents .
Perhaps it makes them trust a little more in love .
A philosophical streak runs through the family — Chinta is currently studying Eastern religions — and in moments of repose they tend toward reflection .
They ’re sitting together on a recent blustery afternoon , not filming for the blog , just catching up in the retirement home ’s lounge , when Kim asks her grandparents whether life has been easy .
Cutie shakes her head .
“ Do n’t think it ’s all Skittles and fish , ” she says .
“ We ’ve had our ups .
We had our downs . ”
She and PopPop just won 50 cents at a bingo game in the retirement home ’s lounge .
They ’re leaning toward each other , munching quietly on popcorn and sipping fruit punch .
Out of the blue , Cutie utters her husband ’s name : “ Harry Cooper . ”
A pause .
“ That is I . ”
‘ Thank you for taking care of me . ”
“ It is my honor . ”

Freddy gets an " A " in World Domination Class .
Energy company BP has been at the center of a political firestorm since an oil rig it was operating in the Gulf of Mexico exploded and began spewing crude into the surrounding waters on April 20 .
But that has n’t stopped its political action committee from raising funds and distributing money to candidates .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics ’ review of a monthly campaign finance report filed today with the Federal Election Commission Rep. Charles Gonzalez ( D - Texas ) , a member of the House Energy Committee , was the sole federal beneficiary of BP ’s PAC between May 1 and May 31 .
Gonzalez collected $ 1,000 from BP ’s PAC on May 19 .
His office did not immediately return messages left seeking comment .
( Update 5:05 PM : Gonzalez will not accept the money from BP ’s PAC , said Patricia Park , the congressman ’s spokeswoman .
“ He was aware of it , the donation , and we have already returned the check to BP .
It was never cashed , ” Park said , adding that she did not know when Gonzalez became aware of the donation or specifically when he returned the check . )
In May , the group also donated to nine state - level candidates in California .
In April , BP ’s federal PAC reported donations to just two candidates at any level of government : Illinois House Speaker Michael J. Madigan , who received $ 500 , and Arizona state house candidate Ken Clark , a former state lawmaker who formerly headed the state ’s energy office , who collected $ 250 .
The PAC reported more than $ 307,000 cash on hand at the end of May .
Since January 2009 , the company ’s PAC has contributed more than $ 79,000 to 65 federal candidates , the Center has found , with top recipients being Sens. Lisa Murkowski ( R - Alaska ) , who collected $ 5,000 , and Blanche Lincoln ( D - Ark. ) , who accepted $ 4,000 .
The oil spill stemming from the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , which was owned by Transocean and leased by BP , has become one of the worst environmental disasters in history .
Contractors with Halliburton , the company formerly headed by Vice President Dick Cheney , had also been working on the rig .
After meeting with President Barack Obama and other White House officials earlier this week , BP agreed to set aside $ 20 billion over four years , beginning this year , for an escrow account to paid out claims related to the spill .
The account will be independently overseen by Kenneth Feinberg , who previously administered the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund .
The escrow account has been criticized by some Republicans , including Reps. Michele Bachmman ( R - Minn . ) and Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) .
Barton called the government ’s push to establish the fund a “ shakedown , ” a comment which he later apologized for .
BP ’s prowess extends beyond political contributions .
In 2009 , the company was one of the biggest spenders on federal lobbying , investing nearly $ 16 million to ensure its voice was heard .
That amount was nearly three - and - a - half times as much as it spent on federal lobbying activities two years earlier .
The state - level candidates to receive money from BP ’s federal PAC in May were as follows :
Assembly Republican Leader Martin Garrick ( $ 1,000 )
Democratic state senate candidate Michael Rubio ( $ 1,000 )
Democratic Assembly candidate Pete Parra ( $ 1,000 )
Vice Chair of the California State Board of Equalization Jerome Horton , a Democrat ( $ 750 )
Democratic Assembly candidate Nora Campos ( $ 750 )
Republican Assembly candidate Allan Mansoor ( $ 750 )
Republican Assembly candidate Jerry Amante ( $ 750 )
Democratic state Sen. Rod Wright ( $ 750 )
Republican state Sen. Bob Dutton ( $ 500 )
For Horton ’s part , he returned the donation as soon as he received it , said Regina V. Evans , his chief of staff .
“ He basically believes BP should spend its personal and financial resources on mitigating the effects of the spillage , ” Evans said of Horton ’s decision to reject the oil company ’s PAC contribution .
None of the other California politicians could be reached for comment late Friday afternoon .
( Update 6/21 , 1:45 PM : Campos ’ campaign told OpenSecrets
Blog that she does n’t intend to keep the money .
“ The money that we received should be going to the affected people in the Gulf , ” said campaign spokesman Javier Gonzalez , adding the campaign would be sending the check back to BP . )
Even if BP ’s PAC was n’t disbursing much political cash , it certainly was raising it : dozens of company officials made 186 individual contributions totaling $ 8,420.24 to the PAC during May , according to its filing with the FEC .
Among these contributions was $ 416.60 from BP America Chairman and President Horace McKay Jr. Several company vice presidents and high - ranking directors also contributed money to the PAC in May .

Statement on H. Res. 1422 , made June 24 , 2010 .
Madam Speaker , the House of Representatives recently considered H. Res. 1422 , honoring the 140th anniversary of the Department of Justice .
I voted against this resolution because of the Justice Department ’s history of violating individual rights .
It is the Justice Department that leads the ongoing violations of the Fourth , Fifth , Ninth , and Tenth Amendments in the name of the “ war on drugs . ”
It is Justice Department agents who perform warrantless wiretaps and “ sneak - and - peak ” searches under the misnamed PATRIOT Act .
It is the Justice Department that prosecutes American citizens for violating unconstitutional federal regulations even in cases where no reasonable person could have known their actions violated federal law .
Some like to pretend that the Justice Department ’s assault on liberties is a modern phenomenon , or that abuses of liberties are only carried out by one political party .
However , history shows that the unconstitutional usurpations of power and abuse of rights goes back at least almost a hundred years to the “ Progressive ” era and that Justice Departments of both parties have disregard the Constitution and violated individual liberties .
During World War I , President Woodrow Wilson ’s Justice Department imprisoned people who dared to speak out against the war .
Following the war , the progressive assault on the First Amendment continued with the infamous “ Palmer raids , ” named for Wilson ’s Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer .
Just as President Wilson ’s policies of foreign interventionism and domestic welfare served as a model for future presidents , Attorney General Palmer ’s assaults on civil liberties served as a model for future attorney generals of both parties .
Think of Robert Kennedy authorizing the wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr. ; John Mitchell ’s role in the abuses of civil liberties by Nixon administration ; Ed Meese ’s assault on the First Amendment with his “ pornography commission ” ; Janet Reno ’s role in the murder of innocent men , women , and children at Waco ; and the steady erosion of our rights over the past decade .
In addition , it is the attorney general and the Justice Department that defend and justify violations of constitutional liberties by the president and the other federal bureaucracies .
Many civil libertarians were hopeful the new administration would be more sympathetic to civil liberties than was the prior administration .
But the current administration has disregarded campaign promises to restore respect for civil liberates and has continued , and in many cases expanded , the anti-freedom policies of its predecessors .
For instance , the current administration is supporting renewal of the policies of warrantless wiretapping and other PATRIOT Act provisions .
The administration , despite promising to be more open and transparent , is also continuing to use the claim of “ state secrets ” to shield potentially embarrassing information from Americans .
According to the New York Times , the current administration is even outdoing its predecessors in the prosecution of government whistleblowers .
It is little wonder that the head of the American Civil Liberties Union recently said he is disgusted with the administration ’s record on civil liberties .
Of course , Madam Speaker , Congress bears ultimate responsibility for the Justice Department ’s actions , as it is Congress that passes the unconstitutional laws the Justice Department enforces .
Congress also fails to perform effective oversight of the Justice Department .
Instead of honoring the Justice Department , Congress should begin to repeal unconstitutional laws and start exercising congressional oversight of executive branch agencies that menace our freedoms .

After we saw the news of the couple in Japan who were married by a robot , we realized Wedding Season ( aka June - July ) is rife with examples of poor wedding theme decisions .
It 's the time of year when the sanctity of marriage and love are celebrated with crab cakes , white frosting , and drunken bridesmaids giving it up for pre-screened strangers .
Here are the most insane and ridiculous wedding themes we have ever seen .
But hey , look at this this way : they 're better than Vegas !...
Kind of .
Alas , while some people are still not allowed to partake in wedding ceremonies , there are others who should not be allowed to join in the fun .
What are the worst wedding themes ?
Generally ones that are offensive or take the couple 's hobbies a little too far .
You know who I am talking about , these are the folks whose passions for a hobby rank as holier than both the sacred word of God or the exalted slurring of a Dean Martin impersonator .
I mean even the top wedding themes for insane people should n't be this available to the general public .
Like , how did these people even pull these weddings off ?
Crazy wedding themes are one thing , and something that should really just be kept to the pages of Pinterest .
But until these weirdo wedding rituals are absolved ... weddings are n't safe for anyone .
Merle Savage has a wheezy , guttural smoker ’s cough .
But the 71 - year - old former Alaska resident and author of Silence in the Sound never smoked a day in her life .
She did , however , spend four months as a general foreman during the Exxon Valdez oil spill recovery project in 1989 .
And she has a message for anyone working at the BP oil disaster sites : “ You ’ve got to use your common sense .
Breathing crude oil is toxic . ”
Savage moved to Alaska in 1988 – just one year before the Exxon Valdez oil spill ravaged Prince William Sound .
After the spill , Savage decided to take action .
She was assigned to clean oil - coated rocks on the beach , but says that Exxon never provided legitimate safety training .
And since Exxon never told her that breathing crude oil was toxic , she did n’t think twice about spraying hot water onto the oily rocks .
When the dizziness and vomiting set in , Savage assumed it was just the flu .
“ We were housed in close quarters , and I could see how the flu could go around repeatedly , ” she says .
The “ flu ” continued as Savage moved into a position as general foreman on the spill ’s cleanup barges .
But she did n’t realize quite how much her health had deteriorated until leaving the cleanup operation .
“ I was in the doctor ’s office continually , ” Savage says .
“ She always heard my
stomach rolling and one day she said ‘ Have you eaten anything toxic or
had any contaminated water ? ’
I said no , never thinking it was the crude
oil . ”
Savage went on to develop a frightening list of symptoms : cirrhosis of the liver ( she does n’t drink ) , rheumatoid arthritis , constant diarrhea , and respiratory problems .
When Savage was contacted by Riki Ott , a marine toxicologist specializing in oil pollution , she finally put the pieces together .
According to Ott , respiratory and central nervous system problems are common among oil spill cleanup workers .
In a recent blog post , she explains her concerns :
Image caption Mr Gove admires the Swedish free school model
The Swedish model of free schools , lauded by the Conservatives , has not significantly improved pupils ' academic achievement , a study suggests .
The research , published in Research in Public Policy , found the biggest beneficiaries tended to be pupils from educated , professional homes .
The Swedish model has influenced the government 's free schools policy .
Education Secretary Michael
Gove believes free schools will lead to higher standards in England 's schools .
In Sweden , non-profit and for - profit organisations are able to set up and run schools which are publicly funded , but independent from government control .
In England , all schools have been invited to become academies , which would allow them to opt out of local authority control
Groups of parents and teachers , charities and businesses are also being encouraged to set up free schools .
' Close to zero '
The paper , published in Research in Public Policy , examined a range of research into Sweden 's experience of free schools .
The study found the scheme was limited in predicting how similar reforms would work in England .
Report author Rebecca Allen from the Institute of Education found those who benefited most from these schools were those from more privileged homes .
" The impact on low - educated families and immigrants is close to zero , " the report said .
It went on : " The researchers also find that the advantages that children educated in areas with free schools have by age 16 do not translate into greater educational success in later life .
" The evidence on the impact of the reforms suggests that , so far , Swedish pupils do not appear to be harmed by the competition from private schools , but the new schools have not yet transformed educational attainment in Sweden . "
Higher standards
In an answer to a parliamentary question on the policy , Mr Gove said on Tuesday that all the evidence showed that more free schools meant higher standards .
" They help close the gap between the poorest and the wealthiest children , " he added .
Rachel Wolf , director of the New Schools Network , which helps groups to set up schools , said the study did not cover " important studies " of charter schools in the United States .
" That research , including lottery studies at Harvard , Stanford and MIT , has shown that allowing properly regulated new schools can bring dramatic improvements in school standards , especially for schools for poorer children in poor areas . "
It was announced last week that more than 700 groups have expressed an interest in setting up a school .
By 2047 the Air Force says unmanned aircraft with blazing artificial intelligence systems could fly over a target and determine whether or not to unleash lethal weapons - without human intervention .
Such intelligent unmanned aircraft were described in the Air Force 's wide - ranging " Unmanned Aircraft Systems Flight Plan 2009 - 2047 " report which outlines the service 's future use of drones .
The report details major new responsibilities for unmanned aircraft from the ability to refuel other aircraft to the capacity to swarm multiple drones on a single target .
And of course the capability to attack enemy targets on its own .

Inside the Top 10 hot aerospace technologies
Six high - tech " less- lethal " weapons that could ruin your day
Inside the bad-ass world of military research projects
In 2047 technology onboard an unmanned aircraft will be able to observe , evaluate and act on a situation in micro or nanoseconds .
According to the Air Force : " Increasingly humans will no longer be " in the loop " but rather " on the loop " - monitoring the execution of certain decisions .
Simultaneously , advances in AI will enable systems to make combat decisions and act within legal and policy constraints without necessarily requiring human input . "
The loop in this case is a concept known as observe - orient - decide - act or OODA which describes the process by which a person or computer would go through before taking action .
There obviously would be some stopgap measures .
The Air Force went on to say that assuming the decision is reached to allow some degree of aircraft autonomy , commanders must retain the ability to refine the level of autonomy the systems will be granted by mission type , and in some cases by mission phase , just as they set rules of engagement for the personnel under their command today .
The trust required for increased autonomy of systems will be developed incrementally .
The systems ' programming will be based on human intent , with humans monitoring the execution of operations and retaining the ability to override the system or change the level of autonomy instantaneously during the mission .
Such unmanned aircraft must achieve a level of trust approaching that of humans charged with executing missions , the Air Force stated .
Authorizing a machine to make lethal combat decisions is contingent upon political and military leaders resolving legal and ethical questions .
These include the appropriateness of machines having this ability , under what circumstances it should be employed , where responsibility for mistakes lies and what limitations should be placed upon the autonomy of such systems , the Air Force stated .
The super - intelligent drone was just one of myriad plans the Air Force floated in it report .
Some of the other intriguing unmanned aircraft possibilities included matching conventional , manned jet fighters with a drone , or " loyal wingman " as the Air Force called it that could help protect a pilot on a critical mission or drop additional ordnance on a target .
The idea of swarming multiple unmanned aircraft on a target is also in the plan .
Swarm technology will let a commander use a virtual world to monitor the drones and a wireless ad - hoc network will connect the drones to each other and the swarm commander .
The aircraft within the swarm will fly autonomously to an area of interest while also avoiding collisions with other UAS in the swarm .
These UAS will automatically process imagery requests from low level users and will " detect " threats and targets through the use of AI , sensory information and image processing .
The Air Force also said it will work to develop better communications technology to facilitate more unmanned aircraft flying in national airspace .
Last year the Government Accountability Office said routine unmanned aircraft access to the national airspace system poses technological , regulatory , workload , and coordination challenges .
A key technological challenge is providing the capability for unmanned aircraft to meet the safety requirements of the national airspace system .
For example , a person operating an aircraft must maintain vigilance so as to see and avoid other aircraft .
However , because the airplanes have no person on board , on - board equipment , radar , or direct human observation must substitute for this capability .
No technology has been identified as a suitable substitute for a person on board the aircraft in seeing and avoiding other aircraft , the GAO report stated
Additionally , the aircraft ' communications and control links are vulnerable to unintentional or intentional radio interference that can lead to loss of control of an aircraft and an accident , and in the future , ground control stations - the unmanned airplane equivalent to a manned aircraft cockpit - may need physical security protection to guard against hostile takeover , the GAO said .

A Good Housekeeping study found staph germs on 3D glasses -- should you worry ?
June 9 , 2010  -- 3D movie glasses make you feel like you can reach out and touch the action , but you may be making contact of a different kind when you wear them -- with the germs of those who wore or handled the glasses before you .
Though most cinemas say the glasses are cleaned in between uses , Good Housekeeping tested glasses at seven theaters in the New York - New Jersey - Connecticut area and found that not one of them was sterile .
" We 're always looking for things that might be of interest to our readers , " says Carolyn Forte , director of home appliances and cleaning products at the Good Housekeeping Research Institute .
" Given the popularity of 3D movies like ' Avatar , ' we thought this was something we should look into . "
Requests for comment on this issue were not immediately returned by the National Association of Theater Owners .
The Good Housekeeping Research Institute tested seven pairs of movie theater 3D glasses , both wrapped in plastic and unwrapped , and found a number of germs , including those causing conjunctivitis , skin infections , food poisoning , sepsis and pneumonia .
One was even contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus , the most common cause of staph infections .
Magazine staff was " shocked " by these results , Good Housekeeping editor - in- chief Rosemary Ellis said in a press release .
" We expected to find general bacteria -- nothing is sterile , but staph is not something to take lightly , " Forte says .
" We 're not saying that these glasses will make you sick , but kids touch the glasses , touch their eyes and mouths -- the potential is there , " she adds .
But are these findings actually cause for alarm , or just more fodder for germophobes ?
ABCNews.com put the question to germ experts .
Germy Glasses , Grubby Seats --
What 's a Movie - Goer to Do ?
Though doctors agree that staph infections are nothing to mess around with , they were not overly concerned by the germs found on 3D glasses , even the Staphylococcus aureus .
" We do not live in a sterile environment , " says Dr. William Schaffner , professor and chair of the department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine .
" We could culture many features of our inanimate environment and find entirely similar results , " he adds .
While potentially dangerous , Staph is " ubiquitous in the environment " and would be found in many non-sterile surfaces , says Dr. Christopher Ohl , associate professor of medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine .
Its presence does n't necessarily lead to infection .
Dr. Harley Rotbart , professor of microbiology in the department of pediatric infectious diseases at University of Colorado School of Medicine , echoed this view :
" If you swab the popcorn box , arm rests on the seats , door handles leading into the theater and the coinage you get in change at the concession stand , you 'll find the same distribution of germs , " he says .
" Until there is a proven ' outbreak ' related to these glasses , these are only theoretical concerns . "
One added germ risk of glasses is that they come in close proximity to the eyes , nose and mouth , Rotbart says , but still the chances of infection " are slim . "
Dr. Justin Bazan , a Brooklyn - based optometrist , notes that no eye infections attributable to 3D glasses have come into his practice and he says it is of " low concern " at his office .
Overall , doctors said they felt the study overstated the risk involved in wearing these glasses .
Taking Matters Into Your Own Hands
While the risk is low , it may be worthwhile to clean the glasses yourself if you are concerned about germs or if you have a weakened immune system to begin with , says Dr. Clifford Bassett , medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York .
" I would be more comfortable with a system in place for ' sanitizing ' these glasses , especially during peak times such as during the upcoming fall flu season , " he says .
Rotbart suggests having a dispenser box of disinfectant wipes nearby the glasses pick - up to give move - goers the opportunity to sanitize their pair .
Short of such amenities , how can you be a good sanitarian , even if the theater you frequent is n't ?
The report found that alcohol wipes , like those found at your corner drugstore , reduced germ content by 95 percent .
Washing with soap was almost as effective , though just wiping them off with a tissue only got rid of 66 percent of germs
Using hand sanitizer , soap or alcohol wipes are the best way to ensure that those specs are spic and span , doctors say , and you may want to clean your hands as well after using them .
But if you do n't have wipes or hand sanitizer , it 's not the end of the world , doctors note .
" At some point you have to trust our body 's immune systems and defenses , " Ohl says .
Here you go , munchkins .
Judge Ted Stewart has ruled for Novell and against SCO .
Novell 's claim for declaratory judgment is granted ; SCO 's claims for specific performance and breach of the implied covenant of good fair and fair dealings are denied .
Also SCO 's motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial : denied .
Novell is entitled to waive , at its sole discretion , claims against IBM , Sequent and other SVRX licensees .
CASE CLOSED !
Maybe I should say case s closed .
The door has slammed shut on the SCO litigation machine .
The judge writes in the Memorandum Decision and Order about SCOsource , " Finally , while SCO 's witnesses testified that the copyrights were ' required ' for SCO to run its SCOsource licensing program , this was not something that SCO ever acquired from Novell . "
He totally got it .
He noticed Darl McBride admitted that SCO did n't need the copyrights .
It could n't be any better if I 'd written it myself .
Was the jury misled or confused ?
Not at all , the judge writes : " The jury could have rejected the testimony of SCO 's witnesses for a number of reasons , including their lack of involvement in drafting the APA , the fact that there was little testimony on any actual discussions concerning the transfer of copyrights , or that many of the witnesses had a financial interest in the litigation . "
" The Clerk of the Court is directed to close this case forthwith , " Stewart writes in the final judgment .
I believe that means SCO v. IBM is essentially over now , unless IBM wishes to pursue its counterclaims .
And now it is -- finally -- time , once again , for my red dress !
And a huge thank you to Michael Jacobs and the team at Morrison & Foerster , who never gave up but , more importantly , showed that you can fight hard and win with ethics and dignity , and to Sterling Brennan of Workman|Nydegger , who was frankly absolutely wonderful at trial .
And thank you to you , Groklaw volunteers , because we made a difference in this world .
SCO 's stock I see is today worth a nickel .
I consider that overpriced , personally .
It 's not worth a plugged nickel .
Well , I know nothing about stocks , so do n't go by me .
Here 's what I can't wait to read : SCO 's press release .
Remember when they put them out after all major court events ?
And Rob Enderle , Dan Lyons , and Maureen O'Gara .
Ca n't wait .
Say , did n't Paul Murphy say he'd stop blogging if SCO lost ?
Promises , promises .
And may I be forgiven for simply stating the obvious ?
Groklaw was never biased .
We merely had sufficient expertise to call it right .
And we did .
SCO really did fall downstairs , hitting its head on every step .
Here 's the real question , though .
How come Boies Schiller could n't call it right , when a mere paralegal could , and so protect its client from going forward with a case that to me was obviously a loser from day one ?
Maybe they tried .
But review this 2003 teleconference transcript from our Transcripts page with Mr. Boies in attendance and decide for yourself if they were dragged in or willingly jumped .
It 's so puzzling to me .
There may be an appeal , you say ?
Yes , true .
I hope there is one , because Boies Schiller has to do it for free , under its contract with SCO , and they claim they are already in the red on this case .
I 'd call that a healthy learning experience .
You know what else I can't wait to hear ?
What SCO 's trustee Edward Cahn tells the bankruptcy court now .
First he told it that SCO had worthy claims , then he said they had a 50 - 50 chance , all to justify going forward with this turkey of a case , at huge expense to SCO .
And to all the folks who said viciously untrue things about Groklaw , apologies would be most welcome .
Here it all is :

06/10/2010 - 878 - JUDGMENT in favor of Novell , Inc. against SCO Group .
Case Closed .
Signed by Judge Ted Stewart on 06/10/2010 . ( asp ) ( Entered : 06/10/2010 ) Update : Novell has now issued a statement : United States District Court Judge Issues Final Judgment Confirming Novell Ownership of UNIX Copyrights and Denying Other SCO Claims June 11th , 2010 by Ian Bruce Yesterday , United States District Court Judge Ted Stewart issued a Final Judgment regarding the long standing dispute between SCO Group and Novell .
As part of the decision , the Court reaffirmed the earlier jury verdict that Novell maintained ownership of important UNIX copyrights , which SCO had asserted to own in its attack on the Linux computer operating system .
The Court also issued a lengthy Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law wherein it determined that SCO was not entitled to an order requiring Novell to transfer the UNIX copyrights because  Novell had purposely retained those copyrights . 
In addition , the Court concluded that SCO was obligated to recognize Novells waiver of SCOs claims against IBM and other companies , many of whom utilize Linux .
Commenting on the Judgment , Novell President and CEO Ron Hovsepian stated  After almost a decade of litigation , we are very pleased to see this final judgment uphold all of Novells claims .
I am very proud of this achievement and the work Novell has done to ensure Linux remains free and open . 
Update 2 : O'Gara has indeed written her article , titled " Novell Wipes the Floor with SCO . "
You 'd never guess she was a participant in the litigation .
One snip : Unless it decides to appeal , it 's all over for SCO and it's not clear SCO has the financial staying power to last through an appeal .
The legal bill for another appeal is already paid ; it 's SCO basic viability that 's in question .
A call to SCO 's general counsel went unanswered .
She says " unless there 's a miracle " the case against IBM wo n't go forward now .
I 'm no theologian , but I 'm pretty sure that if SCO is praying to God for a miracle , it 's not the type of prayer that gets answered .
Even Santa
Claus asks if you 've been naughty or nice .
She also spins some more , " It also lost its right to sue IBM for copying Unix code into Linux . "
That was a fantasy .
It was IBM 's own code SCO sued over , on a claim of control of derivative works under a license .
And someone who did visit her site tells me her actual wording was " ... unless there is a miracle IBM will never stand trial . "
Spun as IBM getting away with something .
Some things never change , I see .
[ http://linux.sys-con.com/node/1428534 if you must . ]
Now I hope IBM does pursue its counterclaims , like its Lanham
Act claims for all the trash talk it endured at the hands of SCO and its supporters .
Remember Groklaw's Alanyst 's poem about IBM 's lawyers , The Nazgul , A Derivative Work of the Intellectual Property of Edgar Allan Poe ?
And the Nazgul , never flitting , still is sitting , still is sitting
On the pallid pasty bust of Bill above my office door ;
And in gloom I sit defeated , crushed by lies that I repeated ,
And the innocence I pleaded has been laughed down to the floor ;
And the bankruptcy attorney lurking round my cellblock door
Shall release me  nevermore !
Oh my , but it 's been so much fun doing Groklaw with you guys .
Fun , yes , but serious work with a purpose .
Imagine a world where SCO 's version of copyright and contract law won .
Here 's the Final Judgment wording :
This matter came before the Court for trial on March 8 , 2010 , through March 26 , 2010 .
Based on the Jury Verdict and the Courts Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law , Final Judgment is entered as follows : 1 . Judgment is entered in favor of Novell and against SCO on SCOs claim for slander of title pursuant to the Jury Verdict .
2 . Judgment is entered in favor of Novell and against SCO on SCOs claim for specific performance pursuant to the Courts Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law .
3 . Judgment is entered in favor of Novell and against SCO on Novells claim for declaratory relief pursuant to the Courts Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law .
Specifically , the Court declares : a. Under § 4.16 ( b ) of the APA , Novell is entitled , at its sole discretion , to direct SCO to waive its purported claims against IBM , Sequent and other SVRX licensees ; b. Under § 4.16 ( b ) of the APA , Novell is entitled to waive on SCOs behalf SCOs purported claims against IBM , Sequent and other SVRX licensees , when SCO refuses to act as directed by Novell ; and c. SCO is obligated to recognize Novells waiver of SCOs purported claims against IBM and Sequent .
4 . Judgment is entered in favor of Novell and against SCO on SCOs claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing pursuant to the Courts Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law .
The Clerk of the Court is directed to close this case forthwith .
SO ORDERED .

corporation , Plaintiff / Counterclaim Defendant , vs. NOVELL , INC . , a Delaware corporation , Defendant / Counterclaim Plaintiff .

Case No. 2:04 -CV - 139 TS MEMORANDUM DECISION AND
ORDER DENYING SCO'S
RENEWED MOTION FOR
JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF
LAW OR , IN THE ALTERNATIVE ,
FOR A NEW TRIAL ___________________
This matter comes before the Court on SCO 's Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or , in the Alternative , for a New Trial .
For the reasons discussed below , the Court will deny the Motion .
1 I. BACKGROUND
This matter came before the Court for trial from March 8 , 2010 , through March 26 , 2010 .
The sole issue before the jury was SCO 's claim for slander of title .
* 1 . After its deliberations , the jury found that the amended Asset Purchase Agreement ( ' APA ' ) did not transfer the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights from Novell to SCO .
*2
Because it found that SCO was not the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights , there was no need for the jury to reach SCO 's slander of title claim .
In the instant Motion , SCO argues that the ' jury simply got it wrong . '*3
As a result , SCO argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law or , in the alternative , a new trial .
Novell opposes the Motion .
II .
DISCUSSION A. JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW Under Fed.R.Civ.P.
50 , a court should render judgment as a matter of law when 'a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue . '* 4
A party which has made a motion for 2 judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 ( a ) prior to a jury verdict may renew that motion under Rule 50 ( b ) after judgment is rendered .
" In [ entertaining a motion for judgment as a matter of law ] , the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party , and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence . " * 5 " Credibility determinations , the weighing of the evidence , and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions , not those of a judge . "
* 6
The Tenth Circuit has made it clear that judgment as a matter of law is to be " cautiously and sparingly granted , " * 7 and is only appropriate when there is no way to legally justify a jury verdict .
Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only " [ i ] f there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis . . . with respect to a claim or defense . . . under the controlling law , " * 8 or if " the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences which may support the opposing party 's position . " * 9 " Judgment as a matter of law is improper unless the evidence so overwhelmingly favors the moving party as to permit no other rational conclusion . "
* 10 3 SCO argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law " because the verdict cannot be squared with the overwhelming evidence and the law . " * 11 The Court respectfully disagrees .
The jury was presented with two versions of the deal between Novell and Santa Cruz , SCO 's predecessor in interest .
On the one hand , SCO argued that the deal was essentially an acquisition of the UNIX and UnixWare business , wherein Santa Cruz acquired all of the business , including the copyrights .
Novell , on the other hand , argued that the deal was more complex and that Santa Cruz only acquired the UnixWare business and that Novell retained significant rights in the UNIX business , such as the copyrights and the right to receive SVRX royalties .
Evidently , the jury found Novell 's version of facts to be more persuasive .
This conclusion is well supported by the evidence .
There was substantial evidence that Novell made an intentional decision to retain ownership of the copyrights .
For instance , Tor Braham , outside counsel for Novell and lead drafter of the APA , testified that Novell was selling to Santa Cruz the UnixWare business and retaining the UNIX business .
* 12 Mr. Braham testified that the exclusion of the copyrights was agreed upon by the parties .
* 13 Mr. Braham stated that the purpose for excluding the copyrights was to protect Novell 's interest in the UNIX business that it had retained .
*14 4 Mr. Braham 's testimony is supported by James Tolonen , Novell 's Chief Financial Officer at the time of the APA and Amendment No. 2 , who testified that the copyrights were purposefully excluded from the assets to be transferred to Santa Cruz .
* 15 Mr. Tolonen explained that retaining the copyrights was : ( 1 ) " part of [ Novell 's ] strategy and really necessary under the nature of the transaction " ; ( 2 ) necessary because Santa Cruz was relatively small and could not afford the entire value ; ( 3 ) necessary to avoid ownership issues with other products ; and ( 4 ) necessary because of concerns with the long - term viability of Santa Cruz . * 16 That testimony is further supported by Michael Defazio , an executive vice president at Novell at the time of the APA , who testified that the intent of the APA was not to transfer the copyrights and that the copyrights were retained as a way to " bulletproof " Novell 's financial asset stream .* 17
All such testimony is further supported by the minutes of Novell 's Board of Directors , which resolved that " Novell will retain all of its patents , copyrights and trademarks ( except for the trademarks UNIX and UnixWare ) . " * 18 It is true that SCO presented more witnesses who testified that it was the intent of the parties to transfer the copyrights as part of the deal but , as the jury was instructed , the number of 5 witnesses is not determinative .
* 19
Thus , there was more than sufficient evidence on which the jury could determine that it was not the parties intent to transfer the copyrights .
SCO nonetheless argues that the copyrights were required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies under Amendment No. 2 .
Again , there was testimony presented that it was not the intent of Novell , in executing Amendment No. 2 , to transfer ownership of the copyrights .
Allison Amadia , who worked as in - house counsel for Novell at the time of Amendment No. 2 and was the lead negotiator and drafter of that document , testified that after reviewing the APA and consulting with Tor Braham and James Tolonen , the decision was made not to alter the APA with regard to copyright ownership .* 20
In fact , Novell rejected a draft amendment from SCO which would have transferred ownership of the copyrights " which pertain to the UNIX and UnixWare technologies and which SCO has acquired hereunder .
. . . " * 21 Ms. Amadia further testified that Amendment No. 2 was meant to affirm that SCO had the right to use , manufacture , and make modifications to the UNIX technology .
James Tolonen similarly testified that Amendment No. 2 was meant to address use rights , not ownership . *22 Further , SCO witnesses acknowledged that SCO could operate its UnixWare business without the copyrights .
Mr. McBride , SCO 's former CEO , admitted that SCO could run its 6 UnixWare business without the copyrights .* 23 Mr. Tibbitts , SCO 's general counsel , similarly stated that SCO could run its UNIX product business without the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights .* 24 Indeed , SCO had offered to sell its business without the copyrights .* 25 Moreover , it was undisputed that SCO would own any newly developed code and could obtain copyrights to protect that code .* 26 Finally , while SCO 's witnesses testified that the copyrights were " required " for SCO to run its SCOsource licensing program , this was not something that SCO ever acquired from Novell .
SCO relies on Recital A in arguing that SCO acquired the " Business , " which is defined as " the business of developing a line of software products currently known as Unix and UnixWare , the sale of binary and source code licenses to various versions of Unix and UnixWare , the support of such products and the sale of other products which are directly related to Unix and UnixWare . " * 27 SCO , however , ignores Recital B which states that Santa Cruz would only acquire " certain assets . " * 28 Those " certain assets " are set forth in more detail in Schedule 1.1 ( a ) and do 7 not include the excluded assets set out in Schedule 1.1 ( b ) .* 29 Under the plain language of the original APA , the copyrights were excluded from the transaction .
*30 SCO also points to Section II of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) , which transferred " [ a ]ll of [ Novell 's ] claim arising after the Closing Date against any parties relating to any right , property or asset included in the Business . " * 31 However , SCO provided no evidence of any such claims that it was entitled to pursue .
Based on the above , the Court finds that SCO is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its claim for copyright ownership .
B. NEW TRIAL SCO moves , in the alternative , for a new trial under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 . Rule 59 ( a ) provides that a new trial may be granted " after a jury trial , for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court . " * 32 The Tenth Circuit has stated that " [ a ] motion for new trial on the grounds that the jury verdict is against the weight of the evidence . . . involve[s ] the discretion of the trial court . . . .
The inquiry focuses on whether the verdict is clearly , decidedly or overwhelmingly against the weight of the evidence . "
* 33 8 SCO argues that the " overwhelming weight of the evidence . . . [ shows ] that a transfer of copyrights was intended . " * 34 It is certainly true that SCO presented more witnesses than Novell concerning the intent of the parties , however , the mere fact that SCO presented more witnesses does not show that the verdict is clearly , decidedly , or overwhelmingly against the weight of the evidence .
The jury could have rejected the testimony of SCO 's witnesses for a number of reasons , including their lack of involvement in drafting the APA , the fact that there was little testimony on any actual discussions concerning the transfer of copyrights , or that many of the witnesses had a financial interest in the litigation .
SCO also relies on the " Forthright Negotiator Rule . "
Under that rule ,
Where the parties assign different meanings to a term ,
it is interpreted in accordance with the meaning attached by one of them if at the time the agreement was made
( a ) that party did not know of any different meaning attached by the other , and the other knew the meaning attached by the first party ; or
( b ) that party had no reason to know of any different meaning attached by the other , and the other had reason to know the meaning attached by the first party .* 35
Here , there is no evidence to support the argument that Ms. Amadia had reason to know that SCO attached a different meaning to Amendment No. 2 . Indeed , Ms. Amadia specifically testified that she informed Mr. Sabbath that Novell would not transfer the copyrights .* 36 SCO also cites to the TLA as providing support for the transfer of copyrights .
The testimony concerning the TLA , however , affirmed that one of the purposes of that agreement was 9 to allow Novell the right to use post - APA SCO - developed code .*37 Further , the TLA licensed assets that were transferred under the APA , which did not include the copyrights .
SCO also points to various course of performance evidence in support of its argument .
However , this evidence , either individually or in combination , does not support the notion that it was the intent of the parties to transfer copyright ownership .
Finally , SCO argues that the copyrights were required for it to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of the UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
However , as set forth above , there was evidence that SCO did not need the copyrights to operate the UnixWare business , that it could obtain copyrights to protect any newly developed code , and that the SCOsource licensing program was not something that SCO acquired from Novell .
Thus , this argument fails .
For each of these reasons , the Court finds that the verdict is not clearly , decidedly , or overwhelmingly against the weight of the evidence .
Therefore , SCO is not entitled to a new trial .
III .
CONCLUSION
It is therefore ORDERED that SCO 's Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or , in the Alternative , for a New Trial ( Docket No. 871 ) is DENIED .

FINDINGS OF FACT AND
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW Case No. 2:04 -CV - 139 TS _________________________
This matter came before the Court for trial from March 8 , 2010 , through March 26 , 2010 .
Having heard the evidence presented at trial , reviewed the materials submitted by the parties , and being otherwise fully informed , the Court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law .
I. INTRODUCTION " This case primarily involves a dispute between SCO and Novell regarding the scope of intellectual property in certain UNIX and UnixWare technology and other rights retained by Novell following the sale of part of its UNIX business to Santa Cruz , a predecessor corporate 1 entity to SCO , in the mid-1990s . " 1
Following competing motions for summary judgment , this Court issued an opinion granting summary judgment to Novell on many of the key issues .
2 SCO appealed the Court 's decision to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed in part , reversed in part , and remanded for trial on the remaining issues .
Specifically , the Tenth Circuit reversed the Court 's " entry of summary judgment on ( 1 ) the ownership of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights ; ( 2 ) SCO 's claim seeking specific performance ; ( 3 ) the scope of Novell 's rights under Section 4.16 of the APA ; [ and ] ( 4 ) the application of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing to Novell 's rights under Section 4.16 of the APA .
" 3 The Tenth Circuit remanded these issues for trial .
4 Pursuant to the Tenth Circuit 's remand , a trial was held in this matter beginning March 8 , 2010 , through March 26 , 2010 .
Prior to trial , the parties agreed that certain issues were to be decided by the jury and certain issues were to be decided by the Court .
5
Specifically , SCO 's claim for slander of title and Novell 's counterclaim for slander of title were to be decided by the jury .
6
At the close of Novell 's evidence , the Court granted SCO 's Motion for Judgment as a 2 Matter of Law Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 on Novell 's counterclaim for slander of title . 7
After its deliberations , the jury found that the amended Asset Purchase Agreement ( " APA " ) did not transfer the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights from Novell to SCO.8
Because it found that SCO was not the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights , there was no need for the jury to reach SCO 's slander of title claim .
The issues the Court must now decide include : ( 1 ) SCO 's claim for specific performance , seeking an order directing Novell to transfer the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights ; ( 2 ) Novell 's counterclaim for declaratory judgment of its rights under Section 4.16 of the APA ; and ( 3 ) SCO 's claim that Novell breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in exercising its rights under Section 4.16 of the APA.9
Additionally , the parties agreed that Novell 's affirmative defense of unclean hands , if any , should be tried to the Court .10 Novell did not include any discussion of its affirmative defense of unclean hands in its Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.11
The Court finds that this constitutes a waiver of that defense and 3 it will not be addressed by the Court .
12
Therefore , only those three issues set forth above remain for the Court 's determination .
II .
FINDINGS OF FACT A. THE PARTIES 1 .
Plaintiff , The SCO Group , Inc. ( " SCO " ) , is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Lindon , Utah.13 SCO is in the business of developing and selling software products .
14 2 . Defendant , Novell , Inc. ( " Novell " ) , is a Delaware corporation with its executive offices in Waltham , Massachusetts , and its principal product development facility in Provo , Utah.15 Novell is also involved in the development and sale of software products .
16 B. UNIX AND UNIXWARE 3 .
UNIX is the name of a computer operating system originally developed in the late 1960s by engineers at AT&T's Bell Laboratories .17 4 4 . " By the 1980s , AT&T had developed UNIX System V ( " SVRX " ) ; it built a substantial business by licensing UNIX source code to a number of major computer manufacturers , including IBM , Sun , and Hewlett - Packard .
These manufacturers , in turn , would use the SVRX source code to develop their own individualized UNIX - derived " flavors " for use on their computer systems .
Licensees could modify the source code and create derivative products mostly for internal use , but agreed to keep the UNIX source code confidential .
" 18 5 . " In 1993 , Novell paid over $ 300 million to purchase UNIX System Laboratories , the AT&T spin - off that owned the UNIX copyrights and licenses .
" 19 6 . " UnixWare is the brand name for the more recent releases of the UNIX System V , Release 4 operating system developed and licensed in the early 1990s by Novell and its predecessors to the technology .
The product was called UnixWare because it was to be a combination of the latest release of System V source code and some components of Novell 's NetWare source code .
The first releases of UnixWare contain all or virtually all of the technology included in the immediately prior System V releases , SVR4.2 and SVR4.2MP . " 20 5 7 . As will be discussed in more detail below , Novell sold the UnixWare business to Santa Cruz in 1995 under the APA.21 " The core members of Novell 's UNIX licensing group became employees of Santa Cruz .
After the APA , Santa Cruz and then SCO developed and licensed SCO UnixWare . " 22 8 . " SCO released several subsequent releases of UnixWare , including multiple versions of each UnixWare 2 and UnixWare 7 , which are the latest implementation of System V and the latest generation of UNIX SVR 4.2 with SVR 4.2 MP .
All of the releases of UnixWare subsequent to Novell 's transfer of the business are releases of System V. Witnesses testified that the commercially valuable technology from the prior versions is included in UnixWare , and UnixWare would not operate without its System V components .
The current version of UnixWare supports the newest industry - standard hardware .
" 23 9 . " Novell acknowledges that it is not entitled to royalties from any UnixWare licenses .
" 24 C. THE SALE TO SANTA CRUZ 10 .
In 1995 , Robert Frankenberg , then - CEO of Novell , made the determination that it would be in the best interest of Novell to sell the UNIX business .
25 Mr. Frankenberg appointed 6 Novell Senior Vice President Duff Thompson as the individual responsible for accomplishing the sale of the UNIX business .
26 Mr. Thompson and others from Novell had discussions with various individuals from Santa Cruz , which was ultimately chosen as the buyer .
27 11 .
It was the initial intent of Novell to sell the entire UNIX business .
28 However , during the negotiations , the parties realized that Santa Cruz could not afford to pay cash or stock for the entire purchase price sought by Novell .
29
Therefore , the deal was structured so that Novell only sold certain of the assets that it had acquired when it purchased the UNIX business from AT & T.30
In particular , Novell sold Santa Crux the UnixWare business , that is the right to exploit and develop UnixWare .
31
As will be discussed below , Novell retained substantial rights in the UNIX business ,32 that is the UNIX System V source licensing business where source code was provided to customers to create a binary product .
33 Specifically , Novell retained the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights and the right 7 to receive SVRX royalties .
For its part , SCO was to act as Novell 's agent in the collection of those royalties and SCO acquired certain UNIX - related assets , such as contracts and employees , to aid in this role .
34 12 .
In exchange for selling these assets , Novell received the following : approximately 16 % to 19 % of Santa Cruz Stock ; a royalty arrangement if Santa Cruz hit certain benchmarks on certain products ; and the royalties from SVRX licenses .35 D. THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT 13 .
In September 1995 , Novell and Santa Cruz entered into the APA memorializing the terms of the sale .
36
The APA was signed on September 19 , 1995 , and was amended in December 1995 and again in October 1996.37 SCO is a successor - in - interest to all of the assets that Santa Cruz acquired under the amended APA with Novell .38 14 .
Recitals A and B of the APA state : A. Seller is engaged in the business of developing a line of software products currently known as Unix and UnixWare , the sale of binary and source code licenses to various versions of Unix and UnixWare , the support of such products and the sale of other products which are directly related to Unix and UnixWare ( collectively , the " Business " ) .
B . The Board of Directors of each of Seller and Buyer believe it is in the best interests of each company and their respective stockholders that Buyer 8 acquire certain assets of , and assume certain liabilities of Seller compromising the Business ( the " Acquisition " ) .
39 15 . The " Acquisition " and those " certain assets " which Santa Cruz acquired are set forth in more detail in Section 1.1 ( a ) of the APA .
That section provides :
On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement , Seller will sell , convey , transfer , assign and deliver to Buyer and Buyer will purchase and acquire from Seller on the Closing Date . . . all of Seller 's right , title and interest in and to the assets and properties of Seller relating to the Business ( collectively the " Assets " ) identified on Schedule 1.1 ( a ) hereto .
Notwithstanding the foregoing , the Assets to be so purchased shall not include those assets ( the " Excluded Assets " ) set forth on Schedule 1.1 ( b ) .40 16 .
Schedule 1.1 ( a ) identifies those assets that were transferred under the APA .
Section I of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) states :
All rights and ownership of UNIX and UnixWare , including but not limited to all versions of UNIX and UnixWare and all copies of UNIX and UnixWare ( including revisions and updates in process ) , and all technical , design , development , installation , operation and maintenance information concerning UNIX and UnixWare , including source code , source documentation , source listings and annotations , appropriate engineering notebooks , test data and test results , as well as all reference manuals and support materials normally distributed by Seller to end-users and potential end -users in connection with the distribution of UNIX and UnixWare . . . . 41 That provision goes on to list a number of UNIX source code products , binary product releases , products under development , and other technology .
42 9 17 . Section II of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) transferred " [ a]ll of Seller 's claims arising after the Closing Date against any parties relating to any right , property or asset included in the Business .
" 43 18 . Section III.L of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) transferred to Santa Cruz " [ a]ll of Seller 's rights pertaining to UNIX and UnixWare under any software development contracts [ or ] licenses . . . and which pertain to the Business , . . . including without limitation : Software and Sublicensing Agreements . . . . " 44 19 . Section IV of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) transfers " [ a]ll copies of UNIX and UnixWare , wherever located , owned by Seller . " 45 20 .
Section V of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) , the " Intellectual Property " portion of the included asset schedule , transfers : " Trademarks UNIX and UnixWare as and to the extent held by the seller . . . . " 46 21 . Section V of Schedule 1.1 ( b ) , the " Intellectual Property " portion of the excluded asset schedule , states : " A . All copyrights and trademarks , except for the trademarks UNIX and UnixWare .
B. All Patents " 47 10 22 . Section VIII of Schedule 1.1 ( b ) excludes " [ a]ll right , title and interest to the SVRx Royalties , less the 5 % fee for administering the collection thereof pursuant to Section 4.16 hereof .
" 48 23 .
Under the plain language of the original APA , all copyrights , including the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights , were clearly excluded from the transaction between Novell and Santa Cruz .49 24 .
Another significant aspect of the APA is the treatment of SVRX royalties .
Under the payment provisions of the APA , Novell retained " all rights to the SVRX Royalties notwithstanding the transfer of the SVRX Licenses to [ Santa Cruz ] .
" 50 Santa Cruz agreed to collect and pass through 100 % of the SVRX royalties , as defined in Section 4.16 , and Novell agreed to pay Santa Cruz a 5 % administrative fee.51 Santa Cruz obtained only " legal title and not an equitable interest in such royalties within the meaning of Section 541 ( d ) of the Bankruptcy Code . " 52 25 . Section 4.16 ( a ) of the APA , as amended by Amendment No. 1 , provides : Following the Closing , Buyer shall administer the collection of all royalties , fees and other amounts due under all SVRX Licenses ( as listed in detail under item VI 11 of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) hereof and referred to herein as " SVRX Royalties " ) .
Within one ( 1 ) calendar month following each calendar month in which SVRX royalties ( and royalties from Royalty - Bearing Products ) are received by Buyer [ except for those SVRX Royalties to be retained in their entirety by Buyer pursuant to paragraph ( e ) of Section 1.2 hereof ]
Buyer shall remit 100 % of all such royalties to Seller or Seller 's assignee .
Buyer shall also provide to Seller , within six ( 6 ) days following the calendar month in which such royalties are received , and estimate the total amount of such royalties .
. . .
In consideration of such activities described in the preceding sentence , Seller shall pay to Buyer within 5 days of receipt of SVRX Royalties from Buyer as set forth in the preceding sentence , an administrative fee equal to 5 % of such SVRX Royalties . . . .53 26 . Item VI of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) states that among the assets to be transferred to SCO are " [ a ]ll contracts relating to the SVRX Licenses listed below .
" 54 Item VI of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) goes on to provide a list of SVRX software releases , up to and including UNIX System V 4.2 MP.55 UNIX System V 4.2 MP was the last version of UNIX before UnixWare .
56 27 .
Under Section 1.2(e ) , which was added by Amendment No. 1 , Santa Cruz had the right to retain 100 % of the following categories of SVRX Royalties : ( 1 ) fees attributable to stand - alone contracts for maintenance and support of SVRX products listed under Item VI of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) ; ( 2 ) source code right to use fees under existing SVRX Licenses from the licensing of additional CPU's and from the distribution by Santa Cruz of additional source code copies ; ( 3 ) source code right to use fees attributable to new SVRX licenses approved by Novell pursuant to Section 4.16 ( b ) ; and ( 4 ) royalties attributable to the 12 distribution by Santa Cruz and its distributors of binary copies of SVRX products , to the extent such copies are made by or for Santa Cruz pursuant to Santa Cruz 's own licenses from Novell acquired before the Closing Date .57 28 .
Section 4.16 ( b ) , as amended by Amendment No. 1 , states : Buyer shall not , and shall not have the authority to , amend , modify or waive any right under any SVRX License without the prior written consent of Seller .
In addition , at Seller 's sole discretion and direction , Buyer shall amend , supplement , modify or waive any rights under , or shall assign any rights to , any SVRX License to the extent so directed in any manner or respect by Seller .
In the event that Buyer shall fail to take any such action concerning the SVRX Licenses as required herein , Seller shall be authorized , and hereby is granted , the rights to take any action on Buyer 's own behalf .
Notwithstanding the foregoing , Buyer shall have the right to enter into amendments of the SVRX Licenses ( i ) as may be incidentally involved through its rights to sell and license UnixWare software or the Merged Product . . . or future versions of the Merged Product , or ( ii ) to allow a licensee under a particular SVRX License to use the source code of the relevant SVRX product (s ) on additional CPU 's or to receive an additional distribution , from Buyer , of such source code .
In addition , Buyer shall not , and shall have no right to , enter into new SVRX Licenses except in the situation specified in ( i ) of the preceding sentence or as otherwise approved in writing in advance by Seller on a case by case basis .58 29 .
Another aspect of the APA is the License Back of Assets found in Section 1.6 .
That section states that Santa Cruz must execute a license agreement giving Novell " a royalty - free , perpetual , worldwide license to ( i ) all of the technology included in the Assets and ( ii ) all derivatives of the technology included in the Assets .
" 59 13 30 .
The parties did enter into a Technology Licensing Agreement ( " TLA " ) in connection with the APA 's closing .
60 The TLA states that Novell retains a " non-exclusive , non-terminable , worldwide , fee - free licence to " use " Licensed Technology " under certain conditions .
61 The TLA provides that the term " Licensed Technology " has the same meaning attributed to it in the APA .
The APA , in turn , defines " Licensed Technology " as " all of the technology included in the Assets and . . . all derivatives of the technology included in the Assets . " 62 31 .
Novell 's Board of Directors approved the APA on September 18 , 1995.63
As part of that approval , the Board of Directors resolved that " Novell will retain all of its patents , copyrights and trademarks ( except for the trademarks UNIX and UnixWare ) . . . . " 64 E. THE CLOSING AND AMENDMENT NO .
1 32 . The transaction between Novell and Santa Cruz closed on December 6 , 1995 .
At the same time , the parties entered into a Bill of Sale65 and Amendment No. 1.66 14 33 .
As set forth above , Amendment No. 1 made various changes to the APA , including changes to Section 4.16 .
Amendment No. 1 , however , did not amend the intellectual property portion of either the included or excluded asset schedules found in Schedule 1.1 ( a ) and Schedule 1.1 ( b ) .67 F. AMENDMENT NO .
2 34 .
The parties entered into Amendment No. 2 on October 16 , 1996.68 Amendment No. 2 amended the intellectual property provision of the excluded asset schedule , Schedule 1.1 ( b ) , as follows :
All copyrights and trademarks , except for the copyrights and trademarks owned by Novell as of the date of the Agreement required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
However , in no event shall Novell be liable to SCO for any claim brought by any third party pertaining to said copyrights and trademarks .
69 35 .
Amendment No. 2 also set out provisions for how the parties were to approach future buy - outs of SVRX licenses .70 Section B.5 of Amendment No. 2 states :
This Amendment does not give Novell the right to increase any SVRX licensee 's rights to SVRX source code , nor does it give Novell the right to grant new SVRX source code licenses .
In addition , Novell may not prevent SCO from exercising its rights with respect to SVRX source code in accordance with the Agreement .71 15 G. TESTIMONY ON SCO'S CLAIM FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE 36 .
The bulk of the evidence presented during the March 2010 trial focused on the intent of the parties concerning the APA and what copyrights were " required " for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
The Court will discuss that evidence below .
1 . The Intent of the Parties a. SCO 's Witnesses 37 .
SCO presented a number of witnesses who testified that it was the intent of the parties to transfer ownership of the copyrights .
38 . Robert Frankenberg , the CEO of Novell at the time of the APA , testified that it was his intent to sell the UNIX business in its entirety , including the UNIX copyrights .
72 However , Mr. Frankenberg 's testimony revealed that he was only involved in the high - level negotiations , that he did not read the entire APA before he signed it , and that he relied on the advice of the attorneys and others in accepting the APA.73 39 .
Duff Thompson , the Senior Vice President of Corporate Development for Novell at the time of the APA , testified that he was instructed to sell the UNIX business in its entirety .
74
As part of that sale , Mr. Thompson testified that he " assumed " that the 16 copyrights were being sold as well .
75 Despite this assumption , Mr. Thompson offered no testimony on any actual discussions concerning the copyrights .
Mr. Thompson also testified that around the time of the APA he had already decided to leave Novell .76 Mr. Thompson subsequently became a board member of Santa Cruz and ultimately of SCO.77 Mr. Thompson was part of the SCO board when SCO made the decision to sue Novell and voted in favor of that decision .
78 Mr. Thompson also has a financial interest in SCO and stands to gain financially if SCO is successful in this lawsuit .79 40 .
Edward Chatlos , the Senior Director of Strategic Relationships at Novell at the time of the APA , was a primary negotiator of the deal between Novell and Santa Cruz.80 Mr. Chatlos testified that the general nature of the transaction was to sell " the entire business , " including the copyrights .
81 Mr. Chatlos admitted that his wife works for SCO and that she had stock options that could become more valuable if SCO succeeded in this lawsuit .
82 17 41 .
Jim Wilt , Santa Cruz 's Vice President of Development at the time of the APA , testified that the intent of SCO was to acquire the entire UNIX and UnixWare business , including the copyrights .
83 However , Mr. Wilt also testified that he became less active toward the end of the negotiations and that he could not recall any specific conversations concerning the transfer of copyrights .
84 42 .
Alok Mohan , the CEO of Santa Cruz at the time of the APA , testified that Santa Cruz bought the business from Novell .
85 However , Mr. Mohan acknowledged that he was only involved in the negotiations at a high level .
86
He also testified that he was not involved in writing the APA , which was drafted by others .
87 43 .
Doug Michels , the Executive Vice President of Santa Cruz at the time of the APA , testified that the intent of Santa Cruz was to buy the UNIX business from Novell .88 Mr. Michels testified that Santa Cruz bought the business " [ a ] nd as a result of buying the business , we owned all the intellectual property .
" 89 Mr. Michels stated that there was " no 18 way that [ the ] deal could have happened without getting the copyrights .
" 90 However , Mr. Michels could not recall specific conversations concerning the copyrights .91 Mr. Michels further stated that he did not draft or review the APA,92 did not have specific recollections of being involved in Amendment No. 1,93 and did not know what Amendment No. 2 was.94 44 .
Burt Levine , an attorney working with Novell at the time of the APA who later transferred to Santa Cruz , testified that the intent was to transfer ownership rights , including the copyrights .
95 Mr. Levine testified that he disagreed with the language concerning intellectual property in the excluded asset schedule of the APA and would have stricken this language or reformed it in some way .
96 However , Mr. Levine did review this portion of the APA when it was being drafted and did not alter the copyright exclusion .
97 19 45 .
Ty Mattingly , Novell 's Vice President of Corporate Development Strategic Relationships at the time of the APA , was also involved in the sale of the UNIX business to Santa Cruz.98 Mr. Mattingly testified that Novell " sold the business " to Santa Cruz and that Novell only retained 95 % of the SVRX royalties .
99 Mr. Mattingly , however , stated that he was not focused on the details of the transaction and was more of a " high level strategy guy .
" 100 While he was involved in the memorandum of understanding phase , he was not involved in the actual drafting of the APA.
101 Further , Mr. Mattingly testified that he owns over 9,000 shares of SCO stock .
102 46 .
Kimberlee Madsen worked as the Manager of Law and Corporate Affairs for Santa Cruz at the time of the APA.103 Ms. Madsen was involved in the transaction between Novell and Santa Cruz as support for Santa Cruz 's general counsel Steve Sabbath and was involved in the negotiations as well .
104 Ms. Madsen testified that the intent was for Santa Cruz to purchase all of the UNIX and UnixWare assets , including the copyrights .
105 20 However , Ms. Madsen conceded that the transaction was more complicated than simply buying the whole business .
106 47 .
Steve Sabbath , Santa Cruz 's general counsel at the time of the APA , testified that Santa Cruz was buying the entire business , including the intellectual property .
107 However , Mr. Sabbath previously executed a declaration where he made a number of contradictory statements , including that , under the APA , Novell would retain significant UNIX - related assets including much of the UNIX System V intellectual property .
108 b. Novell 's Witnesses 48 .
Tor Braham , outside counsel for Novell and lead drafter of the APA , testified that Novell was selling to Santa Cruz the UnixWare business while Novell " retained all of the economics and relationships arising out of the UNIX business .
" 109 Mr. Braham testified that the exclusion of the copyrights was agreed upon by the parties .
110
He also stated that the purpose for excluding the copyrights was to protect Novell 's interest in the UNIX business that it had retained .
111 Mr. Braham further testified that Santa Cruz could use the assets that it received " to then build a new version of UnixWare , and it would own the 21 copyrights in what it built on top of the base UNIX and UnixWare software that it had a copy of .
" 112 Santa Cruz could then license that product to third parties .
113 49 .
David Bradford worked as Novell 's general counsel from 1985 to 2000 .
Mr. Bradford testified that it was " very clear " that Novell retained the copyrights .
114 Mr. Bradford further testified that the Novell board of directors agreed that under the APA Novell would retain all of its copyrights .
115 50 .
James Tolonen , Novell 's Chief Financial Officer at the time of the APA , testified that the copyrights were purposefully excluded from the assets to be transferred to Santa Cruz .
116 Mr. Tolonen explained that retaining the copyrights was done : ( 1 ) as " part of [ Novell 's ] strategy and [ was ] really necessary under the nature of the transaction " ; ( 2 ) because Santa Cruz was relatively small and could not afford the entire value ; ( 3 ) to avoid ownership issues with other products ; and ( 4 ) because of concerns with the long - term viability of Santa Cruz .
117
As will be discussed in more detail below , Mr. Tolonen also testified that Amendment No. 2 was meant to address use rights , not ownership of the copyrights .
118 22 51 .
Michael Defazio , an Executive Vice President at Novell at the time of the APA , testified that the intent of the APA was not to transfer the copyrights and that the copyrights were retained as a way to " bulletproof " Novell 's financial asset stream .
119 52 .
Jack Messman was a member of Novell 's Board of Directors at the time of the APA120 and would later become CEO .
Mr. Messman was present for a telephonic meeting where the APA was discussed .
121 Mr. Messman testified that , based upon that meeting , he understood that the copyrights were not sold as part of the transaction between Novell and Santa Cruz and that there was a specific discussion on that issue .
122 Mr. Messman stated Novell retained the copyrights because SCO was a " fledgling company " and because Novell was worried about the SVRX revenue stream .
123 Mr. Messman tesfied that retention of the copyrights " was the key part of the deal that convinced the board to do that deal .
" 124 Mr. Messman further testified that the copyrights were not required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies as the plan was for SCO to develop new code .
125 23 c. Conclusions from the Testimony 53 .
The Court finds the witnesses presented by SCO on the parties ' intent to be less credible than Novell 's witnesses for a number of reasons .
First , many of SCO 's witnesses were involved only in the " high level " negotiations and did not participate in the actual drafting of the APA where the details of the deal were agreed to .
Thus , while these individuals may have provided relevant testimony as to what the parties were intending or hoping to do at the outset , their testimony has less relevance as to what actually happened as the negotiations unfolded and the APA was actually drafted .
This fact is critical here because the transaction could not be completed as it had been initially envisioned , specifically it had to be structured to account for the fact that Santa Cruz did not have the financial resources necessary to purchase the entire business and there was uncertainty about its long - term viability .
Second , many of these witnesses seemed to take for granted that the copyrights would transfer , but there was surprisingly little evidence of any actual discussions concerning the copyrights .
Finally , a number of SCO 's witnesses , though not all , have a direct financial interest in this litigation .
126 d. Course of Performance 54 .
SCO also points to the parties ' course of performance to support its argument that it was the intent of the parties to transfer ownership of the copyrights .
24 55 . SCO points to a " joint " press release issued after the transaction .
That press release announced an " agreement for SCO to purchase the UNIX business from Novell . " 127 The press release goes on to state that " SCO will acquire Novell 's UnixWare business and UNIX intellectual property .
" 128 While SCO described this as a " joint " press release , there is no indication that it was joined in by Novell and appears to be issued solely by SCO .
Further , the press release supports Novell 's argument that SCO only acquired the UnixWare business , as opposed to the UNIX business .
Finally , though the press release mentions " UNIX intellectual property , " it does not specifically mention copyrights and could just as logically refer to other UNIX - related assets which did transfer under the APA .
56 . SCO also points to its 1996 Form 10 - K in which it stated that it " acquired certain assets related to the UNIX business including the core intellectual property from Novell . " 129 Again , there is no mention of copyrights and no description of what " core intellectual property " was acquired .
57 . SCO also relies on the fact that SCO copyright notices were placed on existing versions of UnixWare , but as SCO 's own witness admitted , this does not answer the question of ownership .
130 SCO also points to the physical possession of copyright registration 25 certificates .
However , SCO 's witnesses testified that , when the APA was finalized , SCO staff and property simply remained in the same physical location as before .
131 58 .
SCO also argues that letters sent from Novell to its customers support the conclusion that the copyrights were transferred .
These letters state that Novell transferred to SCO Novell 's " existing ownership interest in UNIX System - based offerings and related products .
" 132 However , SCO 's witnesses acknowledged that the letters were not meant to give the customers all of the details of the transaction , but merely to inform the customers that they were going to deal with SCO in the future .
133 59 .
SCO also points to the TLA as further evidence of the parties intent to transfer copyright ownership .
However , testimony concerning the TLA affirmed that one of the purposes of that agreement was to allow Novell the right to use post - APA SCO - developed code .
134 60 .
The Court finds that SCO 's course of performance evidence , either separately or in combination , does not support its position that it was the intent of the parties to transfer copyright ownership .
e. Conclusion on the Intent of the Parties 61 .
Based on the evidence presented at trial , the Court finds that it was not the intent of the parties to transfer ownership of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights .
Rather , the Court 26 finds that Novell intentionally retained the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights .
The Court finds that the copyrights were retained by Novell for the following reasons : ( 1 ) to protect the SVRX royalty stream ; ( 2 ) because Santa Cruz could not afford to purchase the entire UNIX business ; and ( 3 ) because of concerns with Santa Cruz 's future financial viability .
2 . Whether the Copyrights are " Required " 62 .
SCO argues that the copyrights are , nonetheless , " required " under Amendment No. 2 . 63 .
As set forth above , Amendment No. 2 amended the excluded asset schedule ( Schedule 1.1 ( b ) ) of the APA to state : " All copyrights and trademarks , except for the copyrights and trademarks owned by Novell as of the date of the Agreement required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
" 135 The parties presented differing evidence on the intent and purpose of Amendment No. 2 , as well as which copyrights were " required . " a. SCO 's Witnesses 64 .
SCO presented little evidence as to the intent of Amendment No. 2 . Steve Sabbath , general counsel for Santa Cruz at the time of the APA , testified that Amendment No. 2 was meant to confirm that Santa Cruz acquired all copyrights pertaining to the UNIX business .
136 Mr. Sabbath stated that the copyrights were needed to protect the technology .
137 As discussed above , however , Mr. Sabbath executed a contradictory 27 declaration and , as will be discussed below , Mr. Sabbath 's testimony is refuted by Novell witnesses .
65 . Kimberlee Madsen testified that the copyrights were essential for SCO to protect its intellectual property rights .
138 However , when asked what copyrights were required for Santa Cruz to operate its UNIX and UnixWare business , she responded that Santa Cruz " would have acquired all the copyrights .
" 139 Ms. Madsen also testified that she did not draft the language of Amendment No. 2 and had no specific recollection of any discussions with Mr. Sabbath about that Amendment .
140 66 .
A number of SCO witnesses testified that the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights were " required " for SCO to operate its business .
For instance , William Broderick , a former Novell and current SCO UNIX Contract manager , testified that the way " you show your ownership and protect your software is by copyright .
" 141 But Mr. Broderick was not involved in the negotiation of the APA and had no involvement in either Amendment .
142 67 .
Darl McBride , the former CEO of SCO , testified that ownership of the copyrights was required for SCO 's business .
143 Mr. McBride testified that there were a number of 28 reasons for this , stating that copyrights were required in order to make copies , do deals , and enforce your rights against others .
144 Mr. McBride was also not involved with negotiation or drafting of either the APA or Amendment No. 2.145 68 .
John Maciaszek , a former Novell and current SCO UNIX Product Manager , testified that copyrights are required for SCO to operate its business .
146
There is no evidence that Mr. Maciaszek was involved in negotiating or drafting the APA or its Amendments .
69 . Ryan Tibbitts , general counsel for SCO , testified that the copyrights were " critical " for SCO to run the business purchased from Novell .
147 Mr. Tibbitts stated : " Because we own the core UNIX intellectual property and a very critical component of that at this point in time is to protect that IP , and we have got to have that IP to keep other people from encroaching into our marketplace .
" 148 Mr. Tibbitts was similarly not involved with the APA or its Amendments .
149 70 .
Most of these witnesses testified that the copyrights were " required " for SCO to run its SCOsource licensing program .
150 However , as will be discussed below , this program was 29 not something that SCO acquired from Novell .
SCO only acquired the UnixWare business from Novell , while Novell retained significant rights in the UNIX business .
Amendment No. 2 applies only to those copyrights " required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies . "
71 . SCO witnesses acknowledged that SCO could operate its UnixWare business without the copyrights .
Mr. McBride admitted that SCO could run its UnixWare business without the copyrights .
151 Mr. Tibbitts similarly stated that SCO could run its UNIX product business without the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights .
152 Indeed , SCO had offered to sell its business without the copyrights .
153 72 .
Moreover , it was undisputed that SCO would own any newly developed code and could obtain copyrights to protect that code .
154 b. Novell 's Witnesses 73 .
Novell presented a different view of the intent and meaning of Amendment No. 2 . 74 .
Allison Amadia worked as in - house counsel for Novell at the time of Amendment No. 2 and was the lead negotiator and drafter of that document for Novell .
155 Ms. Amadia was contacted by Steve Sabbath , general counsel for SCO , who requested an amendment to 30 the APA .
156 Mr. Sabbath stated that because of a " clerical error " the APA did not transfer copyright ownership .
157 75 .
Mr. Sabbath sent Ms. Amadia a proposed amendment which would have amended Section V of Schedule 1.1 ( b ) of the APA ( the intellectual property portion of the excluded assets schedule ) to state : " All copyrights and trademarks , except for the copyrights and trademarks owned by Novell as of the date of this Amendment No. 2 , which pertain to the UNIX and UnixWare technologies and which SCO has acquired hereunder .
. . . " 158 76 .
After review of the APA and discussions with Tor Braham and James Tolonen , Novell , through Ms. Amadia , made the decision not to alter the APA with regard to copyright ownership as requested by Mr. Sabbath .
159 Rather than alter the APA to transfer copyrights , Ms. Amadia modified the amendment proposed by Mr. Sabbath to affirm that SCO had the rights to use the technology .
160 Ms. Amadia testified that Amendment No. 2 was meant to affirm that SCO had the right to use , manufacture , and make modifications to the UNIX technology .
161 31 77 .
James Tolonen , Novell 's Chief Financial Officer at the time of the APA and Amendment No. 2 , similarly testified that Amendment No. 2 was meant to address use rights , not ownership .
162 Mr. Tolonen stated that the easiest way to show a transfer of the copyrights would be to include them on the schedule of included assets , which did not happen .
163 78 .
Mr. Sabbath signed Amendment No. 2 , as modified by Ms. Amadia , on behalf of Santa Cruz with no apparent further protest .
164 c. Conclusions from the Testimony 79 .
The Court finds that Amendment No. 2 was not intended to confirm that the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights were transferred to SCO under the APA , as argued by SCO .
Rather , the Court finds that Novell made a conscious decision to retain the copyrights in the APA and that intent was reflected throughout the negotiating and drafting of Amendment No. 2 . The Court finds that Amendment No. 2 was only meant to confirm that SCO had the right to use the UNIX technology .
The Court finds the testimony of Novell 's witnesses , especially Ms. Amadia and Mr. Tolonen , to be credible .
The Court finds SCO 's witnesses to be less credible for a number of reasons , including the fact that many were not directly involved in the negotiation and drafting of Amendment No. 2 . Additionally , as previously stated , many have a financial interest in this litigation .
32 80 .
Based on all of the above , the Court finds that it was not the parties intent to transfer ownership of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights to SCO .
Rather , Novell purposefully retained those copyrights .
The purpose for doing so was to protect its significant interest in the SVRX royalty stream , to alleviate concerns of SCO 's future financial viability , and because of the fact that SCO could not afford to purchase the entire UNIX business .
The Court further finds that the copyrights are not required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
SCO did not acquire the entire UNIX business from Novell , but only acquired the UnixWare business while Novell retained substantial rights in the UNIX business .
The undisputed evidence is that SCO did not need the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights in order to operate its UnixWare product business .
Further , ownership of the copyrights is not required for SCO to protect its own code .
SCO did present evidence that the copyrights were required for SCO to operate its SCOsource licensing program .
However , this was a business strategy designed by SCO after the APA and its Amendments , not something that it acquired from Novell .
33 H. NOVELL'S WAIVER RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 4.16 81 .
As stated above , Novell retained significant assets under the APA .
One of those assets were royalties from SVRX licenses .
165 Novell recognized that this future royalty stream would be very significant .
166 Under the APA , SCO was to act as Novell 's agent in the collection of these royalties .
167 82 .
In connection with that role , SCO acquired certain assets , including certain agreements and certain employees of Novell .
168 83 .
Section 4.16 of the APA was " the key provision that embodied the deal that the UNIX business , as compared to the UnixWare business , . . . would remain with Novell , but be administered by SCO .
" 169 The intent of Section 4.16 was to " bulletproof " Novell 's ongoing financial interest .
170 A number of SCO witnesses similarly recognized the purpose of Section 4.16 as a way of protecting and managing Novell 's ongoing financial 34 interests , though those witnesses disagreed on the scope of Novell 's rights under that section .
171 84 .
Tor Braham testified that Section 4.16 was added to make very clear that SCO did not have the right to modify , change , or waive SVRX licenses without Novell 's written consent and that if SCO did not act properly Novell " could step in and do it ourselves .
" 172 Mr. Braham testified that Section 4.16 was drafted to avoid any doubt that Novell had complete rights to control what happened with the UNIX business .
173 Mr. Braham further stated that , under Section 4.16 , " [ i ] f SCO did n't do what it was supposed to do as [ Novell 's ] agent , we could step in . . . and do it ourselves .
" 174 85 . Section 4.16 ( a ) states : " Following the Closing , Buyer shall administer the collection of all royalties , fees and other amounts due under all SVRX Licenses ( as listed in detail under item VI of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) hereof and referred to herein as â SVRX Royalties ' ) .
. . . "
Item VI of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) states that among the assets to be transferred to SCO are " [ a ]ll contracts relating to the SVRX Licenses listed below . "
However , the list provided in Item VI of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) provides a list of SVRX software releases , not a list of license agreements .
35 86 . Section 4.16 ( b ) preserved to Novell certain waiver rights with regard to SVRX licenses .
It states , in pertinent part : Buyer shall not , and shall not have the authority to , amend , modify or waive any right under any SVRX License without the prior written consent of Seller .
In addition , at Seller 's sole discretion and direction , Buyer shall amend , supplement , modify or waive any rights under , or shall assign any rights to , any SVRX License to the extent so directed in any manner or respect by Seller .
In the event that Buyer shall fail to take any such action concerning the SVRX Licenses as required herein , Seller shall be authorized , and hereby is granted , the rights to take any action on Buyer 's own behalf .
175 87 .
The question here is what constitutes an " SVRX License . "
SCO contends that the term SVRX License applies only to product supplement agreements , while Novell contends that the term is not so limited and applies to software agreements and sublicensing agreements as well .
88 . William Broderick , the Director of Software Licensing for SCO , described the various types of agreements .
The first type of agreement is called the software agreement or umbrella agreement .
176
The software agreement provided the general terms and conditions that a company would agree to when licensing source code .
177
The second type of agreement is a product supplement agreement or product schedule license .
This type of license actually licenses a software product .
178 The third type of agreement is a sublicensing agreement .
The sublicensing agreement grants the rights to distribute a 36 binary product .
179 These agreements work together .
The software and product license allow companies to create a UNIX flavor and the sublicensing agreement allows that company to distribute its UNIX flavor .
A company could not take a product license if it did not have an umbrella software agreement .
180 89 .
SCO 's witnesses asserted that Novell 's waiver rights extend only to product schedule licenses .
For instance , Mr. Broderick testified that Novell used the term SVRX Licenses to refer to product schedule licenses that licensed SVRX products .
181 However , Mr. Broderick had no involvement in the drafting , negotiation , or approval of the APA or its amendments .
182 Mr. Broderick also conceded that there was nothing in the APA so limiting Section 4.16.183
Other SCO witnesses testified that this provision was only meant to give Novell control over binary royalties , 184 but this testimony suffers from the same flaws set forth above in relation to the intent of the parties .
Further , many of these witnesses acknowledged that the language of Section 4.16 of the APA was not limited to product supplement agreements .
185 37 90 . SCO also points to the parties ' course of performance in arguing that Novell 's waiver rights extend only to product schedule licenses .
Specifically , SCO points to a dispute between Novell , Santa Cruz , and IBM in 1996 where Novell attempted to grant IBM a buyout of its contractual royalty obligations .
186 SCO objected and began to initiate a lawsuit against Novell .
187
The dispute was ultimately settled by : ( 1 ) cancelling the buyout that Novell had executed with IBM and replacing it with Amendment No. X , a three - party agreement between IBM , Novell , and SCO ; ( 2 ) a payment to SCO ; and ( 3 ) clarifying how to approach future buyouts through Amendment No. 2.188 During that dispute , Novell did not invoke Section 4.16 ( b ) to the extent it now has .
189 However , the fact that Novell decided to settle this dispute in this way provides little support for SCO 's ultimate argument .
As recognized by the Tenth Circuit , " [ p] arties may choose to settle claims for a variety of reasons unrelated to their merits , not the least to avoid expensive litigation or to maintain civility in an important commercial relationship .
" 190 91 .
The Court finds that Novell 's waiver rights extend to all three types of agreements and are not limited to product supplement agreements .
The Court bases this finding on a number of things .
First , a number of witnesses , including SCO witnesses , recognized the 38 importance of the royalty stream that Novell was retaining and viewed Section 4.16 as the mechanism that Novell put in place to protect that royalty stream .
While Novell did transfer certain assets to SCO , it did not transfer the SVRX royalty stream .
In order to protect and maintain control over that royalty stream , Novell retained significant rights , as set out in Section 4.16 .
It only makes sense for Novell to retain control over all components of the SVRX licensing agreements in order to protect this significant asset .
The reasoning behind this is the somewhat hierarchical nature of the agreements .
Each company was required to sign a software agreement and termination of the software agreement would terminate the other agreements .
If Novell did not retain control over the software agreement , SCO could terminate that agreement , thereby terminating the other agreements , and deprive Novell of revenue to which Novell would be entitled .
Thus , in order for Novell to protect its SVRX revenue stream , it needed to retain rights with respect to all components of the SVRX licensing agreements .
92 . Second , the plain language of the APA states that Novell 's waiver rights apply to " any SVRX License . "
The language of the APA is not limited to product supplement agreements .
Several SCO witnesses conceded that the language of the APA was not limited to product supplement agreements .
93 . Third , Section 1.2(e ) provides support for this finding .
By identifying " source code right to use fees under existing SVRX Licenses " as a type of SVRX Royalty , this provision supports the conclusion that " SVRX License " includes software agreements covering source code rights .
39 94 . Fourth , 4.16 ( a ) refers to Item VI of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) .
That provision states that " [ a ]ll contracts relating to the SVRX Licenses listed below " will be transferred to SCO .
While Item VI does not go on to list licenses , it does go on to list releases of UNIX .
Thus , under this provision , SVRX licenses include all contracts relating to UNIX System V releases , up to and including UNIX System V 4.2 MP , the latest version of UNIX prior to UnixWare .
95 .
Finally , the Court finds SCO 's evidence on this to be less credible for many of the same reasons stated above in relation to SCO 's claim for specific performance .
Further , many witnesses acknowledged that the language of Section 4.16 of the APA was not limited to product supplement agreements .
96 .
Based on the above , the Court finds that Novell 's waiver rights apply to all three types of agreements and are not limited to product supplement agreements .
With this in mind , the Court turns to the actions taken by Novell under Section 4.16 .
I. LINUX , SCOSOURCE , AND NOVELL'S ACTIONS UNDER SECTION 4.16 97 .
" In 2002 and 2003 , tensions increased between Novell and SCO .
SCO asserted that users of Linux , an alternative to UNIX might be infringing on SCO 's UNIX - related intellectual property rights .
" 191 98 .
" In late 2002 , SCO formally created a new division known as SCOsource .
In approximately January 2003 , SCO launched its SCOsource program .
. . .
As a general matter , the SCOsource program was an effort to obtain license fees from Linux users 40 based on SCO 's claims to UNIX intellectual property allegedly contained in Linux . " 192 Under its SCOsource program , SCO " purported to offer Linux users the opportunity to purchase an intellectual property license in order to continue using Linux without infringing any of SCO 's copyrights .
" 193 99 .
In January 2003 , Joseph LaSala , Novell 's then - General Counsel , learned of SCO 's SCOsource program .
194 Mr. LaSala viewed this as a " campaign against Linux end users " and became concerned about SCO 's program because of Novell 's own involvement in the Linux business .
195
By that point , Novell had " announced its intention to get involved in the Linux business .
" 196 In connection with Novell 's Linux business , IBM purchased $ 50 million worth of Novell stock .
197 100 .
SCO filed a lawsuit against IBM in 2003 alleging that IBM had distributed UNIX source code and other confidential information to Linux .
198
As part of that litigation , SCO threatened to terminate IBM 's SVRX license .
41 101 .
After the initiation of that lawsuit , Mr. LaSala received a call from IBM 's outside counsel .
199 IBM 's outside counsel informed Mr. LaSala that Novell had certain rights under the APA.200 102 .
At some later point , Mr. LaSala participated in a call between himself , the general counsel of IBM , IBM 's outside counsel , and Novell 's outside counsel .
201
During that call , IBM 's outside counsel requested that Novell waive all claims that SCO had made or might make against IBM with respect to IBM 's SVRX license .
202
Novell , through its outside counsel , responded that they were looking at the issue , that they would evaluate each on a case by case basis , and that Novell would take action accordingly .
203 Novell undertook that analysis , which resulted in letter written on June 9 , 2003.204 103 .
On June 9 , 2003 , then - CEO of Novell Jack Messman wrote a letter to SCO CEO Darl McBride .205
In that letter , Novell stated that SCO was advancing unsubstantiated charges and threatening action that could potentially injure Novell , Novell 's customers , and the 42 industry in general .
206 Mr. Messman explained that Novell and SCO had granted IBM an irrevocable , fully paid - up , perpetual right to exercise all of the rights under the IBM SVRX Licenses that IBM then held and that IBM had paid over $ 10 million for this right .
207 Novell then quoted directly from Section 4.16 ( b ) of the APA , stating that Novell had the sole discretion to waive any rights under any SVRX License .
208 Novell concluded , acting pursuant to Section 4.16 ( b ) , by directing " SCO to waive any purported right SCO may claim to terminate IBM's SVRX Licenses enumerated in Amendment X or to revoke any rights thereunder .
" 209 When SCO failed to take the action directed by Novell , Novell wrote a second letter on June 12 , 2003.210
In that letter , Novell , acting pursuant to Section 4.16 ( b ) and on behalf of SCO , waived " any purported right SCO may claim to terminate IBM's SVRX Licenses enumerated in Amendment X or to revoke any rights thereunder .
" 211 104 .
Novell wrote another letter to SCO on October 7 , 2003 , responding to SCO 's " position that code developed by IBM , or licensed by IBM from a third party , which IBM incorporated in AIX but which itself does not contain proprietary UNIX code supplied by 43 AT&T under the license agreements between AT&T and IBM ( ' IBM Code ' ) , must nevertheless be maintained as confidential and may not be contributed to Linux . " 212 In that letter , Novell disputed SCO 's position , citing to various agreements .
213 Novell again cited to Section 4.16 ( b ) of the APA and directed " SCO to waive any purported right SCO may claim to require IBM to treat IBM Code itself as subject to the confidentiality obligations or use restrictions of the Agreements .
" 214 When SCO failed to take the action directed by Novell , Novell , acting pursuant to Section 4.16 ( b ) , waived " any purported right SCO may claim to require IBM to treat IBM Code . . . which IBM incorporated in AIX but which itself does not contain proprietary UNIX code supplied by AT&T under the license agreements between AT&T and IBM , itself as subject to the confidentiality obligations or use restrictions of the Agreements .
" 215 105 .
A similar interaction took place in relation to another company , Silicon Graphics , Inc. ( " SGI " ) .
On October 7 , 2003 , Novell wrote a letter to SCO disputing SCO 's " position that code developed by SGI , or licensed by SGI from a third party , which SGI incorporated in its UNIX variant but which itself does not contain proprietary UNIX code supplied by AT&T under the license agreement between AT&T and SGI ( " SGI Code " ) , 44 must nevertheless be maintained as confidential and may not be contributed to Linux . " 216 Novell stated that SCO 's position was " not supportable " and detailed the reasons why .
217 Citing to Section 4.16 ( b ) of the APA , Novell directed SCO " to waive any purported right SCO may claim to terminate SGI 's SVRX license or to revoke any rights thereunder .
" 218 Novell further directed SCO " to waive any purported right SCO may claim to require SGI to treat SGI code itself as subject to the confidentiality obligations or use restrictions of SGI 's SVRX license .
" 219 Novell made clear that it was not " directing SCO to take any action ( other than to waive termination ) with respect to claims that SGI incorporated in Linux certain proprietary UNIX code supplied by AT&T under the SGI license agreement .
" 220 106 . SCO also took this position with a third company , Sequent Computer Systems .
Novell responded in similar fashion .
On February 6 , 2004 , Novell wrote a letter to SCO directing SCO , under Section 4.16 ( b ) of the APA , " to waive any purported right SCO may claim to require Sequent ( or IBM as its successor ) to treat Sequent Code as subject to the confidentiality obligations or use restrictions of Sequent 's SVRX license .
"
221 When 45 SCO failed to take the action directed by Novell , Novell , acting pursuant to Section 4.16 ( b ) , waived " any purported right SCO may claim to require Sequent ( or IBM as its successor ) to treat Sequent Code as subject to the confidentiality obligations or use restrictions of Sequent 's SVRX license .
" 222 107 .
Chris Stone , Senior Vice President of Novell from 1997 to 1999 and Vice Chairman of Novell from 2002 to 2004 , testified that when Novell took these actions with respect to IBM , it was concerned about Novell , Linux , and the open source movement , and that SCO 's actions were damaging to that process .
223 Mr. Stone further testified that Novell 's actions were not motivated by something said or done by IBM and were not motivated by IBM 's purchase of $ 50 million of Novell stock .
224 Jack Messman , Novell 's former CEO , similarly testified that Novell 's action to waive SCO 's claims against IBM was unrelated to IBM 's investment in Novell .225 108 .
As will be discussed below , the Court finds that Novell had the right , under Section 4.16 of the APA , to take these actions .
46 III .
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW A. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE 109 .
SCO requests , as an alternative to its other claims for relief , an order directing Novell to transfer the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights .
SCO 's request for specific performance must be rejected for three reasons .
First , the jury verdict has determined that the amended APA did not transfer the copyrights from Novell to SCO .
Second , it was not the intent of the parties to transfer ownership of the copyrights .
Finally , the copyrights are not required for SCO to exercise its right with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
Each of these conclusions will be discussed in detail below .
1 . The Jury Verdict 110 .
As set forth above , this matter came before the jury on the parties ' competing claims for slander of title .
While Novell 's slander of title claim was dismissed on a Rule 50 motion , SCO 's claim proceeded to the jury .
The jury determined that the amended APA did not transfer the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights from Novell to SCO .
Because the jury determined that SCO was not the owner of the copyrights , there was no need for the jury to determine SCO 's claim for slander of title .
111 . " [ T ]he Seventh Amendment prevents district courts from applying equitable doctrines on the basis of factual predicates rejected , explicitly or implicitly , by a jury verdict .
" 226 If 47 " the jury verdict by necessary implication reflects the resolution of a common factual issue . . . the district court may not ignore that determination .
" 227 112 . SCO argues that the jury verdict does not resolve its claim for specific performance .
SCO argues that its claim rests on findings not precluded by the jury verdict .
In support of this argument , SCO posits a number of rather tenuous grounds on which the jury could have determined the question presented to it .
The Court must respectfully disagree with SCO 's assessment .
113 .
As stated previously , the bulk of the evidence at trial concerned two issues : ( 1 ) whether the parties intended to transfer ownership of the copyrights ; and ( 2 ) whether the copyrights were " required " for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
Both parties presented substantial evidence and argument on these two issues .
114 .
The jury verdict in this case shows that the jury considered SCO 's evidence on these points and rejected that evidence in favor of the evidence presented by Novell .
The jury verdict necessarily means that the jury found that it was not the intent of the parties to transfer ownership of the copyrights from Novell to SCO and that the copyrights were not required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
As discussed in the Court 's Memorandum Decision and Order Denying SCO 's Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or , in the Alternative , for a New Trial , the jury 's verdict is well supported by the evidence .
48 115 . SCO 's claim for specific performance rests upon factual predicates rejected by the jury verdict .
SCO 's request for specific performance essentially asks the Court to ignore or overrule the jury verdict .
Such relief is prohibited under the Seventh Amendment .
For this reason , SCO 's claim for specific performance must fail .
Even if the jury verdict did not preclude SCO 's claim for specific performance , it would be rejected for the reasons discussed below .
2 . The Intent of the Parties 116 .
Much of the evidence at trial focused on the intent of the parties in drafting the APA .
While Plaintiff presented a number of witnesses from both Novell and Santa Cruz who testified that it was the intent of the parties to transfer the copyrights , the Court , as evidently did the jury , finds the evidence presented by Novell on this issue to be more persuasive .
The Court finds particularly persuasive the testimony of Novell 's outside counsel Tor Braham , who was the lead drafter of the APA .
117 .
As set forth above , Mr. Braham 's testimony showed that Novell purposefully retained ownership of the copyrights .
Novell did so in order to protect its substantial retained interest in the UNIX business .
Mr. Braham 's testimony is supported by the testimony of James Tolonen who explained that retaining the copyrights was necessary : ( 1 ) because of the nature of the transaction ; ( 2 ) because Santa Cruz could not afford the entire value ; ( 3 ) to avoid ownership issues with other products ; and ( 4 ) because of concerns with the long - term viability of Santa Cruz .
Mr. Braham 's testimony is further supported by Michael Defazio , an Executive Vice President at Novell , who testified that the copyrights were 49 retained as a way to " bulletproof " Novell 's financial asset stream .
SCO 's witnesses on this issue are less credible for the reasons set forth above .
118 . The parties ' dealings concerning Amendment No. 2 further support the conclusion that it was not the intent of the parties to transfer copyright ownership .
As set forth above , Steve Sabbath , Santa Cruz general counsel , contacted Allison Amadia , in - house counsel for Novell , to discuss a " clerical error " resulting in the copyrights not being transferred .
Santa Cruz sought an amendment which would have amended Schedule 1.1 ( b ) to exclude all copyrights and trademarks , except for the copyrights and trademarks owned by Novell which pertain to the UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
Upon further research , Ms. Amadia concluded that no clerical error had occurred and Novell specifically rejected the proposed amendment .
Thus , Amendment No. 2 was written to state that all copyrights and trademarks were excluded , except for the copyrights and trademarks required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
As testified to by both Ms. Amadia and Mr. Tolonen , this amendment addressed use , not ownership .
This interaction shows Novell 's continued intent to retain the copyrights .
119 . SCO argues that the forthright negotiator rule is applicable to Amendment No. 2 . The Tenth Circuit has stated :
Where the parties assign different meanings to a term , it is interpreted in accordance with the meaning attached by one of them if at the time the agreement was made ( a ) that party did not know of any different meaning attached by the other , and the other knew the meaning attached by the first party ; or 50 ( b ) that party had no reason to know of any different meaning attached by the other , and the other had reason to know the meaning attached by the first party .
228 Here , there is no evidence to support the argument that Ms. Amadia had reason to know that SCO attached a different meaning to Amendment No. 2 . Indeed , Ms. Amadia specifically testified that she informed Mr. Sabbath that Novell would not transfer the copyrights .
229 120 .
SCO also argues that other provisions of the APA are consistent with it acquiring ownership of the copyrights .
Specifically , SCO cites to the license back provision of the APA , Section 1.6 .
However , that provision only applies to the assets listed in the included asset schedule , which does not include the UNIX copyrights .
Further , testimony concerning the TLA affirmed that one of the purposes of that agreement was to allow Novell the right to use post - APA SCO - developed code .230 SCO also points to Section II of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) , which transferred " [ a ]ll of [ Novell 's ] claims arising after the Closing Date against any parties relating to any right , property or asset included in the Business .
" 231 However , SCO provided no evidence of any such claims that it was entitled to pursue .
51 121 .
While it may have initially been the wish of individuals in both entities for Novell to sell and Santa Cruz to buy the entire UNIX business , that is not what happened .
Rather , because Santa Cruz could not purchase the entire business , the deal had to be structured in a way different than had been originally envisioned .
As all witnesses seemed to recognize , a primary component of the transaction was Novell 's retention of a significant royalty stream .
One of the ways that Novell chose to protect that royalty stream was to retain ownership of the copyrights .
Based on all of the above , the Court finds that the intent of the parties did not entail transfer of ownership of the copyrights .
3 . Copyrights are not " Required " 122 .
SCO further argues that transfer of ownership is appropriate because the copyrights are " required " under Amendment No. 2 . SCO makes two arguments as to why ownership of the copyrights is required .
First , it argues that ownership of the copyrights are required in order for it to protect its intellectual property .
Second , SCO argues that ownership of the copyrights are necessary for its SCOsource licensing program .
The Court rejects both arguments .
123 .
In order to fully understand both of these issues , the exact nature of the transaction between the parties must be understood .
As set forth above , Novell initially envisioned selling the entire UNIX business that it had purchased from AT&T to Santa Cruz .
However , because Santa Cruz could not afford the entire business , the transaction had to be restructured .
The business was essentially divided into two components : the UNIX business and the UnixWare business .
The UNIX business was the UNIX System V 52 source licensing business .
Novell retained the royalties from the licenses and SCO acted as Novell 's agent in their collection .
Novell retained significant rights in order to protect its royalty stream .
Additionally , Novell retained the copyrights as a way to " bulletproof " those royalties .
The UnixWare business , on the other hand , was the business whereby SCO had the ability to go forward and create a new product .
SCO would , of course , own the copyrights for whatever new code it created .
With this understanding , the Court turns to SCO 's arguments .
124 . SCO argues that the copyrights are required to protect its intellectual property .
The Court agrees with this general proposition .
However , SCO was not the owner of the copyrights and , thus , had no right to enforce them .
Further , the parties agree that SCO would own the copyrights to any newly developed code and could use those copyrights to protect against infringement .
Thus , SCO has not shown that ownership of the UNIX copyrights is required to protect its own intellectual property .
125 . SCO also argues that ownership of the copyrights is necessary to run its SCOsource licensing program .
However , the language of Amendment No. 2 applies to copyrights required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
The SCOsource program is not something SCO ever acquired from Novell .
It appears that SCOsource was not something that was envisioned by either party at the time of the APA and its amendments .
Further , both Mr. Tibbitts and Mr. McBride acknowledged that SCO could run its UnixWare business , which is something SCO did acquire from Novell , without the copyrights .
Therefore , the Court finds that the 53 copyrights are not required for SCO to operate the business that it had acquired from Novell .
126 .
Based on the above , the Court finds that it was not the intent of the parties to transfer the copyrights and that the copyrights are not required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
Further , the jury verdict precludes the Court from entering judgment in favor of SCO on its claim for specific performance .
For all of the reasons stated , SCO 's claim for specific performance must fail .
B. DECLARATORY JUDGMENT 127 .
Novell seeks declaratory relief that : ( a ) under Section 4.16 ( b ) of the APA , Novell is entitled to direct SCO to waive claims against IBM , Sequent and other SVRX licensees ; ( b) Novell is entitled to waive such claims on SCO 's behalf ; and ( c ) SCO is obligated to recognize such a waiver .
232 128 . Section 4.16 ( b ) of the APA states , in pertinent part : Buyer shall not , and shall not have the authority to , amend , modify or waive any right under any SVRX License without the prior written consent of Seller .
In addition , at Seller 's sole discretion and direction , Buyer shall amend , supplement , modify or waive any rights under , or shall assign any rights to , any SVRX License to the extent so directed in any manner or respect by Seller .
In the event that Buyer shall fail to take any such action concerning the SVRX Licenses as required herein , Seller shall be authorized , and hereby is granted , the rights to take any action on Buyer 's own behalf .233 54 129 .
" The scope of Novell 's waiver rights turns on the meaning of the term ' SVRX License . '" 234 In order to understand the meaning of Section 4.16 ( b ) and the term SVRX License , it is again necessary to understand the nature of the transaction between the parties .
130 .
As stated previously , Novell sold Santa Cruz the UnixWare business , while retaining substantial rights in the UNIX business .
While Novell retained the financial portion of the UNIX business ( the royalties from SVRX licenses ) , SCO acted as Novell 's agent in the collection of those royalties .
235 131 .
Witnesses from both SCO and Novell recognized Novell 's ongoing financial interests and the importance of that interest .
Section 4.16 ( b ) was the key provision of the APA designed to protect Novell 's financial interest .
As Mr. Braham testified , Section 4.16 was drafted to avoid any doubt that Novell had the right to control what happened with the UNIX business and that if SCO did not do what it was supposed to as Novell 's agent , Novell could step in and take what action it deemed necessary .
236 132 .
The Court concludes that Novell 's waiver rights are not limited to product supplement agreements , as argued by SCO .
The Court reaches this conclusion based on a number of things .
First , the financial interest Novell had in the SVRX royalty stream necessitates such a finding .
As stated above , Novell retained a significant financial interest and Mr. 55 Braham , as well as others , testified that Section 4.16 of the APA was designed to protect that interest .
The somewhat hierarchical structure of the three types of agreements leads to the conclusion that Novell must retain rights over the software and sublicensing agreements as well .
As was explained by Mr. Broderick , each company was required to obtain a software agreement .
If Novell did not have the authority over the software agreements , SCO could easily cancel that agreement , necessarily cancelling both the sublicensing and product supplement agreements , and thereby deprive Novell of revenue .
133 .
Another consideration in support of the Court 's conclusion is the contract language itself .
The contract is not limited to product supplement agreements .
The contract language refers to " SVRX Licenses " and does not differentiate between the three types of agreements .
Further , other language in the APA , specifically Section 1.2(e ) and Item VI of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) , support a broad reading of the language .
134 .
Finally , the Court considers SCO 's evidence on this point to be less credible than that of Novell .
For all of these reasons , the Court finds that Novell 's waiver rights extend to software agreements , sublicensing agreements , and product supplement agreements .
135 .
With this conclusion in mind , the Court turns to Novell 's actions with regard to its waiver rights .
On June 9 , 2003 , Novell directed SCO to waive any right SCO may claim to terminate IBM's SVRX Licenses or to revoke any rights thereunder .
When SCO failed to act , Novell waived those rights on SCO 's behalf .
On October 7 , 2003 , Novell directed SCO to waive any right SCO may claim to require IBM to treat IBM code as subject to the confidentiality obligations or use restrictions of IBM's SVRX Licenses .
When SCO 56 failed to act , Novell waived that right on SCO 's behalf .
Novell took similar actions in relation to SGI and Sequent .
136 . The Court finds that Novell had the authority under Section 4.16 ( b ) of the APA to direct SCO to waive its claims against these SVRX licensees , that Novell had the authority to waive such claims on SCO 's behalf , and that SCO was obligated to recognize such waivers .
C. IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING 137 .
SCO argues that Novell 's actions in directing SCO to waive certain claims against IBM , SGI , and Sequent breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing .
138 . The APA is governed by California law .237 Under California law , " [ e] very contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement .
" 238 " The covenant of good faith finds particular application in situations where one party is invested with a discretionary power affecting the rights of another .
Such power must be exercised in good faith .
" 239 That said , " [ i] t is universally recognized the scope of conduct prohibited by the covenant of good faith is circumscribed by the purposes and express terms of the contract .
" 240 The Court is " aware of no reported case in which a court has held the covenant of good faith may be read to prohibit a party from 57 doing that which is expressly permitted by an agreement .
On the contrary , as a general matter , implied terms should never be read to vary express terms .
" 241 139 .
In this matter , the Tenth Circuit has cautioned " that it is not always the case that an express grant of contractual authority is not constrained by the operation of the covenant of good faith .
" 242 " California recognizes at least two exceptional situations where the covenant of good faith may inform the interpretation of even an express grant of contractual authority .
First , where the express discretion makes the contract , viewed as a whole , ' contradictory and ambiguous , ' the implied covenant may be applied to aid in construction . " 243 " Second , the covenant may aid in the interpretation of a contract seemingly expressly granting unbridled discretion ' in those relatively rare instances when reading the provision literally would , contrary to the parties ' clear intention , result in an unenforceable , illusory agreement .
'" 244 140 .
Considering Novell 's actions , the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing , and the exceptional situations discussed by the Tenth Circuit , the Court finds that SCO 's breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim must fail .
58 141 . The Court finds , as an initial matter , that the actions Novell took with respect to IBM , = SGI , and Sequent were pursuant to an express contractual provision granting it the authority to do so for the reasons discussed above .
Thus , generally speaking , Novell 's conduct would not be a breach of the implied covenant .
142 . Considering the exceptional circumstances discussed by the Tenth Circuit on appeal , the Court finds that neither are present here .
143 .
The first exceptional circumstance applies where the express discretion makes the contract , viewed as a whole , " contradictory and ambiguous , " the implied covenant may be applied to aid in construction .
245 Under the contract at issue in April Enterprises , one party had the right to syndicate episodes of a television show , while the other had the right to erase episodes of the show .
Both parties shared revenues from compensation .
Although the contract expressly granted one party the right to erase episodes , the court applied the covenant of good faith , holding that the contract was contradictory and ambiguous as to whether tapes could be erased while the other party was negotiating for syndication .
144 . SCO argues that Novell 's interpretation of Section 4.16 ( b ) creates the same contradiction and ambiguity because , if Novell could change any part of the contracts that embody the UNIX - based business that Novell transferred , it could destroy that business .
This argument , however , hinges on a faulty premise : that Novell transferred the UNIX business to SCO .
As set forth above , Novell transferred the UnixWare business to SCO , 59 while retaining substantial rights in the UNIX business .
SCO 's involvement with the UNIX business was as Novell 's agent and those portions of the UNIX business that did transfe
Martin Williamson and Laurence Edmondson look at ten instances where team - mates have proved anything but supportive
One of the most infamous collisions in F1 history between team - mates who were anything but .
Prost led the drivers ' championship by 16 points going into the penultimate race but the pair were hardly talking .
After taking an early lead , Prost had been caught by Senna , and at the chicane on lap 46 , the Brazilian went to overtake , Prost blocked him and the pair crashed .
" I know everybody thinks I did it on purpose , " Prost said .
" What I say is that I did not open the door , and that 's it … he tried to pass and for me the way he did it was impossible , because he was going so much quicker than usual into the braking area .
As we came up to the chicane , he was so far back .
When you look in your mirrors , and a guy is 20 metres behind you , it 's impossible to judge , and I did n't even realise he was trying to overtake me .
But at the same time I thought , ' There 's no way I 'm going to leave him even a one - metre gap .
No way ' .
I came off the throttle braked - and turned in . "
As Prost climbed out of his crocked McLaren , Senna managed to re-start his car as marshals pushed it , and went on to win the race , only to be disqualified for missing out the chicane ... and Prost was world champion .
Who was to blame ?
Much depends on whether you are a Prost or Senna fan , but the pair did exactly the same thing on the same track 12 months later .
Mark Webber and Nico Rosberg , Brazil 2006
Although the accident was relatively straight - forward , Nico Rosberg misjudged his braking into a crowded turn four and tagged Williams team - mate Mark Webber , the race back to the pits that ensued was , in a word , crazy .
Webber had a cracked diffuser and lacked rear - end stability while Rosberg had a damaged front wing , inducing copious amounts of understeer .
The team realised this and , because a front wing is easily replaced and a diffuser is n't , Webber was told to cede position .
But having been rear - ended by his younger team - mate , Webber was not willing to play game .
Instead he forced the little upstart off the racing line , onto the dirty part of the track and , with Rosberg 's front wing providing next to no downforce , into a massive accident .
As he did so the team came over the radio , reiterating the orders for Rosberg to pit first .
Webber replied : " Do n't think so mate .
Britney 's in the wall . "
James Hunt and Jochen Mass , McLaren , Canada 1977
Leading from Mario Andretti on the 62nd lap ,
Hunt went to lap team - mate Mass , who was in a distant third , and the pair collided - both spun off , and while Mass continued to take fourth , Hunt was out of the race .
There was no doubting who he blamed as he stood on the side of the track , angrily waving his fist as Mass as he passed for several laps .
When a steward tried to usher Hunt away he was hit .
Hunt was fined $ 750 for walking on the track and $ 2000 for thumping the official .

Juan Pablo Montoya and Kimi Raikkonen , USA 2006
When Juan Pablo Montoya went to McLaren there was genuine excitement that he might fulfil his potential in F1 .
However , it soon became clear that he was no better suited to Ron Dennis 's team than he had been at Williams .
The final straw came on the first lap at Indianapolis , when the brickyard fans were treated to their usual dose of first - lap carnage .
It started with Montoya rather innocuously tagging Kimi Raikkonen 's left - rear wheel but resulted in a chain reaction that saw Nick Heidfeld 's BMW Sauber barrel - roll into a gravel trap .
But the biggest casualty of all was Montoya 's career , which , after an alleged bust - up with Dennis , was over at McLaren and over in F1 .
Wolfgang von Trips and Tony Brooks , Ferrari , 1959
The final race of the season was a title decider between Jack Brabham , Stirling Moss and Brooks .
There was bitter controversy at the start when Brooks was inexplicably replaced on the front of the grid by local driver Harry Schell who had posted a faster lap unseen by anyone .
It proved crucial as on the first corner he collided with Ferrari team - mate von Trips and was forced to pit to inspect the damage .
The two - minute stop ended his title hopes , and although he finished third , Brabham , who pushed his car for the last quarter of a mile to take fourth , did enough to take the drivers ' crown .
Giancarlo Fisichella and Ralf Schumacher , Argentina 1997
It would n't be a list of team - mate bust - ups without Ralf Schumacher making appearance .
The one we 've picked , among a wide selection , was from his early F1 career when , perhaps , inexperience could be used as an excuse .
However , Eddie Jordan would not have seen it that way ; his cars were on for third and fourth position and seven valuable points at just the third round of the season .
But Ralf , not happy to settle for position behind the lead Jordan of Giancarlo Fisichella , barged his way past and knocked his team - mate out of the race .
Schumacher went on to finish third , but needless to say , was not joined wholeheartedly by his team in the post - race celebrations .
Christian Fittipaldi and Pierluigi Martini , Monza , 1993
One of the most bizarre F1 endings came at the Italian Grand Prix when Pierluigi Martini approached the finishing line ahead of Minardi team - mate Christian Fittipaldi .
Fittipaldi simply got too close to Martini , his front clipped the back wheel of Martini , and his car did a complete mid-air somersault , slammed into the tarmac and crossed the line shedding body parts and sparks as it went .
Martini finished in a more traditional manner while Fittipaldi was fortunate to walk away without serious injury .

Derek Daly and Jean - Pierre Jarier , Monaco 1980
From an unusual finish to a not - so - unusual start .
In the tight confines of the Monaco circuit , Derek Daly 's too - late braking on one of the first corners caused him to smash into Bruno Giacomelli's Alfa Romeo , launching daly 's car into the air where it landed on teammate Jean - Pierre Jarier and wiped out Alain Prost 's McLaren .
" The only people left smiling were the Tyrrell team 's sponsors as the pictures were repeatedly shown around the world , " laconically noted one commentator .

Alex Caffi and Andrea de Cessaris , US Grand Prix 1989
It 's one thing taking your team - mate out while racing for position , it 's quite another to do it while being one lap down .
As a result , the BMS Scuderia Italia team had every reason to be livid at Andrea de Cessaris when he got in the way of Alex Caffi who was on the way to a podium in Pheonix .
The incident left Caffi out of the race while de Cessaris plodded round to finish 5 laps down .
He did make up for it , however , by taking a podium at the next race in Montreal .
Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard , Austria 1999
Over their six - year period as McLaren team - mates , it 's hardly surprising that Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard came together .
The first incident was at Estoril in 1996 but the team only lost out on a couple of points at most .
The slightly more serious crash was at the A1 Ring in 1999 , when the pair led the race on the second lap only for Coulthard to inexplicably clip the rear of Hakkinen 's car and tip him into a spin .
Hakkinen staged a fight back to third while Coulthard lost the lead to Ferrari's Eddie Irvine to finish just one place higher in second .
So , Rush Limbaugh just got married .
Congrats , Rush – we wish you well .
We wanted to note this momentous occasion because , as you know , Rush is a big proponent of family values , and few things say family like walking down the aisle and publicly expressing your lifelong commitment to the person of the opposite gender that you love .
Especially when you ’re so committed to traditional values that you do it four times .
Wow .
Sir Elton John , whose raging queerness makes him incapable of family values , was allegedly paid $ 1 M to play the reception .
S&R was n’t invited to attend , but we have managed to lay our hands on his set list .
In addition to playing several of his biggest hits , Elton also cranked out a few covers of other artists ’ hits , including :

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer refused to flinch after Obama administration officials confirmed Friday that they plan to file a lawsuit challenging the state 's anti-illegal immigration law .
In a statement issued late Friday , Brewer called Obama 's decision " outrageous " but " not surprising . "
" Our federal government should be using its legal resources to fight illegal immigration , not the law - abiding citizens of Arizona , " she said .
Meanwhile , Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard said his office plans to withdraw as the state 's lawyers in legal challenges to the law , leaving Brewer 's attorneys to defend it .
Brewer had complained that Goddard 's criticism of the measure raised doubts about his ability to defend it .
Brewer said with Goddard out , " I will ensure the immigration laws we passed are vigorously defended all the way to the United States Supreme Court if necessary , where this reasonable law will ultimately be found constitutional . "
The law takes effect July 29 and requires officers to question a person 's immigration status if there 's a reasonable suspicion that he or she is in the country illegally .
At least five legal challenges have been filed to the law since April .
The lawsuits generally allege that Arizona 's law will lead to racial profiling and argue that it's the federal government 's responsibility to regulate immigration .
On Friday evening , Brewer 's defense team asked a federal judge to throw out the suit by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups that challenge the law 's constitutionality .
Obama officials confirmed plans to file their lawsuit after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in an interview with a TV station in Ecuador earlier this month that the administration would challenge the law in court , though officials had long said the issue was under review .
Administration officials initially would not confirm Clinton 's statement .
But an official told Fox News on Friday that while the review is still underway , the decision has already been made that a Department of Justice suit will be filed .
The administration at this point is just building its case .
Another official said there are still " substantial " issues to address and work out before the Justice Department knows that it has a strong enough case to file a lawsuit .
The official said the department intends to file suit , but that any court action is contingent on the final review .
Clinton 's announcement was met with outrage Thursday by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer , who signed the law .
Brewer told Fox News she 's ready for a fight .
" What a disappointment , " Brewer told Fox News ' Greta Van Susteren on Thursday , saying she was shocked the administration would make such an announcement on foreign TV without giving Arizona officials the news first .
" We are not going to back away from this issue , " Brewer said .
" We are going to pursue it , we 're going to be very aggressive , " Brewer said .
" We 'll meet them in court ...
And we will win . "
She added : " The population of America agrees with Arizona . "
California voters , by a modest margin , think they should be allowed to grow and consume marijuana , according to a new poll that also found more than 1 in 3 voters had tried pot and more than 1 in 10 had lit up in the past year .
The Los Angeles Times / USC poll found that voters back the marijuana legalization measure on the November ballot , 49 % to 41 % , with 10 % uncertain about it .
But support for the initiative is unstable , with one - third of the supporters saying they favor it only “ somewhat . ”
“ The good news for proponents is that they are starting off with a decent lead .
The good news for the opposition is that initiatives that start off at less than 50 % in the polls usually have a hard time , ” said Dan Schnur , director of USC ’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics .
The poll also points to a demographic group that is likely to play a key role -- women , particularly those who are married .
Men favor legalization , but women are split .
Among married women , 49 % reject the measure while 40 % are in favor of the initiative .
Denise Silva , a 55 - year - old court clerk from Pleasanton , in Alameda County , said she is struggling with the issue .
“ I sway from day to day , ” she said .
A mother of two grown children , she opposes drug use for moral reasons but knows people who have smoked for four decades with no apparent harm .
“ It ’s still going to continue to be sold , so since it is , might ’s well let the government get their piece of the pie , ” she said .
Both sides are likely to target mothers , Schnur said .
The measure ’s backers , for example , could argue that legalization would bring more tax money for schools , while opponents could insist that it would put children at risk .
The poll found voters closely divided on those arguments .
The measure ’s supporters say marijuana taxes could raise more than a billion dollars in revenue ; opponents dispute that .
Among voters , 42 % believe that estimate and 38 % think it is wildly exaggerated .
The November initiative authorizes cities and counties , but not the state , to legalize and tax sales .
In Los Angeles County , the epicenter of the Green Rush with more than 600 medical marijuana dispensaries , voters are most inclined to see pot taxes as a way to plug holes in local and state budgets .
Voters were also split over whether legalized marijuana would worsen social problems , such as increasing crime and triggering higher marijuana use among teenagers .
Those concerns appear to have much more potency with voters than the debate over tax revenues .
Among those who oppose the initiative , 83 % think it would add to the state ’s social woes ; 55 % of married women also believe that .
Raul Martinez , a Democrat from Woodland , outside of Sacramento , said he smoked pot as a teenager .
He believes the measure would end up being expensive for local governments .
“ It ’s going to turn around and cost them more money because more crime is going to come from it , ” the 47 - year - old father said .
The survey of 1,506 registered voters was conducted between May 19 and 26 for The Times and the University of Southern California College of Letters , Arts and Sciences by the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner and the Republican firm American Viewpoint .
The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 2.6 percentage points for the overall sample and slightly larger for smaller breakdowns .
Attitudes toward legalization diverge sharply by age , with support much higher among younger voters .
A 52 % majority of voters 65 and older oppose legalization .
Among voters between 45 and 64 , 49 % support it .
But among those 30 to 44 , 53 % are in favor , and that rises to 61 % among those 18 to 29 .
Chris Donnelly , a 25 - year - old substitute teacher from San Diego , has never touched pot but strongly favors the initiative and believes it could support schools .
“ It would n’t bother me one bit if marijuana were legal , ” the unaffiliated voter said .
“ I do n’t think it ’s any more harmful than alcohol . ”
The poll also offers an unusually detailed look at who is using marijuana in California .
Among those surveyed , 37 % of voters said they had tried pot -- a figure roughly consistent with federal surveys of drug use -- and that group strongly supports the initiative .
The 11 % who had used marijuana in the last year favored legalization by a landslide , 82 % .
By contrast , the 57 % of voters who said they have never used marijuana oppose the initiative .
Though certain types of voters are more likely to light up , marijuana use cuts across all demographic slices , reaching beyond the cliches of skateboarders and aging hippies .
A matchup in the governor ’s race between Democrat Jerry Brown , who governed the state in the 1970s , and Republican Meg Whitman , the former EBay executive , clearly illustrates this .
Voters who have tried marijuana make up 45 % of Brown ’s supporters , and 37 % of Whitman’s .
But both candidates oppose legalization .
Among Democrats and voters who decline to state a party affiliation , 12 % had used marijuana in the last year , as had 7 % of Republicans .
About a quarter of the voters in each slice of the state ’s electorate said they experimented with the drug in the past , but not in the last year .
One of the biggest differences is between men and women .
Among male voters , 45 % said they had used marijuana , 14 % in the past year .
Among female voters , 29 % said they had tried it , but just 8 % in the past year .
The heaviest use of marijuana skipped a generation .
The youngest voters , between 18 and 29 , reported the highest percentage of marijuana use in the past year , followed by voters between 45 and 64 , who could be their parents or even grandparents .
Most of those voters came of age in the marijuana - hazed Vietnam War era .
The chance that a California voter has used marijuana is higher for college graduates than high school graduates and rises with income .
Use is highest among single voters and lowest among married ones .
Voters north of the Bay Area , home to the weed - raising Emerald Triangle , are most likely to have used marijuana , while voters in the Central Valley are least likely .

The field of cyber security is one that is growing rapidly .
If you would like to get involved , then it is useful to experiment in real world circumstances , and this means that you will want to get some experience in doing cyber security work , hacking and cracking .
There is no substitute for actually working with the tools that are out there .
That could mean hacking and cracking ‘ white hat ’ style , doing the hacking challenges that are out there – sites that are set up with the express idea of someone breaking in to them .
Or it could mean getting out there and working on your own websites , or your own apps , and making a sandbox that you can use to do your own thing .
There are lots of pre-made virtual machines on OSBoxes.org that you can download so that you can play with your favorite environments and make applications experiment with servers and do pentesting in a safe and legal way .
If you want to do wireless hacking or wardriving , then you will need a laptop that supports it , and to understand how to use linux , since a lot of the tools are made for linux rather than for windows .
Laptop hacking can be a lot of fun , but you need to take care , and make sure that you stay on the right side of the law .
If you ‘ hack your friend ’s wifi ’ when they know you are trying , that ’s one thing .
If you hack the wifi in the office , and end up packet sniffing something sensitive that your boss does n’t want people to see , then that could land you in hot water .
Not all laptops are ideal for hacking .
You will need one with a wifi card or chipset that supports promiscuous mode wireless connections , and that will work with the tools you are aiming to use .
It helps to have a decent amount of memory and perhaps even two wifi cards depending on what you are trying to do .
A proper laptop could well be a better choice than a netbook .
If your goal is to try and crack MD5 encrypted passwords , then a large hard drive for a dictionary attack and a fast processor to work through the attack will also be useful .
Remember that it requires patience and some knowledge to do a good job , and you will need to always be learning to keep up with the latest skills .
Well - oiled : City firm lost £ 6 m after drunk broker bought 7MILLION barrels of crude
The trading floor at PVM : Steve Perkins lost the company £ 6million
A rogue trader who blew £ 345 million on seven million barrels of oil while drunkenly using his home computer has been fined £ 72,000 .
Steve Perkins sat up all night drinking at his redbrick semi , and clicked ' buy ' on the trade while in an ' alcohol - induced blackout ' .
The 34 - year - old broker from Essex sent global oil prices rocketing and caused chaos in the markets after a boozy golf weekend .
When he awoke with a hangover , he tried to pretend nothing had happened , sending his boss a text message asking for the day off because a relative was ' unwell ' .
Yesterday he was banned from the City and ordered to pay the £ 72,000 fine in monthly instalments over three years by the Financial ServicesAuthority watchdog .
Until recently , Mr Perkins lived in a £ 340,000 two - bedroom house in Brentwood .
But last night a woman there refused to comment as she wheeled a pushchair , saying : ' He has gone away . '
A neighbour claimed Mr Perkins had gone to work in Switzerland .
The astonishing episode happened a year ago , when City bankers were at the peak of their unpopularity for reckless and greedy behaviour that was blamed for the economic crisis .
Mr Perkins , who worked for City brokers PVM Oil , had gone on a golfing weekend organised by the firm .
He then took the Monday off work and continued to binge drink from midday onwards .
By the evening , Mr Perkins had made his first batch of unauthorised trades .
But it was in the early hours of the next day - June 30 last year - that the serious damage was done .
Echoes of 1995 : Steve Perkins ' drunken trades are reminiscent of Nick Leeson 's spectacular unauthorised actions that killed off Barings Bank
Mr Perkins has no real recollection , but in his alcoholic haze he went on a spending spree on his computer , which was remotely logged in to his company 's markets trading system in the City .
In his stupor , he casually notched up thousands of trades worth a total of $ 520 million ( £ 345 million ) .
He drunkenly bought a net 7.13 million barrels of oil during the typically quiet overnight period , and at times was actually responsible for 69 per cent of the overall volume of Brent crude being traded globally .
His actions sent prices surging by more than $ 1.50 to $ 73.50 ( £ 48.75 ) for a barrel of Brent crude oil - the highest it had been for eight months .
The deals ended up costing his company £ 6 million and potentially cost companies worldwide more than £ 100 million .
Yesterday the FSA banned him from working in the City for a minimum of five years and said he was ' not a fit and proper person ' to work in the industry due to his alcoholism .
The FSA said : ' As a direct result of Perkins ' trading , the price of Brent increased significantly .
' Perkins ' trading manipulated the market in Brent by giving a false and misleading impression as to the supply , demand and price of Brent - and caused the price of Brent to increase to an abnormal and artificial level .
It6 said the broker had made matters worse the following day by lying to his bosses .
He finally admitted what he had done later , when his trading access was suspended and the company sold off the rest of the oil , raking back all but £ 6 million .
The FSA said : ' Perkins ' trading seems to have been a consequence of extremely heavy drinking resulting from alcoholism , which he now acknowledges . '
It added Mr Perkins - who was sacked - has since joined an alcoholics ' rehabilitation programme .
The FSA made no criticism of PVM in its report but said Mr Perkins ' poses an extreme risk to the market when drunk ' .
The City regulator said the £ 72,000 fine would have been £ 150,000 but for the ' financial hardship ' this would cause him .
A spokesman for his solicitor declined to comment , while a PVM spokesman said only : ' We note this morning 's statement ... and that this matter is now fully closed . '
The unauthorised deal echoes that of Singapore - based trader Nick Leeson , who in 1995 brought down the British Barings Bank after running up losses of £ 862 million trading in derivatives .
A former high - ranking United States defence official says Australian troops could be in Afghanistan for the next 30 years .
Australia 's strategy in the country has been thrust back into the spotlight this week with the deaths of two Australian Army engineers in Uruzgan province .
Defence Minister John Faulkner says Australian troops are likely to be in Afghanistan for the next three to five years as part of the US - led effort against a resurgent Taliban .
But former US strategic analyst Daniel Ellsberg has warned that the war is not even half - way through .
Mr Ellsberg exposed how four successive US adminstrations lied to the public about the Vietnam War when he leaked the top- secret ' Pentagon Papers ' to the New York Times in 1971 .
" For Australian troops I think that three to five years is not just a conservative estimate , it 's totally foolish , " he told Radio National this morning .
" The war will no more be over in three to five years than it is right now .
" If Australians are committed to supporting this strategy they can figure on 10 , 20 and 30 years . "
Mr Ellsberg says the recent deployment of 30,000 US troops is unlikely to be the last such deployment .
" [ President Barack Obama ] has claimed that he proposes to remove troops in 18 to 22 months , but I think the impression that the troops deployed there represent a glass ceiling is totally false , just like it was during the Vietnam War , " he said .
There was more bloodshed in Afghanistan overnight , with at least 39 people reported dead in a suicide bomb attack on a wedding near Kandahar , and four US soldiers killed when their helicopter was shot down by insurgents in the south of the country .
Liberals say that they love the poor , needy , and disadvantaged .
Unfortunately , however , the economic philosophy that liberals favor constitutes a direct assault on the economic well - being of the poor , along with nearly everyone else in society .
Liberals claim to combat poverty in two principal ways .
First , they use the force of government ( e.g. , income taxes ) to take money from those who have earned it in order to give it to the poor .
Second , they restrict people ’s use of their property to enable the poor to have access to such property .
What liberals fail to understand , however , is that the very means they choose to combat poverty — socialism and interventionism — actually exacerbate the problem that they claim to address .
Their war on poverty hurts the very people they say they are trying to assist .
In proposing welfare - state programs , by necessity liberals always make an important assumption .
They assume that there is wealth in society .
After all , if there is no wealth then what good would welfare - state policies do ?
The welfare state operates on the assumption that there are people who are earning wealth or have accumulated wealth .
Those are the people from whom the government takes money in order to redistribute it to the poor .
Let ’s consider a hypothetical case based on science fiction .
Astronomers discover that an inhabitable planet is hurtling toward our solar system and will soon join the other planets in orbit around the sun .
Faced with overcrowding of its prisons , the federal government decides to exile 50,000 prisoners on a spaceship to the planet .
Everyone is given six months of supplies on which to survive — food , water , and clothing — and nothing else .
When the prisoners arrive on the planet , they call into existence a federal government , democratically elected .
Federal officials are empowered to do everything and anything they can to combat the extreme poverty that is immediately facing society .
Liberals are elected to the presidency and to Congress .
They propose a massive welfare - state program modeled on Franklin Roosevelt ’s New Deal and Lyndon Johnson ’s Great Society .
Social Security .
Medicare and Medicaid .
Public housing .
Food stamps .
Grants to education .
Agricultural subsidies .
Unemployment relief .
Do you see the problem ?
The federal government is n’t a fountain of wealth .
It has no money .
Its coffers are empty .
In order to get the money to distribute all these welfare benefits to people , it must first impose a tax on people .
But do you see the next problem ?
There are no wealthy or even middle - class people who can be taxed because everyone in this society is poor .
In proposing their array of welfare programs to help the poor , liberals operate under the mindless assumption that wealth exists naturally in a society .
Even worse , they give nary a thought to the possibility that a society in which wealth is growing is the greatest benefit to the poor .
Worst of all , they do n’t consider the distinct possibility that their own tax - and - redistribute policies tend toward destroying the base of wealth in society , thereby relegating everyone to poverty .
Let ’s return to our hypothetical example regarding the prisoners on the new planet .
Everyone is poor .
Welfare - state policies to combat the poverty will obviously not work because there are no wealthy people to take money from in order to redistribute it to the poor .
So what can be done to combat poverty ?
Ownership , collective and private
The liberals come up with a novel solution .
They adopt a system by which the government owns everything and by which everyone works for the government .
People will be assigned houses to build , businesses to run , or places in fields to grow crops .
Government officials will be in charge of planning everything — which crops will be planted , which occupations people will be assigned to , which houses will be built , which consumer goods will be produced .
Central planners will distribute food , housing , clothing , and other essentials in accordance with the needs of each person and each family .
Everyone seems happy with the scheme , especially since it mirrors much of the prison life to which the prisoners had been accustomed .
But a problem arises , one involving human nature .
No one feels like working very hard .
Agricultural workers are constantly getting sick .
People are doing jobs for which they are ill - suited .
Goods and services are scarce , and the situation is getting worse for everyone .
Actually , this hypothetical society is n’t far from reality .
It is pretty much what happened when the first colonists arrived at Plymouth Rock .
They formed a society in which most property would be collectively owned and shared .
The result ?
Starvation and famine .
One day , Governor Bradford changed the system .
From that day forward , everyone would be entitled to own his own property and keep the fruits of his labor for himself and his family .
No longer would people be forced to share their earnings with others .
Immediately , everyone began working harder and accumulating wealth .
No more starvation and famine .
The bounty produced by this private - property system formed the foundation for the first Thanksgiving .
What would be the solution to poverty in our hypothetical example ?
It would a libertarian one , a solution based on private property and free markets .
Everyone would be free to go into any business he chose .
In that way , people could pursue their own interests and talents in an attempt to provide goods or services that other people would be interested in purchasing .
People would be free to engage in any economic trade with anyone else , without interference or regulation by the government .
People would also be free to accumulate the fruits of their earnings .
There would be no income tax imposed on the people .
Obviously , at first there would still be manifest poverty , given the difficulties in accumulating wealth .
People struggling to survive have a difficult time saving any money .
But by the time of the second generation , things will have improved a bit , with families actually accumulating savings that they would then be free to pass down to the third generation .
Within a few decades , such a system of free enterprise would not only generate millionaires but also raise the standard of living for those at the bottom of the economic ladder .
Equally important , the poor would know that they had a chance to join the ranks of the middle class and wealthy simply by working hard and providing a product or service that other people were willing to pay for .
This , too , is not as hypothetical as it sounds , as it pretty much describes the situation in the United States after the adoption of the Constitution in 1787 and continuing through the early 1900s .
For the first time in history , people were able to engage in enterprise freely ( that is , without government regulation or control ) and accumulate unlimited amounts of wealth ( that is , without their incomes ’ being taxed ) .
That ’s not to say , however , that the process of wealth creation was an immediate one .
For the first few decades , life was very difficult , as it would be in any society in which there exists only a small base of wealth .
Liberals often point to the Industrial Revolution as an example of the horrors of the free - market system .
Factory conditions , for example , were horrific for those working there , including wives and children , as liberals are so fond in reminding us .
But liberals miss an important point .
Those factories , as bad as they were , offered a chance for survival to those who were working in them .
A society in which there is no foundation of wealth and no chance of accumulating wealth will inevitably have people starving to death .
A society in which there is limited wealth but in which people are free to engage in enterprise and accumulate wealth will inevitably have people struggling to survive but at least having a chance to survive .
That ’s what was occurring during the Industrial Revolution .
American husbands and fathers were sending their wives and children into factories not because they hated them but because they knew that that was the only chance they had to keep them alive .
Then , as families began accumulating wealth , the need to send the entire family into the factories became less desperate .
It was not government but rather capital — the accumulation of savings — that ultimately brought wives and children out of the factories .
The key , then , to a rising standard of living in a society lies in savings and capital .
Let ’s examine how this is so .
The role of capital
Let ’s assume that a farmer owns a 100 - acre tract of land on which he grows various crops .
He employs one worker , whose sole piece of equipment is a hoe .
The farmer pays the worker $ 10,000 per year and has additional expenses of $ 5,000 .
At the end of the year , the farmer sells his crops at market for $ 20,000 , earning him a profit of $ 5,000 .
Since the farmer has earned a profit of $ 5,000 , he can use part of that money to give his worker a raise .
But let ’s assume that a $ 5,000 profit is the minimum amount of profit that the farmer has concluded he needs to remain in business .
Since farming is a risky business , one in which a crop could sell for much less than anticipated , the farmer just does n’t feel it ’s worth his while to engage in farming if he can’t earn at least $ 5,000 for himself and his family .
Assuming that things stay the same from year to year , that means that the worker ’s income simply cannot go up .
It must remain the same , given that the farmer lacks the financial means by which to pay the worker more money .
But what if the farmer can somehow increase production ?
Suppose he can double the output on his 100 - acre tract of land ?
If he ’s able to do that , he ’s then able to give his worker a pay raise .
So how does the farmer pull that off ?
That ’s where capital comes into play .
Each year , the farmer puts away $ 500 of his profit .
After a few years , he uses his savings to purchase a used tractor .
Now , the worker is no longer using a hoe .
He ’s got a tractor to plant , cultivate , and harvest the crops .
Let ’s say that production doubles , which increases the farmer ’s profit to $ 10,000 .
That means that the farmer now has more money at his disposal to increase the pay of the worker .
Does the worker need to rely on the beneficence of his employer to guarantee the pay raise ?
No , because the worker knows that there are surrounding farms that are also employing workers .
All that he has to do is check around and see what competing farms are offering and ask his employer to match it .
If the farmer fails to do so , the employee can accept a competing offer , leaving his employer with no one to work on his farm .
Thus , the people who are among the primary beneficiaries of capital accumulation are the poor — those who are wage - earners at the bottom of the economic ladder .
They have as much interest in the success of the company they ’re working for as the owner has .
The more the company invests its profits in productive capital , the more profits the company stands to earn , enabling more money to be devoted to pay raises .
Moreover , the more other companies are doing the same , the more they are able to bid up the real wage rates of the wage - earning class .
Return to poverty
Now , let ’s return to our science - fiction example where the prisoners are living on that new planet .
Let ’s propel them forward by 100 years .
By that time , people have accumulated massive amounts of wealth and everyone has a very high standard of living .
There are , of course , those who are much wealthier than others but by the same token , those who are the poorest have a nice living standard .
Everyone understands that the high standard of living depends , in fact , on the savings and capital accumulation engaged in by the very wealthy and by everyone else .
Reenter the liberals .
Seeing all this wealth , they exclaim ,  Notwithstanding God ’s injunction against coveting , it ’s simply not fair that some have more when others have less .
We wish to declare war on poverty .
Let us rid ourselves of this libertarian free - market scourge and establish a socialistic welfare state , one in which the federal government will take from those at the top of the economic ladder and redistribute it to those at the bottom of the economic ladder . 
People succumb to the liberals ’ siren song .
At first , everything works fine .
Old people are getting free retirement payments and health care .
Poor people are getting free housing , food , and clothing .
Producers are getting free subsidies .
Children are getting free education .
People fail to notice , however , a disquieting phenomenon .
The ranks of the wealthy slowly start dropping because those who are barely on the margin of the wealthy and middle class drop back into the lower category , owing to the new income taxes imposed on them to fund all the free programs .
As the process grows , the tax base shrinks , causing federal officials to extend their income tax to the middle class .
That causes people on the margin between the poor and middle class to begin dropping back into the lower category .
Gradually , taxes continue to expand and rise to keep the socialistic system going , bringing about an ominous development — a gradual reduction in savings and capital accumulation , the keys to a rising standard of living .
In fact , our hypothetical case is not so hypothetical .
It describes the economic history of the United States for most of the 20th century .
After 19th - century Americans had brought into existence an unprecedented accumulation of capital and , consequently , the highest standard of living in history , 20th - century liberals saw a golden opportunity , one that would enable them to tax the wealthy , and later the middle class , to help out the poor .
That is what Roosevelt ’s New Deal and Johnson ’s Great Society were all about — using government to take money from those who had earned it and giving it to those who had not earned it .
Over time , socialism returns people to a state of poverty , one in which everyone is equal by virtue of everyone ’s having nothing .
Cuba is a good example .
By taking everything away from the wealthy and middle class , including their businesses , homes , and bank accounts , with the alleged intent of helping the poor , Fidel Castro carried the socialist principle to its logical conclusion .
The result ?
Manifest poverty .
In fact , if it had n’t been for loans and grants from the Soviet Union ( which itself was based on the socialist confiscation - and - redistribution principle ) , Cubans would have faced the same result as the people at Plymouth Rock — starvation and famine .
The only reason that the U.S. standard of living continued rising during the era of American socialism was that the private sector continued accumulating savings and wealth faster than federal officials were confiscating it .
The invention of computers , for example , almost immediately made workers much more productive .
But it is impossible to say how much more productive Americans would be — how much higher our standards of living would be — if the wealth - producing process that our American ancestors had brought into existence had been free to continue .
If Americans had never adopted the income tax and the welfare state , it boggles the mind to think how much better off the American people would be , especially those at the bottom of the economic ladder .
When it comes to economic policy , liberals suffer from two major weaknesses .
One , they believe that all that matters with respect to policy are good intentions .
As long as liberals mean well , they think that the policies they implement , especially with respect to the poor , are justified .
Two , they have a woeful lack of understanding of economic principles , which inevitably leads them to think that they can change the natural laws of economics through the simple act of enacting legislation .
Arguably , the people who have paid the highest price for these two liberal weaknesses are the poor , the class of people around whom liberal domestic policy has claimed to primarily revolve since at least the time of Franklin Roosevelt ’s New Deal .
It would be difficult to find a better example of all this than minimum - wage laws .
These are laws by which liberals claim to help the poor by requiring employers to pay their employees a minimum hourly rate set by the government .
The notion is that this helps the poor by preventing employers from paying less than a subsistence wage .
In the absence of a minimum - wage law , the liberals say , employers would be paying workers so little that the poor would be starving in the streets .
The truth , however , is that no matter how well intended liberals might be , a minimum - wage law actually serves as a monumental attack on the poor .
It is a classic example of how a lack of understanding about economic principles leads liberals into harming the very people they claim to want to help .
Let ’s examine some fundamental economic principles to show how the poor — those at the bottom of the economic ladders — are damaged by minimum - wage laws .
In every exchange , both sides give up something they value less for something they value more .
It ’s a natural principle on which trade is based .
Let ’s assume that I have 10 apples and you have 10 oranges and that I give you 7 apples and you give me 3 oranges .
Someone might say that that ’s an unequal exchange because I gave up more than you did .
Not so .
I gave up something I valued less — 7 apples — for something I valued more — 3 oranges .
But you did the same — you gave up something you valued less — 3 oranges — for something you valued more — 7 apples .
Both of us have benefited from the exchange .
We have both given up something we value less for something we value more .
We have improved our respective standard of living through the simple act of exchange .
Employment and subjective value
This principle applies not only in the trading of goods , but also in the trading of labor services .
When an employer and employee enter into a labor agreement , each of them is giving up something he values less for something he values more .
The employer gives up a certain amount of money in exchange for the labor services of the employee .
He values the money less than he values the work that the employee is performing .
By the same token , the employee gives up his time and labor in exchange for the money he receives from the employer .
The employee places a higher value on the money than he does on the time and labor he ’s devoting to the employer .
There is an important economic principle involved here : Value is entirely subjective .
It lies in the eyes of the beholder .
The value that I place on a particular item is likely to be different from the value that you place on it .
Thus , I might well be willing to pay a higher price for certain things than you would , and the same applies to you .
This principle of subjective value applies to employers when they ’re hiring employees .
When contemplating whether to hire a certain worker , employers subjectively determine the applicants ’ value .
By the same token , the subjective determination of the worker will determine whether he takes the job .
Whether a person is hired or not will ultimately turn on the subjective determinations of both employer and worker .
An employer might think to himself ,  That person is worth $ 5 an hour to me . 
The worker might think to himself ,  I ’m worth $ 6 an hour . 
If neither side budges , then no trade will take place .
That means that the worker will not be employed at that business and must seek other employment where the employer says ,  That worker is worth $ 6 an hour to me . 
And the first employer has to continue looking for someone who will work for $ 5 an hour .
There will be a meeting of the minds when each side gives up something he values less for something he values more , enabling an employment contract to come into existence .
This is an area in which liberals go astray .
They simply do not understand the concept of subjective value .
They think that everything and everybody has some sort of objectively determined value , one that can be legislatively imposed .
Let ’s consider an example .
Suppose an 18 - year - old man is looking for a job .
He comes from a very poor family , dresses very badly , and speaks poor English .
He has no work experience .
Everywhere he goes looking for a job , he is met with the same answer : No .
No matter how many businesses he visits , he simply can not get a job .
Finally , he walks into a business and says ,  I ’m willing to work for a dollar an hour .
I ’ll do whatever you want me to .
For his part , the employer finds that offer extremely attractive .
He has menial tasks to be performed and it is worth it to him to pay $ 1 an hour to get them done .
Thus , both sides — the employer and the worker — have arrived at a meeting of the minds .
Each is willing to give up something he values less for something he values more .
Their decisions are based on their subjective valuation of the elements being exchanged — labor and money .
Creating unemployment
Will the deal go through ?
Not today .
The reason ?
The federal minimum - wage law , which requires employers to pay workers at a minimal rate of $ 7.25 per hour .
The reasoning employed by liberals goes like this : Nobody can survive earning a dollar an hour .
To sustain one ’s life , liberals say , requires a minimal rate of $ 7.25 an hour .
Therefore , liberals enact a law that requires employers to pay their workers that minimal rate .
In the process , liberals portray themselves as great heroes for the poor .
But there ’s obviously a problem here , one involving subjective value .
In our example , that 18 - year - old is unable to find any employer willing to pay him $ 7.25 .
All they ’re willing to pay him is $ 1 an hour , a rate that he is willing to accept but is precluded from doing so because of the minimum - wage law .
What happens to that 18 - year - old ?
As a result of the minimum - wage law , he goes unemployed , permanently .
He simply cannot get a job at the federally established minimum because employers do not place that value on his labor .
That leaves the worker with the following choices : die by starvation , live on charity , engage in criminal conduct , or go on government welfare .
Keep in mind that when a minimum - wage law is enacted , the government does not require employers to hire people at that rate .
Instead , what the government does is to require people who are hired to be paid at that minimal rate .
The obvious question arises with respect to subjective value :
What happens to people whose labor is valued by employers at less than the governmentally established minimum ?
The answer is as obvious as the question , but unfortunately it ’s one that liberals simply fail to consider .
Those people are laid off and , even worse , permanently locked out of the labor market , assuming that valuations remain the same .
That is , as long as employers place a subjective value on the labor of unemployed people that is lower than the governmentally established minimum , those people are going to be out of work .
Employers will simply refuse to hire them .
To make the matter clearer , suppose that Congress enacted a minimum wage of $ 1,000 an hour .
Would n’t that be a great thing for workers ?
No , because it ’s easy to see that lots of people would be laid off .
The reason ?
Subjective value .
All those workers whose labor is valued by employers at less than $ 1,000 an hour would be terminated .
Liberals will rail against this natural law of economics .
They ’ll exclaim ,  Every employer should place a high value on the work of employees .
The value they place should at least equal the amount we set in our minimum - wage law . 
But that ’s not how life works .
Again , value is subjective , not objective .
Employers have their own personal , subjective valuations .
For their part , so do workers .
Thus , in an unhampered market economy — that is , one unhampered by such governmental interventions as minimum - wage laws — there will be no permanent unemployment because people will be able to find jobs at wage rates that are acceptable to them and to their employers , even if it is at rates that liberals consider too low .
Liberals say that it is abhorrent that that 18 - year - old would have to work at a dollar an hour .
They say that no one could survive at that rate .
They say that it ’s unconscionable that anyone should have to work at that less - than - subsistence wage rate .
But in their paternalistic approach to this situation , they block out of their minds some important things .
Even though the young man is making only a dollar an hour , he ’s not only earning a bit of money he ’s also learning work skills and a work ethic .
He ’s learning the business he ’s working for .
He ’s building up his stock of knowledge , which will enable him to become more marketable down the road or perhaps even open his own business to compete against already - established businesses .
Unemployment and crime
But when a teenager willing to work is locked out of the labor market , thanks to the minimum - wage law , he does n’t acquire any of those things .
As a result of the supposedly good intentions of the liberals , the minimum - wage law locks him out of the labor market and relegates him to a life of charity , illegal activity ( e.g. , theft or drug dealing ) , or welfare .
Liberals cry ,  But the boy could never survive on a dollar an hour . 
Nonsense !
There are all sorts of things he could do to make do , especially knowing that the situation is likely to be temporary .
He could live with family or with a large bunch of friends who are sharing expenses .
He would do what was necessary to survive during the time he was improving his work skills .
With their minimum - wage laws , liberals never give that 18 - year - old a chance .
With their supposedly good intentions , they make him permanently unemployable .
Is there a real - life example of this phenomenon ?
Last October the New York Times published a news story about runaway teenagers in America ( http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/us/26runaway.html?_r=2), the number of which has soared because of family financial problems arising from the recession .
Citing federal studies and experts , the article stated that 1.6 million juveniles become runaways annually .
According to the article ,  Legitimate employment was hard to find in the summer of 2009 ; the Labor Department said fewer than 30 percent of teenagers had jobs . 
The runaways supported themselves by selling drugs , panhandling , and prostitution .
Why were n’t the runaway teenagers choosing to work at legitimate jobs to support themselves ?
The answer : minimum - wage laws .
There are no jobs being offered at low wage rates to 14 - year - old runaways with minimal education , rates that many of the runaways might well be willing to work at .
All the available jobs are being offered at the minimum wage because that ’s what the law requires .
And employers simply do not place that value on the work of runaway teenagers who lack an education and work experience .
( A related factor here is teen work permits , another ludicrous regulation that most states require . )
Suppose there was no minimum - wage law .
Then there would be all sorts of jobs being offered on the market at hourly rates of $ 5 , $ 4 , $ 1 . Runaway teenagers would have an array of available options open to them from which to choose .
But those options are never permitted to come into existence because of the government ’s minimum - wage law .
It relegates runaway teenagers to surviving by working in such activities as drug dealing and prostitution .
High wages
Liberals say that in the absence of minimum - wage laws , employers would pay everyone below - subsistence wages .
But that ’s obviously ridiculous , for the labor market is filled with instances of employers paying their workers more than the minimum wage .
How do liberals explain that ?
In other words , if employers would pay everyone below - subsistence wages in the absence of a minimum - wage law , why would so many employers today be paying many of their workers more than the minimum ?
Would n’t you think that they would be paying the minimum amount established by law and not a penny more ?
The answer lies , again , in the concept of subjective value .
The reason that employers pay some workers higher than the minimum wage is that they subjectively place a higher value on the labor of such workers .
Thus , some employers are willing to trade , say , $ 20 an hour in exchange for the labor of their employees .
Why would employers do that ?
Why not pay less rather than more , even if you place a higher valuation on the labor of the workers ?
Because there are other businesses that are competing for the labor of those workers , which tends to send labor rates upward .
Thus , it is in the interests of workers to have as many businesses operating as possible .
More businesses mean greater competition for workers .
Yet , because of minimum - wage laws and other such governmental interventions , many businesses cannot survive .
For example , a company that is barely operating at the margin cannot afford to give its workers a governmentally established pay raise .
With the increase in the minimum wage , such a business has no choice but to close down , thereby laying off its workers .
Add to that all the businesses that have to shut down as a result of other governmental interventions .
Among the people who are hurt are the poor because there are fewer businesses competing for their services .
Liberals operate under the quaint notion that such natural laws as the law of supply and demand can be repealed by public officials .
They can not be .
Minimum - wage laws are just one example among many of a government intervention that hurts the poor .
Other examples include price controls , welfare , protectionism , licensure , and subsidies .
Good intentions do n’t matter and a lack of understanding of economic principles is no excuse .
What matters are the actual consequences of government policy .
Those whom liberals claim to love — the poor — are the ones who suffer the most from liberal economic policies .

The Missouri State House started its last day of the session on an anti-choice foot by passing the Abortion Restriction Bill .
This omnibus bill , which contains additional restrictions on top of the state ’s current 24 hour waiting period and informed consent process , passed by a vote of 114-39 .
Under the new law , physicians are required to repeat medically inaccurate statements to the patient prior to the procedure and all informed consent processes must be done face to face , adding to the length of time required to obtain an abortion .
Abortions will no longer be included in any private health care plans in the state , regardless of whether or not a woman would have paid for the coverage with separate funds .
Also , clinics will be required to put up signs that read that the state will provide support for mothers who decide to continue their pregnancies , although the state does not at this time have resources in place to give to these mothers .
Planned Parenthood Affiliates of Missouri released the following statement upon passage of the bill :
This bill does nothing to improve the health and well - being of Missouri women , and it does nothing to help women and couples prevent unintended pregnancies .
As a trusted provider of reproductive health care , Planned Parenthood believes every woman should have evenhanded and unbiased information so she can protect her health and make the best decision for herself and her family .
A woman needs – and Missouri women get – information about the risks involved with , and alternatives to , abortion but that information should not be written to coerce , shame or pressure the woman into making a decision that is not right for her .
The House Children and Families Committee debated and passed 6 bills restricting abortion this session while ignoring child protection and prevention bills .
The vast majority of Missourians support common sense solutions like sex education in schools and increased access to family planning services .
The Missouri legislature is out
of step with the priorities of the state .

Robert Carroll of the Tax Foundation has written a new piece entitled " Income Mobility and the Persistence Of Millionaires , 1999 to 2007 " that uses a set of household tax returns from those years to look at income mobility with a particular emphasis on the mobility of millionaires .
I 'll bullet some key findings then add a few comments below .
Of those taxpayer households in the lowest quintile of income in 1999 , 57.5 % had moved up at least one quintile by 2007 and over 30 % jumped two quintiles or more .
Of those taxpayer households in the highest quintile in 1999 , 37.7 % fell at least one quintile , with 14.4 % falling two quintiles or more .
Of those in the top 1 % in 1999 , only 44.6 % were still there in 2007 .
Looking at households with earnings ( in a very inclusive measure that includes things like capital gains ) of $ 1,000,000 or more in any year over that period , Carroll finds :
" In all , over the 1999 through 2007 period , about 675,000 taxpayers earned over a $ 1 million for at least one year .
Of these taxpayers , about 338,000 ( 50 percent ) were a millionaire in only one year , while just 38,000 ( 6 percent ) remained a millionaire in all nine years .
Based on these results , it is clear that taxpayers move in and out of millionaire status with great frequency . "
" What we want to find out is whether the fraction of transitory millionaires fell by more than the total number of millionaires once capital gains is excluded .
What Figure 2 and 3 tell us is that while the total number of millionaires fell by about 36 percent , the number of one - year millionaires fell much more , by nearly 50 percent to 175,000 .
This tells us that realizing capital gains income helps explain why many taxpayers move up to millionaire status for just one year . "
Carroll 's results on overall mobility are right in line with the typical results found in the literature in recent years .
( The results found by Cox and Alm and in a prior US Treasury data set , both covering the 1980s , show dramatically more mobility but have also been highly criticized on methodological grounds . )
So despite the increase in " static inequality " shown by the increased percentage of income earned by the top earners over the last decade , there appears to be no effect on income mobility .
Carroll uses a nice analogy from Schumpeter that I 'd never heard before : the distribution of income is like a hotel with some really fancy rooms on the top floors and some very basic ones on the bottom .
All the rooms are always full , but who occupies which rooms changes from year to year .
If one wants to stretch the analogy a bit more , it 's also the case that each year brings a new upgrade to every room .
What constitutes a " basic " room gets slightly more luxurious each year as standards of living rise , and the same is true on other floors .
It might be the case that the upgrades to the top floor rooms are proportionally greater than those to the basic and middle floor rooms , but given that the occupants of the rooms switch around from year to year , those greater improvements at the top are still consistent with improvements in the absolute standard of living for many .
And to take the analogy even further : if we account for immigration and other new entrants to the labor force , it 's as if the hotel keeps adding rooms / floors on each year at the lower / basic level , enabling everyone else to potentially keep moving up ( assuming that some occupants die or leave the country ! ) .
The bottom line is that income mobility is alive and well and seems pretty consistent regardless of who is president or who controls Congress .
The underlying market processes appear to be doing well at enabling a majority of those who start out poor to move up the income ladder within a decade or less .
And when one combines Carroll 's research with the " Good Old Days are Now " work on the dramatic declines in the real cost of most goods , the increased ability of those in the lower quintile to have them in their homes and the ongoing increase in quality of most goods , it is clear that despite a government that is way too big , the standard of living and the opportunities for poor Americans continue to improve .
As good as these results are , allow me to steal from a favorite source of mine and say " just think what we might do " if those market processes were even freer to work their magic .
The Supreme Court said Thursday a California police officer ’s privacy was not breached when his superiors read transcripts of hundreds of his text messages .
The Ontario Police Department was looking at the transcripts as part of an effort to determine whether it was providing an adequate quota of monthly pager texts to its officers .
The SWAT officer , Jeff Quon , was exceeding the limit for months , and his superiors wanted to know why .
Quon was originally paying the extra fees out of his own pocket .
He sued after the inquiry , alleging his privacy was violated .
Many of the text messages were sexually explicit .
" The city and OPD had a legitimate interest in ensuring that employees were not being forced to pay out of their own pockets for work - related expenses , or on the other hand that the city was not paying for extensive personal communications , " Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the 9 - 0 court , its first ruling directly addressing text - message privacy ( . pdf ) in the work context .
Silicon Valley privacy attorney Christine Lyon said the high court 's analysis was not founded on the police department 's policy that text messages were the department 's property .
Lyon , who was not involved in the case , said even if the department did not have such a privacy policy , the outcome likely would have been the same .
" What they 're saying , even if the employee had an expectation of privacy , it can be effectively trumped , " Lyon said in a telephone interview .
As for the scope of the text - message search , Kennedy said , " reviewing the transcripts was reasonable because it was an efficient and expedient way to determine whether Quon 's overages were the result of work - related messaging or personal use . "
The decision reversed the San Francisco - based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that ruled that the search was " legitimate " but " not reasonable in scope . "
The court of appeals said the audit could have been conducted by allowing Quon to redact the transcript of the messages before they were handed over to his superiors , or the department could have warned him that if he went over the limit again , his messages would be audited .
The Supreme Court did not agree .
" The search was reasonable , and the court of appeals erred by holding to the contrary , " the unanimous court ruled .
Still , the justices suggested that the convoluted facts of the case , including Quon being allowed at one point to pay for his overages , makes this lawsuit not the best one to decide future employee - employer privacy disputes .
" Prudence counsels caution before the facts in the instant case are used to establish far - reaching premises that define the existence , and extent , of privacy expectations enjoyed by employees when using employer - provided communication devices , " Kennedy wrote .
What 's more , Kennedy suggested that privacy in the modern age has more than one meaning .
" Cell phone and text message communications are so pervasive that some persons may consider them to be essential means or necessary instruments for self - expression , even self identification .
That might strengthen the case for an expectation of privacy .
On the other hand , the ubiquity of those devices has made them generally affordable , so one could counter that employees who need cell phones or similar devices for personal matters can purchase and pay for their own .
And employer policies concerning communications will of course shape the reasonable expectations of their employees , especially to the extent that such policies are clearly communicated . "

World 's Largest Concentrating Solar Power Plant to Come Up in Abu Dhabi
June 12th , 2010 by Mridul Chadha
A consortium of some of the most renowned energy companies in the world would construct the world ’s largest concentrating solar power plant near Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates .
The plant would have a capacity of 100 MW .
[ social_buttons ]
France ’s oil company Total , one of the six ‘ super major ’ oil companies in the world , and Spain ’s Abengoa Solar will join hands with Abu Dhabi - based alternate energy company Masdar to build this power plant which would span 2.5 square kilometers ( one square mile ) .
The project will be located in Madinat Zayed , about 120 kilometres ( 75 miles ) southwest of Abu Dhabi .
According to company estimates , the cost of the project is expected to be around $ 600 million and the project would offset 170,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually .
The plant will comprise of concentrating mirrors which will focus the solar energy on tube passing through their foci .
The tube will contain an oil which will absorb the sun ’s heat which will then convert water into steam to drive a steam turbine and produce electricity through a generator .
According to the project manager , the electricity generated will be used for providing electricity through the daytime when the demand peaks due to heavy airconditioning requirements .
The power plant will be complemented with an power generation system based on natural gas in order to fulfill the demand in the absence of adequate sunlight .
The project would help Abu Dhabi achieve its target of generating seven percent of the electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020 .
The construction of the plant would commence in the third quarter of this year and would be completed by 2012 and the company intends to construct two more such projects in the future .
The construction of world ’s largest concentrating solar power plant in the country having the sixth largest proven oil reserves speaks volumes about the urgent need for transition to renewable energy technologies .
Several developed and developing countries continue to see fossil fuels as their primary energy resource even for the long term .
Many countries like India and China are looking to expand their strategic strongholds in countries with ample reserves of oil , natural gas and coal .
Countries like the United States and Canada are either looking for domestic oil reserves or are debating about whether to increase investments into renewable energy technologies or not .
Talks about achieving energy independence are virtually meaningless if we do not consider renewable energy resources and so is short - term energy planning .
Planning about future energy demands and their fulfillment can only be done if we realize that we have only limited conventional energy resources and we must initiate the transition to clean energy resources today .
Surely , construction of such large - scale power plants is not always viable given the global economic slowdown but lawmakers could at least show a sincere intent for promoting clean energy technologies by not blocking new energy policies .

Daily Galaxy ’s picture of the day reveals the huge MacGuffin in space
For those of you following this year ’s season of Doctor Who , this picture of the day makes for some rather disturbing viewing .
It appears that the constellation Sagittarius is featuring a huge stellar bit of graffiti .
And it looks rather like the crack in the Universe that ’s been following Matt Smith and Karen Gillan around this year ’s story .
So what is this crack ?
it ’s “ the core of a thick , sooty cloud large enough to swallow dozens of solar systems and may be harboring beastly stars in the process of forming . ”
That ’s ominous – a star devouring gap in the middle of the night sky … someone better call for The Doctor !

Share a little beauty …. discovering art through your travels
A little bird told me …. to get out there and see .
Travel blogs often convey stories about humans , geography ….
but do they focus specifically on art ?
Do n’t the arts convey culture , stories , experience ?
Here ’s a string of photographs that really resonates with me for a number of reasons :
– the beauty in the unconventional
– the peace that comes from visiting foreign locations
– suppressing ideals ( where in your life do you see freedom , colour and movement ? )
I ’m gathering similar content for future posts …. please let me know about photographers , artists and musicians that you discovered during your travels .
Share a little beauty !
( Do n’t let the photographs fool you …. this is my lovely sister . )
According to Thomas E. Perez , 48 , assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice , enforcement of employment , disability rights and other anti-discrimination laws have been stepped up .
Justice Department officials say the division has filed 29 cases in the first 17 months under President Barack Obama , mostly having to do with employment discrimination .
Only one case was filed during the same period under the previous Bush administration .
Between 2003 and 2007 nearly 70 percent of the lawyers had left the division during allegations that the George W. Bush administration was politicizing hiring .
Critics say the division ’s former head refused to hire lawyers he labeled “ commies ” and even had one transferred for writing in “ ebonics . ”
Civil rights groups nationwide said the department had lost its historic civil rights focus .
But all that is changing say justice department officials .
“ We had to do some healing , ” said Perez to the Washington Post .
Perez is a former Maryland official and deputy assistant attorney under both Democratic and Republican presidents .
“ We had to restore the partnership between the career staff and the political leadership , ” added Perez .
“ And frankly , certain civil rights laws were not being enforced . ”
The Civil Rights division was created in 1957 to assist Freedom Riders and students seeking to integrate public schools .
Today hate crimes and police misconduct has become a renewed focus for the division .
Several section chiefs from the Bush era have left and officials say more than 30 people have been or are about to be hired as part of an 18 percent budget increase this year , the largest in the division ’s history .
Some 102 new people are expected to be hired .
Recently the division has taken a leading role in preparing for a possible lawsuit by the Obama administration against Arizona over the state ’s new controversial and anti-immigrant law .
“ I think we have positioned the division to carry out its traditional mission of enforcement and be nimble enough to respond to emerging challenges , ” said Perez .
For example Perez notes a $ 6.1 million settlement with AIG subsidiaries to resolve allegations of discrimination against African American borrowers and the creation of a fair - lending unit in response to the economic crisis .
The unit has 49 active investigations .
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. has said a heightened focus on civil rights enforcement is a top priority for the justice department .
During his January State of the Union address President Obama vowed that on his watch the Civil Rights Division would prosecute civil rights violations and employment discrimination .
Among recent cases , the division won the largest - ever settlement of rental - discrimination claims under the Fair Housing Act : 2.7 million from the owners of Los Angeles apartment buildings for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos .
Prosecutors are also investigating growing threats to civil rights groups on the Internet as well as other emerging areas where enforcement is required .
Perez notes restoring relationships with historic civil rights groups are part of revamping the division ’s mission .
John Payton , president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund , said his group ’s relations with the division have improved .
“ When we call them , they listen , ” Payton told the Washington Post .
“ I think they ’re on track and on mission .
It ’s just too early to tell what will happen . ”
The Senate Judiciary committee held a hearing for Thomas Perez nominated to the post of Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Rights Division on Capitol Hill in Washington , April 29 , 2009 .

Researchers say the process is just speeding up natural selection Putting a live sheep into a CT scanner looks ungainly , even slightly comical , but the science behind it has serious implications for Britain 's national flock .
One by one they are mildly sedated and then strapped to a gurney , complete with head cushion for comfort .
Once loaded on to the machine itself , a slow conveyor takes them through the large white , donut - shaped scanner .
This is not happening because the animal is hurt or injured , in fact the Charollais ram is in tip top condition and his owner wants more like him .
Dr Kevin Sinclair , a professor in developmental biology at The University of Nottingham , is helping farmers pick the best of the best to breed better quality meat into their flocks .
He says : " One argument for lamb becoming less popular as a meat is because people complain about it being too fatty .
" Breeders are increasingly testing their animals for leanness and this does it with pinpoint accuracy . "
We have a real duty at this moment in time to produce food more efficiently
Charles Sercombe , sheep farmer
When asked about the issues surrounding genetics in farming he added : " Genetic modification conjures up all the wrong images in people 's minds .
" What we 're doing here is a process of selection , akin to natural selection , except we 're speeding up the process and selecting for characteristics that we favour .
" This is n't new .
Domestication in farm animals occurred 10,000 years ago and we 've been doing it ever since .
" By using the technology we can do it with greater precision and accuracy that ever before . "
The mobile scanner was brought down to Nottingham from the Scottish Agricultural College in Edinburgh which developed the technique .
Dr. Lutz Bunger , who heads up SAC's Growth Genetics Team , said " We are proud of what our service can do .
" While ultrasound scanning has been used to measure the fat layers on a sheep 's back , this latest technology allows us to measure meat and bone as well .
" We can identify the very best sheep to breed from , those with the best genetics for growth rate and meat yield " .
The university is the only place it has been used south of the border and it has been such a hit with farmers it is hoped a permanent unit will be set up at its Sutton Bonnington campus by the end of the year .
The system has already improved the yield of some flocks Virtual cross-section slices appear on a radiologist 's screen as each lamb passes through the former NHS scanner .
The images show the animal 's fat , muscle and bone content .
To improve their stock , farmers are looking for less fat and more muscle .
The information is being put to good use by Charles Sercombe , who has a sheep farm in Leicestershire .
At £ 85 per animal , he can only afford to scan a hand - picked trailer full , but believes it is a good investment for the future of his flock .
By pinpointing the best of the best , Mr Sercombe says he can achieve better margins and sustainability : " As farmers I think we have a real duty at this moment in time to produce food more efficiently .
" There are obviously finite resources on this planet and I think we have a duty to the general population to produce faster growing , more muscled animals that use less resources and have less impact on the climate . "
The superior genes of his fitter , leaner lambs fetch a premium when sold for breeding .
The programme is being welcomed by an industry worth £ 822 m a year in Britain .
Mr Sercombe says the breeding programme has already increased his yield per lamb by two kilos .
It will take two to three years for that to filter down through his whole flock and longer still to reach the general sheep population .
But as more farmers cotton on to this technology the future of British lamb is looking good .
The story was updated on 27 May 2010 to include a comment from Dr Lutz Bunger after additional information came to light post publication and was added to clarify the nature of the work .

It 's going to take a really long time before the worst of this oil disaster passes - and we do n't even know yet what this year 's hurricane season will do :
Twenty - three years earlier , in 1979 , an oil well named Ixtoc I had a blowout in 150 feet of water in the southern Gulf of Mexico .
The Mexican national oil company Pemex tried to kill the well with drilling mud , and then with steel and lead balls dropped into the wellbore .
It tried to contain the oil with a cap nicknamed The Sombrero .
Finally , after 290 days , a relief well plugged the hole with cement and the spill came to an end -- but only after polluting the gulf with 138 million gallons of crude .
That remains the worst accidental oil spill in history -- but the Deepwater Horizon blowout off the Louisiana coast is rapidly gaining on it .
The spill has now been partially contained with the cap that BP engineers lowered onto the mile - deep geyser Thursday night .
That means roughly a quarter to half of the flow is being piped to a surface ship , the national incident commander , Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , said Saturday .
BP hopes to improve the rate captured in coming days .
If official government estimates are correct , 23 million to 47 million gallons of oil have spewed so far .
Ecosystems can survive and eventually recover from very large oil spills , even ones that are Ixtoc - sized .
In most spills , the volatile compounds evaporate .
The sun breaks down others .
Some compounds are dissolved in water .
Microbes consume the simpler , " straight chain " hydrocarbons -- and the warmer it is , the more they eat .
The gulf spill has climate in its favor .
Scientists agree : Horrible as the spill may be , it 's not going to turn the Gulf of Mexico into another Dead Sea .
But neither is this ecological crisis going to be over anytime soon .
The spill will have ripple effects far into the future , scientists warn .
" This spill will be lasting for years if not decades , " said Doug Inkley , senior scientist at the National Wildlife Federation .
A " Good Samaritan " risked his life to rescue a toddler from a burning car .
The man , whose identity is unknown , saved the life of a three - year - old boy who was injured in a fatal road traffic collision .
Two vehicles were involved in the head - on crash just after 5.30 pm last night in the Bedfordshire village of Heath and Reach .
The driver of a dark blue Vauxhall Astra was pronounced dead at the scene while the toddler , who was a passenger in the same car , was taken to Luton and Dunstable Hospital .
The driver of the other vehicle , a white Volkswagen van , was seriously injured and was airlifted to the Royal London Hospital , Bedfordshire Police said .
A spokeswoman said : " The ' Good Samaritan ' was in another car and may have witnessed the collision before risking his own life to save the young boy from the burning Astra .
" Once free of the wreckage , he passed the toddler to a woman who also witnessed the incident and happened to be an off - duty nurse , before continuing on his way without leaving any contact details . "
The force is appealing for him to contact them .
He is described only as an " older " man .
Pc Andy Carter , from the collision investigation unit , said : " The act of bravery shown by this man is astonishing .
" The fact that he then carried on his way without a thought for himself is even more staggering .
Last week , I wrote a list of the Top 10 Video Game Westerns .
This week , after spending many an hour in the sprawling game world of Rockstar San Diego ’s Red Dead Redemption , I must humbly amend that list to reflect that this game is the best video game Western ever made .
Sorry to spoil the suspense ; usually it ’s customary to wait until the final paragraph to deliver the verdict , but anyone who is remotely in touch with the world of gaming has heard of , read , or watched dozens of stellar reviews for Red Dead Redemption .
This review will be no exception .
Red Dead Redemption puts you in the boots & spurs of John Marston , a former outlaw now under the thumb of the US Federal Government .
In order to protect his family and himself , Marston must do dirty work for the government and , seemingly , every other citizen of New Austin .
On the way , he encounters dozens of interesting , believable and often times sympathetic characters .
The story and character development are primarily relayed through lengthy , but never tedious , cutscenes , and through dialogue that takes place during travel by horseback , train , or stagecoach .
The pacing of the game is sublime , with Marston ’s troubled past and true motives being slowly revealed with each interaction , and new characters receive the time and attention needed to make the player care about them .
The plot never drags on , but it never feels rushed , either .
The expected top - tier Rockstar dialogue returns , and it ’s bolstered by realistic facial animations and outstanding voice work .
Progression is broken up into missions for different people , similar to the Grand Theft Auto series , and while the main storyline gets top billing , the side quests are equally enjoyable and well written .
Objectives are varied enough that only the marathon players will feel the gnaw of repetition .
Should you be one of these players , New Austin is packed to the brim with optional mini-games and other diversions .
These range from saving women from being kidnapped , breaking wild horses , playing poker & blackjack , and dozens more .
The game deftly handles its plethora of play options by gradually introducing new elements , so it never feels overwhelming .
Gameplay is solid both on foot and on horseback .
An arsenal of deadly weapons is at your disposal , all of which feel appropriately powered , and the targeting system can be picked up after the first few gunfights , The ‘ Dead Eye ’ is your standard slow - motion fare , and it ’s especially useful when fending off a small army .
Melee combat is , sadly , lacking in both style and substance , but you ’ll rarely have to let your fists do the talking .
The cover system is intuitive but not flawless , and combat on horseback or when riding shotgun on a stagecoach is handled well .
Essentially , the game provides all the resources to be deadly , and the rest is up to the player .
Navigating the massive world of Red Dead Redemption is no small feat .
You ’ll spend most of your time on horseback , and players will inevitably become attached to their horse , whose stats increase as the bond between rider and mount grows stronger .
Stagecoaches can be used to quick travel to previously visited locations , and trains can be used to travel from town to town .
Once locations are discovered , John can thankfully fast travel to any point on the map by using his campsites .
It ’s an odd , and somewhat illogical method of travel , but it beats galloping everywhere across the map .
The only thing that is disappointing is the fact that John Marston sinks like a rock when he ’s in anything but a few inches of water .
This restriction was put in place to cordon off the southern half of the map ( based on Mexico ) until the few bridges are completed , but it feels out of place in a game that allows you to do so much .
The single player mode could last you anywhere from 20 to 200 hours depending on how often you quick travel and how engrossed you become in the game world .
In addition to that , the multiplayer options are substantial to say the least , with cooperative and competitive modes and the ‘ Posse ’ system , which allows you and a group of friends to stay together across multiple game modes .
Visually , regardless of which machine you choose to play it on , Red Dead Redemption is nothing short of breathtaking .
Taking into account the scope of the game , the occasional pop-in or slow - down is excusable , and everything usually runs at a solid framerate .
The environments range from Monument Valley - inspired expanses to snowy peaks and everything in between .
The weather effects are particularly excellent , with the stars in the sky glimmering during the night and puddles of water being found on the roads after a heavy rain .
As previously mentioned , the facial animations do a lot to lend the characters humanity , and this extends to the Euphoria engine - based body animations , which are as fun as ever , albeit occasionally glitchy .
The way an outlaw falls off his horse after a well - aimed shot to the head is nothing short of poetic .
If you have even the slightest interest in Westerns , buy this game .
It has film references galore , looks and plays beautifully , and , as previously stated , is the best video game Western out there .
It has a few flaws , yes , but it ’s the first game to approach perfection in 2010 .

There ’s video of valedictorian Rebeccah TerHune giving her speech .

When it comes to Prayer versus Moments of Silence in public schools , most Christians are smart enough not to endorse prayer .
Not every student is Christian and you ’re just asking for a lawsuit … it ’s not worth the fight .
Moments of silence are trickier .
The conservatives who push for it say it ’s good for students to begin a day with “ silence ” ( as if teachers would n’t want silence otherwise … ? ) but it ’s really both a waste of time and a thinly veiled attempt at getting prayer - time into the classroom .
Recently , California ’s Exeter Union High School administrators irresponsibly let students vote on whether or not a student could deliver a graduation prayer .
It was irrelevant , though , thanks to the work for church / state separation groups .
The school board decided not to go through with any formal graduation prayers .
They did n’t even bother counting the votes .
The school board made the decision after three organizations — Americans United for Separation of Church and State , the Freedom from Religion Foundation and the Anti-Defamation League — sent letters to the district objecting to a graduation prayer .
Board President Larry Larson says the district ca n’t afford a drawn - out legal fight over the issue .
He says the courts have ruled against prayer at graduation and he does n’t want the issue to overwhelm the ceremony .
They could afford it if they knew were going to win .
But it ’s a losing battle .
And Larson knows it .
Was he trying to get away with breaking the law because he figured no one would notice ?
The school board voted to have a moment of silence instead …
“ It does n’t really matter ” if there ’s a moment of silence instead of a prayer , Larson said .
“ The whole idea of the moment of silence is for the graduating class to contemplate what they have accomplished . ” …
“ I want to have a prayer at the graduation .
I think the Lord has blessed my time at high school , ” [ senior Anna ]
Unger said .
“ But I understand that ’s the law now .
We ’re not going to change it .
I guess a moment of silence is a good alternative . ”
Of course they ’re ok with silence , because to them , it ’ll give everyone a chance to pray .
Literally .
Some Christians could n’t stand not being able to pray out loud .
So take a guess as to what happened during the moment of silence :
( If you ca n’t see the video , go here . )
These people are pathetic .
They could easily have prayed before the ceremony .
Or in their minds during the ceremony .
But they do n’t care about that .
It ’s not about their relationship with their god .
It ’s about the show .
They do n’t just want to pray .
They want to pray out loud and they want to make sure everyone hears it .
They want to out - Jesu - fy everyone else .
Any Christian ought to be embarrassed by these people .
Hell , it ’s not even what Jesus wanted :
But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .

Vehicle warfare comes to the forefront in Atacama Desert while Nelson Bay focuses squarely on infantry assault .
Players can compete in squads and check individual progress via the dedicated Onslaught leaderboards .
The email , said to have been sent by Mr Chartier , was itself published on the internet .
It said : " I actually like to pay my employees , my family , my bank for their work and like to get paid for my work .
Commemorating the anniversary of the Green Movement .
One year ago this week in Iran , the desire for democracy gave birth to an indigenous political reform movement that is more promising and more consequential than anything the Middle East has seen in a generation .
One year ago , the conventional wisdom held that the prospect for political evolution in Iran was dim and distant .
But as it often is , that conventional wisdom was utterly wrong :
After the Iranian people were denied their right to a free and fair election , the world watched in awe as a sea of protestors — by some estimates , as many as three million Iranians — swelled into streets all around the country .
Ordinary Iranians realized that they could not remain neutral in the struggle for human rights in their country , and they became part of it .
As a result , history was made before our very eyes : one year ago , democratic change in Iran looked rather improbable , but just one week later it looked virtually inevitable .
Unfortunately , we also watched the ensuing crackdown , which was as swift as it was brutal .
Peaceful protestors were attacked in the streets by masked agents of the Iranian regime , then dragged away to the darkest corners of cruelty .
Many of Iran ’s best and brightest were forced to flee in fear from the land they love , and to seek asylum in places such as Iraq and Turkey , where they remain today as refugees .
We read the desperate pleas of terrorized Iranians as they shouted for help through whatever cracks they could make in Iran ’s government - censored Internet .
And then , on June 20 , 2009 , the entire world watched as a young woman named Neda bled to death in the streets of Tehran .
And on that day , I believe , we witnessed the beginning of the end of this offensive government in Iran .
The past year ’s events have demonstrated the true character of Iran ’s people : proud , talented , the stewards of a great culture , eager to engage with the world , and relentless in their quest for justice — a nation that should be a natural ally of the United States .
The past year ’s events have also highlighted the true character of the Iranian regime : a violent and militarized tyranny , self - serving and unconcerned for the welfare of Iran ’s people , with no shred of legitimacy left to justify its rule .
We cannot any longer separate the behavior of Iran ’s government from its character .
After all , is it any wonder that a regime that has no regard whatsoever for the rights , the dignity , the very lives of its own people , would also show the same blatant disregard for its own international agreements , for the sovereignty and security of its neighbors , and for the responsibilities of all civilized nations ?
Is it any wonder that this is the same regime that spends its people ’s precious resources not on roads , or schools , or hospitals , or jobs that benefit all Iranians — but on funding violent groups of foreign extremists who murder the innocent ?
And is it any wonder that this Iranian regime has been , and will always be , uncompromising in its pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability — not just because it would be a source of power in the world , but perhaps more importantly , because it would be a source of safety and survival for its corrupt , unjust system at home ?
When we consider the many threats and crimes of Iran ’s government , we are led to one inescapable conclusion : it is the character of this Iranian regime — not just its behavior — that is the deeper threat to peace and freedom in our world , and in Iran .
For this reason , I believe that it will only be a change in the Iranian regime itself — a peaceful change , chosen by and led by the people of Iran — that can finally produce the changes we seek in Iran ’s policies .

Right .
Did I miss something here ?
How often do you see a good band list U2 as one of their references ?
And if they do , is it Achtung Baby in particular ?
It 's not even a good album , by U2s standards .

Image caption Landings into UK ports in the 19th Century were four times higher than today
Over -fishing means UK trawlers have to work 17 times as hard for the same fish catch as 120 years ago , a study shows .
Researchers used port records dating from the late 1800s , when mechanised boats were replacing sailing vessels .
In the journal Nature Communications , they say this implies " an extraordinary decline " in fish stocks and " profound " ecosystem changes .
Four times more fish were being landed in UK ports 100 years ago than today , and catches peaked in 1938 .
" Over a century of intensive trawl fishing has severely depleted UK seas of bottom living fish like halibut , turbot , haddock and plaice , " said Simon Brockington , head of conservation at the Marine Conservation Society and one of the study 's authors .
" It is vital that governments recognise the changes that have taken place ( and ) set stock protection and recovery targets that are reflective of the historical productivity of the sea . "
Victorian values
In the late 1880s , the government set up inspectorates in major fishing ports in an attempt to monitor what fish were being landed .
There 's nothing basically wrong with the CFP and not much wrong with the scientific research they receive Philip MacMullen , Seafish
" The records are pretty reliable , " said Callum Roberts from the UK's York University , another of the study authors .
" The Victorians were very assiduous about collecting information ; and while some of the landings might have been missed from smaller ports , the larger ports were covered very efficiently , " he told BBC News .
Around the same period , naturalist Walter Garstang was beginning to analyse " fishing power " - essentially , the capacity of a fleet to catch fish .
The biggest change over the period was from sail to engine power .
" With sail power , boats could only go at fixed times and only in certain places with a smooth sea bottom , " Professor Roberts noted
" But when you got engines , that meant they could fish in any conditions of wind or tide and sea bed . "
As waters near the coast became depleted , industrialisation also meant the UK fleet could travel further in search of new grounds - a phenomenon that took off after 1918 .
But despite the growing power and range , the amount of fish caught for each unit of effort has gone drastically down , with 17 times more effort required now to catch the same amount of fish as compared with the late 1800s .
' Old news '
Philip MacMullen , head of environmental responsibility at the UK's industry - funded sustainability organisation Seafish , suggested that accenting the historical picture could obscure more recent improvements .
" It could be correct but I do n't know , and I do n't think the data support the findings , " he said .
Image caption Fish such as plaice have been fished further and further afield
" But it 's old news .
Fifteen years ago we started understanding how badly management was working , and 10 years ago we started doing something about it . "
Seafish points out that in the last decade , stocks of some species such as cod have shown increases .
But Professor Roberts counters that the long historical timeline in his study shows the recent improvements to be small in scale .
" If you get a 50 % increase from 2 % of a species ' former abundance , you get to 3 % of its former abundance , so you should n't celebrate too hard , " he said .
" That 's why this perspective is important . "
Whereas UK fishermen tend to blame the EU's Common Fisheries Policy ( CFP ) for their economic problems , the authors of this study say it proves that depletion stems from mismanagament well before the CFP came into existence .
" There 's nothing basically wrong with the CFP and not much wrong with the scientific research they receive , " commented Dr MacMullen .
" But what happens to that advice when it goes up to the Council of Ministers - it 's completely mis-managed . "
Haaretz reports :
A group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators sailing toward Gaza with humanitarian supplies on Thursday have refused a request by the father of abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit to deliver a package and letter to his son .
Activists rejected Noam Shalit ’s offer to mediate on their behalf with the government , which has vowed to block the flotilla ’s entry to Gaza , if they agreed to his request .
A forum of seven senior ministers decided on Wednesday that Israel would attempt to turn back the ‘ Freedom Flotilla ’ , on course to enter a 20 - mile Israeli - imposed exclusion zone off Gaza this weekend .
The government said it would allow the United Nations to transfer the flotilla ’s humanitarian cargo to Gaza after security inspections at the Israeli port .
Just a horrific workplace tragedy in Montcoal , West Virginia :
If , as feared , the four missing miners are found to have perished and the death toll at Upper Big Branch rises to 29 , it would be the worst U.S. mining disaster since 1970 , when 38 were killed by an explosion at Finley Coal Co. in Hyden , Ky .
The cause of Monday ’s explosion has not been determined , but a buildup of methane or coal dust was considered the likeliest culprit .
Although Massey Energy boasts on its
Web site of achieving its best safety record in 2009 and beating the industry average for the sixth consecutive year , safety officials said the Upper Big Branch Mine , run by Massey subsidiary Performance Coal Co. , has a history of violations for not properly ventilating methane gas .
Federal inspectors fined the company more than $ 382,000 in the past year for repeated serious violations involving its ventilation plan and equipment at Upper Big Branch , the Associated Press reported .
The violations also cover failing to follow the plan , allowing combustible coal dust to pile up and having improper firefighting equipment .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Gaze into a glass of water , and you 're unlikely to see much more than your own reflection .
But gaze a little deeper using a microscope -- or , better yet , a series of laser pulses and detectors -- and you 'll see an intricate molecular dance .
As water sits , seemingly calm , the hydrogen bonds between water molecules are continually breaking and forming , with each molecule switching dance partners a hundred billion times a second .
" We 've known for quite a while that the hydrogen bonds change constantly , but the details were still fuzzy , " said Kelly Gaffney , a researcher at the joint SLAC - Stanford PULSE Institute for Ultrafast Energy Science .
" In recent simulations , others have found that the switch from one bond to another happens very quickly , and that the angle between the hydrogen atom bonds changes by 60 or 70 degrees .
But it 's so hard to simulate the complex nature of water that it was important to check this prediction experimentally . "
Now , in collaboration with Stanford physics graduate student Minbiao Ji and Stockholm University chemical physicist Michael Odelius , Gaffney has conducted intricate experiments showing that the molecules do indeed act as simulations predict .
In their experiments , the researchers studied not pure water but a mix of water and a type of salt called sodium perchlorate .
In this solution , each water molecule's two chemical bonds ( connecting its two hydrogen atoms to its oxygen atom ) interacted with other water or perchlorate molecules , forming hydrogen bonds .
These distinct hydrogen bonds differ slightly in strength depending on whether they connect a water molecule with another water molecule or with a perchlorate molecule .
They also each change the vibrational strength of the water molecule 's chemical bond differently , enabling researchers to distinguish the two types of hydrogen bond .
By sending carefully timed laser pulses into the water - perchlorate mixture , Ji and Gaffney were able to compare these initial vibrations with the vibrations a bit later , measuring how long it took for the molecules to switch dance partners .
The answer ?
About once every six picoseconds , or 160 billion times a second .
See the molecular dance of water animated in this simulation by Stockholm University chemical physicist Michael Odelius ( Time : 1:00 ) .
( Video by Brad Plummer and Kelen Tuttle ; simulation courtesy Michael Odelius . )
" That 's fast , " Gaffney said .
The researchers were also able to determine how the angle of the bond changed from moment to moment because laser light is polarized , with an intrinsic extra " directionality " at right angles to the light rays ' direction of travel .
As a result , the laser pulse preferentially excites molecules with bonds parallel to the laser light 's polarization , allowing the researchers to distinguish between bonds oriented in this direction and those oriented in all other directions .
By looking at the orientation of water molecules that have switched dance partners from another water to a perchlorate molecule , they could determine how far and how fast a water molecule rotates when it exchanges hydrogen bonds .
" We found that the hydrogen bond breaks and reforms with an angular jump of about 50 degrees , " Gaffney said .
" And that 's about what simulations performed by Michael Odelius suggested . "
The method used by Gaffney and his team to measure the bond lifetime and angle worked well for water and perchlorate , but is not possible with pure water ; when all water molecules form the same hydrogen bonds , there is no way for the researchers to tell when they have switched partners .
Fortunately , Gaffney said , all simulations seem to imply that the results found for salt water apply to pure water and a variety of aqueous solutions .
" This is exciting work , " Ji said .
" To really understand water , the stuff that makes up more than half our bodies , we need to understand how these molecules move in a microscopic field .
But it 's only with the recent development of ultrafast lasers that we 've been able to measure the time scale of these small molecules . "

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. stocks slumped on Wednesday , leading the market to its worst quarter since December 2008 , as economic concerns continued to pile on .
A disappointing private - sector jobs report offset more upbeat manufacturing data ahead of Friday 's monthly employment report .
" The economy is still in a tenuous state at best , " said Bob Enck , president and CEO at Equinox Fund Management .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , +1.19 % fell 96.28 points , or 1 % , to 9,774.02 on Wednesday .
The S&P 500 Index SPX , +0.82 % fell 10.53 points , or 1 % , to 1,030.71 , while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , +0.74 % fell 25.94 points , or 1.2 % , to 2,109.24 .
For June , the Dow industrials fell 3.6 % , the S&P 500 fell 5.4 % and the Nasdaq dropped 6.6 % .
For the second quarter , the Dow lost 10 % , marking its first drop after four straight quarters of growth .
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell 12 % each during the quarter , with the two indexes posting their worst quarter since December 2008 .
While corporate results have largely exceeded expectations , worries have mounted about the U.S. economic recovery , which has been hindered by a persistently high unemployment rate and a troubled housing market .
In recent weeks , Europe 's ability to deal with its debt crisis and worries about a possible economic slowdown in China have plagued Wall Street .
On Wednesday , manufacturer 3M Co. MMM , +0.23 % was the only gainer on the Dow , up 0.6 % .
Alcoa Inc. AA , - 0.34 % was the Dow 's greatest laggard , off 2.7 % .
For every stock on the decline nearly two were rising on the New York Stock Exchange , where more than 1.4 billion shares traded .
Data points
The Institute for Supply Management said manufacturing activity in the Chicago region slipped a bit in June , but remained at relatively high levels that still indicate overall expansion .
" Manufacturing remains the bright spot in the spotty economic recovery , " noted Peter Boockvar , equity strategist at Miller Tabak , in an email .
A separate report Wednesday showed that companies added far fewer employees than anticipated in June after a revised 57,000 hike the month before .

" Lame is the first word that comes to mind as it compares to expectations of 60,000 , " wrote Boockvar , who noted , " We are in the midst of a third straight jobless recovery . "
The ADP report rankled sentiment ahead of Friday 's monthly jobs report from the Labor Department .
Signaling European banks might be in better fiscal shape than thought , the European Central Bank said Wednesday that it would loan financial institutions 131.9 billion euros , or $ 161.5 billion , for three months .
Demand for the ECB cash proved less than expected , fueling optimism ahead of Thursday 's deadline for banks to repay 442 billion euros in 12 - month funds to the ECB .
Curbing enthusiasm some , Moody 's Wednesday afternoon said it was putting Spain 's triple - A rating on review for a credit downgrade .
The ratings agency was again " late to the party , " remarked Boockvar , who noted S&P downgraded Spain from triple - A to AA - plus in January 2009 and then to double - A in April 2010 .
Test Tone DJ mixes .
On Friday , October 19th 2012 , I played a 5 hour set at RISE in Boston .
Thanks to the efforts of one Matt Feato , all 4 hours , 59 minutes and 42 seconds of it were recorded and are available for listing on Mixcloud as well in V0 mp3 .
I 've got got a 1.45 GB FLAC version for the truly insane .
Anyone who wants that will have to contact me directly .
The Mixcloud link includes the entire track listing .
Saturnine .
I 've been a DJ since about 1996 , but in that time , I have released exactly zero mixes .
I 've been working on one , off and on ( mostly off ) since I first started doing lights in some of the local nightclubs in the spring of 2004 .
It has evolved considerably during that time , but it also has n't diverted much from the original idea .
The theme here is dark , melancholic downtempo .
I made it a point to have the mix be ... musical enough that people who are not familiar with ( nor have any interest in ) DJ culture might be able to sit through it .
I 'm going to buck the trend and not post a tracklisting , but I will say this : there are two Portishead tracks , one from Vangelis and one from Ennio Morricone .
There 's also a remix of a Nancy Sinatra song that was done by a friend of mine .
This mix ate my life for entirely too long .
It is one giant deep thought , that I am sick of having .
I am proud of it , but I 'm glad to be done with it .

A WOMAN is facing charges of making a false complaint to police after claiming she was raped in Port Melbourne last month .
The 22 - year - old 's story prompted a man - hunt for the alleged offender and a significant police investigation , costing thousands of dollars in time and resources .
On May 28 , Victoria Police contacted the Sunday Herald Sun with the story in a bid to alert the public and appeal for help to find the alleged offender .
When contacted on Friday by the Sunday Herald Sun , the woman , who is receiving counselling , said she was sorry for lying .
" I have n't meant to upset anyone , " she said .
The woman claimed she was still the victim of a sexual assault , which occurred " somewhere else " .
Police from the Moorabbin sexual offences unit said the woman had made " full admissions " on Thursday night that she had lied to police .
Detective Sgt Paul Toogood said a brief of evidence was being compiled to determine whether the woman would be charged with making a false report .
Sgt Toogood said the Port Melbourne community needed to be informed the rapist did not exist .
" The offence reported on that date did not occur .
There is no reason for the people of Port Melbourne to be apprehensive going about their business , " he said .
The woman claimed she had been grabbed by the throat from behind and dragged into an alcove on the St Joseph's Church grounds on Rouse St , where she was raped between 8 pm and 8.30 pm on May 25 .
Police said they hoped the false report would not discourage victims from coming forward for help .
Detective Sen-Constable Mark Feehan said : " Victoria Police encourages all victims of sexual assault to come forward so police can provide support , investigate and prosecute offenders . "
Centre Against Sexual Assault spokeswoman Carolyn Worth said false reports , while rare , were a " tricky issue " .
" It makes everybody slightly wary when there is a similar allegation , which we cannot afford , " she said .
" We 've spent a long time trying to get people to take sexual assault seriously . "
JERUSALEM —
Six years ago , when violence was the order of the day here , Elias Khoury ’s 20 - year - old son , George , was killed in a Palestinian terrorist attack .
The Khourys are Palestinian , so the murder of George — who was out for a jog and shot from behind by gunmen in a car — produced an apology .
Sorry , the killers said , we assumed the jogger was a Jew .
Mr. Khoury was not only disconsolate , he was appalled .
A prominent Jerusalem lawyer who often fights Israeli confiscations of land from Palestinians , he considered violence a toxin corroding his nation ’s core .
So in memory of George , a charismatic law student and musician , Mr. Khoury did something that shocked many in his community .
He paid for the translation into Arabic of the autobiography of Israel ’s most prominent author and dove , Amos Oz .
The Arabic version of the book , “ A Tale of Love and Darkness , ” went on sale late last month in Beirut , Lebanon , where it has received positive commentary — notably by Abdo Wazen , cultural editor of the pan -Arab newspaper Al Hayat — as well as some angry reaction .
The book is due to be distributed more widely in the region in the coming weeks .
( The following commentary includes material obtained by the National Association of Chiefs of Police from the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's Behavioral Analysis Unit . )
Psychopathy is a personality disorder manifested in people who use a mixture of charm , manipulation , intimidation , and occasionally violence to control others , in order to satisfy their own selfish needs .
Although the concept of psychopathy has been known for centuries , the FBI leads the world in the research effort to develop a series of assessment tools , to evaluate the personality traits and behaviors attributable to psychopaths .
Interpersonal traits include glibness , superficial charm , a grandiose sense of self - worth , pathological lying , and the manipulation of others .
The affective traits include a lack of remorse and / or guilt , shallow affect , a lack of empathy , and failure to accept responsibility .
The lifestyle behaviors include stimulation - seeking behavior , impulsivity , irresponsibility , parasitic orientation , and a lack of realistic life goals .
Research has demonstrated that in those criminals who are psychopathic , scores vary , ranging from a high degree of psychopathy to some measure of psychopathy .
However , not all violent offenders are psychopaths and not all psychopaths are violent offenders .
If violent offenders are psychopathic , they are able to assault , rape , and murder without concern for legal , moral , or social consequences .
This allows them to do what they want , whenever they want .
Ironically , these same traits exist in men and women who are drawn to high - profile and powerful positions in society including political officeholders .
The relationship between psychopathy and serial killers is particularly interesting .
All psychopaths do not become serial murderers .
Rather , serial murderers may possess some or many of the traits consistent with psychopathy .
Psychopaths who commit serial murder do not value human life and are extremely callous in their interactions with their victims .
This is particularly evident in sexually motivated serial killers who repeatedly target , stalk , assault , and kill without a sense of remorse .
However , psychopathy alone does not explain the motivations of a serial killer .
What does n't go unnoticed is the fact that some of the character traits exhibited by serial killers or criminals may be observed in many within the political arena .
While not exhibiting physical violence , many political leaders display varying degrees of anger , feigned outrage and other behaviors .
They also lack what most consider a " shame " mechanism .
Quite simply , most serial killers and many professional politicians must mimic what they believe , are appropriate responses to situations they face such as sadness , empathy , sympathy , and other human responses to outside stimuli .
Understanding psychopathy becomes particularly critical to law enforcement during a serial murder investigation and upon the arrest of a psychopathic serial killer .
The crime scene behavior of psychopaths is likely to be distinct from other offenders .
This distinct behavior can assist law enforcement in linking serial cases .
Psychopaths are not sensitive to altruistic interview themes , such as sympathy for their victims or remorse / guilt over their crimes .
They do possess certain personality traits that can be exploited , particularly their inherent narcissism , selfishness , and vanity .
Specific themes in past successful interviews of psychopathic serial killers focused on praising their intelligence , cleverness , and skill in evading capture .
Experts recognize that more research is needed concerning the links between serial murder and psychopathy , in order to understand the frequency and degree of psychopathy among serial murderers .
This may assist law enforcement in understanding and identifying serial murderers .
Over the past twenty years , law enforcement and experts from a number of varying disciplines have attempted to identify specific motivations for serial murderers and to apply those motivations to different typologies developed for classifying serial murderers .
These range from simple , definitive models to complex , multiple - category typologies that are laden with inclusion requirements .
Most typologies are too cumbersome to be utilized by law enforcement during an active serial murder investigation , and they may not be helpful in identifying an offender .
As most homicides are committed by someone known to the victim , police focus on the relationships closest to the victim .
This is a successful strategy for most murder investigations .
The majority of serial murderers , however , are not acquainted with or involved in a consensual relationship with their victims .
For the most part , serial murder involves strangers with no visible relationship between the offender and the victim .
This distinguishes a serial murder investigation as a more nebulous undertaking than that of other crimes .
Since the investigations generally lack an obvious connection between the offender and the victim , investigators instead attempt to discern the motivations behind the murders , as a way to narrow their investigative focus .
Serial murder crime scenes can have bizarre features that may cloud the identification of a motive .
The behavior of a serial murderer at crime scenes may evolve throughout the series of crimes and manifest different interactions between an offender and a victim .
It is also extremely difficult to identify a single motivation when there is more than one offender involved in the series .
Identifying a homicide series is easier in rapidly - developing , high profile cases involving low risk victims .
These cases are reported to law enforcement upon discovery of the crimes and draw immediate media attention .
In contrast , identifying a series involving high risk victims in multiple jurisdictions is much more difficult .
This is primarily due to the high risk lifestyle and transitory nature of the victims .
Additionally , the lack of communication between law enforcement agencies and differing records management systems impede the linkage of cases to a common offender .
While many political leaders will deny the assessment regarding their similarities with serial killers and other career criminals , it is part of a psychopathic profile that may be used in assessing the behaviors of many officials and lawmakers at all levels of government .

IRA victims killed with Libyan semtex to get £ 2bn in compensation from Colonel Gaddafi
Compensation : Colonel Gaddafi will pay £ 2bn to IRA victims killed with bombs made of semtex
Colonel Gaddafi is to pay as much as £ 2 billion in compensation for IRA terrorism carried out with explosives supplied by Libya , it emerged today .
The agreement follows nine months of talks in Tripoli involving representatives of families and British officials .
It will deliver payments to the families of victims killed in a series of republican bombings using Semtex shipped from Libya in the 1980s .
Among attacks carried out with the imported plastic explosive were the Harrods bombing of 1983 , which killed six amid Christmas shopping crowds , and the Enniskillen atrocity of 1987 that left 11 dead during a Remembrance Day service .
It was also used by the Real IRA splinter group in the Omagh bombing in August 1998 , killing 29 and injuring 220 .
And Libyan semtex was employed in the 1989 Lockerbie airline bombing that left 270 dead .
Libya has already paid £ 5 million to each of the families of victims aboard Pan Am Flight 103 .
Gordon Brown set up a Foreign Office unit in Tripoli last September - less than three weeks after Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al - Megrahi was freed from jail in Scotland - to help lawyers working for families secure compensation .
The cash for families is expected to go alongside a trade deal which will seal Libya 's reconciliation with Britain and open the door for British companies to make high profits from Libyan oil and other assets .
Around £ 800 million of the compensation is likely to go to 147 families who have been pressing Libya to acknowledge its role .
However , Colonel Gaddafi is not expected to accept liability for specific bombings and so other victims are likely to be able to claim .
The Foreign Office said today : ' The Government is sympathetic to the suffering of the victims and their legitimate attempts to seek redress .
' We believe success is best achieved by direct contacts , which we have helped establish , between the campaign and the Libyan authorities . '
A spokesman added : ' With Government support the Campaign has been able to make initial contacts , develop relations and enter into exploratory discussions with the Libyan authorities .
The campaign is a private one and it would be inappropriate to elaborate on what remain sensitive and confidential discussions . '

GENEVA ( Reuters ) -
The euro zone is facing a period of zero growth if not recession , and the United States is heading for financial trouble , U.S. economist Nouriel Roubini was quoted as saying on Saturday .
Nouriel Roubini , Professor of Economics at New York University and Chairman of Roubini Global Economics speaks at the opening session " Rebalancing the Global Economy " at the Global Financial Forum in New York April 26 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Mike Segar
There was a risk of renewed recession in Europe , Roubini said in an interview with Swiss daily Tages - Anzeiger .
“ There is that risk , at least for the euro zone .
Growth will fall toward zero .
Even if that is perhaps not a real recession , it will feel like one .
Greece was just the tip of the iceberg , ” he said .
“ And the Americans too will run into the wall at some point if the carry on the way they are , ” he said in the interview published in German .
Roubini , known as Dr. Doom and best known for predicting the U.S. housing crisis , said there was a risk of a second financial crisis , with countries becoming insolvent and being forced out of the euro , and banks collapsing .
Countries such as Spain and Greece were now under pressure to cut spending and raise taxes to retain access to the capital markets , even though they had no growth to speak of .
If governments implement austerity measures too soon they risk snuffing out demand and recovery , but delays could provoke a catastrophe with high interest burdens and inflation .
“ You ’re damned if you save and you ’re damned if you do n’t , ” he said .
Roubini said it was “ possible to square this circle ” if governments committed to a credible medium - term plan to restore their budgets .
But such policies , which carry the risk of a deflationary recession , must be compensated for with a loose pan-European monetary policy to stimulate demand .
Any resulting further decline in the euro would make European exports more competitive and allow Germany to raise wages and purchasing power at home to stimulate exports from other euro zone countries , he said .
Roubini said that a Japanese - style period of deflation , stagnation and high unemployment was a much greater risk to Europe for the next two or three years than inflation .
Image caption Mr Coke is the alleged leader of the infamous Shower Posse
To his supporters , Jamaican Christopher Coke is a public - spirited businessman .
But to many officials , he is a drug lord whose activities span the Caribbean , North America and the UK .
The US justice department placed the leader of the notorious Shower Posse gang on its " world 's most dangerous " list , while Jamaica 's former national security minister , Peter Philips , recently described him as probably the most powerful man in the country .
Mr Coke was arrested in June 2010 while on his way to surrender to the US embassy in Kingston , weeks after his supporters engaged in a bloody battle with the security forces to halt his extradition for trial in New York .
In August 2009 , US authorities charged him with organising deals of marijuana and crack cocaine , and funnelling the profits along with weapons back to Jamaica .
He has admitted at a New York federal court charges of racketeering and conspiracy to commit assault with a dangerous weapon .
The extradition request greatly strained relations between the US and Jamaica , which initially fought the move , arguing that it was based on flawed evidence .
It also exposed the links between Jamaican politicians and gang leaders .
Bloody history
Mr Coke 's life has been racked by violence .
Two of his brothers and a sister have been shot dead .
His father Lester , also known as Jim Brown , was the leader of the Shower Posse , which derives its name from " showering " communities with bullets and was blamed for more than 1,000 murders during the 1980s .
Nobody has heard of him being involved in any criminal activity Tom Tavares - Finson , Former lawyer for Christopher Coke
He died in 1992 in a mysterious fire in his prison cell , while awaiting extradition to the US on drugs and murder charges .
It also occurred on the same day as the funeral of Mark Coke , Dudus ' brother .
According to the US authorities , Mr Coke stepped into his father 's shoes , running the Shower Posse and developing extensive business interests , including an entertainment company and a construction company .
Until last year he enjoyed substantial protection from the ruling Jamaican Labour Party and Prime Minister Bruce Golding , whose parliamentary constituency is Tivoli Gardens , a West Kingston district that the Shower Posse controls .
In an interview in December 2009 , Tom Tavares - Finson - his lawyer until recently , and a Jamaican senator - said his client was a legitimate businessman , not a gang leader .
Image caption Mr Coke has many supporters in his West Kingston stronghold
" Nobody has heard of him being involved in any criminal activity , " he told the Jamaica Observer .
Mr Tavares - Finson described his former client as " just an ordinary Jamaican going about his everyday business … trying to improve the lot of his children , his family and his community , with a recognition that he has an influence , and he takes his influence very seriously , and that influence is what is propelling the transformation of western Kingston " .
He said people were turning his client into " a mythical character " .
" That is not his doing .
Left to his own devices , he would not be on the front page of any newspaper , " he added .
According to Jamaican media , Mr Coke is more like a " godfather " to Kingston residents - a benefactor providing the means for food and schooling .
Loyal residents have been taking to the streets in their hundreds to voice their support for the man they call the " president " , " general " , " shortman " , or most commonly " Dudus " .
" Jesus died for us so we will die for Dudus , " read one placard .
State of emergency
When the Jamaican government bowed to heavy US pressure and announced in May 2010 that it would extradite Mr Coke , the Shower Posse and his supporters attacked police stations in Tivoli Gardens .

The assault prompted the declaration of a state of emergency in Kingston and the biggest mobilisation of the security forces in Jamaican history .
Hundreds of soldiers were deployed to help the capital 's police force sweep through Tivoli Gardens and surrounding areas in search of Mr Coke .
The troops fought pitched battles for several days with heavily - armed gunmen , who barricaded the streets .
Thousands of people were trapped in the area and the clashes resulted in the deaths of more than 70 people .
Despite the assault , Mr Coke was able to escape and went on the run .
He was eventually arrested nearly four weeks later by policemen " acting on intelligence " at a vehicle checkpoint on the outskirts of Kingston .
He is scheduled to be sentenced on 8 December , when he could face up to 23 years in prison .

The Wise Men and The Bomb
In his resignation speech as director of Los Alamos National Laboratory in October , 1945 , after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the physicist Robert Oppenheimer expressed doubts about a world living in the shadow of the bomb .
The scene is nicely described in the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin .
As thousands listened , Oppenheimer , speaking in a low , quiet voice , said he hoped in the years ahead everyone would take pride in their wartime accomplishments .
Then he declared :
" Today that pride must be tempered with a profound concern .
If atomic bombs are to be added as new weapons to the arsenal of a warring world , or to the arsenals of nations preparing for war , then the time will come when mankind will curse the names of Los Alamos and Hiroshima . "
After the war , Oppenheimer , who led the team that built and tested the first atomic bomb , warned of a nuclear arms race , the impossibility of defense against the bomb in war , and the need for international control of the atom .
His concerns , and those of fellow scientists , were shared in a slim but potent volume which became a bestseller in 1946 , One World or None : A Report to the Public on the Full Meaning of the Atomic Bomb , republished in 2007 .
There ’s something about the bomb , something so mighty and mysterious , that many who have known of its immense destructive power and worked to restrain it have come away profoundly affected by the experience .
At the dawn of the atomic age , it was the Oppenheimer generation of physicists .
In his introduction to the new edition of One World or None , the nuclear historian Richard Rhodes asks the question of why the scientists grasped so well the " radically new nuclear future " when others did not .
The answer : " The scientists had done the numbers . "
They understood that the energy released in the fission of one uranium atom was on the order of 200 million electron volts .
In contrast , ordinary chemical burning - the process in fire , for example - releases about one electron volt per atom .
The physicists realized this huge difference in scale could forever change the nature of nations and war .
Many others came to share their fears .
At a time of deep tensions with Moscow in 1983 , Ronald Reagan watched a made - for - television movie , The Day After , while at Camp David .
In his diary , Reagan wrote of the film : " It has Lawrence , Kansas wiped out in a nuclear war with Russia .
It is powerfully done … very effective & left me greatly depressed … "
At the end of the Cold War , Gen. George Lee Butler , who retired in 1994 as commander of U.S. nuclear forces , called for abolition of nuclear weapons .
In a speech at the National Press Club in 1996 , Butler said , " We ’re not condemned to repeat the lessons of 40 years at the nuclear brink . "
He added : " Standing down nuclear arsenals requires only a fraction of the ingenuity and resources as were devoted to their creation . "
Now come four prominent wise men of the American defense and foreign policy establishment with a new film , Nuclear Tipping Point , warning about the still - present threat of nuclear weapons and the fissile materials that go into them .
They are George Shultz and Henry Kissinger , former secretaries of state , William Perry , former secretary of defense , and Sam Nunn , the Georgia Democrat who served 24 years in the Senate and was chairman of the Armed Services Committee .
The film is narrated by actor Michael Douglas , written and directed by Ben Goddard , and was produced by the Nuclear Security Project .
The project is coordinated by the Nuclear Threat Initiative based in Washington , a group working to reduce the risks of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , in cooperation with Stanford University ’s Hoover Institution .
NTI is co-chaired by Nunn and Ted Turner , the CNN founder turned philanthroper - activist .
This is an advocacy film , intended to galvanize the public .
Perhaps with that in mind , it presents the threat more in terms of nuclear terrorism than proliferation of weapons to states like Iran and North Korea .
The four men share Barack Obama ’s vision for a world without nukes , but , like the president , they see it as a long way off .
Their detailed recommendations , which they have spelled out in a series of op - eds in the Wall Street Journal , include deeper reductions in arsenals of all nuclear states , taking some missiles off launch - ready alert , eliminating the short - range or tactical nuclear weapons , and locking up stocks of nuclear materials .
Their message , as Nunn puts it in the film , is that " if you view the goal of getting to zero as the top of the mountain in terms of nuclear weapons , then we ca n’t even see the top of the mountain today .
We ’re heading down .
We ’re not heading up .
It ’s going to take a long time to see the top of the mountain .
But I think we have an obligation to our children and to our grandchildren to build paths up the mountain , to get other people to go up the mountain with us … "
In an effort to connect with viewers , the film is sprinkled with stock footage of bombs exploding , rockets being launched , missiles on parade , and a scene that looks like terrorists stealing nuclear materials .
But the most effective part of the film , and its purpose , are a series of simple interviews against a black backdrop in front of the camera with the four men , all deeply involved in nuclear - weapons policy and arms control .
Shultz was at Reagan ’s side during the Reykjavik summit , where Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev came close to agreement on eliminating nuclear weapons altogether .
Perry was under secretary of defense under Jimmy Carter , and defense secretary for Bill Clinton .
In the Senate , Nunn pushed to reduce the risks of accidental nuclear war , and later authored legislation to secure nuclear weapons and materials after the Soviet collapse .
Now , like Oppenheimer , they want us to wake up to new risks and dangers .
Is this a case of remorse , like Robert McNamara on Vietnam ?
Not really .
These are cold warriors reminding us that circumstances have changed , and the war is over .
The Soviet Union is gone .
They do n’t address the wisdom of the superpower arms race , nor re-examine their own roles and decisions .
They simply argue it is time to get on with cleaning up the legacy .
Consider Kissinger .
For many years he was concerned with how a nuclear war would be fought .
He authored a book in 1957 , Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy , at a time Americans were worried about falling behind the Soviets .
Sputnik was launched that October .
In the book , Kissinger outlined possible strategies for national security in the atomic era .
He saw a world in which there would not be a single massive nuclear retaliatory strike , as was the doctrine of the Eisenhower years , but rather local wars , in which nuclear weapons might be used .
" War between nuclear powers , " Kissinger wrote at the time , " has to be planned on the assumption that it is likely to be a nuclear war .
Nuclear war should be fought as something less than an all - out war .
Limited nuclear war represents our most effective strategy against nuclear powers or against a major power which is capable of substituting manpower for technology . "
He added , " Such a strategy is not simple or easy to contemplate . "
Kissinger went on to help Nixon build détente and sign the first major treaties to restrain nuclear weapons with the Soviets .
Behind the scenes , in keeping with his earlier work , Kissinger also pushed for procedures and plans that would give the president more flexible options for limited nuclear strikes in the event of a conflict .
In the film , Kissinger talks not of waging nuclear war , but of the consequences .
" I have been writing about nuclear weapons for over 50 years now .
I tried to apply traditional diplomatic principles to a world with nuclear weapons and I found it almost imp — I would say impossible to do .
So the consequences have to be looked at on two levels .
One is , technically , what happens if , say , a 20 - kiloton weapon hits downtown New York ?
And that ’s a very small weapon .
Most of the hospitals , most of the medical facilities , most of the power , most of the bridges , most of the communications would be gone . "
" There ’s a second level , namely , what do people think happened that permitted such casualties to occur , and what will they demand of their government , they will probably say , globally , if this ca n’t be prevented , what ’s the use of any government ? "
In the film , Nunn returns to a topic that has concerned him for years — the danger of accidental launch or miscalculation .
At the peak of the Cold War , a president would have only minutes to decide on a course of action after receiving a warning of a nuclear attack .
In the 1980s , Nunn and John Warner , the outgoing Virginia Republican senator , proposed creating risk - reduction centers in the United States and Soviet Union to share information in a crisis .
In 1987 , the United States and the Soviet Union signed an agreement establishing Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers in Washington and Moscow .
Nunn and Warner had also suggested a more ambitious effort , but it was not adopted .
In his recently - published Nuclear Posture Review , setting down nuclear weapons policy for the next five to 10 years , Obama decided not to take intercontinental ballistic missiles off alert .
But in the film , Nunn makes a strong appeal for doing so , giving a president more time to make a decision and avoid a mistake .
The land - based missiles are generally on four - minute alert and submarines 12 minutes .
" Now , people would assume that cannot be , the Cold War is over , " Nunn says in the film .
" Are we still in that posture ?
The answer is , we are .
The number of weapons on quick launch on both sides is something to me that is absolutely ridiculous , bordering on insanity …
And if we have , let ’s say , four , five minutes ’ warning now , we ought to double it , and once we get to 10 minutes , we ought to go to 20 , and then to 40 , and then to 60 , and then to hours , and then days , and nuclear weapons become less relevant . "
Nunn adds , " It ’s awful hard to cooperate in the true sense of the word , to be partners in the true sense of the word , it ’s hard to do that when you ’re still pointing thousands of weapons at each other with very little warning time and when both sides fear a first strike from the other .
Those things simply do n’t go together .
So we ’ve got to change the psychology .
We ’ve got to back off some of the concepts we had during the Cold War .
We ’ve got to understand that the threat has changed . "
These are the words of men who lived with the Cold War that began in Oppenheimer ’s day .
Today , they are all in the twilight of their careers , no longer in public office .
Surely they will have more to say , someday , about the events they witnessed , and their own choices .
For now , they are sober and realistic in talking about the future , and we ought to listen to them carefully .

BP processes about 1.5 million barrels of crude oil per day , across six refineries in the United States .
In total , 150 refineries in the United States process just under 18 million barrels per day , so BP processes about 8.5 percent of it .
However , as reported by the Center for Public Integrity , 97 percent of the most dangerous violations found by OSHA were on BP properties .
There are several levels of citations .
The most dangerous are egregious willful and willful , in that order .
Egregious citations are flagrant violations and willful citations are intentional disregard for employee safety and health .
Between June 2007 and February 2010 , there were 761 egregious citations issued in total .
All but one of them were issued to BP .
In the same time period , 69 of the 91 willful citations also belonged to BP .
Most citations for other companies were in the serious category , meaning there was “ substantial probability ” of death or serious injury .
There were 1,521 serious citations issued to non-BP refineries , versus BP ’s thirty .
However , if we take into account barrels of oil processed by the rest , we get an even worse image of BP .
Really , it ’s bad no matter how you look at it :

You know that something strange is happening when the usual crew of neocon critics takes out after Turkey -- yes , Turkey ! -- a country that , as Inter Press Service ’s Jim Lobe points out , they long cultivated and supported as a key ally and supposedly model democracy in the Islamic world .
Of course , that was then .
Now , Turkey ’s involvement in a nuclear deal with Tehran and its prime minister ’s outrage over the Israeli attack on a convoy bringing aid to Gaza that resulted in the deaths of nine Turks has soured them considerably on the country .
In fact , the strength of the Turkish reaction -- essentially a breach with Israel , once a close ally -- sent the Obama administration scrambling awkwardly for a way to mollify the Turks without condemning the Israeli attack .
And do n’t think it ’s just the usual suspects on the right blaming Turkey either .
The Washington Post editorial page denounced its government for “ grotesque demagoguery toward Israel that ought to be unacceptable for a member of NATO , ” while the Christian Science Monitor typically declared it “ over the top , ” raised the specter of “ anti-Semitism , ” and swore that its leaders now ran “ the risk of further undermining Turkey ’s credibility and goal of being a regional problem solver . ”
In a news story , the New York Times offered a classic statement of the problem from Washington ’s perspective : “ Turkey is seen increasingly in Washington as ' running around the region doing things that are at cross-purposes to what the big powers in the region want , ' said Steven A. Cook , a scholar with the Council on Foreign Relations .
The question being asked , he said , is ' How do we keep the Turks in their lane ? ' ”
And which lane might that be , one wonders ?
It looks ever more like the passing lane on the main highway through the Middle East .
Talk about a country whose importance has crept up on us .
It 's a country that , as John Feffer , co-director of the invaluable Foreign Policy in Focus website and TomDispatch regular , indicates , has been in that passing lane for some time now ( whatever Washington may think ) , whether in its relations with Iran , Russia , or Iraq , among other countries .
And what surprising relations they turn out to be .
If one thing is clear , it ’s that , as American power wanes , the global stage is indeed being cleared for new kinds of politics and new combinations of every sort .
The future holds surprises and , as Feffer makes clear , it will be surprising indeed if Turkey is n’t one of them .
Tom
The future is no longer in plastics , as the businessman in the 1967 film The Graduate insisted .
Rather , the future is in China .
If a multinational corporation does n’t shoehorn China into its business plan , it courts the ridicule of its peers and the outrage of its shareholders .
The language of choice for ambitious undergraduates is Mandarin .
Apocalyptic futurologists are fixated on an eventual global war between China and the United States .
China even occupies valuable real estate in the imaginations of our fabulists .
Much of the action of Neal Stephenson ’s novel The Diamond Age , for example , takes place in a future neo-Confucian China , while the crew members of the space ship on the cult TV show Firefly mix Chinese curse words into their dialogue .
Why does n’t Turkey have a comparable grip on American visions of the future ?
Characters in science fiction novels do n’t speak Turkish .
Turkish - language programs are as scarce as hen ’s teeth on college campuses .
Turkey does n’t even qualify as part of everyone ’s favorite group of up - and - comers , that swinging BRIC quartet of Brazil , Russia , India , and China .
Turkey remains stubbornly fixed in Western culture as a backward - looking land of doner kebabs , bazaars , and guest workers .
But take population out of the equation -- an admittedly big variable -- and Turkey promptly becomes a likely candidate for future superpower .
It possesses the 17th top economy in the world and , according to Goldman Sachs , has a good shot at breaking into the top 10 by 2050 .
Its economic muscle is also well defended : after decades of NATO assistance , the Turkish military is now a regional powerhouse .
Perhaps most importantly , Turkey occupies a vital crossroads between Europe , the Middle East , and Central Asia .
A predominantly Muslim democracy atop the ruins of Byzantium , it bridges the Islamic and Judeo - Christian traditions , even as it sits perched at the nexus of energy politics .
All roads once led to Rome ; today all pipelines seem to lead to Turkey .
If superpower status followed the rules of real estate -- location , location , location -- then Turkey would already be near the top of the heap .
As a quintessential rising middle power , Turkey no longer hesitates to put itself in the middle of major controversies .
In the last month alone , Turkish mediation efforts nearly heralded a breakthrough in the Iran nuclear crisis , and Ankara supported the flotilla that recently tried to break Israel ’s blockade of Gaza .
With these and other less high - profile interventions , Turkey has stepped out of the shadows and now threatens to settle into the prominent place on the world stage once held by its predecessor .
In the seventeenth century , the Ottoman Empire was a force to be reckoned with , spreading through the Balkans to the gates of Vienna before devolving over the next 200 years into “ the sick man of Europe . ”
Today , a dynamic neo-Ottoman spirit animates Turkey .
Once rigidly secular , it has begun to fashion a moderate Islamic democracy .
Once dominated by the military , it is in the process of containing the army within the rule of law .
Once intolerant of ethnic diversity , it has begun to reexamine what it means to be Turkish .
Once a sleepy economy , it is becoming a nation of Islamic Calvinists .
Most critically of all , it is fashioning a new foreign policy .
Having broken with its more than half - century - long subservience to the United States , it is now carving out a geopolitical role all its own .
The rise of Turkey has by no means been smooth .
Secular Turks have been uncomfortable with recent more assertive expressions of Muslim identity , particularly when backed by state power .
The country ’s Kurds are still second - class citizens , and although the military has lost some of its teeth , it still has a bite to go along with its bark .
Nonetheless , Turkey is remaking the politics of the Middle East and challenging Washington ’s traditional notion of itself as the mediator of last resort in the region .
In the twenty - first century , the Turkish model of transitioning out of authoritarian rule while focusing on economic growth and conservative social values has considerable appeal to countries in the developing world .
This “ Ankara consensus ” could someday compete favorably with Beijing ’s and Washington ’s versions of political and economic development .
The Turkish model has , however , also spurred right - wing charges that a new Islamic fundamentalist threat is emerging on the edges of Europe .
Neocon pundit Liz Cheney has even created a new version of George W. Bush ’s “ axis of evil ” in which Turkey , Iran , and Syria have become the dark trinity .
These are all signs that Turkey has indeed begun to wake from its centuries - long slumber .
And when Turkey wakes , as Napoleon said of China , the world will shake .
Out of Ottomanism
Constantinople was once an Orientalist ’s dream .
In his otherwise perceptive 1877 guide to the city , the Italian author Edmondo de Amicis typically wrote that old Istanbul “ is not a city ; she neither labors , nor thinks , nor creates ; civilization beats at her gates and assaults her in her streets , but she dreams and slumbers on in the shadow of her mosques , and takes no heed . ”
Turkey ’s first wake - up call came from Kemal Ataturk , the modernizing military officer from Salonika who created a new country out of the unpromising materials left behind by the collapsed Ottoman Empire .
Decisively ending the caliphate in 1924 , Ataturk patterned his new secular state on the French model : strong central power , a modern army , and a strict division between public and private spheres .
This was no easy process : Ataturk brought Turkey kicking and screaming into the twentieth century .
In many ways , that kicking and screaming continued throughout the rest of that century .
The Turkish military never quite got used to civilian rule .
It ’s seized power four times since 1960 .
In the 1980s and 1990s , Turkish security forces killed thousands of its own citizens in a dirty war against the Kurds and the Turkish left , and subjected many more to beatings , torture , and imprisonment .
The country ’s leadership maintained a garrison mentality based on a fear that outsiders , aided by a fifth column , were bent on dismembering the country ( as outside powers had indeed attempted to do in 1920 with the Treaty of Sèvres ) .
In the 1980s , however , economic globalization began to eat away at this garrison mentality as then - President Turgut Ozal attempted to reconnect Turkey to the world through export - oriented reforms and a policy of building economic bridges rather than erecting suspicious walls .
During the eight - year Iran - Iraq War , for instance , Turkey refused to choose sides , remaining a friend to both countries .
In the process , Istanbul was transformed .
It became the center of a laboring , thinking , and creating class that faced both westward toward Europe and the United States and eastward toward the Middle East and Central Asia .
Even Central Anatolia and its key city , Kayseri , once considered a Turkish backwater , was emerging as a vital center of manufacturing .
“ While Anatolia remains a socially conservative and religious society , it is also undergoing what some have called a ‘ Silent Islamic Reformation , ’ ” went the European Stability Initiative ’s influential 2005 report on Turkey ’s new Islamic Calvinists .
“ Many of Kayseri ’s business leaders even attribute their economic success to their ‘ protestant work ethic . ’ ”
By the 1990s , the “ star of Islam ” -- as The Economist dubbed Turkey -- had gone about as far as it could within the confines of the existing Ataturk model .
In 1997 , the military once again swatted aside the civilian leadership in a “ stealth coup , ” and the country seemed to be slipping back into aggressive paranoia .
The Kurdish war flared ; tensions with Russia over Chechnya rose ; a war of words broke out with Greece over maritime territorial disputes .
And Turkey nearly went to war with Syria for harboring the Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan .
But that stealth coup proved a last gasp attempt to place the uncontainable new political and economic developments in Turkish society under tighter controls .
Soon enough , the military gave way again and the Islam - influenced Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) came to power in 2002 , only enlarging its political base after the 2007 elections .
Zero Problems ?
Throughout the twentieth century , geography had proved a liability for Turkey .
It found itself beset on all sides by former Ottoman lands which held grudges against the successor state .
The magic trick the AKP performed was to transform this liability into an asset .
Turkey in the twenty - first century turned on the charm .
Like China , it discovered the advantages of soft power and the inescapable virtues of a “ soft rise ” during an era of American military and economic dominance .
Led by Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu , a former academic who provided a blueprint for the country ’s new good - neighbor policy in his 2001 book Strategic Depth , Turkey pledged “ zero problems with neighbors . ”
In foreign policy terminology , Davutoglu proposed the carving out of a Turkish sphere of influence via canny balance - of - power politics .
Like China , it promised not to interfere in the domestic affairs of its partners .
It also made a major effort to repair relations with those near at hand and struck new friendships with those far away .
Indeed , like Beijing , Ankara has global aspirations .
Perhaps the most dramatic reversal in Turkish policy involves the Kurdish region of Iraq .
The détente orchestrated by the AKP could be compared to President Richard Nixon ’s startling policy of rapprochement with China in the 1970s , which rapidly turned an enemy into something like an ally .
In March , Turkey sent its first diplomat to Arbil , the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan , to staff a new consulate there .
Today , as journalist Jonathan Head has written , “ 70 % of investment and 80 % of the products sold in the Kurdish region [ of Iraq ] are Turkish . ”
Realizing that when U.S. troops leave Iraq , its Kurdish regions are bound to feel vulnerable and thus open to economic and political influence , Ankara established a “ strategic cooperation council ” to sort things out with the Iraqis in 2009 , and this has served as a model for similar arrangements with Syria , Bulgaria , Greece , and Russia .
Détente with Iraqi Kurdistan has gone hand in hand with a relaxation of tensions between Ankara and its own Kurdish population with which it had been warring for decades .
Until the early 1990s , the Turkish government pretended that the Kurdish language did n’t exist .
Now , there is a new 24 - hour Kurdish - language national TV station , and new faculty at Mardin Artuklu University will teach Kurdish .
The government began to accept returning Kurdish refugees from northern Iraq , as well as a handful of Kurdish guerrillas from the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party ( PKK ) .
This has n’t been an easy sell for Turkish nationalists .
In December , a Turkish court banned the main Kurdish political party , and this spring the military launched repeated attacks against PKK targets inside Iraq .
But the AKP is continuing to push reforms , including proposed changes in the country ’s constitution that would allow military commanders for the first time to be tried in civilian court for any crimes they commit .
The elimination of this demonizing of “ internal enemies ” is crucial to the AKP ’s project , helping as it does to reduce the military ’s power in internal affairs .
Reining in the military is a top objective for party leaders who believe it will strengthen political stability , improve prospects for future integration into the European Union ( EU ) , and remove a powerful opponent to domestic reforms -- and to the party itself .
Only a little less startling than the government ’s gestures toward the Kurds has been its program to transform Turkish - Greek relations .
The two countries have long been at each other ’s throats , their conflict over the divided island of Cyprus being only the most visible of their disagreements .
The current Greek economic crisis , however , may prove a blessing in disguise when it comes to bilateral relations .
The Greek government -- its finances disastrous and economic pressure from the European Union mounting -- needs a way to make military budget reductions defensible .
In May , Turkish president Erdogan visited Greece and , while signing 21 agreements on migration , environment , culture , and the like , began to explore the previously inconceivable possibility of mutual military reductions .
" Both countries have huge defense expenses , ” Erdogan told Greek television , “ and they will achieve a lot of savings this way . "
If Turkey manages a rapprochement with Armenia , it will achieve a diplomatic trifecta .
The two countries disagree over the fate of the Nagorno - Karabakh enclave , which is also at the center of a dispute between Armenia and Turkish ally Azerbaijan .
Complicating this territorial issue is a long - standing historical controversy .
Armenia wants acknowledgement of the Ottoman Empire ’s 1915 extermination campaign that killed more than a million Armenians .
The Turkish government today disputes the numbers and refuses to recognize the killings as “ genocide . ”
Nevertheless , Turkey and Armenia began direct negotiations last year to reopen their border and establish diplomatic relations .
Although officially stalled , secret talks between the two are continuing .
Other diplomatic efforts are no less dramatic .
When Bashar Assad arrived in Ankara in 2004 , it was the first visit by a Syrian leader in 57 years .
Meanwhile , Turkey has cemented its relations with Russia , remains close to Iran , and has reconnected to the Balkans .
This charm offensive makes Chinese efforts in Asia look bumbling .
Mediation Central
A friend to all sides , Turkey is offering its services as a diplomatic middleman , even in places where it was persona non grata not long ago .
“ Not many people would imagine that the Serbians would ask for the mediation of Turkey between different Bosniak groups in the Sandjak region of Serbia , ” observes Sule Kut , a Balkans expert at Bilge University in Istanbul .
“ Turks were the bad guys in Serbian history .
So what is happening ?
Turkey has established itself as a credible and powerful player in the region . ”
It ’s not just the Balkans .
The new Turkey is establishing itself as Mediation Central .
Teaming up with Brazil , Turkey fashioned a surprise compromise meant to head off confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program ( which the Obama administration managed to shoot down ) .
Along with Spain , it initiated the Alliance of Civilizations , a U.N. effort to bridge the divide between Islam and the West .
It also tried to work its magic in negotiating an end to the blockade of Gaza , removing obstacles to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq , bringing Syria and Israel together , resolving the brouhaha around the cartoon depiction of Mohammed , and hosting U.N. meetings on Somalia .
“ Zero problems with neighbors ” is a great slogan .
But it ’s also a logical impossibility .
Turkey ca n’t embrace Hamas without angering Egypt and Israel .
It can move closer to Russia only at the potential expense of good relations with Georgia .
Rapprochement with Armenia angers Azerbaijan .
Nor was Ankara ’s attempt to transcend zero - sum thinking an easy task during the “ with us or against us ” years of the Bush administration .
In addition , there are the periodic tensions that arise around U.S. congressional resolutions on the Armenian genocide , still a touchy issue in Turkey .
Washington has indicated its growing unhappiness with Turkey ’s increasingly active role in the Middle East , particularly its overtures to Syria .
As a result , Turkey has had to finesse its relationship with the U.S. in order to remain a key NATO ally and a challenger to American power in the region .
As with China , the United States is willing to work with Turkey on some diplomatic issues even as it finds the country ’s growing influence in the region a problem .
In turn , Ankara , like Beijing , is trying to figure out how it can best take advantage of the relative decline in U.S. global influence even as it works closely with Washington on an issue - by - issue basis .
The greatest challenge to Turkey ’s zero - problems paradigm , however , is its ever more troubled relationship with Israel .
The U.S. - Turkey - Israel troika was once a solid verity of Middle Eastern politics .
A considerable amount of bilateral trade , including military deals , has linked Turkey and Israel , and that trade increased dramatically during the AKP era .
But Israel ’s 2008 invasion of Gaza -- and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s subsequent excoriation of then - Israeli president Shimon Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos -- began a process that is tearing these former allies apart , while boosting support for Turkey in the Arab world .
In October , Turkey cancelled Israel ’s participation in a military exercise , throwing lucrative military contracts between the two countries in jeopardy .
In the wake of the recent Gaza - aid debacle in international waters , the rift threatens to become irreparable .
When Israeli commandos seized a flotilla of ships attempting to break the Gaza embargo , killing nine Turkish citizens , Turkey spoke of severing diplomatic relations .
With Israel increasingly isolated and American mediation efforts seriously compromised , only Turkey is emerging stronger from what can now only be seen as the beginning of a regional realignment of power .
Once viewed with suspicion throughout the area where the Ottomans ruled , Turkey may now be the only power that has even a remote chance of one day brokering peace in the Middle East .
Return to Ottomanism ?
Neo-Ottomanism is not exactly a popular phrase in Turkey today .
The leadership in Ankara wants to be clear : they have no intention of projecting imperial power or reestablishing the modern equivalent of the Ottoman caliphate .
However , if you look at the friendships that Turkey has cultivated and the trade relations it has emphasized -- Syria , Armenia , Greece , Palestine , Iraq , Libya , the Balkans -- you can see a map of the old Ottoman empire reassembling itself .
In other words , just as the AKP has turned geography to its advantage , so it is transforming an imperial albatross into the goose that lays golden eggs ( in the form of lucrative trade deals ) .
In a similar way , China has tried to revive its old Sinocentric imperial system without stirring up fears of the Chinese army marching into India or the Chinese navy taking over the South China Sea , even as it -- like Turkey -- also establishes friendly relations with old adversaries ( including Russia ) .
Still , even this amiable version of neo-Ottomanism can raise hackles .
" We want a new Balkan region based on political values , economic interdependence , and cooperation and cultural harmony , ” Foreign Minister Davutoglu said nostalgically at a conference in Sarajevo in October .
“ That is what the Ottoman Balkans was like .
We shall revive such a Balkan region ...
The Ottoman centuries were a success story , and this should be revived . ”
A furor followed among some Serb commentators , who viewed this romanticized version of history as evidence of a Turkish desire to Islamicize the Balkans .
What Turkey means by its vision of Balkan harmony may prove critical in the context of European integration .
The Ottomans and Western Europe fought a succession of wars over control of the Balkans .
Today , the E.U. and Turkey compete for influence in the region , and much hangs on Turkey 's prospects for joining the 27 - member European organization .
Although Turkey began the process of meeting requirements for joining the Union , the talks stalled long ago .
In the meantime , some European leaders like French Prime Minister Nicholas Sarkozy have spoken out against Turkish membership , while the spread of Islamophobia throughout Europe has dimmed what enthusiasm may still exist for bringing Turkey on board .
In Turkey as well , public support for membership has declined from 70 % in 2002 to just over 50 % today .
In fact , Turkey ’s turn toward the Middle East , Central Asia , and North Africa has in part been a reaction to the fading of the E.U. option .
Fine , the Turks are saying , if you do n’t want us , we can play with others .
And play they have , particularly when it comes to the energy game .
If oil had been discovered in its territory just a little sooner , some form of the Ottoman Empire might have survived as the wealthiest energy player in history .
The riches of Iraq , Kuwait , and Libya all once fell within the territorial limits of its empire .
Today , Turkey lacks energy wealth , but has worked assiduously to ensure that a maximum number of oil and natural gas pipelines flow through the country .
Europe and the United States have funded a series of pipelines ( like the Nabucco pipeline from the Caspian Sea ) that use Turkish territory to bypass Russia and lessen Moscow ’s ability to blackmail Western Europe by threatening to withhold energy supplies .
Turkey has n’t stopped there , however .
It negotiated directly with Russia for another set of pipelines -- the South Stream , which goes from Russia to Bulgaria through Turkish territorial waters , and the Samsun - Ceyhan pipeline that would transport Russian and Kazakh oil from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean through Turkey .
Turkey now relies on Russia for 60 % of its energy imports and Iran for another 30 % .
In this sense , “ zero problems with neighbors ” could just as easily be understood as “ zero problems with energy suppliers . ”
Turkey is also a builder .
Of the top 225 international contractors , 35 are Turkish , second only to China .
Like China ,
Turkey asks no difficult questions about the political environment in other countries , and so Turkish construction companies are building airports in Kurdistan and shopping malls in Libya .
Despite political tensions , in 2009 they were even involved in nine projects worth more than $ 60 million in Israel .
Finally , there is culture .
Like the Confucian institutes China is establishing all over the world to spread its language , culture , and values , Turkey established the Yunus Emre Foundation in May 2009 to administer cultural centers in Germany , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Macedonia , Egypt , Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan , and Israel .
Turkish schools have sprung up in more than 80 countries .
Turkish culture has also infiltrated Middle Eastern life through television , as Turkish soap operas spread the liberal cultural values of moderate Islam .
“ The Turkish soaps have been daring and candid when it comes to gender equality , premarital sex , infidelity , passionate love , and even children born out of wedlock , ” writes journalist Nadia Bilbassy - Charters .
Beyond Ottomanism
Turkey ’s leaders may not themselves be comfortable with the neo-Ottoman label -- in part because their ambitions are actually much larger .
Their developing version of a peaceful , trade - oriented Pax Ottomanica takes in Turkey ’s improved relations with sub-Saharan Africa , Latin America , and the Asia - Pacific .
Turkey declared 2005 the “ year of Africa ” and accepted observer status in the African Union .
In 2010 , it has already opened eight embassies in African countries and plans to open another 11 next year .
At the pan-Islamic level -- and a Turk , Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu , now heads up the 57 - member Organization of the Islamic Conference , the leading international voice of Islamic states -- Turkish leaders think in terms of the ummah , the global Muslim community .
For some critics , Turkey ’s Islamic character and its ruling Islam - influenced party -- as well as its recent attacks on Israel -- suggest that the country is on a mission to reestablish , if only informally , the Islamic caliphate .
In the most extreme version of this argument , historian of the Middle East Bernard Lewis has argued that Turkey ’s fundamentalism will strengthen to such an extent that , in a decade ’s time , it will resemble Iran , even as the Islamic Republic moves in the opposite direction .
This is , however , a fundamental misunderstanding of the AKP and its intentions .
Islamism has about as much influence in modern - day Turkey as communism does in China .
In both cases , what matters most is not ideology , but the political power of the ruling parties .
Economic growth , political stability , and soft - power diplomacy regularly trump ideological consistency .
Turkey is becoming more nationalist and more assertive , and flexibility , not fundamentalism , has been the hallmark of its new foreign policy .
In 1999 , Bill Clinton suggested that if Ankara launched a reformist movement , the twenty - first century could be “ Turkey ’s century . ”
Turkey has indeed heeded Clinton ’s advice .
Now , Europe and the United States face a choice .
If Washington works with Turkey as a partner , it has a far greater chance of resolving outstanding conflicts with Iran , inside Iraq , and between the Palestinians and Israelis , not to mention simmering disputes elsewhere in the Islamic world .
If the European Union accepts Turkey as a member , its economic dynamism and new credibility in the Muslim world could help jolt Europe out of its current sclerosis .
Spurned by one or both , Turkey ’s global influence will still grow .
By all means , get that Lenovo computer , buy stock in Haier , and encourage your child to study Mandarin .
China ca n’t help but be a twenty - first - century superpower .
But if you want to really be ahead of the curve , pay close attention to that vital crossroads between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean .
It wo n’t be long before we ’ll all be talking Turkey .

AmForth is an easily extendible command interpreter for the Atmel AVR8 Atmega micro controller family and some variants of the TI MSP430 .
The RISC -V CPU ( 32 bit ) is currently beeing worked on .
It has a turnkey feature for embedded use too .
AmForth is published under the GNU Public License v3 ( GPL ) .
A commercial use is possible but for traditional commercial uses there are commercial Forths — amForth just is not one of them .
AmForth runs completely on the controller .
It does not need additional hardware .
It makes no restrictions for hardware extensions that can be connected to the controller .
The default command prompt is in a serial terminal .
The command language is Forth .
AmForth implements an almost compatible Forth 2012 indirect threading 16 bit Forth .
AmForth for the AVR8 needs 8 to 12 KB Flash memory , 80 bytes EEPROM , and 200 bytes RAM for the core system .
A similar code for the MSP430 fits into 8 KB flash .
The MSP430 info flash is used for similar purposes as the EEPROM for the AVR8 platform .
The 32 - bit variants for ARM and RISC -V are experimental .
They share most of the high - level code with the 16 - bit variants .

NEW YORK -- Baseball commissioner Bud Selig is ignoring calls to move next year 's All - Star Game from Phoenix because of Arizona 's new immigration law .
Asked about such demands at a news conference Thursday following an owners meeting , he responded with a defense of baseball 's minority hiring record .
" Apparently all the people around and in minority communities think we 're doing OK .
That 's the issue , and that 's the answer , " he said .
" I told the clubs today : ' Be proud of what we 've done . '
They are .
We should .
And that 's our answer .
We control our own fate , and we 've done very well . "
Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said he would n't participate in next year 's All - Star Game if it remains in Arizona because of the law , which empowers police to determine a person 's immigration status .
The Major League Baseball Players Association condemned the law and Rep. Jose Serrano , a New York Democrat whose district includes Yankee Stadium , sent Selig a letter asking him to move the game .
Selig cited sports sociologist Richard Lapchick , whose annual report from the University of Central Florida 's Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports last month gave baseball an A for race and a B for gender hiring .
Selig also referenced a lifetime achievement award he received in March from the Jackie Robinson Foundation .
" We 're a social institution .
We have done everything we should do -- should do , our responsibility , " he said .
" Privilege to do it .
Do n't want any pats on the back , and we 'll continue to do it . "
Leaders of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry , the Greater Phoenix Economic Council , the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and 10 other groups on Thursday released a letter in which they ask Selig to not take a position against the state by moving the game .
The letter says a relocation would cost jobs for " innocent citizens , including our Hispanic community , " and it says baseball should n't become " a pawn in a political debate . "
Presente.org , issued a statement Thursday asking Selig to move the game , saying " the commissioner is clearly out of touch with the ' minority communities ' he says MLB is so in tune with . "
Selig also said he remained optimistic about attendance this season .
" We 're down about 2 percent .
I 'd rather be up 2 percent , " he said .
" We 've had a lot of horrendous weather . "
Still , the major leagues went into late April without a rainout for the first time since 1985 .
Rob Manfred , baseball 's executive vice president for labor relations , said management might make a proposal to change the way injured players serve drug - related suspensions when the next collective bargaining agreement starts , for the 2012 season .
Currently , time on the disabled list counts toward those penalties , and Cincinnati Reds pitcher Edinson Volquez is serving his 50 - game suspension while sidelined following reconstructive elbow surgery .
" I suspect ultimately we 'll have a proposal on that , " he said .
Selig also said he would n't mind if the Wilpon family , which owns the New York Mets , bought the NHL's New York Islanders or added an expansion MLS franchise to its holdings .
" If somebody believes that kind of synergism will help , then I think that 's good , " he said .
" If there 's an owner who believes that owning another sport will really help baseball and help them , fine .
I think that 's great . "
At the news conference , Don Hooton said Selig was being given the first " Taylor 's Award " by the Taylor Hooten Foundation , presented for educating youth about the dangers of performance - enhancing drugs .
Taylor Hooton , Don 's son , committed suicide at age 17 in 2003 after apparently taking steroids in an effort to get stronger for high school baseball .
Major League Baseball is a founding sponsor of the foundation .
Marlo , Kima , and Bodie Go Paintballing .
Omar Watches from the Shadows .
It sounds like either a Wirehead porno fantasy come true or the beginning of a really good joke , but crazily enough , it ’s exactly what the post title says : Jamie Hector , better known as Marlo Stanfield from HBO ’s The Wire , staged a paintball tournament on behalf of his arts youth - mentoring charity Moving Mountains .
According to Hector , participants originally were to include Michael K. Williams ( Omar Comin ! ) , Snoop Pearson ( Snoop ) , Sonia Sohn ( Kima Greggs ) , Anwan Glover ( Slim Charles ) , Seth Gilliam ( Carver ) , and others .
Though Snoop was stuck in traffic , Slim was sadly a no - show , and Michael K. Williams reportedly spent most of his time sitting alone at a table with a dog , the sheer idea of it is still awesome .
Though apparently , its execution left much to be desired .
The paintballing took place at NYC Paintball in Long Island City , Queens .
Stereogum ‘s Gabe , seen in the photo above , hilariously described the place as such :
A windowless , airless , abandoned storage shed that smells like kerosene and is lit by the same fluorescent bulbs they used to film Saw .
The bathroom seems like something out of Grand Theft Auto .
Going to the bathroom feels like a mission to kill a Haitian who betrayed a mob boss and is now hiding in a disused subway tunnel .
Apparently , spending time with famous actors who you ca n’t help but associate with their on - screen personae is n’t a easy gig , either .
Gabe writes about this excruciating awkwardness , also :
The thing about being near famous people is that it is really fun and neat and exciting for about 20 minutes , after which you are just in a room with some strangers who do not particularly like you , but at whom you cannot stop staring .
Yikes .
Add to that the fact that it is usually very hard to disassociate their screen roles from them as human beings , and now you are in a room full of strangers who do not particularly like you and who you think are ACTUAL MURDERERS .
But Jaime Hector and Sonia Sohn were very nice .
Bodie was there , too , and he was super Bodie the whole time .
I ’m pretty sure he was for real running a corner during the event .
For us that remain voyeurs however , we can continue to enjoy with relative creeper ease the idea of actors from The Wire shooting each other in the face with colorful paint pellets .

Danish experts have warned that some types of nano products could cause cancer in a similar way to asbestos exposure .
Modern technology has seen a growth in the use of nano particles across a wide scope of industries , with applications ranging from building and cleaning materials to super fast computers .
“ Scientifically , one can draw a parallel between the spread of nano products and the asbestos scandal .
A study of the type of nano particles called carbon nanotubes showed that laboratory animals got pulmonary membrane cancer under certain conditions , ” said Otto Melchior Oulsen , National Labour Environment ( NFA ) Research Director .
He added that many asbestos handlers also contracted lung cancer in later life .
On April 16 , the Danish Environmental Protection Agency outlawed the use of nano - enhanced dirt resistant floor sprays after a study found links to serious lung problems .
The testing and recommendation were undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency , reports Politiken .
“ We subjected mice to a spray from the product and could see that it made them very sick .
During the first 24 hours , they lost 10 percent of their body weight and many of them died , ” said NFA Senior Researcher Soren Thor Larsen , adding that serious lung problems were discovered upon dissection .
Larsen claimed that many other nano products have yet to be fully tested , but that similar results to those seen in the floor spray studies are feared .
Accepted research maintains that nano particles are generally safe as long as they are encapsulated in a product , but airborne particles may still pose an undefined threat .
“ It is reasonable to assume that there are problems with products such as the one we have tested .
My advice is that workmen , for example , or consumers , should be careful with products like the floor spray in which nano particles get into the air as small droplets or dust .
In these cases one can use masks , for example , or ensure strong ventilation , ” said Larsen .

Warning :
The story you are about to read is true and has been compiled from a variety of sources I have been researching since 1994 .
I would like to give special mention to two websites , the incredible and highly recommended www.20kride.com ( an awesome fan site for the ride with ten times the information and memories found in this article ) and www.jimhillmedia.com ( a site with some excellent articles , many related to the inside dealings of Disney ) .
I take no responsibility for any ill feelings , lost business , or acts of vandalism that may befall Walt Disney World or any associated enterprises as a result of reading this article .
You have been warned !
The opening of Disneyland , California and the release of Walt Disney Pictures feature film version of Jules Verne ’s literary classic “ 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ” occurred less than a year apart .
Firmly gripping the coattails of the film ’s success , Disneyland established a temporary walk through attraction featuring props from the film including Captain Nemo ’s pipe organ ( now a fixture in the Disneyland Haunted Mansion ) and the giant squid !
A few years later in 1959 Disneyland opened a permanent attraction called “ Submarine Voyages ” which allowed patrons to take an eight minute ride “ across the globe ” including visits to the polar ice caps and the lost city of Atlantis .
This ride proved extremely popular with tourists who welcomed the opportunity to ride in a “ nuclear ” submarine even if it did just circle a man made lagoon !
The popularity of the “ Submarine Voyages ” ride was not lost on the designers of a new Disney theme park , Walt Disney World in Florida , some ten years later .
At this point Disney decided to take the ride one step further and tie it forever to one of their best - loved live action motion pictures , which coincidently saw one of its many theatrical re-releases the same year the park and ride opened .
The addition of a large dash of nostalgia into the proven mixture brought out the best the ride had to offer and added an even greater element of fantasy .
While the guts of the new Walt Disney World “ 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ” ride were almost identical to the “ Submarine Voyages ” at Disneyland , the design would be completely different .
Gone were cold war era military gray submarines in favor of the teal hued sea monster that was the Disney “ Nautilus ” !
The new submarines , designed by George McGinnis , had to be assembled at the Tampa shipyards and hauled into South Orlando on huge flat bed trucks .
The submarines were then fitted onto tracks in an 11.5 million gallon lagoon surrounded by jagged rocks that looked like they had been pushed up through the Earth by a volcano just like on Captain Nemo ’s beloved isle of Vulcania .
The majority of the interior decorations for the lagoon were carried over from the existing ones at Disney Land .
This accounts for the cross -eyed sea serpent that most passengers either loved or hated but no one forgot !
The one notable addition to the “ undersea ” sites was the giant squid attacking another Nautilus ( one of the sister ships in the fleet , guests were told ) !
The other major addition was the voice of Captain Nemo ( sounding amazingly like none other than James Mason from the movie but revealed years later to be an actor impersonating him ) guiding passengers on their voyage .
The final amalgamation of imaginative technology and well - suited fantasy resulted in a unique experience that visitors to the Magic Kingdom were guaranteed not to forget .
When Walt Disney World opened it ’s doors to tourist for the first time in October of 1971 , the “ 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ” ride was one of it ’s flagships and one of only eight original “ E ” ticket rides ( for those too young to remember , guests at Walt Disney World were originally given ticket booklets with their admission .
These tickets determined how many times a guest could go on a ride in any one of five lettered categories .
For many years , “ E ” ticket status was the highest honor the Disney theme parks had to offer and other notable “ E ” attractions included the “ Haunted Mansion ” and “ Space Mountain ” . ) .
As guests stood in line at the loading pier for their turn on the ride , they could stare into the almost too blue waters of the lagoon and dream about what mysteries must lie below .
Once they boarded one of the fourteen submarines ( when Walt Disney World opened in 1971 , the combined total of twenty seven submarines between this park and Disneyland gave Uncle Walt the fifth largest submarine fleet in the world ) they became a part of both a literary classic and a Walt Disney film masterpiece .
Even if these submarines never really submerged , the water was never deeper than twelve feet , and the fish were all plastic ( the high chlorine content in the water needed to kill the algae would kill anything else too ) , it was the illusion that mattered .
Needless to say , the “ 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ” ride was an instant and sustained hit with guests at the Magic Kingdom .
As a child during the fledgling years of Walt Disney World , this was my favorite ride to go on and nothing else came close .
Sure the “ Haunted Mansion ” was fun , the “ Jungle Cruise ” was exciting and “ Mr. Toad ’s Wild Ride ” was amusing but remember , this was a time when the Mountain rides ( Space , Splash , and Big Thunder ) and even the “ Pirates of the Caribbean ” were still just gleams in Uncle Walt ’s eye .
Even as a young child I realized that I could look up at the top of the water and see the feet of ducks swimming on the surface , but as soon as I stared straight out the porthole again I was thousands of miles below the ocean ’s waves about to be attacked at any minute by a giant squid !
The 20 K ride was also able to stand the test of time .
It started out on the cutting edge of theme park thrills and , even after twenty years , was still in the upper tier .
It was n’t a roller coaster like “ Space Mountain ” or a motion simulator like “ Back to the Future ” but it was eight minutes of pure colorful fantasy in a setting that was easy to buy into .
The guests never stopped coming and the only complaints the ride ever received was when it was closed for repairs ( WDW was never very good about letting guests know which rides were closed for repairs since the only way to find out for sure was to go there , pay to park , and walk to the front ticket office ) .
I remember the Kingdom being a little less magic any time I would visit and the 20 K ride was down .
Fortunately for me it was usually open and I got to ride it many times during my twenty or so visits to Walt Disney World ( living in Florida has it perks folks ) growing up .
The ride was not without its difficulties but few things worth having ever are .
It was one of , if not the most , difficult rides in the entire park to keep maintained .
At least two of the fourteen submarines were perpetually being worked on at any given time .
Over its twenty - three year run , the ride had to be shut down every three years and completely overhauled .
The lagoon was drained and cleaned , the animatronics repaired , and the scenery repainted to mask the damage of the highly chlorinated water and harsh Florida sun .
The diesel - powered submarines were then dry docked and repaired in a process that took six weeks to complete .
The real reason for the ride ’s closure had more to do with apathy than safety , access , or even finance .
For years the operations staff and maintenance crews had hated the 20 K ride because of its continual need for repairs and upkeep .
In 1994 , when Disney CEO Michael Eisner issued a memo calling for budget cuts and improved profits in the theme parks , they saw their chance .
By closing down the “ 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ” ride once and for all , they could not only make the company happier with the bottom line but also save themselves some labor in the bargain .
When the 20 K ride was “ closed for repair ” in 1994 , rumors were n’t the only thing that started to fly .
Walt Disney World and the Disney parent corporation in California were literally swamped with letters , phone calls , and E - mails wanting to know why the ride was closed and , better yet , when it would be back .
Some were just pleasant inquires of curiosity while others were threats of lost revenue and canceled vacations if the ride was not reopened .
The longer the ride was closed the greater and less tolerant the number of complaints became , so much so that in the early part of 1995 , then Disney President Michael Ovitz decided it was time for a “ routine inspection ” of Walt Disney World including a status check on the “ 20,000 Leagues ” ride .
During the course of his inspection , Ovitz inquired about the 20 K ride and was given the , by now , familiar spiel of excuses concerning its safety hazards and physical condition by the same staff that had just gone out of their way to shut it down .
Nevertheless , he insisted on personally touring the ride before passing judgment on the viability of its continuation in the park .
The ride that was arranged for Mr. Ovitz the following morning has become such a legend among the Walt Disney World staff that it is still to this day referred to as “ The Day We Slipped Michael Ovitz a Mickey ” .
The final voyage of the Walt Disney World Nautilus was a calculated plot of theatrics designed to give Michael Ovitz the impression that not only was the “ 20,000 Leagues ” ride unsafe but that it was fortunate no one had been killed on it up to this point !
He was taken for an orchestrated voyage of bumps , grinds , misfires , and malfunctions on the worst operating sub the operations staff could find .
Just to be on the safe side they “ decorated ” the sub immediately prior to the ride by throwing buckets of water inside until the interior was sufficiently dampened and an inch or so stood on the floor .
By the time Michael Ovitz had completed his ride , he had been thoroughly convinced that the attraction was not only dangerous but beyond salvation .
So there you have it , one of the most popular rides in Walt Disney World history was ruined by one small group of people tired of doing their jobs and a corporate office that did n’t care enough to look any further than the perceived obvious .
Perhaps the ride really was uneconomical to keep repaired ( the “ Submarine Voyage ” at Disneyland would meet a similar fate four years later in the Fall of 1998 ) but after a successful run of over twenty years could n’t it have been renovated or updated ?
My major complaint with Disney is not that they saw fit to close the 20 K ride , but the manner in which they did it .
It was clear all along that the public loved this ride and wanted it open badly enough to call , write , and E- mail .
The very least the fans deserved was a straight story about what was going on , an explanation for why this was being done , and maybe , just maybe , a final voyage to call their own .
Obviously the real estate the ride utilized was not in demand because it sat unused for almost ten years following the closure .
The Disney company may have been worried about the bottom line but one more round of repairs would most likely have bought them twelve months of record attendances had they marketed it as the final year of the “ 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ” ride .
The real problem here lies in the fact that the money machine that is Disney cares nothing about nostalgia , no matter how much they would like you to believe otherwise .
The ride subs could have easily been put on display in areas like the MGM studios “ bone yard ” or sold off to collectors .
Even child proofing them and donating them to orphanage playgrounds seems a far better use than burying them in a landfill .
Unfortunately , once an attraction is marked for closure , Disney would much rather the public just forget that it ever existed than remember it fondly or , Heaven forbid , call for its return .
Nowhere is this more evident than with the “ 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ” ride .
When Disney released an excellent two DVD set of the feature film in March 2004 , it included commentaries , rare footage , and documentaries on everything from the memorabilia surrounding the movie to the study of the real Humboldt squid .
Conspicuously absent from these exhaustive extras was any mention that the film had inspired a theme ride in Florida that had lasted over twenty years and entertained millions of visitors .
" Ladies and gentlemen , in just a few moments we will be docking at Vulcania , our home port .
It has been a pleasure having you aboard the Nautilus , on this memorable voyage that has taken us 20,000 leagues under the sea .
Captain to bridge .
Reduce speed and proceed to number four berth .
Stand by to dock . "
- Captain Nemo ’s final words from the Walt Disney World “ 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ” Ride .
1971-1994 .

A bill that calls for severely limiting the visitation rights of Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails was approved Sunday by the Ministerial Committee on Legislation .
Under the proposed law , colloquially referred to as the “ Schalit Law , " the conditions under which Hamas prisoners are held will be made more stringent - they will be denied all visits except by legal counsel and representatives of the International Red Cross .
The ministers said they would support the bill on the condition that they be consulted before it goes to a second reading at the Knesset , in conjunction with the Justice and Internal Security ministries .
The bill was proposed by MKs Yariv Levin and Danny Danon ( Likud ) , Moshe Matalon ( Israel Beiteinu ) and Yoel Hasson ( Kadima ) , supported by others .
Danon said that the legislation would deliver a clear message to Hamas leadership that their " VIP treatment " in Israeli prisons was coming to an end .
The proposal will come up for an initial vote on Wednesday .
Image caption Thousands have submitted their ideas to BP
We asked readers to submit their ideas on how the Gulf of Mexico oil spill should have been stopped .
A selection of the hundreds we received has been assessed by Prof Iraj Ershaghi , director of petroleum engineering at the University of Southern California .
BP 's cap on the well is currently , according to the company 's estimates , capturing more than half of the oil .
But could there be a better way ?
NUCLEAR BLAST
" Drill a hole next to the well .
Place a low - yield nuclear warhead and detonate it .
EXPERT VIEW
Would create uncontrollable flow
" The power will fuse the rock together and the intense pressure from the sea water will keep the rock in place thus sealing the leak . "
- Michael Murray , Greensboro , North Carolina , US
Prof Ershaghi says : " A nuclear blast would not fuse the pipe under the cooling effect of water but rather would create a crater and would make it impossible to control the flow . "
FABRIC TUBE
" I think you should create a large fabric tube to help control the amount of oil that gets away from the leak .
I think something like parachute cloth might work because that fabric is quite a tight weave - water passes through , but I do n't think oil would .
EXPERT VIEW
Pressure means it 's impossible
" It might have access panels , especially near the bottom where the actual leaks are occurring , but perhaps that would allow for some kind of pump to pump the oily water that would be held within the tube . "
- Elaine Seniuk , Enfield , Canada
Prof Ershaghi says : " What forces the oil and water to flow through the fabric is a pressure of close to 7,000 pounds per square inch .
We also need to realise the volume being produced ( 15,000 - 20,000 barrels per day or 600,000 to 800,000 gallons a day ) .
That means capacity requirements that are impossible to create or install under 5,000 ft of water . "
POLYSTYRENE BEADS
" How about using small polystyrene beads impregnated with iron filings to cling to the oil , then pick up the beads with an electromagnet which could be mounted on any number of platforms such as vehicles or boats .
EXPERT VIEW
Sinking oil harder to collect
" Beads get processed to remove the oil , then re-used .
Cheap to produce , easy to collect from water , better than trying to scrape oil off difficult surfaces .
Beads would be easily deployable by air / sea . " - Alwyn Turner , Chapel - en- le - Frith , UK
Prof Ershaghi says : " They use straw to help in collecting oil .
Any other type of material attachment could result in making the oil drops heavier .
Causing the oil droplets to sink will not solve the spill clean - up as we will be polluting the water below the surface .
Please also realise , mass production of any new products on the scale of sinking miles of spilled oil on the surface requires months if not years of planning and manufacturing . "
PILE OF ROCKS
" How do we block any hole in the earth ?
By using the natural resources of the earth itself .
I suggest that BP utilise barge after barge of rocks that will sink quickly and directly over the outpouring .
EXPERT VIEW
Rocks would leave gaps
" Enough rocks to create a mini-mountain .
Sea bed sand might eventually fill the gaps in the rocks as a kind of cement . "
- Vernon Turner , St Ives , Cambridgeshire , UK
Prof Ershaghi says : " If BP had cut the riser during the first week and had installed a second blowout preventer , a massively heavy 48ft stack , it would have done the equivalent of what you are suggesting .
By dropping large pieces of rock , there is no way they can seal all the holes in between the boulders to stop the flow .
Use of soft sand will not work for sealing the holes as the flow of high pressure oil and gas will blow away sediment and rocks . "
METAL AND MAGNETS
" Wrap electromagnets at different sections of the pipe and secure .
Turn on magnets .
Inject small metal material into pipe to be attracted to magnets .
As material adheres to inside of pipe , inject slightly larger material .
Make sure electromagnets are powerful enough .
EXPERT VIEW
Like ' top kill ' and would n't work
" Eventually , the flow will decrease and perhaps stop just like a clogged artery in the human body .
Remember , power to the magnets must not stop until the pipe is safely capped . "
- Anon
Prof Ershaghi says : " BP was trying to inject high pressure mud and could not fight the upward flow of oil and gas .
It is hard to inject the materials you are suggesting with fluid unless they are pulverized .
If they could have been injected , they would have been subjected to the upward pressure and could not have entered the casing . "
SINK A SHIP
" I think that the hole could be plugged to greatly reduce the flow , if not end it , by sinking an old ship over the leak .
EXPERT VIEW
A ship might not create a seal
" If extra ballast were added to the ship to make it even heavier , it would exert enough pressure to seal the hole . "
- Howard H Rothman , Bridgeport , Connecticut , US
Prof Ershaghi says : " If we used your idea , the weight of the sunken vessel must be enough to overcome the upward force of the fluid while also a tight seal is required over the casing .
A better idea is still , as mentioned above , placing another blowout preventer after cutting the riser . "
GIANT FUNNEL
" What will contain it is simply an enormous funnel in thin mild steel which can be lowered over the whole mess with enough pipe of suitably flexible material and diameter to guide the oil to the surface , where of course it will need a constant supply of tankers to suck / pump it safely aboard .
EXPERT VIEW
The current cap is better
" Obviously the flow - rate and rate of rise needs to be well estimated to get the diameter of the mile of pipe to the surface . "
- G Vert Vaughan , Veliko Tarnovo , Bulgaria
Prof Ershaghi says : " What BP has done in terms of connecting the Lower Marine Riser Package ( the cap on top of the blowout preventer ) to take the oil to the surface is similar to your idea , except , they did not have to make a huge funnel to accommodate 800,000 gallons of oil per day . "
BARBED PLUG
" Manufacture a series of 30 cm custom plugs , each tapered at the front like a bullet .
Each plug must have the same diameter as the inner diameter of the tube ( minus 2 mm to prevent jamming on the way in ) .
However , along the sides of the plugs , cut 100 small diagonal incisions .
Thus the plug will look like it is barbed .
EXPERT VIEW
Damaging the well casing would be catastrophic
" It will go in easily , but dig itself in when going out , plus the more pressure exerted by the gas , the deeper the plug will dig into the pipe sides .
Clearly , the plug must be made of a metal harder than the pipe , or it wo n't be able to do this .
Use a pneumatic or even limited explosive charge to deliver the plugs .
I suggest a minimum of two - that 's how we seal basement leaks in Canada , after all . "
- Dave Lundy , Canada
Prof Ershaghi says : " Maintaining the integrity of the casing is extremely critical .
Use of any hard materials or force against the casing is counter - productive as bursting of the casing could occur .
That would make it impossible to control the flow . "
INFLATABLE BLADDER
" The most obvious solution to me is to use a bladder that is inserted deep into the pipeline , then pumped up with a high pressure medium .
Once the flow has stopped and the feed line removed , the end of the pipe may be sealed by whatever caps are required .
EXPERT VIEW
Coiled tubing might have been an option
" Alternatively , once the pipe is repaired and if it is to be used again the bladder may be deflated . "
- Mike Konshak , Louisville , Colorado , US
Prof Ershaghi says : " BP could not have done anything of this sort until they cut the riser .
One practical solution similar to yours is the use of industry standard coiled tubing .
Yes , they could have done that to pump high pressure fluid to fight the well pressure .
But one has to be careful not to burst the casing . "
PLUMBING SOLUTION
" Being an ex-plumber , the only way to deal with a pressurised leak is to keep the open end and connect a fitting to the pipe , then shut the fitting when the pipe connection is made .
Underwater and at 5,000 ft , you would need to use a skirt , fixed to an open - ended pipe .
The skirt could be split on one side .
This could be drawn down over the broken pipe end and fixed to a sound portion of the broken pipe , away from the break .
EXPERT VIEW
Similar to using a second blowout preventer
" This could be fixed in place using traditional mechanical fittings , but it is not taking the strain yet , as the pressurised stream is going up the new open pipe and through the split skirt .
Then you can slowly draw the skirt closed , re-strengthening the fixings on the sound part of the broken pipe , thus allowing the skirt to take more strain of the pressurised flow .
The skirt can be drawn to a close , as the fixings are made good behind it and the pressurised stream will flow up the new pipe to awaiting vessels . "
- Paul , Canada
Prof Ershaghi says : " The practical way to use your idea , as discussed above , would have been to actually install another blowout preventer over the existing one after BP managed to cut the riser .
They did not do that .
Still , if the containment device does not stop the flow , they may have to resort to that option . "
LEAD BALLS
" To stop the oil flow in the pipe in the Gulf of Mexico , form a funnel that fits into the open pipe and also grips it below the top outside to keep it stable .
Pour lead balls of the right size into the funnel to definitely sink into the oil flow despite its speed .
They need to be as small as possible while being big enough to be sure to sink .
They must be less than about a third of the width of the opening in the funnel to avoid self - jamming in the funnel or pipe and not so large that venturi forces around the balls ( from increased oil flow speeds passing the balls ) stop them from sinking .
EXPERT VIEW
Like the failed ' junk shot '
" Reduce the size of the lead balls as the reduced oil flow speed allows smaller ones to sink .
When enough lead balls have been fed in to slow down the oil speed , start putting clay balls into the oil pipe .
When enough of them have been fed in , put in more lead balls ( or steel balls would do by this stage ) .
These last balls will , under the action of gravity , then deform the clay balls to form a seal in the pipe . "
- Peter Keogh , Olso , Norway
Prof Ershaghi says : " Your idea falls in the category of the junk shot that BP found was not successful . "
CRIMP THE PIPE
" Could the pipe be crimped shut ?
I have read that ' giant shears ' were used to cut the pipe , so why not ' giant pliers ' ?
Since capping and siphoning seem problematic , crimping , even if not complete and permanent , should diminish the flow at least partially and until the relief wells or other means can ameliorate the situation .
EXPERT VIEW
Similar to what blowout preventer should have done
" Once crimping was used it would deform the pipe so that capping or siphoning would be almost impossible . "
- Julian P Crane , Everett , Massachusetts , US
Prof Ershaghi says : " Yes , if the blind ram - a device that forms a seal - had worked on the blowout preventer , that was exactly the way the seal process would have taken place to close the casing . "
EPOXY WARHEAD
" Epoxy might be a better top kill method than mud , and in any case a heavier solid is needed - try bismuth and / or iron shot .
Delivering the resin and catalyst into the well requires two tubes , though an intermediate pulse of isopropyl alcohol may have a chance or separating the two liquids in a single feed tube , there 'd be a risk of simply clogging the feed tube before it reached the well .
EXPERT VIEW
Firing a warhead into the well not wise
" Another alternative plug is a torpedo , wire - guided , with a low speed mode ( or restrictor ) for manoeuvring into place , and an extended warhead holding just enough charge to split containers of epoxy monomer and catalyst . "
- Jeremy , New Jersey , US
Prof Ershaghi says : " A torpedo or any warhead entering the casing would have made this a major catastrophe as the loss of casing integrity would have resulted in a crater with continuous and uncontrollable oil flow for the next 30 - 40 years depending on the amount of oil in the reservoir . "
UMBRELLA PLUG
" Use an umbrella plug , which would be deployed into the well to the point where the drill borehole breached the well , effectively capping from the inside .
EXPERT VIEW Umbrella could not withstand pressure
" You could let the pressure of the well secure the plug or fix it to the seabed . "
- Shayne Dawe , Plymouth , UK
Prof Ershaghi says : " Umbrella type materials that can collapse to fit the pipe and then expand under pressure cannot withstand 6,000 - 7,000 pounds per square inch of pressure . "
SHALLOW RELIEF WELL
" They should drill another hole into the same well and continue collecting the oil .
This would diminish the pressure in the currently leaking system , and make it possible to seal the leak .
EXPERT VIEW
Relief well must go in at an angle
" If it is possible to hit the current well by drilling into it at an angle , this ' shallow ' drill may be faster and easier to do than going all the depth into the reservoir . "
- Alex , Boston , Massachusetts , US
Prof Ershaghi says : " At the site there are a lot of vessels , the relief well needs to be away from them .
You have to go down and then angle it , when you dig the relief well . "
UNSCREW THE FLANGE
" It appears that below the cut that they have made before capping the pipe , there is a section of the pipe that is bolted , which combines the two sections of pipe .
Would n't it be possible to remove the bolts and attach a new section of pipe , bolting the new piece on incrementally , which would allow some leverage in allowing for a rotation of the new section into place .
EXPERT VIEW
Necessary torque difficult under water
" The new section could have a valve that could be closed off once this section is put into place , thereby minimising the pressure that they would face when installing this new section . "
- John Allison , Doylestown , Pennsylvania , US
Prof Ershaghi says : " Such operations would require a tremendous amount of torque and this is very difficult with robots and underwater . "
HYDROCARBON POLYMER
" To clean up the spill itself they could use a hydrocarbon polymer which attaches itself to oil and produces a sponge - like material which would be easier to clean up , or scoop up .
EXPERT VIEW
These polymers are used , but sheer volume problematic
" They could even dye the polymer so that the resultant material is much more visible and again easier to collect . "
- Steve , Bermuda
Prof Ershaghi says : " Materials similar to what you are proposing are used , but the sheer magnitude of the amounts needed to treat the volume of oil and the timely spread and collection in a speedy manner is not easily manageable . "
FREEZE THE WELL
" I know that a lot of wells in the Gulf of Mexico are difficult to produce because of hydrate ( methane ice ) formation .
The containment dome failed because of this .
Has the idea of promoting the formation of hydrates within the wellbore itself , to form an ice plug to stop the flow of hydrocarbons , been considered ?
EXPERT VIEW
Freezing would not reliably block the well
" With a reservoir that does not have free water , and producing at above hydrate curve temperatures , the hydrates will not form until the gas has expanded and cooled the surrounding area ( Joule Thompson effect ) .
However , if ice cold , fresh water were pumped into the wellbore , perhaps with some ice crystals or grains of sand , or something to promote the seed required to help the hydrate cage form , that may promote the formation of a hydrate plug within the wellbore itself . "
- Mike , Stony Plain , Alberta , Canada
Prof Ershaghi says : " You are correct .
In fact , hydrate can form near the mud line close to the sea bed .
Even if some restrictions develop , this is not a reliable way to stop the flow .
A simple change of thermodynamics can change the conditions . "
R otting food scraps picked out of the dirt and the bins of the backstreets of Harare are piled together in a slimy heap on the ground with torn cardboard as a serving plate .
Elias , 15 , squats and pushes both hands into the pile , scooping out a chunk of something pink .
He gnaws on it , then shouts : " Dinner ! Come and eat . "
The other boys shush him .
" The police will come , " says Lloyd , " and we will have to run . "
There are more than 20 of them , gathered on a small piece of waste ground around a thin fire .
The youngest is 8 , the eldest 18 .
Lloyd used to have a blanket , but the police took it last time he was rounded up .
He is among the older children who have been living on the streets since President Robert Mugabe 's infamous Operation Murambatsvina , the slum clearances that began in 2005 and left hundreds homeless .
But now they are seeing new , younger kids drifting in day after day from the countryside , looking for protection and a share of whatever has been scavenged or stolen or begged .
" Zimbabwean society is splintering , breaking , the family is not working the way it used to , " said an official at the ministry of health .
" The gap is increasing between the rich and the poor , the middle classes are moving out into the high - density suburbs where the poor used to live , and the poor are ending up on the streets . "
At the Makumbi children 's home , half an hour 's drive from the city , Sister Alois is upset to report she has had to turn away three abandoned babies brought in by social workers in the last week .
" More and more children abandoned , it 's not the African way .
There are so many now .
They are being left in the bush , some are eaten by the ants , " said the nun , who has always been strict on taking in a manageable number of orphans to give each child the best possible chance : 10 children to each of her " house mothers " .
She says " poverty , and poverty leading to girls being abused " , is the cause .
But after years of financial mismanagement at the hands of an ageing dictator and his corrupt cronies that saw this country decline into chaos amid food and energy shortages , sky - high inflation and political violence , Zimbabwe is entering a new era .
In the two years since the election that nearly tore the country apart before resulting in a national unity government between Mugabe and opposition leaders Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara , there have been dramatic changes .
There is food on the shelves now , and the trillion - dollar banknotes are gone .
Since 2009 citizens have been free to use the South African rand or the US dollar , and all do .
A human rights commission has been sworn in .
A media commission has licensed newspapers independent of government control and one , Newsday , began publishing this month .
There are more cars on the road , some traffic lights work and the big four - wheeled drives no longer mainly have white faces behind the wheel .
Vast diamond fields discovered at Marange have the potential to bring prosperity , and work on a new constitution is under way .
But what has really changed ?
Zimbabweans still top the world list of asylum - seekers .
On Monday , Mugabe was ranked the world 's second - worst dictator behind Kim Jong-il of North Korea , and Zimbabwe rated in the top 10 failed states .
The report by the US - based Fund for Peace stated : " Mugabe has arrested and tortured the opposition , squeezed his economy into astounding negative growth and billion - percent inflation , and funnelled off a juicy cut for himself using currency manipulation and offshore accounts . "
On Thursday , the international watchdog , the Kimberley Process , failed to reach agreement on Zimbabwe 's diamonds , concerned at human rights abuses and corruption .
So the ban on the country exporting diamonds remains in place .
And Mugabe 's government remains disdainful of international opinion .
The mines minister , Obert Mpofu , responded by saying Zimbabwe would sell them anyway .
" Those of you who dream of regime change , " he told his critics , " there will never be regime change in Zimbabwe .
We fought for our liberation and we are ready to fight again . "
Tsvangirai has been accused of ineffectual leadership , of doing the " Mugabe shuffle " – making small changes that mean nothing for the people .
As one businessman told the Observer : " There is a saying in Shona , ' It 's best to take an enemy inside your hut and there kill him ' .
That is what Mugabe has done to Tsvangirai .
We are betrayed . "
The government is in another paralysis of disagreement , with reports that Tsvangirai and Mugabe are not speaking .
The state newspaper last week ran a front - page picture of the recently widowed Tsvangirai sitting near a woman it alleged was his new girlfriend .
Rumours abound of MDC officials accepting farms from Mugabe just as he rewards the loyalty of his own Zanu - PF officials .
The suggestion is denied vehemently , but worn - out Zimbabweans believe it .
The controversies and rumours are helping to raise the profile of a new player on the field .
Zapu , the party of the late liberation hero Joshua Nkomo , has officially extricated itself from Zanu - PF and is showing signs of winning support outside its Matabeleland stronghold .
" Their pockets and their necks are getting fatter , there is no difference between the MDC and Zanu any more , " Dr Dumiso Dabengwa , interim chairman of Zapu , said , insisting that cross-tribal support was already coming their way .
And while the political leaders are failing to fix a broken Zimbabwe , those who try to help on the streets are overwhelmed by the scale of the country 's problems .
A charity operating to help the growing bands of homeless children , Streets Ahead , is a drop - in day centre where kids can come and wash , attend art and drama classes , have a meal .
Staff used to do night outreach work to find kids newly arrived on the city streets before the pimps and the abusers got to them , but donations are drying up .
" So many kids we could take back home now , but we do n't have the money or the truck to take them , " said outreach worker Pauline Manigo , close to tears .
Duduzile Moyo , executive director of the centre , said : " We are soldiering on .
The donations are scaling back big time , economic pressures everywhere .
But it is the same pressures that are causing the problems that mean we cannot fix them . "
A census in August found 705 children living in Harare 's city centre .
" Poverty is the underlying cause and the economic downturn is making everything worse .
We are seeing new kids arriving all the time now .
The gap between the rich and the poor is getting very wide now . "
A 34 - year - old woman , in a retail management job , told of her despair that she was about to give up her small flat to move to the sprawling townships around the city where electricity and running water are seen as a luxury , not a necessity .
" I have always worked hard , always .
But now I just do n't know how I can manage any more , so I am going to have to move out .
My wages have been cut and cut and now my rent is $ 300 a month and my income is $ 320 .
" I am middle - class , my parents had a nice house , but if I want my kids to go to school then they 're not going to have a nice house . "
But her two children are still luckier than some .
A few streets away , at a bus stop , a row of bodies are huddled under thin sheets .
Connie Tatianashe is four months pregnant .
Her three - year - old son sleeps by her side .
They lost their home because her husband had to take a pay cut while the rents just kept on rising .
Beside her , a shivering girl called Memory Muringai looks younger than the 13 she claims to be and has been here only a few days .
So far none of the older boys has claimed her as a " girlfriend " .

About Florida 's Deepwater Horizon Program
On April 20 , 2010 , the offshore oil drilling platform Deepwater Horizon exploded in the Gulf of Mexico , causing the largest oil spill in U.S. history .
As a result of the disaster , three funding streams were created : compensation for injury / damage under the Natural Resource Damage Assessment ( NRDA ) , civil penalties administered under the RESTORE Act , and a criminal settlement administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation 's Gulf Environmental Benefits Fund .
Each of the funding streams is tied to a particular type of injury or violation , and each one is administered differently .
The state of Florida has also settled with a non-operating investor , MOEX , and utilized those funds for several priority projects .
Below is information about each funding stream with links to more information , settlement information , and how to submit a project proposal for funding consideration .

Deepwater Horizon Settlement
On April 4 , 2016 , the consent decree between BP , the United States and the five Gulf Coast states was approved and entered into by the court .
The consent decree requires BP to pay a total of $ 18.5 billion , which is broken down between Clean Water Act civil penalties , natural resource damage claims and economic claims across the Gulf states .
The state of Florida will receive at least $ 3.25 billion .

Natural Resource Damage Assessment
The Oil Pollution
Act authorizes certain state and federal agencies to evaluate the impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill .
This legal process , known as Natural Resource Damage Assessment ( NRDA ) , determines the type and amount of restoration needed to compensate the public for damages caused by the oil spill .
The department is playing a key role in Florida 's restoration along with Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission ( FWC ) as co-trustees on the Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council .

RESTORE Act
The RESTORE Act , which was passed by Congress on June 29 , 2012 , and signed into law on July 6 , 2012 , by the president , provides a vehicle for Clean Water Act civil and administrative penalties from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill .
The act calls for a regional approach to restoring the long - term health of the valuable natural ecosystems and economy of the Gulf Coast region .
The RESTORE Act dedicates 80 percent of civil and administrative penalties paid under the Clean Water Act , after the date of enactment , by responsible parties in connection with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund for ecosystem restoration , economic recovery and tourism promotion in the Gulf Coast region .
Governor Rick Scott has appointed DEP Secretary Noah Valenstein as his designee to represent Florida on the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council , which is responsible for implementing the Comprehensive Plan : Restoring the Gulf Coast 's Ecosystem and Economy .
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation
The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation established the Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund to administer funds arising from plea agreements that resolve the criminal cases against BP and Transocean .
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the department work directly with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to identify projects for the state of Florida , in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .

But scientists doubt that IGNITOR will lead to fusion power .
The proposed IGNITOR reactor moved a step closer to reality this week .
M. Romanelli / The IGNITOR project
Italy and Russia plan to fund a compact nuclear - fusion experiment called IGNITOR , according to an intra-governmental memorandum signed on Monday in Milan , Italy .
But fusion scientists contacted by Nature have dismissed claims made by its inventor that the reactor is a bigger step towards fusion power than the much more expensive international ITER project .
Nuclear fusion involves the joining together of two nuclei of low atomic mass , usually deuterium and tritium , to release energy .
IGNITOR and ITER will both use a doughnut - shaped device known as a tokamak to magnetically confine fusion reactants in a super - heated plasma .
But IGNITOR is designed to use a much smaller tokamak ( a radius of 1.3 metres compared with ITER's 6.2 metres ) and a stronger magnetic field to compress the plasma .
And unlike ITER , the ultimate aim of IGNITOR is to demonstrate the feasibility of plasma ignition — a state in which there is enough fusion power to maintain the reaction without the need for external heat .
ITER , on the other hand , aims to maintain fusion by generating up to 10 times more power than it consumes .
The idea behind IGNITOR was first put forward in the 1970s by Italian plasma physicist Bruno Coppi of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge .
Supported by funding of about € 20 million ( US $ 27 million ) from the Italian government , Coppi and a small group of collaborators in the United States and Italy have developed the IGNITOR reactor on paper and built the first prototype parts .
Coppi's long battle to bring the project into being collided with plans to fund ITER , which kicked off in 2006 after long delays and scientific debate about its feasibility .
According to the intra-governmental memorandum signed this week , Coppi , together with the Italian National Agency for New Technologies , Energy and the Environment ( ENEA ) will collaborate with Evgeny Velikhov , president of the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow , to finalize plans for the machine , which will be built at the Triniti site at Troitsk near Moscow .
Velikhov is also the chair of the ITER council .
Fusion fallout
Coppi now claims that his reactor is the right way forward if fusion is ever going to generate useful amounts of energy .
" With IGNITOR we can study high - field plasmas at ignition — the only way to get to a nuclear - fusion power plant , " he says .
“ The idea that there is a simple solution and ITER scientists are going crazy for the most expensive one is really exaggerated . ”
Coppi says that ITER 's aim of producing 10 times more power than is put in — known as the fusion energy gain factor , or Q value — is too low to generate power on a meaningful scale , and that the science that will be carried out at ITER will not be useful for future power plants .
But fusion scientists contacted by Nature , while welcoming the project , are less convinced that IGNITOR has the advantages over ITER that Coppi suggests .
Günther Hasinger , the scientific director of the Max Planck Institute of Plasma Physics in Garching , Germany , says that even if IGNITOR is successful it will still require an ITER - like project to scale up because there is no room in the smaller reactor for other components to absorb the energy produced by the fusion reaction .
" The idea that there is a simple solution and ITER scientists are going crazy for the most expensive one is really exaggerated , " he says .
" ITER scale is the way to power plants , " says Steve Cowley , director of the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in Oxfordshire , UK .
IGNITOR " is a great way to do an exciting experiment but it's a dead end " , he says .
Cowley agrees that a Q value of greater than 10 would be good , but says " Q=10 is a conservative value , it may be 20 , some predict ITER may even reach ignition ; but we are not bound to ignition " .

But Hasinger goes further in his scepticism of the IGNITOR reactor by questioning the feasibility of the whole project .
Hasinger says that the IGNITOR team 's plan to heat the plasma mostly with a current , a process known as ohmic heating , will not work .
ITER complements ohmic heating with two other methods of plasma heating — neutral - beam injection and electromagnetic waves .
" We studied the possibility of a high - field ignition machine and came to the conclusion that relying on ohmic plasma heating has a very narrow corridor for success , " he says .
But Coppi refutes the criticism , saying that ohmic heating has been shown to heat plasma to higher temperatures than expected , and points out that IGNITOR has an alternative heating method known as ion-cyclotron resonant heating .
According to a 2003 ENEA estimate , at least an additional € 226 million will be needed to build IGNITOR , although neither Italy nor Russia have yet officially committed any funds to the project .
Coppi claims that the costs will be lower .
He hopes to have the machine built and working within 3 – 5 years and to have the first results immediately afterwards .
" We are in a hurry , " he says .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve on Friday announced plans to test a new facility it could use to withdraw some of the extraordinary stimulus it pumped into the economy during the recession , but stressed it was not embarking on a tightening of monetary policy yet .

The Fed announced three auctions of short - term deposits and said two more could follow .
The auctions will offer around 8,000 banks around the country a chance to park reserves at the Fed and earn interest , effectively taking those funds out of general circulation in the economy .
“ These auctions are a matter of prudent planning and have no implications for the near - term conduct of monetary policy , ” the U.S. central bank said in a statement .
Fed officials have made clear for months they would use a process similar to the certificates of deposit banks offer customers .
The tool gives the Fed the chance to drain reserves from the financial system when they want to begin to tighten financial conditions as the economy recovers from recession .
“ Nothing that we see here looks unusual relative to what we would have expected , ” said Michael Feroli , an economist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in New York .
“ It ’s a very long , predetermined process . ”
The Fed bought about $ 1.4 trillion in mortgage - related debt and $ 300 billion worth of longer - term Treasury securities in a bid to provide additional punch to the flagging economy after it had already cut borrowing costs to near zero .
At about $ 2.3 trillion , the Fed ’s balance sheet has ballooned from its pre-crisis level of about $ 900 billion .
Policy makers have signaled they will keep rates exceptionally low for an extended period .
But they have mapped out methods for draining reserves from the system , including offering term deposits and reverse repurchase agreements .
The term deposit auctions announced on Friday are in effect dry runs of a facility that could become much larger if it is successful .
The Fed has already conducted trial reverse repurchase agreements , in which it sells securities to financial firms that deal directly with Fed with an agreement to sell them back later for a slightly higher price .
Policy makers hope that pulling back funds from banks on a larger scale will limit the risk of inflation from having so much credit sloshing around the financial system .
The Fed also believes that by absorbing reserves , it will have more control over the benchmark interest rates it targets to rein in any overheating in the economy when needed .
The first auction will be for $ 1 billion of 14 - day deposits on June 14 .
Auctions of 28 - day and 84 - day deposits will follow for amounts yet to be announced .
The maximum rate at auction will be for no more than the discount rate , the cost of emergency loans from the Fed .
The Fed said it could hold up to two additional term - deposit auctions later in the summer .
Growing demand from emerging markets and for biofuel production will send prices soaring , according to the OECD and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation
Food prices are set to rise as much as 40 % over the coming decade amid growing demand from emerging markets and for biofuel production , according to a United Nations report today which warns of rising hunger and food insecurity .
Farm commodity prices have fallen from their record peaks of two years ago but are set to pick up again and are unlikely to drop back to their average levels of the past decade , according to the annual joint report from Paris - based thinktank the OECD and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) .
The forecasts are for wheat and coarse grain prices over the next 10 years to be between 15 % and 40 % higher in real terms , once adjusted for inflation , than their average levels during the 1997 - 2006 period , the decade before the price spike of 2007 - 08 .
Real prices for vegetable oils are expected to be more than 40 % higher and dairy prices are projected to be between 16 - 45 % higher .
But rises in livestock prices are expected to be less marked , although world demand for meat is climbing faster than for other farm commodities on the back of rising wealth for some sections of the population in emerging economies .
Although the report sees production increasing to meet demand , it warns that recent price spikes and the economic crisis have contributed to a rise in hunger and food insecurity .
About 1 billion people are now estimated to be undernourished , it said .
Fairtrade campaigners said the predictions of sharply rising prices provided a " stark warning " to international policymakers .
" Investment to encourage the 1 billion people whose livelihoods rely on smallholder agriculture is vital .
Not only will this increase yields but will go a long way to increase prosperity in poverty stricken regions , " said Barbara Crowther , director of communications at the Fairtrade Foundation .
" At the same time , the promise of increased agriculture commodity prices could spark a new surge in land grabbing by sovereign wealth funds and other powerful investors which risks marginalising further rural communities who must be included in solutions to secure and maintain food supplies . "
The report says that agricultural production and productivity must be stepped up and it argues for a well - functioning trading system to ensure fair competition and that surplus food is getting to where it is needed .
It also painted a growing role for developing countries in both boosting demand and production .
Brazil is by far the fastest growing agricultural producer , with output expected to rise by more than 40 % in the next decade and production growth is also expected to be well above 20 % in China , India , Russia and Ukraine .
" The role of developing countries in international markets is growing quickly , and as their impact grows , their policies also have an increasing bearing on conditions in global markets , " said FAO director - general Jacques Diouf .
" This makes their role and contribution to global policy issues critical .
Policy discussions must be global in scope and we need to improve the framework for such exchange of views . "
Another factor driving up food prices is the controversial biofuels industry .
The report predicts that continued expansion of biofuel output – often to meet government targets – will create additional demand for wheat , coarse grains , vegetable oils and sugar .

What is it about today 's school system that so many find unsatisfactory ?
Why have generations of reformers failed to improve the educational system , and , indeed , caused it to degenerate further and further into an ever declining level of mediocrity ?
In this radical and scholarly monograph , out of print for two decades and restored according to the author 's original , Murray N. Rothbard identifies the crucial feature of our educational system that dooms it to fail : at every level , from financing to attendance , the system relies on compulsion instead of voluntary consent .
Certain consequences follow .
The curriculum is politicized to reflect the ideological priorities of the regime in power .
Standards are continually dumbed - down to accommodate the least common denominator .
The brightest children are not permitted to achieve their potential , the special needs of individual children are neglected , and the mid-level learners become little more than cogs in a machine .
The teachers themselves are hamstrung by a political apparatus that watches their every move .
Rothbard explores the history of compulsory schooling to show that none of this is accident .
The state has long used compulsory schooling — backed by egalitarian ideology — as a means of citizen control .
In contrast , a market - based system of schools would adhere to a purely voluntary ethic , financed with private funds , and administered entirely by private enterprise .
An interesting feature of this book is its promotion of individual — or home — schooling , long before the current popularity of the practice .
As Kevin Ryan of Boston University points out in the introduction , if education reform is ever to bring about fundamental change , it will have to begin with a complete rethinking of public schooling that Rothbard offers here .
