Q : What is swine flu ?
A : Much the same as human flu – but in pigs .
The worry is that pigs are excellent hosts for the virus .
And because they are genetically close to humans , they can pass the virus to us more easily than birds can .
The great fear over the past decade has been that the avian flu virus , H5N1 , would infect pigs which would act as a reservoir for its transmission to humans .
Luckily for the world , apart from a few isolated outbreaks , this did not happen .
Q : How worried should we be ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A : At this stage , no one knows .
The virus that has caused the outbreak is a strain of the H1N1 type that contains bird , pig and human genes in a combination never seen before .
Immunity to it will thus be limited .
Scientists are working to establish the precise nature of the virus , the symptoms it causes and its capacity to cause disease and death .
Q Has swine flu infected humans before ?
A : Yes .
There have been rare cases since the 1950s , mostly in people such as farmers who work directly with pigs .
In Europe , 17 cases have been reported since 1958 .
In the US , an outbreak at a military camp in New Jersey in 1976 , infected over 200 soldiers , of which 12 were hospitalised and one died .
Q What are the symptoms of swine flu ?
A : Similar to ordinary human flu – cough , sudden fever , headache , muscle pains .
In severe cases , it may lead to pneumonia , multi-organ failure , and death .
The incubation period for ordinary human flu is two to five days .
Q : Can it be treated ?
A : Yes – up to a point .
Early indications are that patients in Mexico and the US have been successfully treated with the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza .
These drugs cannot prevent flu but they can limit its severity , and thus save lives , if taken as soon as symptoms develop .
However , the swine flu has proved resistant to older anti-virals such as amantadine .
Q : Is Britain prepared for a pandemic ?
A : Better than it was five years ago .
A pandemic plan has been prepared detailing action by everyone from pharmacists , who will hand out anti-viral drugs , to hospitals handling the seriously ill , to mortuaries which may have to be temporarily expanded .
Over 14 million courses of Tamiflu have been stockpiled and the Government announced last year it was doubling the amount to provide enough for half the population .
Q : How bad might a pandemic be ?
A : At its worst , it could have a devastating global impact , greater than a terrorist attack , nuclear accident or environmental disaster .
The World Health Organisation estimates that a mild pandemic could cause up to 7.5 million deaths .
In the UK , Sir Liam Donaldson , the Government 's Chief Medical Officer , has said that in the worst case scenario the country could face up to 750,000 deaths .
However , in the flu pandemics of 1957 and 1968 most victims recovered .
There was no panic , cities did not empty , travel did not come to a halt and economies were n't devastated .
Each of those pandemics killed 50,000 people in the UK and around one million worldwide .
In a normal year , flu kills 12,000 to 20,000 mainly elderly people in Britain and 250,000 around the world .
Q : Who is at greatest risk ?
A : In Mexico , the virus appears to be targeting those aged 20 to 40 .
This is not unusual – the same occurred during the worst pandemic of the last century , in 1918 , when 20 to 40 million people died .
Young healthy people with strong immune systems react most powerfully to the virus but the very strength of their reaction produces inflammation and secretions in the lungs which can be overwhelming .
In the US , the virus appears to be targeting children who are suffering only mild illness .
The difference in the two countries is so far unexplained .
One hypothesis is that a second virus may be circulating in Mexico which is interacting with the swine flu virus to produce more severe symptoms .
Q : How can I protect my family ?
A : By acquiring a stock of anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu or Relenza , available only on prescription at an NHS cost of around £ 20 for a course of 10 doses ( enough for one person ) .
Otherwise , the best defence is strict personal hygiene .
It is hard to better the advice printed by the ' News Of the World ' on 3 November 1918 : " Wash inside nose with soap and water night and morning ; force yourself to sneeze night and morning , then breathe deeply .
Do not wear a muffler , take sharp walks regularly and walk home from work ; eat plenty of porridge . "
Porridge is , of course , a known cure - all – but the rest of the advice holds as true today as it did then .
Q : Is there a vaccine against it ?
A : Not in humans ( there is in pigs ) .
Ordinary seasonal flu vaccine for humans might offer some protection because there are similarities between the H1N1 human flu viruses and the new H1N1 pig flu virus .
Investigations are under way to see if the seasonal vaccine would have a protective effect but those will " take some time " .
Q : Why has this outbreak started in Mexico and the US ?
A : No one knows , but it is certainly a surprise .
The next threat was expected to come from the Far East .
Avian flu has spread through poultry populations , and 400 humans have been infected , 250 of whom have died .
Health experts warned that a small mutation to the virus could turn a rare but lethal disease into one which could threaten the entire planet .
Now , the threat has emerged – but on the other side of the world .
Q : Is it safe to eat pork ?
A : Yes .
Cooking destroys the virus .
* Moody ’s cuts top Aaa ratings of Berkshire Hathaway
* Cites recession , investment losses in insurance ops
* Only S&P still has triple - A rating on Buffett firm
* 4 others , all non-financial , left with Aaa from Moody ’s ( Adds analyst comments , background on company , and remaining Aaa - rated companies )
NEW YORK , April 8 ( Reuters ) - Moody 's Investors Service cut its credit ratings on Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.NBRKb.N from Aaa , the top rating , saying the recession and investment losses at insurance operations of investor Warren Buffett 's holding company reduced its ability to support funding needs .
Wednesday ’s cut to Berkshire ’s rating means Moody ’s no longer has a Aaa rating on any company with significant financial - services operations .
Moody ’s cut the ratings on Omaha , Nebraska - based Berkshire to Aa2 , the third - highest investment grade , and cut to Aa1 , the second - highest , its ratings on Berkshire ’s reinsurance subsidiary National Indemnity Co and bond insurance arm Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp .
The outlook for all the ratings is stable , indicating an additional rating change is not anticipated over the next 12 to 18 months .
A Berkshire spokeswoman was not immediately available to comment .
The downgrade leaves Standard & Poor ’s as the only rating agency still ranking Berkshire AAA .
S&P changed its outlook on the company to negative on March 25 , indicating a cut from AAA is more likely .
S&P on Wednesday cut the ratings on all major U.S. mortgage insurers , saying the deterioration in the residential mortgage market had translated into greater delinquency rates than it had anticipated .
Moody 's cut to Berkshire 's ratings leaves only four other companies with its top rating : Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N , Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N , Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Automatic Data Processing Inc ADP.O .
FINANCIAL FALLOUT
Analysts said Berkshire ’s downgrade reflected what investors already knew -- that no one is immune from the worst financial crisis in decades .
“ This has been the most critical financial environment of our lifetimes , ” said Michael Holland , head of New York - based investment firm Holland & Co , which holds Berkshire shares .
“ Any financial company , including Warren Buffett ’s , has been affected by it .
Moody ’s is saying it is so , long after the fact . ”
“ Moody ’s is taking preemptive action , ” said Sean Egan , managing director of Egan - Jones Ratings Co in Haverford , Pennsylvania .
“ We think the Moody ’s downgrade is not a major move .
It wo n’t cost them a lot of business , ” Egan said , adding that his own ratings company would probably take Berkshire down a notch or two .
Berkshire is a large investor in Moody’s .
Falling stock prices have reduced the value of National Indemnity ’s investment portfolio , in turn weakening its capital cushion relative to its insurance and investment exposures , Moody ’s said in a statement .
Other , non-insurance businesses at the company have also seen “ a meaningful drop in earnings and cash flows , particularly for businesses tied to the U.S. housing market , construction , retailing or consumer finance , ” Moody ’s added .
Since taking over Berkshire in 1965 , Buffett has transformed it from a failing textile maker into a sprawling insurance and investment company , with more than 70 businesses .
Berkshire products include Geico car insurance , Borsheim 's Fine Jewelry and Fruit of the Loom underwear .
Its investments include American Express Co AXP.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N .
The company ’s bond insurance arm Berkshire Hathaway Assurance had been the only insurer of municipal bonds to have retained its top credit rating , although it has not been a major player in insuring primary deals .
Fitch ratings cut Berkshire to AA , the third - highest investment grade , on March 12 .

There were no immediate reports of a struggle during the arrest A man described as the military leader of the Basque separatist group Eta has been captured in south - western France , Spanish government sources say .
Jurdan Martitegi was detained with two other suspected Eta members near Perpignan in a joint Franco - Spanish security operation .
Another six suspected Eta members were detained in Bilbao and other cities .
The news comes just over a week since the arrest in Paris of another top Eta suspect , Ekaitz Sirvent Auzmendi .
Mr Martitegi is the third suspected Eta military chief to be detained by the French security forces in the past five months .
Eta is blamed for the deaths of more than 820 people in its 40 - year campaign for an independent Basque nation .
Arrest after arrest
The three men arrested on Saturday were armed with three pistols and had a car with false number plates , Spanish media report .
A suspected woman member of Eta was also arrested in France this week French police say they were picked up in Montauriol , in the eastern Pyrenees region which borders Spain .
The Spanish interior ministry named one of the other detained suspects as Alexander Uriarte Cuadrado , adding that the third had not been conclusively identified .
Mr Martitegi is alleged to have assumed the military command of Eta since the arrest in December of Aitzol Irionda , also in south - west France .
Mr Irionda himself had allegedly just taken over the military command from Mikel Garikoitz Aspiazu Rubina , also known as Txeroki , after the latter 's arrest in France in October .
Once regarded as a safe haven for Basque militants , France began arresting Eta suspects after the group called off a 15 - month - old ceasefire in June 2007 .
A suspected woman member of Eta , Itxaso Legorburu Madinabeitia , was arrested in the central French town of Mezieres - en - Brenne on Thursday .
Another suspected member with her managed to escape .
The two had reportedly been inside a gun shop when they aroused suspicion and police were called .

The high end of the market is just getting slaughtered in New York and the surrounding areas .
A recent report indicated that the price of Manhattan townhouses was basically clipped in half in the first quarter .
And the same trend is bad news for tony Hamptons real estate brokers selling summer homes :
Bloomberg : Home sales in the Hamptons , the New York oceanside communities favored by financiers and celebrities , plunged 67 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier as Wall Street job cuts and investment losses stifled demand for second homes .
Across 11 eastern Long Island towns , 96 homes sold in the three months ended March 31 , marking the biggest percentage drop in at least 27 years , property broker Town & Country Real Estate said .
It was the biggest percentage drop in their records , which date to 1982 .
In the same quarter of 2008 , 287 homes sold .
What 's more , average prices have fallen by 28 % .
So when you factor that in to the 67 % volume decline , you 're looking at dollar volume down by about 77 % .
That 's a crash 's crash .
• Newspaper to be available only on messaging service • Experts say any story can be told in 140 characters
Consolidating its position at the cutting edge of new media technology , the Guardian today announces that it will become the first newspaper in the world to be published exclusively via Twitter , the sensationally popular social networking service that has transformed online communication .
The move , described as " epochal " by media commentators , will see all Guardian content tailored to fit the format of Twitter 's brief text messages , known as " tweets " , which are limited to 140 characters each .
Boosted by the involvement of celebrity " twitterers " , such as Madonna , Britney Spears and Stephen Fry , Twitter 's profile has surged in recent months , attracting more than 5 m users who send , read and reply to tweets via the web or their mobile phones .
As a Twitter - only publication , the Guardian will be able to harness the unprecedented newsgathering power of the service , demonstrated recently when a passenger on a plane that crashed outside Denver was able to send real - time updates on the story as it developed , as did those witnessing an emergency landing on New York 's Hudson River .
It has also radically democratised news publishing , enabling anyone with an internet connection to tell the world when they are feeling sad , or thinking about having a cup of tea .
" [ Celebrated Guardian editor ] CP Scott would have warmly endorsed this - his well - known observation ' Comment is free but facts are sacred ' is only 36 characters long , " a spokesman said in a tweet that was itself only 135 characters long .
A mammoth project is also under way to rewrite the whole of the newspaper 's archive , stretching back to 1821 , in the form of tweets .
Major stories already completed include " 1832 Reform
Act gives voting rights to one in five adult males yay !!! " ; " OMG Hitler invades Poland , allies declare war see tinyurl.com / b5x6e for more " ; and " JFK assassin8d @ Dallas , def. heard second gunshot from grassy knoll WTF ? "
Sceptics have expressed concerns that 140 characters may be insufficient to capture the full breadth of meaningful human activity , but social media experts say the spread of Twitter encourages brevity , and that it ought to be possible to convey the gist of any message in a tweet .
For example , Martin Luther King 's legendary 1963 speech on the steps of the Lincoln memorial appears in the Guardian 's Twitterised archive as " I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by " , eliminating the waffle and bluster of the original .
At a time of unprecedented challenge for all print media , many publications have rushed to embrace social networking technologies .
Most now offer Twitter feeds of major breaking news headlines , while the Daily Mail recently pioneered an iPhone application providing users with a one - click facility for reporting suspicious behaviour by migrants or gays .
" In the new media environment , readers want short and punchy coverage , while the interactive possibilities of Twitter promise to transform th , " the online media guru Jeff Jarvis said in a tweet yesterday , before reaching his 140 - character limit , which includes spaces .
According to subsequent reports , he is thinking about going to the theatre tonight , but it is raining :(.
A unique collaboration between The Guardian and Twitter will also see the launch of Gutter , an experimental service designed to filter noteworthy liberal opinion from the cacophony of Twitter updates .
Gutter members will be able to use the service to comment on liberal blogs around the web via a new tool , specially developed with the blogging platform WordPress , entitled GutterPress .
Currently , 17.8 % of all Twitter traffic in the United Kingdom consists of status updates from Stephen Fry , whose reliably jolly tone , whether trapped in a lift or eating a scrumptious tart , has won him thousands of fans .
A further 11 % is made up of his 363,000 followers replying " @stephenfry LOL ! " , " @stephenfry EXACTLY the same thing happened to me " , and " @stephenfry Meanwhile , I am making myself an omelette !
Delicious ! "
According to unconfirmed rumours , Jim Buckmaster , the chief executive of Craigslist , will next month announce plans for a new system of telepathy - based social networking that is expected to render Twitter obsolete within weeks .

The 114 people were arrested at a school in the Sneinton Dale area More than 100 people have been arrested in Nottingham over a suspected plan to target a power station .
Police said 114 men and women were arrested in Sneinton Dale on suspicion of conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass and criminal damage .
Officers said they believed those arrested were planning to protest at nearby Ratcliffe - on - Soar power station .
Police said equipment including bolt - cutters was found and they feared a threat to the safety of the site .
A police spokesman said it was thought there was a " serious threat " to the coal - fired power station , which is eight miles south - west of Nottingham .
More than 200 police officers from Nottinghamshire , Derbyshire , Leicestershire , Staffordshire and British Transport Police were involved in the arrests at the Iona School .
' Real bedlam '
There were no reported injuries .
The Ratcliffe - on - Soar power station has previously been targeted by members of the Eastside Climate Action , although the group has denied any involvement in the latest suspected plot .
Eleven people from the group were arrested in April 2007 after chaining themselves to buildings and equipment at the site .
Eon , which operates the power station , said it was helping the police with their investigation .
City councillor David Mellen said the police raided the privately - run school as a result of " an intelligence - led operation " .
The operation is understood to have been " intelligence - led "
He said : " I do n't know whether it was the school itself being used or the car park .
" Neighbours reported a lot of noise after midnight .
It seems to have been used as a rendezvous for people from a wide area . "
No-one at the school was available for comment .
Residents in the suburb of Sneinton contacted the BBC with reports of a large police presence in the area .
Tess Rearden , who lives near where the arrests were made , said she saw 20 police vehicles .
She said : " It was all slamming of doors and van doors and all these vans were coming up here - police vans , riot vans .
" My son came out of his bedroom and he said : ' Have you seen what 's going on out front ? '
Police had big black and yellow bin bags full of something which they took away
Susan Lawson , neighbour " They were all up and down the roads here .
It was bedlam , real bedlam . "
Residents said handcuffed suspects sang loudly as they were led away .
Susan Lawson , 56 , who lives opposite the school , said : " The police said to me ' get in the house and do n't come out ' .
" Then I saw them bringing people out of the school gates in handcuffs and putting them into vans .
" The vans kept coming back to pick up more of them .
Police had big black and yellow bin bags full of something which they took away .
The coal - fired facility is eight miles from Nottingham " I was shocked , I could n't get back to sleep afterwards .
It was terrible . "
Speaking on behalf of Eastside Climate Action , Bob Andrews said : " We do n't know anything about the arrests last night .
" It was n't us and we do n't know who has been arrested .
" But if people were planning to shut [ the plant ] down like we tried to do two years ago then that is great news .
" We would fully support people taking safe and responsible action to stop carbon emissions .
" Ratcliffe is the third biggest single source of CO2 in the country ; it has got to be closed down if we are serious about climate change . "

Sri Lanka ’s Hidden Massacre : The Times Report
By Catherine Philp
30 May , 2009
The Times
Colombo : More than 20,000 Tamil civilians were killed in the final throes of the Sri Lankan civil war , most as a result of government shelling , an investigation by The Times has revealed .
The number of casualties is three times the official figure .
The Sri Lankan authorities have insisted that their forces stopped using heavy weapons on April 27 and observed the no-fire zone where 100,000 Tamil men , women and children were sheltering .
They have blamed all civilian casualties on Tamil Tiger rebels concealed among the civilians .
Aerial photographs , official documents , witness accounts and expert testimony tell a different story .
With the world ’s media and aid organisations kept well away from the fighting , the army launched a fierce barrage that began at the end of April and lasted about three weeks .
The offensive ended Sri Lanka ’s 26 - year civil war with the Tamil Tigers , but innocent civilians paid the price .
Confidential United Nations documents acquired by The Times record nearly 7,000 civilian deaths in the no-fire zone up to the end of April .
UN sources said that the toll then surged , with an average of 1,000 civilians killed each day until May 19 , the day after Velupillai Prabhakaran , the leader of the Tamil Tigers , was killed .
That figure concurs with the estimate made to The Times by Father Amalraj , a Roman Catholic priest who fled the no-fire zone on May 16 and is now interned with 200,000 other survivors in Manik Farm refugee camp .
It would take the final toll above 20,000 .
“ Higher , ” a UN source told The Times .
“ Keep going . ”
Some of the victims can be seen in the photograph above , which shows the destruction of the flimsy refugee camp .
In the bottom right - hand corner , sand mounds show makeshift burial grounds .
Other pictures show a more orderly military cemetery , believed to be for hundreds of rebel fighters .
One photograph shows rebel gun emplacements next to the refugee camp .
Independent defence experts who analysed dozens of aerial photographs taken by The Times said that the arrangement of the army and rebel firing positions and the narrowness of the no-fire zone made it unlikely that Tiger mortar fire or artillery caused a significant number of deaths .
“ It looks more likely that the firing position has been located by the Sri Lankan Army and it has then been targeted with air - burst and ground - impact mortars , ” said Charles Heyman , editor of the magazine Armed Forces of the UK .
On Wednesday , Sri Lanka was cleared of any wrongdoing by the UN Human Rights Council after winning the backing of countries including China , Egypt , India and Cuba .
A spokesman for the Sri Lankan High Commission in London said : “ We reject all these allegations .
Civilians have not been killed by government shelling at all .
If civilians have been killed , then that is because of the actions of the LTTE [ rebels ] who were shooting and killing people when they tried to escape . ”
BrisConnections faces a nightmarish cash hunt for investors who have transferred their units into false names — including one who allegedly used the moniker " Humphrey B Bear " .
Others have transferred units into the names of people living overseas .
All registered holders of BrisConnections units on April 22 must pay a $ 1 instalment to the company for every unit they own , due on April 29 .
To avoid that payment a number of BrisConnections unit holders have used the off - market share transfer system to shift ownership into false names .
In November last year BusinessDay highlighted a serious flaw in the off - market transfer system that allows shares to be held in false names , by buying a share in a listed company in the name of a pet budgie named Mr Bud Gerigar .
Dobson :
It sounded , Carrie , like your first reaction was to hedge , to say " Well , this is a free country " and then something took over .
Prej ean :
It really was a switch .
Dobson :
And you did one of the most courageous things I 've seen anybody your age or anybody else do .
What was going on in your mind ?
Prejean : I started off by saying I want to win this pageant so bad , I 've worked so hard , I wanted to sound politically correct but still stay true to my values .
But I just knew at that moment that God was just telling me " Carrie , how bad do you want this ?
Are you willing to compromise your beliefs for a one year crown of Miss USA . "
And I just knew right there . . .
And I said you know what and the switch went off .
And I said , " A marriage should be between a man and a woman and that 's how it should be . "
. . . .
And I knew there was no way I was going to win Miss USA .
No way .
Dobson :
So you put it on the line , that 's what I mean when I said you 're courageous because this was the goal of your life to that point .
And yet you gave it up .
And yet the Lord is using you all over this country .
Prejean :
And we are all faced with that at times .
And just by me being here , I want to encourage other people that when you 're faced with an issue which you know in your heart what to say , but you 're faced with someone asking it , do n't ever compromise that just for pleasing them .
Your goal should be to please God , not to please man . . . .
Dobson :
Why did you give the answer you did with regard to the affirmation of marriage ?
Prejean : . . .
I felt as though Satan was trying to tempt me in asking me this question .
And then God was in my head and in my heart saying , " Do not compromise this .
You need to stand up for me and you need to share with all these people . . . you need to witness to them and you need to show that you 're not willing to compromise that for this title of Miss USA . "
And I knew right here that it was n't about winning .
It was about being true to my convictions .
With almost no controversial news allowed to appear in martial law ruled Fiji , one newspaper has decided to inject some humour into the situation .
The Bainimarama regime has imposed a state of emergency and introduced censorship of news media .
The country ’s smallest of three daily newspapers , the Fiji Daily Post , has responded to it with some humour .
One story it published was headlined “ Breakfast as usual ” .
The story went on :
" It was breakfast as usual for the staff of this newspaper .
' I had leftover roti from last night ' , senior reporter Manueli told his colleague yesterday morning .
Staff gasped with delight when Fiji Daily Post receptionist Lupe said her breakfast was a cup of latte coffee along with toasted currant bread . "
Another published story reported on a man getting on a bus .
" It was easy , " he said .
" I just lifted one leg up and then the other and I was on " .
A further story was headlined " Paint dry " .
It quoted a man called Max who painted a couch .
" It just went on wet , but after about four hours , it started to dry " .
" That was when I realised , paint dries , " the young scholar observed .

After drinking a chemical dissolved in water , mice with damaged hearts turn from couch potatoes into treadmill tearaways , researchers say .
The finding raises hopes that the same substance can invigorate patients weakened from heart attacks by increasing the supply of oxygen to damaged cardiac muscle .
Designed to make haemoglobin release more of its oxygen than normal , the drug , myo- inositol trispyrophosphate ( ITPP ) boosted exercise levels in the ailing mice by 35 % when given dissolved in water .
When given by injection into the abdomen , exercise levels rose a massive 60 % .
“ ITPP does n’t deliver oxygen itself , but makes haemoglobin able to release a larger amount of oxygen to tissues , ” explains Jean - Marie Lehn of the University of Strasbourg in France .

Normally , he says , haemoglobin releases only 25 % of its oxygen cargo during one circuit of the body .
But when ITPP binds to haemoglobin , it releases 35 % more than usual , boosting supplies of oxygen to tissues without people having to inhale any extra air .
Sports warning
Further evidence of increased oxygen supply came from blood samples taken from the mice showing a fivefold reduction within just three days of hypoxia - inducible factor , a chemical distress signal produced by oxygen - starved tissue .
The results also suggested that the effects from a single dose could last almost a week , so patients would n’t need to take ITPP every day .
Unlike artificial blood substitutes , which have run into practical and ethical problems during clinical trials , ITPP simply boosts the efficiency with which native blood supplies tissues with oxygen .
It is also very similar to a naturally occurring chemical made in the body , myo-inositol .
As a result , Lehn hopes to begin clinical trials “ as soon as possible ” .
For athletes tempted to use the substance to enhance performance , he warns : “ It could be very easily detected . ”
‘ Novel approach ’
Lehn says that studies are under way to find out exactly how ITPP interferes with haemoglobin to make it give up more oxygen .
He says that the substance is not natural , but is related to myo- inositol , a substance found in rice and cereals .
Peter Weissberg , medical director of the British Heart Foundation , says that inadequate oxygen delivery to tissue causes many symptoms of heart failure .
“ Around 700,000 people in the UK alone are living with heart failure , and inadequate tissue oxygen delivery is the cause of many of the symptoms – particularly fatigue and poor exercise tolerance , ” he says .
Such a novel approach is welcome , says Weissberg , given the limited success of existing treatments based on increasing heart output or improving blood circulation .
“ They ’ve found a molecule that can boost the amount of oxygen transferred from blood to the muscles , ” he says .
“ If a similar effect can be achieved in [ humans ] , it will raise the possibility of a new treatment to improve debilitating heart failure symptoms . ”

In Basra 's Hayaniyah district , a notorious stronghold of Shia militias , a US army sergeant leading a patrol faced two suspects in the street .
Amid rising tension he produced a gadget from his pocket and after a few minutes of its use the matter was amicably resolved .
The Iraqis and the Americans went their separate ways .
The equipment being used – described by the US Army as ideal for 21st - century warfare – was an Apple iPod Touch .
In a matter of minutes the soldier had established through words and images that the two men were not considered to be serious threats and detaining them was unnecessary .
Apple 's iPods and iPhones , symbols of a modern urban lifestyle , are now in use in a very different setting – the front lines of Iraq and Afghanistan .
They are , say the US forces , ideal for the age of " network centric warfare " , relatively easy to use , safe with secure software , and far cheaper than manufacturing a military version .

The sheer versatility of the kit – with the capability of over 30,000 programmes – allows a huge variety of functions needed for operations ranging from providing language translations to the transmitting of sensitive information and working out trajectories for snipers .
Projects are on the way to use them as guidance systems for bomb disposal robots and receivers of aerial footage from unmanned drone aircraft .
The US Marine Corps is funding an application that would allow soldiers to upload photographs of detained suspects , along with written reports , into a biometric database .
The software would match faces , in theory making it easier to track suspects after they 're released .
Members of the British military who have seen the Apple instruments in action drool about the opportunities on offer .
The Ministry of Defence , however , remains wary of security implications and has " no plans " at present to go down the American path .
But Lieutenant Colonel Jim Ross , the director of the US Army 's intelligence , electronic warfare and sensors operation , believes the iPod " may be all that the personnel need " .
" What gives it added advantage is that a lot of them have their own personal ones so they are familiar with them , " he said .
Another plus is the cost .
The iPod touch ( which soldiers can use over a secure WiFi network ) retails for around $ 230 ( £ 150 ) and the iPhone for $ 600 .
Bulk orders placed by the Pentagon bring further savings .
The manufacture of a specific military model would be much more expensive .
Robert Emerson , a security analyst who has advised foreign governments on computerised warfare , said : " The US military has had a reputation for being somewhat heavy handed , with justice .
But what they are doing with iPods and iPhones show they can also be nimble on their feet .
Other militaries should learn to be equally open minded . "
Have we put the horse in front of the cart ?
Are we getting ahead of ourselves ?
Equity market rely on a 6 - 9 month lead , but this 9 - week rally erasing all of 2009 losses has been astounding .
All what is broken now fixed ?
Stronger seasonal earnings have driven the markets , but no one is adjusting future earnings just yet !
Despite all last weeks event risk becoming public do not be surprised to see the market take stock of its recent euphoric rise .
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 12 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœsubduedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Capital markets are clearly in risk loving mood after last week ’s ECB decision ( - 25 bp ease ) , US bank stress test results and a stabilization of the US unemployment increase ( not a trend , but a start ) .
Even China is contributing to this euphoric rise from the ashes .
Recent statements ( despite worrying about their currency reserves ) continue to positively influence the markets .
All of the above reasons will only further contribute towards the USD decline .
Expect little consolidation as the major trading partners breach currency technical levels .
Most frightening has been the poor response to the US long bond auction last week .
The government continues to issue new maturities to finance debt .
However the market is beginning to drown in supply !
A betting individual would expect the greenback to grind lower
The USD $ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.32 % , GBP - 0.31 % , CHF - 0.39 % and lower against JPY + 0.40 % .
The commodity currencies are mixed this morning , CAD +0.13 % and AUD - 0.28 % .
Wow !
The loonie posted its 6th - weekly gain after Canadian employers unexpectedly added jobs last month ( +35.9 k vs. Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ 48.5 ) and US payrolls fell less than forecasted ( - 539 k vs. Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ610 k ) and providing stronger evidence that the economic slowdown may be moderating .
Of course global equities and commodities rallying also helped this highly correlated risk currency .
Unlike its southern partner , Canadian unemployment rate held steady at + 8.0 % .
Technically , the underlying fundamentals remain healthy in this environment , which is starting to convince speculators to purchase the currency on USD rallies .
This stronger data will allow the BOC to breathe a sigh of relief .
The market can expect no additional measures to be implemented any time soon by Governor Carney .
Despite the move been swift and violent , the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœtrend remains your friendÃ¢â‚¬â „¢!
Last week was another winning week for the best performing currency this year vs. the USD ( +9.3 % ) .
It was the 10th - weekly advance , the longest streak in 6 - years .
Fundamentals look good , the currency managed print a 7 - month high in the O/N session vs. the USD and JPY on speculation that the global equity markets will extend their 2 - month gains as deep recession fears subside ( 0.7630 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 57.62 down - 101c ) .
Crude managed to gain +10 % last week after various reports surprised to the upside .
Firstly , US home sales and manufacturing in China Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœboosted optimismÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ about the global economy .
Secondly , the weekly EIA crude inventory numbers climbed less than forecasted and finally , FridayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s payroll numbers fell by Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ539 k vs. an anticipated loss of Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ699k .
Technically , the market is primed to make an assault on $ 62 a barrel in the short term .
However , fundamentally the underlined reports suggest that this market is overextended as overall US demand remains weak despite the black stuff printing a 6 - month high on Friday as the greenback traded under pressure vs. the EUR , which supports the demand for commodities as an alternative investment .
Too far too quickly , look for assets classes to pare some of their gains or losses .
Last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s
The EIA release was Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœbullishÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ in respect to the other reports of late .
Crude supplies rose +605 k barrels to +375.3 m last week ( a new 19 - year high ) , but less than the forecasted + 2.5 m gain .
Meanwhile gas supplies fell - 167 k to +212.4 m vs. a +500 k gain and distillate fuel ( heating oil and diesel ) , rose + 2.43 m barrels to +146.5 m , the highest print in 32 - months .
Gold continues its rally as a safe heaven alternative as Cbanks actions may spur inflation , thus increasing the demand for the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as a hedge ( $ 915 ) .
The Nikkei closed 9,451 up +19 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,851 down - 61 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,417 down - 44 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 1 bp on Friday ( 3.30 % ) and a further 6 bp in the O/N session ( 3.24 % ) .
Despite a higher unemployment rate printed on Friday , treasuries managed to have another weekly loss , the 7th in a row and the longest losing stretch in 5 - years .
Last week the US government tendered $ 71 b of new debt .
Their borrowing requirements are starting to overwhelm the market as noted by the $ 14b long bond auction on Thursday .
Investors and dealers managed to push yields aggressively higher and make the Fed pay up to attract buyers .
We are back to trading the supply and demand push - pull by the US government and the Fed .
With the abundance of supply and the pickup in economic activity , dealers will not support the longer end of the curve .
The Fed will have to increase their buy - back program to keep rates low ( +600b ) otherwise these high rates will stifle any growth that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s been promised .
With yields rapidly rising of late perhaps its time to own some ?

OTTAWA  Members of the Canadian Auto Workers union overwhelmingly approved another cost- cutting agreement with General Motors of Canada on Monday .
The union said that 86 percent of its members supported the agreement , which is the third contract negotiated with G.M. in just over a year .
The union reopened a contract reached last May and agreed to cutbacks in March .
But the governments of Canada and Ontario said they would not provide the company with financial aid unless the union agreed to accept further cuts .
“ Although we were forced to make a number of important sacrifices , the support we received from our members is proof that they recognize the incredible challenges the industry is facing , ” Ken Lewenza , the union ’s president , said in a statement issued on Monday evening .
The union represents about 10,000 people at G.M .
FEATURES Learning to Become a Game Developer : An Interview with Jean - Francois L�vesque , Ubisoft Montreal [ 03.03.09 ]
- Jill Duffy
Jean - Francois Lévesque is a game play programmer at Ubisoft Montreal , who worked extremely hard to be where he is today .
When he first contacted me , it was a cold - call email with the subject line " Giving back . "
Lévesque wrote simply that he was grateful to be working as a game developer and wanted to know if he could be useful in some way to the community of people here at GameCareerGuide who are seeking advice about breaking in to the game development industry .
We exchanged a few emails .
I asked him about his experiences in climbing up the industry ladder .
I knew Lévesque had been featured on sister site Gamasutra for the remarkable work he and artist Matthias Baillet did on Far Cry 2's fire system .
What I did n't know was how he got to that stage .
In this interview , Lévesque talks about his path from working in telecommunications in a remote Canadian village , to feeling prepared to apply for a big video game job in Montreal .
He shares some of the details of his job interviews , both the good and the bad , as well as the programming projects he worked on to make himself qualified to apply for those jobs in the first place .
Jill Duffy :
Tell us a little bit about yourself , where you grew up , what kinds of things interested you as a child and as an adult , your family .
Jean - Francois Lévesque : I grew up in a small town in the province of Quebec , Canada .
I was born at the end of the 1970s , and I was lucky enough to start playing video games when they were still big pixels on the screen .
I lived the evolution from the Atari 2600 to the current consoles .
The games that most impressed me at the time were all the Sierra classics , like Police Quest , Space Quest , King Quest , and some LucasArts titles , like Day of the Tentacle .
Maybe it 's because I 'm getting old , but the games of today do n't hold a special place in my memories like they used to .
The old Sierra games were all text - based adventure games .
You had to type the action you wanted to accomplish , for example , " Take the keys " or , " Open the door . "
Since I am French - Canadian and I did n't know a single word in English , I improved my second language skills a lot by playing them .
JD : For quite a few GameCareerGuide readers , English is not their first language .
At work , I presume you speak mostly French .
Do you think speaking English , or at least speaking a little English , is important to becoming a game developer ?
JFL : Absolutely .
I would n't say it 's essential , because you may make indie video games in your basement , but if you want to open yourself to the world , it 's most likely needed .
One nice thing about being a video game developer is that your skills are exportable .
The methods to develop a game differ around the world , but there are enough similarities to make you valuable anywhere .
What that means is that , most likely , your co-workers will have different nationalities and different mother tongues .
English then becomes the common language .
As a side note , when I started in the industry , I was very concerned about my English proficiency .
I found that I had a limited vocabulary and a very thick French accent .
After some time , I realized that none of my co-workers cared .
They understood me well enough , and that it was never seen as a problem .
JD : What else do you remember about how video games influenced your childhood and personal development ?
JFL : Surprisingly , as a child , I do n't recall playing video games that much .
I would rather go outside and enjoy myself with my friends .
Playing video games was an activity , but played among many other kids and was often a way to socialize with them , to get together and have fun .
It 's only a lot later , when I got older , that I developed an unhealthy addiction for EverQuest .
I could sometimes play entire days .
I learned my lesson , and today I stay away from MMOGs .
Other than that , I guess I would qualify as a novice - geek .
I played a fair amount of D&D .
That sure gives me some points .
I read fantasy books .
I enjoy watching sci-fi movies -- but I 'm no Trekkie or Star Wars evangelist .
I 'm also not so well versed in any of that stuff to defend my point of view in a geek rant .
JD : What is your educational background ?
What degrees do you have ?

Will Obama , McCain , Dodd Return Contributions From AIG Employees ?
As AIG accepted bailout funds , it still made contributions to some big names .
March 18 , 2009 -- AIG employees kept doling out donations to politicians , including presidential candidate Barack Obama , after getting bailed out with federal funds last year , raising the question of whether those politicians will now return the money .
AIG executives gave more than $ 630,000 during the 2008 political cycle even as the company was falling apart
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , which tracks campaign finance reports , more than $ 120,000 of that money was donated after AIG received its first $ 85 billion in federal bailout funds in September .
The company has since received a total of $ 170 billion in taxpayer cash to prevent its collapse .
Their generosity included more than $ 23,000 to Obama 's campaign .
Both Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain raked in much larger sums from AIG earlier in the year .
Obama collected a total of $ 130,000 from AIG in 2008 , while McCain accepted a total of $ 59,499 .
This raises two key questions :
Was any bailout money used to make political contributions ?
And will the politicians who received AIG cash give the money back ?
ABC News has asked the question of the big recipients of AIG cash on Capitol Hill , including Rep. Paul Kanjorski , D - Pa. , the guy chairing today 's AIG hearing .
Kanjorski received $ 12,000 in AIG contributions during the 2008 political cycle .
AIG 's CEO Edward Liddy said he imposed new rules when he took over the struggling insurance giant six months ago , banning further lobbying of politicians and ending political donations from AIG 's two political action committees .
Records indicate that AIG's PACs stopped making donations , but contributions from AIG executives continued right up to the presidential election .
One suggestion : Perhaps the money could be paid back not to AIG but to the U.S. Treasury .
Here 's the list of top AIG recipients for the 2008 campaign :
1. Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , $ 103,100
2. Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , $ 101,332
3. Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , $ 59,499
4. Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , $ 35,965
5. Sen. Max Baucus , D - Mont. , $ 24,750
6. Former Gov. Mitt Romney , ( R ) Pres $ 20,850
7. Sen. Joe Biden , D - Del. , $ 19,975
8. Rep. John Larson , D - Conn , $ 19,750
9. Sen. John Sununu , R - N.H. , $ 18,500
10 . Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ( R ) Pres $ 13,200
11 . Rep. Paul Kanjorski , D - Pa. , $ 12,000
12 . Sen. Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , $ 11,000
Fans of Brazilian Soccer Team Fluminense Invade Team ’s Practice , One Punches Player : Video
Fluminense fans are not happy with their team ’s play as of late .
Following two home losses to fellow Brazilian sides Corinthians and Santos , fans decided they ’d had enough and visited the team during practice .
Supporters chanted and swore at players throughout the training session , claiming the players were not trying their best and were more worried about nightlife than their play .
Eventually , around 30 fans rushed the field , with one man throwing punches at midfielder Diguinho , who quickly ran back inside the locker room .
Conflicting reports have come out about this invasion , as the fans claim that security guards fired warning shots into the air , but the club denies this , saying their employees have no guns .
Practice continued later on , but fans still continued to argue with club officials .
One employee , Marcelo Penha , said there would be extra security in the future and added :
We understand that Fluminense supporters are not satisfied with recent results but we will not accept , under any circumstances , the acts of vandalism that were carried out today .
It ’s unacceptable that the players are attacked by vandals , especially at their place of work .
And that concludes today ’s reminder of why Brazilian soccer fans are crazy .
More videos of angry Fluminense fans voicing their displeasure at their team ’s practice session can be found below :

Why dont you report on the true nature and spirit of these rallies ?
For me , and hundreds of others in Santa Rosa , Ca , this event was non-partisan .
This evet saw a majority of End , or Audit the ( un ) Federal Reserve signs .
It was about No Taxation without Representation .
Or maybe you like the War of Terror , Bank Bailouts , and warantless wiretapping ?
While major attrocities are happening , you are " reporting " on tea - baggers , a lame attempt at sexual humor ... FOX , and MSNBC set the bait , and you bit .
Instead of dividing us , why not try to unite us with the origin of these events ?

Did you forget some of them actually wanted to end the war !
You have no idea how Pyscology works , and how Fox and MSNBC are playing you all like a rope in the middle of tug - o - war !
Its time YOU get over the fact that arent represented , and start doing something other than supporting Presidents that wiretap without warrants , torture , rendition programs , Bank bailouts , etc ...

Simple , our beloved corporate oligarchy , the ones behind the tea parties , is calling everyone who protested on April 15th one of ' their " teabaggers ... regardless .
As has been pointed out elsewhere it will happen again on July 4th .
What Brian and similar disaffecteds do n't understand is that they 're not being given a choice in this " alliance " ... if they protest on any issue that could possibly be called conservative then their numbers will be used to pad the rolls of the wingnuts .
The oligarchs will see to that .

Brian -
If you believe these protests were about the largely legitimate conservative concerns of the Ron Paul Libertarians , I got news for you , you allowed yourselves to be co-opted by wingnutted GOP partisans , clueless self - destructive Fox " News " stooges , and cynical manipulative corporatists .
... maybe you like the War of Terror , Bank Bailouts , and warantless wiretapping ?
Feel free to show us the photos and media coverage of all of those signs and protests against the " War of Terror " and warrantless wiretapping , Brian .
I watched quite a bit of coverage on Fox , CNN , MSNBC and did n't happen to see any such signs of protest .
As I said , even if you think that 's what you were protesting , the bulk of your comrades were not , have , in fact , shown themselves to be in favor of those things over the past eight years , with no sign of changing .
Otherwise , we'd have seen all sorts of signs for arresting George W. Bush for War Crimes , rather than signs claiming Obama is a " fascist " .
Instead of dividing us , why not try to unite us with the origin of these events ?
1773 , Boston .
The 1773 protest was against multi-national corporatism in collusion with the British government at the time .
I 'd suspect that 99 % of the folks at this week 's protest have n't a clue about that , otherwise , they'd be yelling and screaming to end our Corporatocracy , which they were not .
Though I very much appreciate your thoughts here --- and hope you 'll continue to share them --- your gross generalizations against " you all " here would be far better ( and more accurately ) spent on the wingnut tea bagger sore loser sites , educating them on the real problems we face , because the Ron Paul ReLOVEutionaries have been overshadowed again by the sore loser opportunists who do n't give a damn about the legitimate interests that you and the other Paul folks have been trying to yell and scream about for years .

I do n't know , guys .
Seems to me Brian 's biggest gripe is that anyone 's bothering to perpetuate the right / left / left / right antagonism that has proven such a powerful tool for the politicians felons who are ruining our country .
That is a really good question , Brian .
I think the reason it wo n't go away is because sheeple are unerringly roused by such prurient stuff , and that gets ratings on tv and radio and blogs .
So .
The media , MSM and independent , just do n't seem to be able to resist it and get on real subjects .
It drives me crazy , too .
The left , " liberals " and " progressives " ... whatever they call themselves ... finger - pointing dirty - name - calling holier - than - thou politically - correct rubes are very plainly every bit as guilty of this crap as the un-American greed - head social Darwinist rubes on the right !
And , you are so right , they do n't see it .
They get off on dissing the snot out of the other side just as much as the other side gets off on the same kind of action .
People just can't seem to drag their brains up a level to look at it objectively --- they think their own positions are objective , do n't grok that just because it seems to make sense to them does n't mean it 's objectively so .
This so seriously sucks because we have to be raising our brains up at least a notch , maybe many of them , in order to solve the heinous problems facing us .
Thanks for trying .

The irony of calling Obama a " fascist " when the last 8 years , the fusion of the defense industry with government ( the main definition of fascism ) , with Carlyle Group ( Bush family and friends ) and Halliburton ( Cheney family and friends ) IN the White house , shows the absurdity of the Right - wing 's " perspective " .
Actually , they , standard Roboticans , do n't have any , because the GOP billionaire class keeps exploiting their ignorance , getting these " tea party " games rolling .
The brilliant Jim Hightower said during the Bush years , " The corporations do n't have to lobby the government , anymore , they ARE the government . "
THAT is the definition of fascism , that collusion .
And what do ya know , along came torture , elimination of habeous corpus , illegal spying , every imaginable war crime , invasion of an innocent country , killing over a million human beings , and so much more , and they dare call Obama , a fascist .

Brian , Former Ron Paul supporter ( and regular Bradblog reader ) here , who has been up nights worrying about the effect of these so called Tea Bag Protests on the super - saavy , bold , informed RP folks I had the pleasure to work with during the campaign .
After contacting many of them , I found that most of them are not drinking the FOX FIX / Glen Bleck retardation , thankfully , and after attending many of them wrote extensively about their gross disappointment that Fox perpetrated and promoted this National anti-Obama rally under the guise of protesting TAXES .
They know that ( I could n't have put it better than Brad ) : " ... the Ron Paul ReLOVEutionaries have been overshadowed again by the sore loser opportunists who do n't give a damn about the legitimate interests that you and the other Paul folks have been trying to yell and scream about for years . "
Righto .
As for the " taxation without representation " being their beacon call to re-enact and emulate our famous Boston uprising - Well , now we have an interesting quandry ...
We DO , in fact , have representation .
We may not LIKE who has been chosen to represent us through the democratic process , or approve of the job they 're doing .
We may feel , and many of us do , that we are being UNDER - represented by these Poops , and have no voice in shaping future policy .
But we are represented , nonetheless .
That is , until you factor in how easy it is manipulate election results , and effectively the subsequent media coverage of them .
All who follow this blog , Brian , Dem / Independent and Conservative , are extremely well versed and super informed on this subject matter .
They have taken years of their lives to grasp every hard fact , and amass the data .
Lots of independent thinkers , here .
If we are n't electing our elected officials , then no , we 're NOT being represented .
So - I suppose we DO INDEED have taxation without representation !
Yet I did n't hear ANYTHING about stolen elections at any of these comical - but - creepy protests .
Brad nailed it .
They 're USING us .

brian & brad ,
i saw signs that said " show me the law " , " end the fed " on msnbc , i believe both income tax and the fed r illegal but the last leaders that tried to confront this were lincoln and kennedy ( by printing us backed money instead of fed reserve notes ) and we know what happened to them fox saw an opportunity to " steal " the libs numbers and present them as neo con numbers , since they cant get 30 peops to a rally not alone a couple hundred velvet revolution has a petition going telling obama to prosecute the illegal deeds of the last admins justice department ... i think thats a very important place to start , as it most directly affects citizens day to day lives i like msnbc 's coverage better than other msm but they too r owned by corporations and im sure racheal and keith know they can only go so far or they will end up like dan abrams did ..off the air abrams asked the question we all wanted answered , why is rove above a congressional subpeona ?

I 'm so admiring of the knowledgable Left here on this site .
Thank you .
Agent 99 , I agree , that Obama is not the shining light on the hill , we were expecting to clean up the rot , but instead , seems to be perpetuating it , but , I know , that McCain in office would have been more horrific .
I 'm still grateful Bush is gone .
And now , all I can do is hope and pray that there is some bright plan , unknown yet to us , that justice will happen , though not holding my breath .
Obama is brilliant , so , maybe he has a plan that is not immediately apparent now to us .
Surely , other countries are getting wind of this , the actual documents , now .
To be honest , I would n't be surprised , if Obama knows , assasination is an actual possibility for him .
It 's not like it never happened before .
The things that have occurred under the powers previously ( and quite probably now ) under the radar running things still looms and is holding a dark heavy cloud above him .
You have to admit , that criminality is their modus operundi .

The 1773 protest was against multi-national corporatism in collusion with the British government at the time .

I so totally understand the urges to cut Obama slack .
Because he 's not * is a major incentive .
Because he 's intelligent is a major incentive .
Because he 's black is a huge incentive .
I might want more than I can even bear to think about for him to do well , do the right things , be , finally , the great man we need so desperately .
So I really do get it .
But none of these things are good reasons to think well of his work .
I 'm saying it 's not enough to want him to do well and so try to see a way for good motives behind things that are obviously bad .
He has to actually do good things and stop actually doing bad things ... and trying to get away with calling them something else .
I say this stuff , not only aware that he could be assassinated if he does the right things , but angry that he wo n't do them anyway , like certain others have done and been murdered for , BECAUSE if he does not , he is only making matters exponentially worse for the whole world .
So , heartless as it may sound , I do n't care if they have guns to his daughters ' heads !
What are they worth compared to what is being done to harm everyone ?
What possible decent motive could he actually have for running for president if he has n't already decided it is worth his life and his family 's lives to make the " change " he was drilling us about for so long ?
This is n't trivial stuff .
That oath of office is n't trivial .
People treat it as if one should only be held to it if it is n't scary to keep it .

Blubonnet , I 'd like to think we could yell our heads off for Obama to stop being such a wuss , to start abiding by the Constitution , and if he 's got something going we cannot see , no matter how discerning we are , then it actually helps him accomplish it .
I honestly would love to see everyone who voted for him start coming untrained on him about these things , get it all the way out there in the public square , show the shits trying to hold him back that he 's got the whole nation behind him .
That might be the only thing that could back them off ....
If we think he 's being coerced , and we do , then he gets safer the louder and nastier we yell for him to get off his ass and perform on his promises .
That 's what I call being a true friend when the chips are all the way down .
And why do n't we make him earn some regard for a damn change ?
All he 's done so far is talk pretty , and function poorly , function not that much unlike * did .
Some people say we 're such passive jerks because they put fluoride in our drinking water .
Some say it 's our tv sets hypnotizing us .
Whatever it is , we better wake the hell up and get this stuff done , or the definition of altruism will turn into the definition of fascism .

The Ron Paul folks need to be going after the wingnuts ( who I do not consider Ron Paul folks to be in the slightest ) for their phony " protests " and co-opting of a legit movement --- whether I agree with all of it or not does n't actually matter --- with a phony one , perhaps made more obvious than ever by the graphic Floridiot linked to above .

The thing is , we are not passive .
We have gone out in the thousands to protest when Bush was in office , while he been turning our country into what more resembeled German in the era of Hitler .
Fact is , the colluding MSM barely covered it , making the protests impotent in its declaration against whatever any one of Bush 's multiple criminal operations were .
Even if now that the masses GOT IT , as we could see in the latest election , the voting for change overpowering the massive attempts at thieving office , as occured previously , now our will is not exactly being considered either .
You know , I 'm quite sure , if the anti-democratic operations were initiated under Obama , that are being continued , from Bush , we would be screaming bloody murder as well , about , and towards Obama .
Anyway , we have not been passive , but we 've been shorted on coverage through the Bush years .
It 's amazing how when one gets your trust , you can be obligingly violated .
It 's like the boyfriend who says he was just making sure that the girl he was feeling up did n't have any cancerous cysts , you WANT to believe him , and there are women who would .
It is true that the MSM is the biggest problem .
They are owned by the defense industry .
Legal accountability NEEDs to be in place to make the media do its job , especially when the outright misinformation campaigns are DESTROYING THIS COUNTRY !!!
The fools are kept foolish , because of their usefulness .
If the FCC were doing their job making sure truth is what we got , instead of the assuredness that nastywords or bodyparts made their way to us , life would be so much better .
We can be so thankful for those like Brad here are truly major players in the process of countering the massive lying operations of the GOP .
Where would we be is the MSM was all we had ?
I shudder to think .
I think much progress is being made and will continue to be made , but we still have to fight like hell , manning our keyboards , andgrily and passionately calling the liars out , all over the web , and bring validating sources to your debates .

It can also be very effective .
( See Team Bush 's use of " sore loser " in 2000 and again in 2005 ) .
For the record , I do n't believe that you , Brian , are a sore loser .
And if you believed I was calling you that , then I 'm certainly willing to apologize .
I was n't , because I do n't believe you 're a " wingnut " , as used to describe the " sore losers " being referenced in the headline .

CNN -- Sebastian Junger found him crouched on a battlefield in Afghanistan , fighting to stay alive .
Ahmad Shah Massoud , center in white shirt , leads his men in his beloved Afghan mountains .
The Taliban had the man cornered and outnumbered .
A sniper 's bullet came so close to the man that it plucked dirt between his feet .
But Junger watched him coolly orchestrate a cunning counterattack by his soldiers -- all while discussing his favorite poetry and international news .
" He had tremendous magnetism , " says Junger , a noted journalist and author who has written bestsellers like " The Perfect Storm , " and " A Death in Belmont . "
" You did n't even need to speak his language to fall under his sway .
That 's the only time I 've ever really felt that from another person . "
The man Junger met was Ahmad Shah Massoud , the " Lion of Panjshir . "
Today , Massoud is a national hero in Afghanistan , but he's also become something else : the prototype for the tough but enlightened leader Afghanistan desperately needs today , some Afghans say .
Watch how images of Massoud are everywhere in Afghanistan »
Massoud was assassinated two days before the September 11 terrorist attacks by agents linked to al Qaeda .
Though he died eight years ago , his legacy looms over any would - be leader in Afghanistan , Afghans and scholars say .
See current key players in Afghanistan »
' He would have found bin Laden '
Afghanistan 's government has been accused of being corrupt and weak .
Massoud had a reputation for integrity and strength , says Junger , who traveled to Afghanistan in 2000 to profile Massoud for his book , " Fire . "
" He would have been very hard for the warlords to intimidate , " Junger says .
Massoud had a reputation as a fierce nationalist who would not allow any outside group -- the Russians , Pakistan , the Taliban , even the United States -- to control Afghanistan , says Zieba Shorish - Shamley , an Afghan native and founder of the Women 's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan .
" All he wanted was to have Afghanistan for Afghanistan , " Shorish - Shamley says .
" If Massoud would have been in power , he would not sell out . "
Massoud made his name as a brilliant guerrilla leader .
He was born in Afghanistan 's Panjshir Valley , the son of an Afghan army officer .
He attended college as an engineering student where he became involved in student politics .
Massoud became Afghanistan 's most famous resistance leader after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 .
Widely read , he studied the works of famous guerrilla leaders .
His army fought back nine major offensives by the Soviet army in the Panjshir Valley .
After the Soviet army retreated , Massoud then waged war against the Taliban , objecting to their rigid interpretation of Islam and treatment of women .
While battling the Taliban , Massoud became a bitter foe of the group 's chief ally , al Qaeda 's Osama bin Laden .
Shorish - Shamley , the women 's rights activist , says Massoud was assassinated just before the 9/11 attacks because bin Laden feared Massoud .
Massoud 's military prowess combined with his knowledge of the Afghan - Pakistan border would have made him an even more formidable threat against the Taliban with U.S. military muscle backing him .
" If they [ al Qaeda leaders ] were hiding under a rock , he would have found them , '' Shorish - Shamley says .
" He was that type of person .
He would have found bin Laden . "
' He was a charming killer '
Yet there are others who say Massoud was n't that different from the warlords who try to control Afghanistan today .
After the Soviet army left Afghanistan , various Afghan resistance leaders cobbled together a coalition government to run the country .
Massoud was appointed defense minister .
But a civil war soon erupted as various factions fought for control of the country .
Men under Massoud 's command were accused of massacring civilians .
Paul Fitzgerald , co-author of " Afghanistan 's Untold Story , " says Massoud was a " charming killer . "
" He was n't as bad as the worst , " Fitzgerald says .
" But from the Afghan point of view , they 're all war criminals .
They really did n't do any good for the Afghan people . "
The Taliban eventually stepped into the leadership vacuum created by feuding Afghan factions .
When they gained control of Afghanistan , they pushed Massoud 's army into the Panjshir Valley .
There Massoud fought a rear - guard action against the Taliban while trying to warn the West about the global threat posed by bin Laden and the Taliban .
Marcela Grad , author of the book " Massoud , " says he was the only Afghan resistance leader who never left the country to live abroad .
He fought constantly for Afghanistan 's independence , but constant war did n't appear to destroy his humanity .
" He had tranquility about him , " says Grad , who journeyed to Afghanistan to talk to Massoud 's friends for her book .
" He brought his poetry books to battle . "
Grad says Massoud believed that his fight against the Taliban was n't isolated but part of a larger battle against a Taliban - like Islam that threatened to spread across Central Asia .
" If Massoud and the Afghans were not being a front against intolerance in that part of the world , we would have had al Qaeda everywhere -- it would have been much worse , " Grad says .
Junger , who had interviewed Massoud the year before , says he was crushed by Massoud 's death .
" A lot of people who knew him felt that he was the best hope for that part of the world , " says Junger .
There may be another Massoud in Afghanistan 's future .
A year after Massoud 's death , he was named a " National Hero of Afghanistan . "
As dignitaries stepped on stage to honor Massoud , a thin adolescent with the same aquiline nose and almond - shaped eyes as Massoud stepped before the crowd .
It was Massoud 's only son , Ahmad , who was then 13 ( he would now be about 20 ) .
CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour , who covered the event , reported that Ahmad said that terrorists may have killed his father but not his vision of a united and free Afghanistan .
" I want to follow in my father 's footsteps , " Ahmad said .
" I want to secure our country 's independence .
I want to be my father 's successor . "

Welcome Aboard the Fleet of the Future
Bienvenido a bordo de los Trenes del Futuro
​​​​歡迎登上未來車 隊「 Fleet of the Future 」
New Train Delivery Update ( as of 09/29/20 ) :
Cars Received Certified In Service 245 226 171
Note : some cars are being used to provide training for BART train operators and maintenance technicians on the new systems , and to allow for regular train maintenance .
BART currently has 17 new trains in service .
Update : Fleet of the Future cars to be assembled in the Bay Area ( 06/14/19 )
On June 14 , 2019 Bombardier Transportation announced it is opening a rail car assembly site in Pittsburg , California to assemble BART ’s Fleet of the Future rail cars .
This work , which is currently taking place in upstate New York , will be transferred to the Bay Area over the coming months .
The new facility is expected to employ local workers , contribute tax dollars to the local economy and , thanks to its proximity to BART ’s Hayward Test Track , greatly reduce the vehicle emissions needed to transport the cars to BART property .
Update : Space for Bikes on the Fleet of the Future ( 05/24/19 )
Based on surveys of more than 3,000 BART riders , a decision has been made to include two bike areas on each new Fleet of the Future train car , the same as on BART ’s older legacy cars .
While the bike areas result in fewer seats , having an open bike area at each end of the car :
is consistent with the legacy cars , which have two bike areas ;
will create a predictable boarding location for bicyclists at each end of the car ;
will accommodate more cyclists ; and
will accommodate more standing passengers , luggage , and strollers when not used by bikes .
With this change , the current order of 775 Fleet of the Future cars will have an average of 50 seats , compared to legacy cars which average 54.6 seats .
Fleet of the Future cars use thinner seat backs to help maximize seat count , and are outfitted with as many seats as can fit within the available space .
Available space for seating , however , is limited by new buffer zones at the ends of each car required for crash safety , and a third door on each car to make it faster and easier to get on and off the train .
Nevertheless , as new cars continue to arrive , BART is increasing the number of cars in service to maximize overall seating .
By Spring 2020 , BART anticipates to increase train lengths to 10 cars on all transbay runs .
Also , to increase the number of seats in the fleet , BART has set a goal to obtain funding to increase the number of cars from 669 in the old fleet to 1,200 train cars in the future .
This would increase the number of seats in the fleet by more than 60 % .
Each bike area will have a horizontal leaning bar and strap that bicyclists can use to stabilize their bikes .
BART is selecting this leaning bar option instead of bike racks based on bicyclist preference in the survey .
Also based on bicyclist feedback , BART will explore modifications to the shape of the leaning bar to more closely match the leaning bars on the legacy cars in terms of height and distance from the wall .
Here is a picture of the leaning bar and straps that were tested :
Note : most of the Fleet of the Future cars delivered to date have just one bike area per car .
They will be modified in the future to conform with the two - bike - area standard .
A New Era Begins
The first of 775 new BART train cars went into service January 2018 and are ready to take you on a quieter , cooler , and more comfortable ride .
The new cars will help relieve crowding on the BART system .
Here are some tips to help you navigate the Fleet of the Future .
Accessibility Tips for the Fleet of the Future
Train Destination
As the train pulls in , you may notice digital signs on the side and front of the train .
These signs use high contrast amber text to show the train destination , and a blue , red , orange , ­yellow , or green block of color to indicate the route of the train — using the same colors as the BART system map .
BART will also continue to ­display train destinations on the ­electronic signs above the platform and via audio announcements .
Navigating the System
Once on - board , check out the digital screen next to each side door .
It has a dynamic system map and a “ You Are Here ” bubble that shows your train ’s current position .
The right - hand side of the screen shows next stop information and customer service messages .
You may also see next stop information on an overhead digital sign at the end of the car , or hear it via new automated ­announcements .
More Priority Seats
Notice the green priority seats on your left as you enter the train .
BART asks passengers to yield these seats to people with disabilities , seniors , and pregnant women .
With the addition of the third door , the new trains have approximately 50 % more priority seating .
More Doors
New trains have 50 % more doors for easier boarding and ­exiting .
Decals on the train exterior mark doors that have ­wheelchair areas , ­multi- purpose space , and bike areas .
Note that the location of the first and third door on each car will align with existing black squares on the platform but the ­platform is not yet marked to show where to wait to board a middle door .
BART plans to start installing the new markers this summer .
Tactile Directional Bars
Blind or low vision customers may continue to use existing “ directional bars ” at the ­center of the platform to identify a boarding location .
At these locations , blind or low vision ­customers can board the first or third door of the new cars .
( Middle door locations do not yet have directional bars .
BART plans to seek input from the BART Accessibility Task Force on how best to mark these additional locations for blind customers at a future date when all the train cars have a middle door . )
When boarding , turn left for the priority seats or grab the floor - to - ceiling pole that is straight ahead .
Traveling Together
The two wheelchair areas in each car are both located near the middle door to make it easier for passengers who use wheelchairs to travel together .
Note that there are no ­floor - to - ceiling poles in this area to provide maximum accessibility for customers who use wheelchairs .
Wheelchair areas are marked on the floor with the international disability ­symbol .
Different Riders , Different Needs
BART knows that different riders have different needs .
Seat back ­handles and vertical poles help riders stand up or lower themselves into the new , higher seats .
These new seats have more room underneath for service animals or carry - on luggage .
Overhead straps are available to support standing passengers .
And ­vertical bars and floor - to - ceiling poles provide a place to hold on to as the train starts or stops for passengers who are unable to reach ­overhead straps .
Assisted Listening Hearing Loop
The center area of each car has a hearing loop system ( indicated by a decal on the train interior ) for riders who use hearing aids or cochlear implants .
The range of this system covers approximately the center 1/3 of the train car .
This system is one of the first of its kind in a moving public transit vehicle .
Please consult your audiologist for optimal device ­settings .
Emergency Information
Evacuation information is posted at the ends of each car .
In the event of an evacuation , the train operator will make an announcement and information may also ­appear on the digital displays .
Emergency features , located throughout the car , are ­indicated by red signs that can glow in the dark .
Please note the location of emergency features such as fire extinguishers and ladders near car ends , and manual door release ­handles and intercoms near each door area .
Digital cameras , onboard all cars , help deter crime , but alert riders are always the best ­defense .
Please report any suspicious packages or activity to BART Police : ( 510 ) 464-7000 or through the BART Watch app available for your mobile device .

Free a annoncé ce mardi l'activation d'un parc de 3 millions de hotspots WiFi répartis sur toute la France , avec ses Freebox v5 .
L'opérateur suit ainsi les pas de SFR , qui utilise également les Neufbox pour donner l'accès à des hotspots WiFi gratuits à ses abonnés mobiles .
L'occasion pour Numerama de s'interroger sur la compatibilité de ces hotspots avec l'esprit de la loi Hadopi .
Free a annoncé mardi l’ouverture du « plus grand réseau WiFi communautaire au monde « , qui pourrait être sa réponse au blocage de l’octroi de la quatrième licence 3G .
L’opérateur a activé l’accès à 3 millions de hotspots WiFi , qui sont autant de Freebox ADSL v5 réparties sur tout le territoire .
« Ce service permet ainsi à tous les abonnés ADSL dégroupés de profiter d’un accès internet gratuit ( inclus dans leur forfait ADSL ) à travers ces points d’accès dans les zones dégroupées « , explique l’opérateur dans un communiqué .
Avec la téléphonie par IP , il sera donc possible de téléphoner gratuitement partout où se trouve à proximité un hotspot WiFi , et bien sûr de naviguer sur Internet sans passer par la 3G .
A terme , c’est donc l’espoir pour
Free de ne pas avoir besoin de passer par les antennes - relais classiques pour téléphoner en toute mobilité , et donc de pouvoir se passer de la licence 3G qui semble lui échapper .
Mieux ,
Free a rendu son service « Hadopi - compatible » .
Le réseau est en effet distinct du réseau privé WiFi des abonnés Free . « FreeWifi est entièrement sécurisé , chaque Freenaute se connectant au réseau Wifi communautaire via une IP propre ( et non l’adresse IP de la Freebox sur laquelle il se connecte ) « , précise en effet le communiqué .
Un point fondamental pour la sécurité des abonnés lorsque l’Hadopi sera mise en œuvre .
Sur ce point , Numerama a demandé à SFR des précisions sur sa propre offre SFR WiFi , qui permet aux abonnés mobiles SFR qui installent sur leur téléphone ( iPhone ou Android notamment ) une application spécifique , ou qui utilisent un ordinateur portable , d’accéder aux hotspots des Neufbox / SFRbox .
Nous nous inquiétions en effet de la compatibilité du système avec la loi Hadopi .
S’il est possible d’utiliser la connexion WiFi d’une Neufbox avec un téléphone ou un ordinateur portable , quelle adresse IP apparaîtra sur les relevés en cas de piratage ?
Notre inquiétude fut confortée par la réponse de SFR : « L’utilisateur du réseau Neuf WiFi aura la même adresse IP sur internet que l’abonné de la box sur laquelle il est connecté « .
L’opérateur a simplement voulu nous rassurer en rappelant que « les protocoles autorisés sur le réseau Neuf WiFi sont limités à du Web ( HTTP / HTTPS ) , du mail et du SIP .
Il n’a donc que très peu d’intérêt pour pratiquer le téléchargement illégal « .
Le problème est d’autant plus gênant que par les conditions générales d’utilisation de son service , « le Client autorise l’utilisation par des tiers de la partie non exploitée de sa bande passante « .
Il doit faire l’effort de se rendre dans sa zone d’administration pour désactiver l’accès public à son hotspot .
« Le réseau Neuf WiFi est ouvert par défaut sur toutes les neufbox de SFR ou NB4 ( ancienne Neuf Box de Neuf Cegetel ) .
Le client a le choix de le désactiver ensuite « , nous a ainsi confirmé la filiale de Vivendi .
Et même si « tous les clients se connectant sur le réseau Neuf WiFi doivent s’authentifier via leurs identifiants de connexion avant de pouvoir surfer « , ou le font automatiquement sur les mobiles , ce qui doit permettre de « retrouver les utilisateurs sur le réseau Neuf WiFi » en cas de piratage …
L’Hadopi ne prévoit toutefois pas de telle vérification , et il n’est pas dit que SFR la fera systématiquement .
En attribuant une adresse IP distincte , Free s’évite ce problème .
Un bon point .

Customs officers drill holes in cricket bats sent from Pakistan ... to check for explosives
A cricketer who ordered eight bats to be shipped in from Pakistan was shocked to discover custom officers had drilled holes in them to check for drugs and explosives .
Stunned Dilawar Hussain opened the package containing his £ 475 batting gear to find it all ruined .
Each cricket bat and two pairs of pads had two drill holes in them - meaning they are weaker and could splinter or break easily .
Customs officials told the keen amateur they had been looking for bombs and drugs .
Hit for six : Dilawar Hussain with the cricket bats ruined as officials hunted for explosives
The 28 - year - old takeaway owner said : ' It is totally unbelievable .
What were these people thinking .
' How could I possibly hide anything in the crickets bats .
You would have hope these people would have used some common sense . '
He paid £ 475 for the equipment on a recent club tour to Pakistan and has made similar orders in the past but never had any problems .
The damaged bat
He added : ' The bats are for members of the teams I captain in local leagues .
The lads are more perplexed than I am as they were looking forward to using the bats and pads during the new season .
' I bought the cricket bats in Lahore and each one cost me 8,000 rupees ( ( £ 67 ) .
I have just wasted my money .
' I checked every one and everything seemed to be okay .
I had them packed and before I left I got DHL Pakistan to ship them over .
' The bats and pads arrived and I was shocked to find they had holes drilled into the front of them . '
Dilawar , from Blackburn , Lancs , continued : ' Whoever did this must have known that this basically makes the cricket bat obsolete .
' We ca n't use the bats because they will splinter after a few games .
What kind of people would do this ?'
Dilawar , who plays for Gujrat Cricket Club and Nile cricket clubs , phoned customs officials to complain and was told that the holes had been made as part of security checks for drugs and bombs .
He added : ' I rang Pakistan and they said UK authorities had made the holes .
When I rang the UK office they said Pakistan had done it .
' No - one wants to take responsibility and no - one is owning up to the gaffe . '
Cricket pads he purchased from Pakistan also had holes drilled through them
A spokesman for DHL International said they would not disclose information on individual cases .
A spokesman for UK Customs and Excise said : ' If it was UK Customs Mr Hussain should have received paperwork with his consignment giving contact details for any Customs checks on his parcels .
' The paperwork normally gives contact details for any query or complaint . '

The woman who fired a gun at President Gerald Ford in 1975 and spent the next 32 years in prison said in an interview today that she believed the country would change only through a violent revolution .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Sara Jane Moore told NBC's " Today " that she now realizes that her actions were " wrong ... a serious error . "
The appearance was Moore 's first TV interview since she was released on parole in late 2007 , NBC said .
In September 1975 , Moore , then around 45 , fired on Ford as he waved to a crowd in San Francisco .
A man near her knocked the pistol out of her hand and the shot went astray .
It was the second failed attempt on Ford 's life in less than three weeks .
Moore was sentenced to life in prison but released on parole in December 2007 .
She has lived in an undisclosed location since then .
It was during the long years in prison , she said , that " gradually I began to realize that I had let myself be used .
... I definitely think that it was wrong .
I think I was misled .
I think I was mistaken .
I think I made a serious error . "
Moore , who had been loosely associated with leftist groups in California , said she " was n't prepared " for the things she learned about the extent of poverty and other problems .
" It was a time that people do n't remember .
You know , we had a war ... the Vietnam War , you became — I became — immersed in it , " Moore said Thursday .
" We were saying the country needed to change .
The only way it was going to change was a violent revolution .
I genuinely thought that ( shooting Ford ) might trigger that new revolution in this country . "
On politics , she said she now knows she was hearing only one side of the story .
" We thought San Francisco was the world , and it was n't . "

Asked by NBC's Matt Lauer why she was doing the interview now , she said , " I think that one gets tired of being thought of as a kook , a monster , an alien , something like that .
...
There has been a lot of curiosity .
I thought , OK , let 's do it . "
As for the people in the town where she 's now living , who would learn about her past through the interview , " I hope they 're OK with it . "
Just 17 days before Moore 's attack , Lynette " Squeaky " Fromme , a follower of cult murderer Charles Manson , tried to kill Ford in Sacramento , California .
A Secret Service agent grabbed her after she aimed a pistol at the president .
Fromme , now 60 , is serving a life sentence at a federal prison in Fort Worth , Texas .
Ford died of natural causes on 26 December 2006 .
Do you agree with the Iowa Supreme Court 's decision ?
Back in March when I reviewed the early - 2009 version of the Mac mini , I concluded that if you ’re going to be using the newest mini for more than the most basic tasks , you ’ll want it configured more like the $ 799 model ( 2GB RAM , 320 GB hard drive ) than the $ 599 model ( 1GB RAM , 120 GB hard drive ) .
But I also noted that compared to the $ 599 model , the $ 799 model is a poor value .
Shelling out the additional $ 200 for the $ 799 model gets you only those modest bumps in memory and storage — upgrades that , if you ’re comfortable installing them yourself , would cost less than $ 100 with some frugal shopping .
The dilemma is that I was talking about a Mac mini , not a MacBook .
Having taken apart previous Mac minis , I knew that many people would n’t feel comfortable performing such surgery themselves , so I also recommended an alternative : paying Apple $ 50 to bump the $ 599 mini ’s RAM to 2GB , and then purchasing an external hard drive for additional storage ( and , if you go the FireWire route , additional performance , as well ) .
But part of the beauty of the Mac mini is its compact size .
Many people do n’t want to expand the mini’s “ footprint ” by adding an external hard drive .
So the two questions I heard most often from Macworld readers and anyone who follows me on Twitter were , “ How difficult is it really to upgrade this Mac mini ? ” and “ What about installing a faster internal hard drive ? ”
So I decided it was once again time to get inside the Mac mini— specifically , Apple ’s $ 599 entry - level model — and do some hands - on research .
For the upgrade components , I could have purchased a 320 GB , 5,400 - rpm hard drive for around $ 65 and a 1GB RAM chip for $ 20 ; these would have brought the $ 599 mini on par with the $ 799 model for just $ 684 — a whopping $ 115 less .
But I wanted to see what kind of performance increases I could get by upgrading , so I bumped the RAM up to 4GB and installed a drive , Western Digital ’s 320 GB Scorpio Black , that operates at 7,200 - rpm and includes a 16MB cache .
This do - it - yourself configuration costs only $ 747 at current retail prices — still less than Apple ’s stock $ 799 model .
Entering without breaking
Apple ’s policy on upgrading the Mac mini yourself has always been that as long as you do n’t break anything in the process , your warranty is still valid .
At the time of my review , I confirmed that this policy still applies .
The bigger issue is that , as with earlier minis , getting inside the computer ’s compact enclosure often feels as if you ’re breaking it .
But those of us who ’ve successfully taken apart a mini can assure you that the little guy can take much more abuse than you think .
( And once you ’ve taken apart a mini without breaking it , you ’re much more confident — and the process is much quicker — the next time . )
Christopher Breen and Dan Frakes discuss the Mac mini in the Macworld Podcast
Rather than go through the take - apart process step by step , I ’ll just give you a quick overview .
For in - depth instructions , check out one of the excellent tutorials around the Web .
For example , iFixit ’s First Look at the Mac mini includes detailed instructions for getting inside , as well as photos of each step .
( i Fixit also includes some excellent side - by - side comparisons of the internals of the latest mini with those of its predecessors . )
If you prefer video , Other World Computing provides both RAM and hard - drive installation tutorials .
To make swapping the hard drive as convenient as possible , I recommend buying an inexpensive 2.5 - inch SATA case ; you can get one for as little as $ 10 .
Just before the swap , put the new drive in the case and use SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to make an exact copy of your Mac mini ’s original drive onto the new drive .
After performing the swap , your mini will boot using the new hard drive and you can pick up right where you left off .
You can then put the original drive in the drive case and use it as an external hard drive .
The process of disassembling the latest Mac mini involves just a few steps :
Opening the case : Easily the most gut - wrenching part of the process , this step requires you to flip over the mini , insert a thin putty knife between the mini ’s aluminum top case and its white - plastic base , and then pry past the point where you ’re sure you ’re going to break something ; you work your way around the base of the mini with the putty knife until you 've released all the plastic clips holding the top and bottom together .
( The first time I opened a mini , this step took me at least half an hour because I thought I was doing something wrong .
While writing this article , I took the new mini apart again for some photos and realized it took me only 10 seconds or so to pop off the top .
Practice makes perfect . )
If you ’re careful , the only evidence that you ’ve been inside the mini will be a few tiny marks in the plastic or metal from the edge of the putty knife , and even those marks will be nicely hidden from view on the bottom of the mini .
Watching OWC ’s video gives you a good idea of how much force is necessary to apply to your putty knife .
Detaching antennas :
There are three antennas clipped atop the mini ’s innards .
You remove two by gently pulling them upwards ; the third requires you to squeeze a plastic clip underneath .
Removing screws and detaching the connector cable :
Four small screws hold the mini ’s drive assembly — the optical drive , hard drive , and fan — in place .
After removing these screws , you gently disconnect the small ribbon cable connecting the drive assembly to the rest of the mini ’s components .
You can then lift the drive assembly , exposing both the hard drive ( on the underside of the drive assembly ) and the RAM slots ( on the bottom section of the mini ) .
No further tools are needed to install or swap RAM .
To swap the hard drive , you need to remove four standard drive - sled screws .
The only hitch here is a small temperature sensor attached , using adhesive , to the edge of the hard drive ; you ’ll want to carefully remove it , swap the drive , and then reapply the sensor to the same location on the new drive .
Putting the mini back together is as simple as reversing your steps .
You can take solace in the fact that putting the mini’s top case back on is a much simpler process than removing it .
You just line it up with the base and then squeeze the two pieces together .
It took me less than half an hour to swap our mini ’s RAM and hard drive , including stopping occasionally to take photos .
For someone who ’s never performed the procedure before , I ’d set aside an hour or so .
Interestingly , I found the current mini to be easier to take apart and put back together than some of the previous versions .
For example , I needed two putty knives to open the original mini .
Similarly , when putting the case back together , the original mini had metal shielding that had a tendency to get caught on the top case ; this is n’t a problem on recent models .
( A tip from Christopher Breen , who upgraded his mini for the purposes of using it as a media center :
Before closing things up , double - check to make sure each of the three antenna cables is still connected to the motherboard .
He managed to disconnect one accidentally . )
While I'm on the topic of digging around inside the mini , the folks over at Macminicolo .
net documented their own takeapart earlier this year .
One of those photos revealed what appears to be eSATA circuitry inside the mini .
Perhaps we ’ll be seeing eSATA connections on future models ?
Performance
You can save some money by buying RAM and a hard drive separately and installing them yourself , but how does the resulting configuration compare ?
After all , if you do n’t get better performance , all you ’re gaining by going the DIY route is $ 50 in savings ( at least using the components I chose ) .
Many people would be content paying that difference just to avoid the installation hassle .
So I handed off our upgraded Mac mini — now with 4GB of RAM and a 7,200 - rpm hard drive — to the Macworld Lab to put the machine through our standard suite of benchmark tests .
Coincidentally , the Lab was also testing Apple ’s maxed - out mini , which is the $ 799 model custom - configured with a 2.26GHz processor and 4GB of RAM — upgrades for which Apple charges $ 250 , bringing the total cost to a staggering ( for a Mac mini ) $ 1,049 .
Below are the benchmarks for five Mac mini systems : the $ 599 model with 2GB RAM ( some of our tests do n’t work with only 1GB ) , the stock $ 799 model , the 2.26GHz model with 2GB RAM , the 2.26GHz model with 4GB RAM , and , finally , our DIY model .

Two things stand out .
First , both our DIY mini and the 2.26GHz custom configurations handily best the $ 599 and $ 799 stock models .
But second , and more notable , is the fact that our DIY Mac mini competes well with Apple ’s $ 1,049 maxed - out monster .
The 2.26GHz configurations outperformed our DIY model in processor - intensive tasks such as rendering video , encoding audio , and creating zip archives — not surprising , given the faster processor speed .
But our DIY mini held its own in our Photoshop suite test , and , thanks to its 7,200 - rpm hard drive , easily bested the most - expensive mini in drive - intensive tasks such as unzipping file archives .
And when it comes to our overall Speedmark score , the DIY mini edged out the top - of - the - line model , 217 to 216
Although I did n’t get any hands - on time with the 2.26GHz models , the DIY mini also feels subjectively snappier when compared to its original configuration , especially if many programs are running and when performing tasks involving the hard drive .
And despite concerns that maxing out the mini’s RAM and installing a faster hard drive might result in higher internal temperature — and , thus , more fan noise — the mini remained relatively cool .
For example , after more than an hour of constant drive access , the mini ’s internal temperatures increased by fewer than 20 degrees ( Fahrenheit ) ; and even when the fan did kick in , it was barely audible from just a couple feet away .
Custom - build it your way , not Apple’s
In my review of the mini , I contended that it ’s tough to justify purchasing the $ 799 model .
Buying the $ 599 model and upgrading the RAM ( either as a build - to - order option or on your own after the purchase ) and hard drive ( either internally or by connecting an external drive ) is a better way to go .
After performing those very upgrades and comparing the results to both the stock mini models and Apple ’s top - of - the - line upgraded mini , that argument is even more compelling .
Even if you pay a local Apple guru to install your additional RAM and larger ( or faster ) hard drive , you ’ll likely end up spending not much more than the cost of the $ 799 mini for a considerably more capable machine .
As for Apple ’s build - to - order 2.26GHz processor upgrade , that option seems like an even poorer value when compared to our $ 747 DIY mini .
Unless you specifically need the additional processor speed — in which case , the mini probably is n’t the best Mac for you anyway — you should instead consider less - expensive options … such as , say , more RAM and a faster hard drive .

You might think that all cycling advocates would support bicycle lanes .
You ’d be wrong .
Some cyclists oppose bike lanes on the grounds that they protect only from rear - end collisions ( which are rare ) , and increase the likelihood of collisions at intersections ( which are more common ) .
The research data is a bit conflicting .
Here at Bicycle Universe we generally support bicycle lanes because :
They make cycling feel safer .
The surveys always show that # 1 reason why people say they do n’t bike is that they feel it ’s too dangerous , and the # 1 thing that would make them feel safer is more bike lanes .
Even if bike lanes do n’t help , it ’s unlikely that they hurt .
Some research shows that streets with and without bike lanes are about the same risk for cyclists .
In that case , there ’s no harm in installing the lanes , especially if they encourage more people to bike .
Bike lanes mean more cyclists .
Cities that install bike lanes see an increase in the number of cyclists .
( source )
Bike lanes keep cyclists off sidewalks .
Riding on the sidewalk drops when bike lanes are available .
Riding on the sidewalk is dangerous to pedestrians , and actually dangerous even to cyclists because they ’re vulnerable to getting hit by turning cars when coming off the sidewalk to cross the street .
Other countries have them .
Other countries with higher rates of cycling ( and lower rates of cyclist injuries ) employ bike lanes .
Some of the research into the safety of bike lanes is listed below .
Bike Lanes : Pros & Cons
Research supporting the safety of bike lanes
Bicycle Quarterly .
Cites European data which shows that separated bike lanes ( with a physical barrier ) cut the accident risk in half on high - speed roads ( 45 mph ) .
American Journal of Public Health , 2012 .
Bike lanes cut injury risk by 50 % , dedicated bike lanes cut it by 90 % .
John Forester challenged its conclusions , saying in part : “ In the much more impressive cycle - track issue , the authors proclaimed enormous crash reduction without informing the readers [ that they studied only a single installation which ] was not along a typical city street but [ was ] the only situation in which a plain cycle track could possibly be safe , a place without crossing or turning movements by motorists , cyclists , or pedestrians .
The authors refer to the forty - year - old cycle - track controversy as if they had studied it , but clearly , they do n’t understand it . ”
Forrester notes the absence of on - street parking is correlated with safety for cyclists .
University of Texas study , 2006 .
Study shows improved safety for motorists when bike lanes exist because drivers passing cyclists on roads without bike lanes veer farther left into the next lane of traffic .
It also found that bike lanes promote safety for cyclists since bikers in bike lanes do n’t hug the curb as much as those on unmarked streets .
Moritz ’ 1996 study gives strong evidence that streets with bike lanes are safer than those without .
The community development department of Cambridge , MA has evidence about the safety of bike lanes .
Bicycle Lanes vs. Wide Outside Curb lanes .
Study by the U.S. Dept. of Transportation .
( And here ’s a critique of that study by John Forrester . )
Mike Dahmus did a small sampling to see how closely cars passed him on Shoal Creek Blvd. in Austin , Texas , when there was no bike lane and then again after the bike lane was stripped .
He observed that cars kept a greater distance from him on average when there was no bike lane , but that without a bike lane cars would occasionally pass much closer than when the bike lane was there .
His conclusion was that the bike lane provides a measure of safety because with the bike lane cars are more likely to maintain a minimum safe distance from cyclists .
Texas Transportation Instititute , 2000 ( PDF ) .
Study found that the wider the lane , the faster drivers drive .
Bicycle Coalition of Philadelphia .
Sidewalk riding dropped from 19.8 % on streets with no bike lane to 8.6 % on streets with a bike lane to 2.4 % on streets with a buffered bike lane .
Mixed pro/con
Listening to Bike Lanes by Jeffrey Hiles strikes a balance between those who support and those who oppose bike lanes .
Lots of good data here .
BicyclingInfo.org has a balanced article Pros and Cons of Bike Lanes by Alan Wachtel .
Opposed to bike lanes
Bicycle Quarterly .
Cites European data which shows that painted bike lanes offer no benefit on most urban roads ( 30 - 45 mph ) , and are much more dangerous on low - speed roads ( 12/20 mph ) than no bike lane .

Bike lane design guide ( PDF ) by the US DoT “ Sharrows ” are “ shared - lane arrows ” painted onto the street to show motorists and cyclists that they ’re supposed to share the lane .
They ’re being promoted as an alternative to bike lanes , especially on roadways where there is n’t enough space for a dedicated bike lane .
Alta Planning conducted a detailed study of sharrows ( PDF ) .
Pros and Cons of Bike Lanes
by Mike Dahmus ,
There are no good studies proving that bike lanes or wide curb lanes are better than the other .
ALL theories you hear on which one is better are resting on somebody ’s opinion .
[ Updated , Feb . 2007 : A few months ago , a study did come out which claimed to show a non-trivial safety enhancement for marked bike lanes vs. wide curb lanes . ]
I ’m one of the people who thinks we overprescribe bike lanes , but it bugs me that so many Forsterites are so hostile to them in general .
Both bike lanes and wide curb lanes have their place .
I ’m operating under the assumption that we ’re comparing bike lanes to wide curb lanes ; not narrow curb lanes .
The theory that we can reengineer the 98 % of Austin that needs it to a grid pattern like Hyde Park where we do n’t need EITHER facility is just ludicrous .
My general feeling on when bike lanes are appropriate :
Where there are lots of inexperienced bicyclists
Where speed differential is fairly high
Where volume of bicyclists is very high
My general feeling on when wide curb lanes are appropriate :
Where speed differential is lower
Where bicycle volume ( all types ) is moderate to low Where not to put bike lanes :
Low - speed or congested roadways where turning volume is very high Residential streets ( NOTE : DESPITE NEIGHBORHOOD MISREPRESENTATIONS , “ RESIDENTIAL STREET ” IS A CATEGORY OF ROADWAY SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW SHOAL CREEK BOULEVARD ) .
Where they ca n’t be swept or otherwise maintained
Where you ca n’t commit to “ no parking ” .
Things I believe that are PROs for bike lanes :
Bike lanes attract new cyclists ; wide curb lanes do not .
I think this is self - evident .
Patrick agreed , and so do most people who actually work in the field ( not the people who commute and criticize ; but the people who are paid to try to increase cycling in their particular city ) .
No amount of education so far has been able to match up against the bike lane stripe as a way to get people out on their bikes .
Of course , this may be a good thing if you think we do n’t need more uneducated cyclists out there .
You ca n’t attract new cyclists to a road like Jollyville without a bike lane stripe .
Period .
The automobile traffic moves too fast .
A wide curb lane simply does n’t provide the space that new cyclists think they need in a way which makes sense to them , coming from the world of the automobile .
( We do n’t make the right - hand lane up a hill twice as wide so trucks can pull to the side ; we stripe another lane ) .
If you accept riding on shoulders on 360 , you should accept riding in bike lanes on Jollyville .
The argumentative convulsions some Forsterites go through to defend shoulders from the same logic they use against bike lanes are breathtaking .
( They do this , I think , because they know that even most Forsterites do n’t want to share a lane at 65 ; the same anti-bike - lane reasoning with a few exceptions would logically apply to shoulder - riding ) .
Most cyclists for whom bike facilities are built are not the expert cyclists that you and I might be .
They are instead the novice cyclist that I used to be ( and presumably you used to be ) .
Even on low - speed roadways , utility for the population AS A WHOLE sometimes demands the channelization of low - speed traffic .
For instance , Speedway and Duval north of UT – car speeds are 25 - 30 ; bike speeds are 10 ; this is n’t normally enough speed differential to justify separation , but the volumes of cars and bikes are both high , and the corridor ’s thoroughput for both cars AND bikes is thus improved by partial separation of the modes .
( this is from the link I gave a few days ago ) – it is possible to have a better average passing distance on a roadway with a wide curb lane , but still have a better overall level of safety in passing distance with a bike lane .
Whether this happens in practice is debatable – but it is a fact that you should n’t use “ average passing distance ” to compare the facilities .
The idea ( stolen from a semi- Forsterite ) that we can easily get roads restriped with wide curb lanes is in reality not true .
If you want space for bikes to be taken from car lanes , it generally has to be a bike lane .
( I do n’t know why this is , but it seems to be true , although Austin has an exception or two here ) .
CONS for bike lanes
Car drivers do tend to think you need to stay in the bike lane ( even when obstructed , unsafe , whatever – they usually ca n’t see the obstruction ) .
Also , car drivers often think you should only ride on roads that have bike lanes .
This problem exists with wide curb lanes too , by the way .
Bike lanes are theoretically more obstructed than wide curb lanes .
I do n’t believe this to be true , but most people do , so I ’m listing it here .
For instance , Bull Creek does n’t seem any less obstructed north of 45th where there are wide curb lanes .
In Austin , at least , BOTH facilities need vast amounts of sweeping which they ’re just not getting .
Sometimes cyclists will stay in a bike lane when they need to leave it due to an obstruction or intersection approach .
This is a sign of bad bike lane design in most cases and can be overcome , but is hard to get right , judging from how often it ’s done wrong .
Sometimes cyclists will stay in a bike lane when they should be leaving it to turn ( the “ turn left out of the far right lane ” phenomenon ) .
The problem here is that I see this happen on wide curb lanes fairly often as well .
The only solution here is heavy enforcement .
Bike lanes supposedly encourage wrong - way cycling .
( Whatever happened to painting arrows , by the way ?
Jollyville did n’t get them … ) – again , I see this often with wide curb lanes too .
Heavy enforcement and more arrows .
Questioning the safety of bicycle lanes
by Fred Meredith ,
You may FEEL safer , but it may be a false sense of security .
The only thing that is going to actually make you safer on those streets is how you and the other road users behave … .
If the bike lane is painted to the intersection , are you going to stay in it if you go straight across the intersection ?
What should the car turning at that intersection do ?
Should he / she come over into the bike lane to make the turn ?
Do they know that ?
Are you going to stay in the bike lane if it is right next to parked cars [ any one of which could open its door in your path ] ?
If cars are parked on the left side of a one - way street and there is a bike lane on the left side , are there special considerations you should keep in mind ?
Why is the bike lane any safer than being out in the middle of the traffic lane ?
There are lots of other lanes for the rest of the road users , why should n’t you have one ?
If you feel unsafe in a traffic lane , then maybe you need more experience / practice / or something .
Maybe less paranoia .
by Jeffrey Thorne ,
I have to question some of the statements supporting bike lanes from the research above .
“ encourage bicyclists to ride in the correct direction of travel ”
That does n’t match my observations here in Austin .
Judging by the number of riders I see riding the bike lanes against traffic flow , I ’d say they encourage that behavior instead .
I do n’t see much riding against traffic except in bike lanes .
I have to wonder about the “ national study ” concluding otherwise .
According to Jeffrey Hiles ’ Listening to Bike Lanes ( see below ) , more cyclists ride the wrong way on streets with bike lanes than on those without .
“ signal motorists that cyclists have a right to the road ”
That is , they signal that bikes belong in bike lanes , which some would take to mean ONLY in bike lanes , which is a false message for motorists and cyclists alike .
“ remind motorists to look for cyclists when turning ”
In my experience and in the conclusions of several studies , bike lanes may actually increase the incidence of motorists hitting cyclists while turning in front of them .
This seems to be because the motorist who normally would turn right from the right edge of the road , not cutting off the cyclist ’s path ( the cyclist would be behind or in front of the turning car ) , is encouraged by the bike lane stripe to make the turn from a farther left position , cutting off the cyclist ’s path .
I do support bike lanes as a tool for solving traffic problems where problems are occurring .
Usually , I see bike lanes being established where riding was safe and enjoyable already , and in those places they are at best a waste of paint and at worst creating dangers that were n’t present before .
from Jeffrey Hiles ’ Listening to Bike Lanes
Studies of bicyclists ’ behavior point to one overriding rule :
The more options cyclists have , the more options they take .
This is true whether or not those options are officially sanctioned .
The side of the street on which bicyclists ride , for example , is influenced by the kind of space they have in which to ride .
Thom and Clayton ( 1992a ) observed bicyclists riding at mostly busy intersections with standard 12 - foot lanes and speed limits mostly either 50 or 60 kph ( 31 or 37 mph ) .
A full 97.6 percent of the cyclists rode on the side of the street with the flow of traffic ( p. 97 ) .
On most of the streets at the seven intersections studied , bicyclists would have had to ride close to on - coming traffic if they had chosen the other side of the street .
The picture changes where bicyclists have more room .
A study of bicyclists on nine streets with striped bike lanes ( Cycecki , Perry , & Frangos , 1993 ) found that 22 percent of the cyclists who rode on the streets chose to ride facing the motor traffic on their side of the street .
On one street the bike lane was marked with four arrows per mile “ to show clearly that bicyclists must ride with traffic . ”
Apparently the arrows did not deter wrong - way riding as much as the extra space encouraged it ; 23 percent still rode facing traffic .
On another bike - laned street , 39 percent cycled against the flow ( pp. 29 , 31 ) .
from Tom Wald ,
If you ’ve biked on west 29th St between Rio Grande and Shoal Crest ( between Guadalupe St and Lamar Blvd ) , you probably recognize a case where the painting of bike lanes is highly questionable .
On this stretch of road , from the center line to the curb is about 14 feet .
( Not so incidentally , 14 feet is the maximum lane width for which Texas State Law * explicitly * allows a bicyclist to use the entire lane ) .
However , there are currently bike lanes marked on this stretch of road .
These bike lanes measure about two to four feet wide , if my spatial memory is correct .
My impression is that some motorists get fairly frustrated when I ride outside of the marked bike lane on this road , as is evidenced by their aggressive driving , creating unsafe situations for all involved , and horn signals .
I do n’t really fit inside the bike lane — in some places , I think any of my bikes are too wide for the lane .
Of the three choices — bike lane , sharrows , and no markings — having marked bike lanes easily takes last place .
If sharrows were used , I ’d like to see them centered somewhere between 40 - 50 % from the center line so that motorists do n’t get any impression that it ’s reasonable to pass .
Perhaps though , in 2007 , no markings is the best choice .
Supporting Bike Lanes
Mike Dahmus ,
Most of the people who argue that bike lanes are almost always bad tend to be in one of these groups ( or combinations thereof ) : focused with laser - sharp precision on the needs of current ( experienced ) transportational cyclists ( i.e. do n’t think or care about kids , novices , elderly ) – tend to be people who live in areas where cycling just tends to happen by itself and does n’t need promotion or encouragement .
inexperienced with suburban cycling conditions ( i.e. why would you ever need a bike lane or marked shoulder if roads are laid out in a grid pattern with design speeds of 30 mph ) – tend to be disproportionately European , some Amercan adherents among Forsterites mainly in the northeast or midwest United States – areas which have n’t seen much growth since the 1960s or so .
IE – these are people who never have to ride on roads like Jollyville to get where they want to go .
careless about the needs of the city to ensure good traffic flow for all users of a corridor – i.e. sometimes the bike lane exists to increase the likelihood that motorists can maintain some reasonable level of speed , and this is n’t necessarily a bad thing .
IE , these are people who think the city should n’t care that automobile traffic would often and suddenly be restricted to 10 mph or so on any given street since some motorists do n’t effectively know how to pass cyclists without the help of a stripe .
They also tend to neglect statistical thinking in their arguments – focusing , for instance , on the average passing distance they get from motorists in wide curb lanes vs bike lanes , rather than looking deeper to the 10th percentile case .
Those of us in the real world note that many Shoal Creek corridor users are very young or very old , and that it tends to attract novice cyclists of all ages ( me , for instance ) .
It , while theoretically a low - speed corridor , has an apparent design speed of 40 mph or so , and serves as a transportation spine which can be an alternate for Burnet Road and Mopac for cyclists ( improving conditions for cyclists and drivers if it succeeds in attracting most cyclists away from those two corridors ) .
It also functions as a minor arterial itself ( even though bogusly reclassified as a collector ) and thus needs to worry about flow of cars in addition to bikes .

Our solar system is a vast place , with lots of mostly empty space between planets .
But out there are comets , asteroids and more rocky , frozen objects ( including dwarf planets ) yet to be discovered in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud .
NASA 's Spirit rover landed on Mars nine years ago today ( Jan. 3 ) , kicking off a surface mission that 's still operational thanks to the amazing endurance of Spirit 's twin Opportunity .
Mars is currently host to five active space missions , commanding more attention than any planet apart from Earth .
But unmanned probes are also exploring many other solar system bodies , from the sun out to Pluto and beyond .
Here 's a brief rundown of some of the intrepid spacecraft that are currently sending data home from beyond Earth orbit .
( For the sake of brevity , this list does not include the extensitve fleet of satellites currently orbiting Earth , though some notable ones are NASA 's Solar Dynamics Observatory and iconic Hubble Space Telescope . )
Sun-studying spacecraft
Wind :
This NASA probe launched in November 1994 to study the solar wind , the stream of charged particles flowing from the sun .
The Wind spacecraft operates from a halo orbit around the sun-Earth Lagrange point 1 ( L1 ) , a spot about 900,000 miles ( 1.5 million kilometers ) from Earth ( in the direction of the sun ) .
At sun-Earth L1 , the gravitational pulls of the two bodies interact in such a way that a probe can essentially park there .
[ Gallery : Solar System 's Deep - Space Probes ]
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory : SOHO , a joint effort between the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and NASA , launched in December 1995 and also orbits around sun-Earth L1 .
In addition to its sun-studying duties , SOHO has discovered more than 2,300 comets .
The total mission cost is about 1 billion euros ( $ 1.32 billion at current exchange rates ) .
Advanced Composition Explorer ( ACE ) : This $ 107 million NASA spacecraft launched in August 1997 to help researchers better understand and predict space space weather .
ACE also orbits sun-Earth L1 .
Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory : NASA 's $ 550 million sun-studying STEREO mission , which blasted off in October 2006 , consists of two spacecraft , known as A and B .
Both probes are in a heliocentric orbit , with A zipping around the sun faster than Earth and B lagging somewhat behind .
Mercury
Messenger : NASA 's $ 446 million Messenger mission ( short for Mercury Surface , Space Environment , Geochemistry and Ranging ) launched in August 2004 and arrived in orbit around the solar system 's innermost planet in March 2011 .
Messenger has found solid evidence of water ice and carbon - containing organic compounds in the permanentaly shadowed craters near Mercury 's poles .
Venus
Venus Express :
This $ 290 million ESA spacecraft blasted off in November 2005 and began orbiting Earth 's hellishly hot " sister planet " in April 2006 .
Its main goal is to help scientists better understand the evolution of Venus ' thick atmosphere .
Akatsuki : The $ 300 million Akatsuki mission , which launched in May 2010 , was Japan 's second attempt to send a probe to another planet , after 2003 's ill - fated Nozomi mission to Mars .
Akatsuki has had troubles as well , failing to insert into Venus orbit as planned in December 2010 .
The probe is now circling the sun , and mission managers plan to take another shot at Venus in November 2015 .

Earth 's moon
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter : LRO launched on June 18 , 2009 , and arrived in lunar orbit five days later .
The $ 504 million , car - size NASA spacecraft is studying the lunar surface for scientific and exploration purposes ; its observations should help researchers decide where to put a future human colony on the moon , NASA officials say .
Artemis :
The two ARTEMIS spacecraft — short for Acceleration , Reconnection , Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon ’s Interaction with the Sun — completed their unusual journey from Earth orbit to lunar orbit in July 2011 .
They had originally been part of a five - satellite , $ 200 million NASA mission called THEMIS ( Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms ) , which launched in February 2007 . [ 10 Coolest Moon Discoveries ]
Deep space beyond the moon
This graphic from the China Lunar Exploration Program shows the progress of China 's Chang'e 2 moon probe from its lunar orbit out to the L2 Lagrange point 1.5 million km from Earth .
( Image credit : CSLEP )
Chang'e 2 : This well - traveled Chinese spacecraft launched in October 2010 to scout out locations for a future lunar lander , which China is readying for launch in 2013 .
After completing its mission at the moon in June 2011 , Chang'e 2 headed out to sun-Earth Lagrange point 2 to help test China 's deep - space tracking and control network .
Then , in mid-April of this year , it departed to do a flyby of the near - Earth asteroid Toutatis , accomplishing the feat on Dec. 13 .
Several other spacecraft are also parked at sun-Earth L2 , including the European Space Agency 's Herschel and Planck space observatories .
NASA 's prolific Spitzer Space Telescope , meanwhile , is in an Earth - trailing orbit around the sun , and the agency 's Deep Impact probe is headed toward a possible 2020 rendezvous with a near - Earth asteroid called 2002 GT .
Deep Impact launched in January 2005 and slammed an impactor into Comet Tempel 1 on July 4 of that year .
In November 2010 , it accomplished a flyby of Comet Hartley 2 .
Deep Impact has traveled more than 4.2 billion miles ( 6.75 billion km ) in space thus far .
Mars
Mars Odyssey :
This venerable NASA orbiter launched in April 2001 and arrived at the Red Planet six months later to look for signs of past and present water activity .
The $ 297 million spacecraft also serves as a communications relay between NASA 's Mars rovers and their controllers on Earth .
Mars Express : This 150 million - euro ( $ 198 million ) ESA probe 's main objective is to look for subsurface water from orbit .
It launched in June 2003 and arrived at Mars in December of that year .
Mars Express also aimed to put a lander , called Beagle 2 , on the Martian surface , but this aspect of the mission failed .
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter : NASA 's $ 720 million MRO spacecraft launched in August 2005 and achieved Mars orbit in March 2006 .
Since then , it has been mapping the Red Planet 's surface with unprecedented precision .
In addition to their scientific value , MRO 's observations have helped NASA decide where to land surface missions on the Red Planet .
MRO is also the chief communications link between Mars surface craft and Earth .

Opportunity Rover :
This golf - cart - size robot launched in July 2003 and landed in January 2004 , three weeks after its twin , Spirit .
Spirit and Opportunity were tasked with three - month missions to search for signs of past water activity on Mars ; both found plenty of such evidence and kept on roving .
Spirit stopped communicating with Earth in March 2010 , but Opportunity is still going strong .
NASA has spent about $ 900 million on the rovers ' mission to date .
Curiosity Rover : The $ 2.5 billion Curiosity rover dwarfs Spirit and Opportunity ; it 's the size of a small car and weighs a ton .
Curiosity launched in November 2011 and pulled off a dramatic sky - crane landing on Aug. 5 , 2012 .
Its main mission is to determine if its Gale Crater landing site has ever been capable of supporting microbial life .

Asteroid belt and environs
Dawn : NASA 's $ 466 million Dawn spacecraft launched in September 2007 and arrived at the protoplanet Vesta — the second - largest denizen of the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter — in July 2011 .
Dawn departed Vesta in September 2012 to head to the belt 's biggest body , Ceres .
It should reach the dwarf planet in February 2015 .
Rosetta :
This ambitious ESA mission , which costs about 1 billion euros ( $ 1.32 billion ) , aims to orbit and drop a lander on the comet 67P Churyumov - Gerasimenko .
Rosetta launched in March 2004 , executed flybys of two different asteroids in 2008 and 2010 and is set to meet up with the comet in mid-2014 near the orbit of Jupiter , about 420 million miles ( 675 million km ) from Earth .
Jupiter
Juno :
This $ 1.1 billion NASA spacecraft launched in August 2011 and is slated to arrive at Jupiter in August 2016 .
Over the course of one Earth year , Juno will study the gas giant 's atmosphere , internal structure and magnetic field from orbit .
Juno is the first solar - powered spacecraft ever to venture as far as Jupiter .

Saturn
Cassini : The $ 3.2 billion Cassini - Huygens mission , a joint effort involving NASA , ESA , and the Italian Space Agency , launched in October 1997 and achieved Saturn orbit in July 2004 .
The Cassini spacecraft has been studying Saturn , its rings and the planet 's many moons ever since .
In January 2005 , the probe also delivered the Huygens lander to the surface of Titan , Saturn 's largest moon .
Pluto
New Horizons :
This super - speedy NASA spacecraft launched in January 2006 and is set to fly by the Pluto system in July 2015 , giving researchers their first - ever up - close look at the dwarf planet .
After that , the $ 700 million probe may also fly by one or more objects in the Kuiper Belt , the ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune 's orbit .
Solar system 's edge
Voyager 1 and 2 : NASA 's twin Voyager probes launched in 1977 to study Saturn , Jupiter and their moons .
The pair made many discoveries about these far - flung bodies , then checked out Uranus and Neptune and kept on flying .
Both spacecraft are now studying the unique conditions at the edge of the solar system , knocking on the door of interstellar space .
Voyager 1 — the most distant manmade object ever launched — is currently about 11 billion miles ( 18 billion km ) from Earth , while Voyager 2 is 9 billion miles ( 15 billion km ) from home .
NASA has spent about $ 1 billion on the mission to date .

RALEIGH , N.C. --
A playoff game was tied and time was ticking away .
For the Carolina Hurricanes , that meant it was Jussi Jokinen 's time to shine .
Jokinen scored at 2:48 of overtime to lift the Hurricanes past the Boston Bruins 3 - 2 on Wednesday night in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinal series .
Sergei Samsonov scored a goal and assisted on Jokinen 's winner for the Hurricanes , who took a 2 - 1 series lead with Game 4 set for Friday night in Raleigh .
" Obviously it feels great , with the things I 've been through this year , " said Jokinen , waived by the Tampa Bay Lightning before being traded to Carolina in February .
" I found my confidence again here .
It 's been a great ride . "
Mark Recchi and Milan Lucic both scored their first goals of the playoffs for Boston .
The top - seeded team in the East has lost two straight and is trailing a playoff series for the first time this year after sweeping Montreal in the first round .
" We had some chances , but there 's such a thing as hockey gods , and sometimes they 'll give the breaks to the team that deserves it , " Boston coach Claude Julien said .
" Unfortunately , we did n't really deserve this game , the way we played . "
Jokinen certainly would n't let them have it .
The hero of Game 4 of the first round , who scored off his skate with 0.2 seconds left to beat the New Jersey Devils , delivered another clutch goal .
Samsonov set up the winner by moving into the low circle and firing a backhander off Tim Thomas ' pads .
Jokinen was positioned perfectly to tap the rebound into an open net for his fifth goal of the playoffs .
" The last month , the last two months , I 've been getting my confidence pretty high , and I 'm just believing in myself , " Jokinen said .
" When you have your confidence high , you feel you can do some good things on the ice . "
He also scored the tying goal in Game 7 against the Devils with 1:20 left in the third period before Eric Staal netted the winner with 31.7 seconds remaining .
" I think there 's a belief that 's built in , that you have a tendency to keep the faith a little bit longer , " coach Paul Maurice said .
" The fact of the matter is , the teams that do n't are already gone .
That 's how it works .
The teams that believe the longest just keep playing . "
Thomas made 38 saves for the Bruins .
Carolina 's Cam Ward stopped 21 shots .
Recchi -- a key member of the Hurricanes ' Stanley Cup championship team in 2006 -- tied it with just under 11 minutes left in regulation when he scored on a deflection , redirecting Chuck Kobasew 's shot from the wing past Ward to make it 2 - all .
Thomas kept it tied by withstanding an onslaught by the Hurricanes , who had a 38 - 19 shots advantage before overtime .
Two straight shots -- from Staal and Samsonov , 69 seconds apart in the second -- gave the Hurricanes a 2 - 1 lead .
Staal started the scoring burst when he stole the puck from Steve Montador near the end line and whipped it by Thomas with 3:11 left in the second for his team - leading seventh goal .
Samsonov -- one of several high - profile Hurricanes with none -- ended that dry spell just over a minute later , snapping in a pretty feed from Scott Walker .
" We were on the attack .
We were skating well , " Staal said .
" We were hustling to pucks and getting shots through from the point .
If it did n't hit the net , we were getting to the loose pucks in the corners .
That 's a key to our team .
That 's what makes us good . "
It also reignited a cowbell - clanging crowd of Caniacs , who were still buzzing after Carolina 's 3 - 0 win Sunday in Boston that shifted home - ice advantage to Tobacco Road .
Lucic did his best to silence them for a while , scoring his first goal of the playoffs about 8 1/2 minutes in .
" We have to make sure we 're doing the right things , " Recchi said .
" Right now they 're a team that seems to want it a little bit more than us .
For whatever reason , it 's desperate times now .
We do n't want to go down 3 - 1 .
We 're going to have to play the best game of the year on Friday . "
So you 're poking around the web , and you find a skeptical article that simply rocks the casbah ( yes , I 'm old ) .
You 're dying to tell everyone you can about it , but how to get the word out ?
There are lots of options , actually .
Skeptic KyleV just sent me a note saying that reddit.com has its own skepticism section !
That 's fantastic .
Reddit is a social network site where people submit articles they like , and others can vote them up or down , and leave comments .
As an article gets more votes , it rises in the list , and more people see it .
In that sense it 's much like Digg , too .
A lot of people seem to prefer Reddit over Digg , and in fact while I am a big fan of Digg , they have taken a couple of weird turns lately ...
I 'm specifically calling them out over their toolbar , for example .
Anyway , submitting articles to these social networks is a great way to get the word out .
When I have an article " front page " on Digg , for example -- meaning it rises up to a certain level and moves from the upcoming section to the actual main science or space section -- I might get tens or even hundreds of thousands of page views to that page .
It 's incredible .
We skeptics have a hard time getting our word out .
We do n't have a lot of celebrities pretending to be skeptics ( like Jenny McCarthy pretends to be a medical researcher ) so it 's tough for us , plus lot of the times people do n't want to hear the truth .
But it helps a lot if those of us in the trenches at least get to hear about news when it comes out , the Reddit skeptic section is a great way to raise the alarm when needed .
A five - year study by Tom Corley , the author of “ Rich Habits , ” found that on average , 65 % of self - made millionaires had three income streams .
As demonstrated in this study , by diversifying income streams , individuals could benefit from greater income and increased financial independence : the less reliant you are on a single source of income , the greater control and flexibility you have with your finances .
As VP of Investments at Fundrise , I often hear from investors their desire to add another income stream .
While there are nearly infinite ways to earn supplemental income , some options require less time and attention than others – and offer more consistent returns .
Considerations like these can be important for anybody working a full - time job trying to determine the best place to put their capital or efforts .
If you have limited time or desire to devote to building a side hustle , a wise investment strategy is key in creating dependable , low - maintenance supplemental income streams .
Real estate has long been an asset of choice for savvy investors interested in building powerful supplemental incomes .
Why ?
Real estate can offer a consistent cash flow from rental income .
On top of rental income , investors can benefit from asset appreciation over the long term .
But real estate investing has n’t always been easy , and some forms of real estate investing pose fewer barriers than others .
Active real estate investing offers the benefit of direct ownership , but also requires large commitments of time , lump sums of money , and ongoing responsibility .
On the other hand , passive real estate investing significantly lowers barriers to entry , expanding access to real estate investments , and with much less maintenance required .
Active Real Estate Investing : Ready to Be a Landlord ?
Rental properties have been the default choice for average investors who want to step into the world of real estate investing .
While this option certainly has the potential to offer supplemental income , it also comes with many ongoing , hands - on responsibilities – and its profitability depends entirely on the investor .
Active real estate investing demands a wealth of real estate and financial acumen .
An investor must have the knowledge to assess , buy , and manage the property in order to turn a profit each month .
Without this expertise , you risk not earning a profit at all , or worse , losing money .
If you do have all the necessary skills , do you also have the necessary capital ?
A rental property is an option that only some can afford .
It requires a large monetary commitment upfront , in the form of a down payment and / or loan – all for a single asset .
A rental property is also considered an illiquid investment , meaning that an investor should expect to tie up their money in the asset .
As a long - term investment , this usually means years .
On top of financial responsibilities , rental property ownership also comes with myriad hands - on responsibilities to the tenants and property .
Rental property owners bear the full weight of these responsibilities .
Some ongoing , hands - on responsibilities include ensuring maximum tenant occupancy , performing tenant background screenings , collecting rent , maintaining appliances , and possibly evicting tenants .
Additionally , a rental property owner must ensure that the property and its finances comply with all applicable laws at all times .
It ’s easy to see how a side hustle like this can turn into a full - time job .
If you do n’t have any interest in becoming a landlord , there are more accessible , passive ways to generate supplemental income in the real estate market .
Passive Real Estate Investing : Less Responsibility , Greater Benefits
You can still reap the rewards of supplemental income and asset appreciation through passive investing .
Plus , passive investors can receive the benefit of greater real estate diversification – all without the ongoing responsibilities of building maintenance , landlording , and other obligations that property owners face .
If you are n’t ready to commit to a large down payment for a single property , a passive investment can lower the financial barrier .
Where rental properties can range from tens of thousand to millions of dollars in acquisition and operation fees , passive investments are more accessible .
In addition to requiring less capital , a passive investment also requires significantly less maintenance from an investor .
The responsibilities – and ultimately the success of a property – fall on the shoulders of the investor in an active investment .
In a passive investment , an investor only provides capital and lets the investment professionals take it from there .
For example , at Fundrise , our real estate team provides active real estate private equity management service for all investments .
This entails underwriting , originating , and closing all investments – and continuing to manage each investment throughout the lifetime of ownership , without ever needing to take time of the investors themselves .
Passive real estate investors also enjoy the options of investing in real estate across multiple locations , property sizes , and classes of real estate rather than putting large amounts of money into one property .
Online real estate investment platforms offer investors ways to invest in diversified portfolios of real estate , but access and investment minimums vary by platform .
What ’s the Best Way to Earn Supplemental Income for You ?
Many investors understand how real estate can offer a valuable and reliable source of supplemental income when selected and managed well .
Before beginning , it ’s important to assess which method of real estate investing maximizes your return for the amount of time , money , and responsibility that you ’re able to commit .
If you ’re not ready to become a landlord , you can skip the hassles and potential pitfalls that have traditionally gone hand - in - hand with real estate investing and invest passively in a diversified pool of real estate .
Our Supplemental Income Portfolio was created with the purpose of earning investors consistent supplemental income over the long term .
To achieve that goal , it ’s invested in a diversified pool of more than thirty debt and equity real estate investments across the US .
Overall , the traditional barriers of real estate investing have been drastically lowered thanks to advancements in technology and federal regulations .
Regardless of which method fits best with your investment strategy – getting into the historically well - performing asset class of real estate is a great way to start building an income stream today .
Kendall Davis leads the Investments Team at Fundrise , the first investment platform to create a simple , low - cost way for anyone to unlock real estate ’s historically consistent and exceptional returns .
Since joining in 2014 , Kendall has built out investor relations for the company , focusing on all aspects of the Fundrise investor experience and furthering the company ’s mission to democratize real estate investing .

Many players are , understandably , put off by World War II games , thanks to their over saturation and endless exploitation .
With that in mind , Wolfenstein 's creative director Eric Biessman wants it to be known that the latest iteration of the Nazi - killing franchise is not another WWII shooter .
" There ’s a lot to be excited about in Wolfenstein , " says the Raven director .
" The core gameplay of Wolfenstein is based on fast - action , visceral combat and heavy - duty firepower .
Looking deeper at the game , you see that it ’s set in a very compelling universe .
While the game is set in WWII , it ’s not a WWII game – that ’s like saying the Indiana Jones movies are WWII movies . "
Biessman goes on to talk about how Wolfenstein will focus on the occult side of proceedings , with " larger than life " characters , weaponry and enemies .
Nazis wearing powered - up suits of armor and wielding beam weapons are the order of the day , not gritty realistic warfare .
More power to them and I hope they do well with that .
Raven , I mean ... not the Nazis .
Seriously , I look forward to good things .
I was personally very disappointed with the last Wolfenstein game but Raven is in my good books right now , so I expect they 'll pull something solid out of the bag .
Nazis in power armor always make for a good start .

Shell will revisit one of the darkest periods of its history tomorrow as a potentially groundbreaking court case opens in New York .
The oil giant stands accused of complicity in the 1995 execution of Ken Saro - Wiwa , a Nigerian environmental activist .
The world 's boardrooms are watching the case , which is seen as a test of whether transnational companies owned or operating in the US can be held responsible for human rights abuses committed abroad .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A collection of cases brought by torture victims in the oil - rich Niger Delta and by relatives of those killed has been brought together under the umbrella of Wiwa v Shell .
The plaintiffs include Ken Saro - Wiwa 's son , Ken Wiwa Jnr , and his brother , Owens Wiwa .
For Shell , which denies any involvement in the environmentalist 's killing , ordered by the government of Sani Abacha , the case represents an unwelcome public hearing of grievances that the company has spent time and money trying to make people forget .
Mr Saro - Wiwa was hanged in November 1995 after being convicted by a military tribunal in which he was denied proper legal representation or appeal .
Shell subsequently faced a storm of protest and Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth .
The then British prime minister John Major called the execution " judicial murder " .
Tomorrow 's proceedings will see the Dutch - based energy giant charged with collaborating with Nigerian authorities in the execution of Mr Saro - Wiwa and eight other members of his ethnic Ogoni group on " trumped - up charges " .
Shell has vigorously denied any involvement and says it appealed to the Abacha government for clemency on Mr Saro - Wiwa 's part .
The suit also alleges that the company consistently conspired with military authorities to violently put down peaceful protests by the Ogoni people , hundreds of thousands of whom Mr Saro - Wiwa had helped to mobilise .
" I have always maintained that Shell was complicit in the conspiracy to silence my father along with thousands of other Ogonis , " said his eldest son , Ken Wiwa Jnr .
Nigeria 's oil industry has long been the most glaring example of what is called Africa 's " resource curse " .

While Nigeria is Africa 's largest oil producer , the peoples of the river delta where the crude is extracted have seen their homelands turned into a wasteland .
The millions of dollars of oil revenue accrued every day have done nothing for the 70 per cent of Nigerians who live on less than $ 1 a day .
In the Niger Delta , farmlands and fish stocks have been destroyed amid environmental degradation brought on by oil spills , deforestation and the notorious practice of gas flaring , which continues despite being banned .
Ken Saro - Wiwa , an accomplished writer and businessman , had warned that Shell 's actions in Nigeria would return to haunt them : " I and my colleagues are not the only ones on trial ...
There is no doubt in my mind that the ecological war that the company has waged in the Delta will be called into question sooner than later and the crimes of that war duly punished . "
The campaigner 's death proved to be a turning point in the Delta and many of his darker predictions have since been borne out .
Oil production in Nigeria is running at half its capacity , the Petroleum Minister Odein Ajumogobia said last week .
And the Niger Delta has been transformed into a war zone .
The peaceful protests that peaked in 1993 with an estimated 300,000 Ogonis marching against Shell demanding compensation and an end to environmental destruction have been succeeded by armed militias in open revolt .
The demonstrations and sit-ins have given way to kidnappings , bombings , sabotage and armed assaults on oil rigs , pumping stations and multinational targets .
The region is overrun with corrupt authorities orchestrating pirate gangs and wholesale oil theft .
As the preliminary hearings begin in New York tomorrow , hundreds of people in the Niger Delta are feared to have been killed in the crossfire during a counter - insurgency which the Nigerian government launched this month .
A joint task force carried out sea and air attacks against targets in the Delta and ground troops were sent in to flush out militants .
Amnesty International condemned the operation .
The main militant group in the region is now the Movement for Emancipation of the Niger Delta , and unlike Mr Saro - Wiwa 's Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People , its tactics are avowedly violent .
The violence has affected all oil companies but analysts say that Shell 's onshore fields have been the worst affected .
The oil industry was judged to have fed the violence in the Delta , according to a report that Shell commissioned five years ago .
Shell has been active since 1958 in the Delta , which contains most of Nigeria 's energy reserves , estimated at 36 billion barrels of oil and 187 trillion cubic feet of gas .
The plaintiffs in the case allege that , although the Nigerian government tortured and executed the claimants and their relatives , " these abuses were instigated , orchestrated , planned , and facilitated by Shell Nigeria " and that the company " provided money , weapons , and logistical support to the Nigerian military , participated in the fabrication of murder charges , and bribed witnesses to give testimony . "
In a statement , Shell said : " Shell in no way encouraged or advocated any act of violence against [ the claimants ] or their fellow Ogonis .
We believe that the evidence will show clearly that Shell was not responsible for these tragic events . "
Ethnic groups in the Delta have wanted greater autonomy since before independence from Britain in 1960 .
The Ogoni campaign was built on perceptions among ethnic minorities that they were being cheated out of oil revenue by a corrupt government dominated by Nigeria 's larger ethnic groups .

The tale of Homo floresiensis – aka the hobbit – is beginning to read less like a Tolkien epic than an Agatha Christie whodunit .
Two studies add a new twist to the plot .
One claims that the skeleton ’s ape - like feet push back its ancestry near the dawn of Homo .
Another argues that the hobbit is a later offshoot of Homo erectus , dwarfed by aeons of island isolation .
“ Either answer is pretty damn exciting , ” says William Jungers , a palaeoanthropologist at Stony Brook University in New York , who led the analysis of the foot .
“ It ’s telling us something pretty amazing about human evolution . ”
Hobbit skeleton
Researchers unearthed the hobbit ’s 18,000 - year - old skeleton in Liang Bua Cave on the Indonesian island of Flores in 2003 .
Then in 2004 partial remains from at least a half dozen individuals were uncovered .
Much subsequent research has focused on the skull , which encased a 417 cubic - centimetre brain – about the size of a chimpanzee ’s and a third the size of a human adult brain .
Since island species , separated from their mainland kin , tend to shrink over evolutionary time , the main thrust of the “ hobbit as separate species ” arguments have focussed on its small brain .
However another theory holds that the skull is simply that of a diseased Homo sapiens .
Lack of resources could select for smaller and smaller bodies , and some researchers argue that power - hungry brains can shrink even more drastically than the rest of the body .
Island dwarf
“ It might be advantageous to the animal not to invest in such a large organ , ” says Eleanor Weston , a palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum in London , whose new study contends that H. floresiensis was an insular dwarf of H. erectus .
But even scaled down to the hobbit ’s 1 - metre , 30 to 40 kilogram frame , H. erectus would boast a brain of 500 to 650 cubic centimetres – small but still too big to explain the Hobbit skull .
However , Weston contends that such figures underestimate the dwarfing of mammalian brains that actually occurs on islands .
She and colleague Adrian Lister compared two extinct species of dwarf hippopotami found on Madagascar with the modern , full - sized beasts found only on the African mainland .
True brain size
The dwarf species went extinct in the past 1000 years , and they diverged from mainland hippopotami sometime between 50,000 and two million years ago , Weston says .
Using more than 30 full - size hippopotami of varying age and size as reference points , Weston and Lister calculated the scaled - down brain size of 24 dwarf hippos .
These models consistently overestimated the true size of the dwarf ’s brains by about 24 or 30 per cent .
“ If Homo floresiensis really had undergone this process of dwarfing , potentially something like Homo erectus could be the ancestor , ” Weston says .
Applying a scaling factor to a dwarfed H. erectus comes up with Hobbit - sized brain that ’s between 378 and 493 cubic centimetres , depending on the H. erectus specimen used .
Bizarre foot
“ My problem with that is that it does n’t speak to the rest of the skeleton , ” says Jungers , who also presented his analysis of the hobbit ’s bizarre foot at an anthropology conference last year .
For starters , the feet of H. floresiensis are far longer than would be expected of 1 - metre tall H. erectus or H. sapiens .
The resulting need to drag its feet back high with each step to avoid kicking the ground would have limited its ability to move swiftly .
It also has unarched feet .
“ It ’s never going to win the 100 - yard dash , and it ’s never going to win the marathon , ” Jungers says .
Both features also point to an ancestor that predates fleet - footed H. erectus , Jungers says .
“ If in fact human evolution redesigned the bipedal foot in some way , these guys missed the train . ”
A closer inspection of the bones in the hobbit ’s nearly complete left foot reveal both modern and archaic characteristics .
Its short big toe resembles that of an australopithecine like Lucy , while the shapes of the toe bones appear human .
“ It ’s definitely a head - scratcher , ” Jungers says .
He speculates that the hobbit ’s closest relative is a species of human more ancient than H. erectus , with a smaller brain – perhaps H. habilis .
Satisfying theory
Robert Martin , a palaeontologist at Chicago ’s Field Museum not involved in either study , says Jungers ’ explanation is more satisfying than the idea of a H. erectus , dwarfed by island - life .
“ That could explain the small brain without requiring any major reduction , ” he says .
But adds that there is no indication in the fossil record that any human species older than H. erectus travelled beyond Africa .
However , Martin still thinks the hobbit is an unusually small human that suffered from a developmental disease , possibly microcephaly .
“ This needs to be confirmed by some fossils , ” says Jungers , who hopes a five - year excavation of other spots in Flores that ’s in the works will determine what the ancestors of the Hobbit looked like .

Geithner 's Heist America Plan is receiving words of self - serving praise from Pimco 's Bill Gross .
Indeed , Geithner ’s Non-Recourse Gift Keeps on Giving to Bill Gross .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s plan to rid banks and markets of devalued assets may be a boon for Pacific Investment Management Co. ’s Bill Gross .
The plan may reward investors with 20 percent annual returns on “ really toxic ” mortgages bought at 45 cents on the dollar by allowing them to borrow six times their money with “ non-recourse ” government - backed debt , New York - based Credit Suisse Group AG analysts Carl Lantz and Dominic Konstam wrote in a March 27 report .
That loan would be worth 15 cents to an investor seeking the same return who ca n’t use borrowed money .
“ This is perhaps the first win / win / win policy to be put on the table , ” Gross , co-chief investment officer of Newport Beach , California - based Pimco , said in an e-mailed statement last week .
Geithner ’s plan may already be working .
Top -rated commercial - mortgage bonds rose 5.6 percent since March 20 to about 79 cents on the dollar on average , according to Merrill Lynch & Co. indexes .
The most - senior class of benchmark 2005 securities backed by fixed - rate Alt - A home loans , or those ranked between prime and subprime , increased about 12 percent to 54 cents as of March 31 , according to Deutsche Bank AG .
Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama , the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee , said in an April 1 interview that the distribution of half of the profits to the investor “ does bother me . ”
“ But even beyond that , what bothers me even more is it ’s taxpayer money , ” Bachus said .
“ What you are doing is artificially inflating the price of those assets because at the present prices the financial institutions wo n’t sell them . ”
‘ Taxpayer Loses ’
Nobel prize - winning economists Paul Krugman , a professor at Princeton University in Princeton , New Jersey , and Joseph Stiglitz , a professor at the Business School of Columbia University in New York , blasted Geithner ’s plan for putting the taxpayer on the hook for losses with what they say is little likelihood of success .
“ The Geithner plan works only if and when the taxpayer loses big time , ” Stiglitz wrote in the New York Times this week .
“ With the government absorbing the losses , the market does n’t care if the banks are ‘ cheating ’ them by selling their lousiest assets , because the government bears the cost . ”
Krugman wrote in the Times last month that “ Obama is squandering his credibility ” with the plan .
‘ We intend to participate and do our part to serve clients as well as promote economic recovery , ’’ Pimco ’s Gross said in the e-mail .
The Plan : Dump $ 500 billion of toxic assets on to unsuspecting taxpayers via a public - private partnership in which 93 % of the losses are born by the taxpayer so that bondholders are made whole .
The whole scheme is not really a bidding process at all but rather backroom political dealing by the " Good Ole Boys " on how to split the pie .
Pie Splitting Rules
1 ) Bail out the banks at taxpayer expense
2 ) Do so at the least possible cost to the major bondholders ( not the taxpayer )
The more players ( hedge funds , etc. ) one ads to the backroom poker game , the harder it is to accomplish rule number 2 .
This explains Geithner 's steep rules for entry into the club .
Exclusive Invitation Only Club
They are excluding large ( over $ 25 billion ) hedge funds , who would have the sophistication and resources to look under the Kimono and declare with vicious authority that the emperor has no clothes .
Pimco Needs A New Name
Clarice Adhiambo was looking for the usual things when she moved .
Safe streets , more space , a guest room , maybe even a view of something green .
More than anything she wanted a place to call her own .
Her wish - list would be familiar to first - time buyers anywhere in the world .
What would be less recognisable is the place from which she was moving .
Clarice left behind a 10ft by 10ft tin shack that she shared with eight others in the Nairobi slum of Soweto .
Unlike the iconic South African shanty town of the same name , there is no electricity , running water or flushing toilets and no prospect of getting them .
Kenya 's capital offers some of the most appalling urban poverty to be found anywhere in the world .
It was in places like Kibera , Mathare and Soweto that the term " flying toilet " was invented .
It describes the desperate people who cannot afford to use pit latrines and have to defecate into plastic bags and hurl them on to a nearby roof .
In her new home in Kaputei , an eco - town rising from the plains south of Nairobi , she has a flushing loo for the first time in her life and understandably she 's delighted .
" This place has fresh air , " the 53 - year - old says , almost unbelievingly .

Clarice is part of one of 50 families who have bought into a startling experiment that it is hoped will change the nature of microfinance and banking for the poor .
The practice pioneered by the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus , of offering tiny loans to the some of the world 's bottom billion living on less than $ 1 a day , is flourishing .
From six million borrowers worldwide in 1987 , microfinance groups now lend to 150 million people .
And while the rest of the banking industry has been in meltdown , microfinance has been a rare pocket of stability and growth .
The sector brings together an unlikely , eclectic mix of people from frustrated charity workers to entrepreneurs , to those who have already made their fortune and come to microfinance with the evangelical zeal of the reborn .
Ed Bland falls into this last category .
In his past life as a Microsoft executive he was the man who launched the X - Box .
Today he is the president of Unitus , an American non-profit group in a hurry to make a big difference to global poverty and intent on using microfinance to do it .
Mr Bland explains his credo as " the ability to use common business principles to make people 's lives better in a way that development has shown it can't do " .
In the future , he believes there will be an " opportunity for enterprising banks to focus on the bottom and not just the top " .
" Look what happened when we just focused on the top , " he muses .
Seattle - based Unitus uses its capital , connections and corporate credibility to persuade mainstream banks to loan to , or underwrite , microfinance institutions ( MFIs ) .
It then uses its know - how to identify and support innovative microfinance outfits it believes can make a dramatic impact on alleviating poverty .
Mr Bland rates Jamii Bora , Kenya 's oldest and biggest MFI , among the most innovative organisations in the world .
When Jamii Bora – Swahili for " better families " – found that micro loans and repayments could take the poorest only so far , it decided to do something new .
" As long as you are living in the slums , you will never climb out of poverty , " says Ingrid Munro , the founder of Jamii Bora .
" Families of course need economic opportunities to rise out of poverty but what good are they if you are still living in hell ? "
The solution they came up with was to build an entirely new town , a Milton Keynes of microfinance .
The result is Kaputei with its neat rows of clay - tiled roofs .
From a distance , it looks like the shining town on a hill , only this one is set among Maasai grazing lands and the occasional polythene flower farm .
" We are seeing something that we have n't seen anywhere else in the world , " says Mr Bland , bumping along the dirt track towards it in a mini-bus .
When Jamii Bora found that the Kenya power corporation wanted a fortune to connect the town to the grid , their attitude was " we 'll do it ourselves " .
So they built their own renewable power station .
When builders ' merchants wanted to overcharge for breeze blocks and tiles , they built their own factories which now provide jobs as well as materials .
Kaputei's houses are powered by solar panels and its water will be processed by one of the first ecologically sound recycling plants in Africa .

The question is whether Kaputei is scaleable .
Even if it succeeds in getting 2,500 families to move from the slums , it is a pressure release that will be barely felt in the likes of Kibera , with its one - million plus residents .
Relaxing in an armchair in her sitting room , Clarice gives the former Microsoft whizzkids her take on where Jamii Bora 's ferocious can - do mentality comes from .
It is an organisation she knows well , having joined at the " ground level " .
Born into poverty near Lake Victoria , Clarice had a hard life .
She was badly beaten by her husband and the father of three of her four children .
He eventually threw her out and she drifted from friend to relative before ending up a street beggar in Nairobi .
While living rough she was raped , conceiving her only son .
Clarice and her fellow beggars struck up a relationship with a kindly worker of a non-government organisation they knew as Mama Ingrid .
As well as a little money , the Swede would take the time to talk to the women , Clarice remembers .
Despite this friendship , the women were deeply suspicious when Mama offered to help them learn how to save money .
The women thought " she 'd been sent from Sweden to come and eat our money " and hatched a plan to beat her up .
Ingrid Munro persisted and persuaded a few dozen of the beggars to trust her .
Clarice 's face contorts with remembered shock when she recalls the day Mama told her she had saved 1,000 Kenyan shillings ( £8 ) .
There were more surprises to come as Mrs Munro offered to lend her the same amount again to set up a business .
" Do n't give me a headache , " was Clarice 's initial response .
" What is a loan ?
What business can I do ?
I do n't even know how to write my name . "
The Great Lakes girl put her 2,000 Kenyan shillings in fish .
With each loan repaid she would borrow more .
By her sixth loan , there was too much money for fish and she expanded into market stalls .
By her 10th , she was borrowing £ 1,200 and opening a string of slum businesses .
The first group of 50 beggars a decade ago has swollen to a membership of 225,000 .
Clarice 's latest loan is a mortgage on her home in Kaputei with monthly payments of £ 23 .
She is " overpaying " at the moment to settle the loan early .
From the window of Clarice 's kitchen , the green of the grasslands is only interrupted by the black and white lines of a herd of zebra .
But it is the sink tap that holds her attention .
She turns it on .
" So much water , " she says with infectious wonder .
Guy from Russia had a camera installed on his window looking over the construction site .
He has made daily one shot for one year while the house was built and then combined one year into 16 second video .
Senator Christopher J. Dodd , the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee , said the bill became a reality because of cooperation from Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama , the panel ’s ranking Republican , and many other lawmakers on both sides .
President Obama has spoken derisively of the multi-page , fine - print statements familiar to millions of credit card - users .
Last week , he told a receptive crowd in New Mexico that “ you should not have to worry that when you sign up for a credit card , you ’re signing away all your rights .
You should n’t need a magnifying glass or a law degree to read the fine print that sometimes does n’t even appear to be written in English . ”
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts , a senior Democrat on the finance and commerce committees , said , “ We ’ve got too many hard - working families in Massachusetts struggling to keep their heads above water , and the last thing they need is to get whacked with unfair credit card fees . ”
Among other things , the Senate measure would prohibit companies from raising interest rates on existing balances unless a card holder was 60 days behind , and then it would require the rate to be restored to its previous level if payments were on time for six months .
Consumers would have to be notified of rate increases 45 days in advance .
And companies could not charge a late fee if they were late processing a payment .
Statements would have to be mailed 21 days before a payment was due .
It would be harder for companies to issue cards to people under age 21 .
Rates could not be increased within the first year , and promotional rates would be in force for at least six months .
Credit card debt has increased by 25 percent in the last decade , with delinquency rates up by more than a third since 2006 , according to statistics cited by the White House .
Americans pay $ 15 billion in penalty fees a year , accounting for about 10 percent of the industry ’s revenues .
About a fifth of those carrying credit card debt pay more than 20 percent in interest .
One amendment attached to the Senate bill by Senator Tom Coburn , Republican of Oklahoma , would restore a Bush administration policy allowing loaded guns in national parks .
That provision is not in the House version , so there may be discussions between the two chambers over the issue .
( CNN ) --
Recent headlines focusing on the rash of pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia should instead focus on the humanitarian crisis driving Somalis to commit crimes on the high seas , an international aid group said Thursday .
Somalia 's population have suffered from a lack of the most basic services .
An estimated one - third of Somalia 's population desperately needs emergency aid , the international agency Oxfam said , as donors to Somalia met in Brussels , Belgium .
" Without economic opportunities offering alternatives to criminality , and without law and order to curb these activities , then the massive economic returns of hijacking ships will continue to drive piracy , " Robert Maletta , policy adviser for Oxfam , said in a news release .
" The international community must urgently focus their attention on finding ways to assist the millions of people in desperate need , " Maletta said .
Somalia , which is racked by poverty and conflict , has not had a fully functioning government since 1991 , when its president was overthrown in Mogadishu , the capital .
Drought and rising food prices have added to the nation 's problems , according to Maletta .
" Families are finding it difficult to meet their most basic needs , as prices for basic food items are at record high levels , " he said .
Not only do civilians need emergency aid , they also need protection from military abuses , aid groups said .
" Since Somalia 's security forces have committed so many violent abuses against civilians , efforts to strengthen them also need to make them more accountable , " said Georgette Gagnon , Africa director for Human Rights Watch .
The combination of security and humanitarian assistance is necessary to curb piracy in the region , which borders the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean , aid groups said .
The April 8 hijacking of the U.S. - flagged cargo ship Maersk Alabama made headlines worldwide when its American captain , Richard Phillips , was held hostage by four Somali men .
Phillips was rescued four days later , after U.S. Navy snipers fatally shot three pirates .
The fourth suspect , Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse , was brought to New York to face federal piracy charges .
Ships with aid supplies destined for countries in the region , including Somalia , also have been hijacked in the Indian Ocean .
Pirates held a ship carrying U.N. food aid for 100 days in June 2005 .
Two years ago , a cargo ship and crew delivering U.N. aid to Somalia were held and released after 40 days .
The Maersk was going to the coastal town of Mombasa , Kenya , to deliver relief supplies intended for various countries in the region , including Somalia .

pyron : Making Python package development DRY to the point of no return
Date : 22 April 2009
Tags : computing , python
I finally snapped last week .
After years of writing verbose and repetitive setup.py files for my Python packages , I am unable to write another .
Instead , I have started writing Pyron , a tool that gathers the same information by inspecting a Python package itself .
Not only does this mean that I get to stop repeating myself , but that my projects will become much more uniform because package metadata will be represented through common conventions instead of explicit ( and repetitive ) configuration .
Though Pyron is still very primitive , it has already allowed me to reduce simple packages to only a README . txt plus their actual Python source code .
The start of the trouble
What happened is that I wanted to create a simple Python package full of tools for professional authors working with rst documents , so that they could monitor their word count while writing , and convert their rst files into the proprietary formats used by various publications .
But just to start a new Python project required me to create four entire files , and almost as many directories :
. / cursive .
tools / setup . py . / cursive .
tools / cursive / __init__ . py . / cursive .
tools / cursive / tools / README . txt . / cursive .
tools / cursive / tools / __init__ .
py
The setup.py file itself repeats the project name over , and over , and over again , reminding me of the old Adventure game 's “ maze of twisty passages , all alike ” :
from setuptools import setup setup ( name = ' cursive.tools ' , version = ' 0.1 ' , description =
' Tools for restructured text files ' , author = ' Brandon Craig Rhodes ' , author_email = 'brandon@rhodesmill.org ' , packages = [ ' cursive.tools ' , ' cursive ' ] , namespace_packages = [ ' cursive ' ] , )
The first __init__.py file shown above of course looks like :
import pkg_resources pkg_resources .
declare_namespace ( __name__ )
Meanwhile , my stub README.txt and __init__.py files down in the bottom directory contained just enough information to get me started , whether I wanted to start by writing documentation and tests or get started by writing actual code :
``cursive.tools`` --
Tools for restructured text files
------------------------------------------------------
The routines in this ``cursive . tools`` package are designed for authors .
They provide command - line tools that can examine Restructured Text files .
" " " Command - line routines for Restructured Text authors . " " "
__version__ = ' 0.1 '
And , having created these files , I stopped , and stared in horror .
For an entire hour I tried to move on .
I tried to start writing actual code and actual documentation .
I tried to just ignore the stupidity of what I had just written .
Or , in the case of setup.py , what I had just written by cutting and pasting from another project on my hard drive — yes , it 's actually become that bad , that we cut - and - paste file contents between Python projects because our boilerplate requires so much repetition while carrying so little information .
But , try though I might , I could not move on to writing code ; I was finally defeated .
The Python language has done such a wonderful job over the past decade of honing my asthetics and sharpening my senses that I am now unable to use its own standard packaging techquies !
This new package would have to wait until I had resolved the problems that sat staring me in the face .
Let us review them , one by one .
After stating so carefully that this package was named cursive .
tools , I then had to inform setup ( ) that the project name would also be — who would have guessed ?
— cursive.tools as well !
This is idiotic .
Of course I am giving this project the same name as the package it contains ; that is a best - practice from which modern Python projects have no excuse to dissent .
Who wants to have to remember that you need the ZODB3 package when all you want to do is import persistent ?
Who wants to remember to depend on pyephem when all you want is to import ephem ( a problem that I , myself , created in my own misguided Python youth ) ?
Not me .
And not , if they have any sense , my users .
This package is named cursive .
tools .
Of course I want cursive to be a namespace package !
That is so painfully obvious that it should not even require mention ; it should be inferred .
Similarly , the mention that cursive is a package in the packages declaration is redundant .
Of course if a.b is a package then a is going to be a package as well !
There 's not even a way to avoid that in the Python language , so far as I know .
Why even make me type it ?
The entire top - level __init__.py file — the one inside of the cursive directory — is utterly and entirely a boilerplate cut - and - paste .
Given that cursive is already stated to be a namespace package , it should not even be necessary to provide the contents of its __init__.py ; it 's standard and can be copied straight from PEP - 382 .
The package , you will note , has started out lacking a long_description despite the fact that it has a perfectly serviceable README .
txt file .
Many packages jump through the hoops of path manipulation just to find their own README .
txt so that they can include it as their long description ; but why , in the absence of an override , should n't its inclusion as the long description be the default ?
This raises the larger question of where , exactly , should a project README .
txt even go — where on the filesystem , that is , should it be placed ?
There seems to be no consistency on this between different Python packages .
Some people place it directly at the project top - level , next to the setup.py file , which is friendliest to developers checking out the source code from a public repository — but which makes the README . txt invisible to users !
Others place it down inside of the package directory itself so that it will be included in their distribution , which is better ; and still other Python projects have two separate README .
txt files so that they have both bases covered !
The package version is kept in two different places here : in the setup.py and also in the __version__ symbol of the module itself .
When the version advances , both places will have to be updated — if the developer remembers !
The alternative is for the setup.py to grow more complex by including its own bootstrap code that uses path manipulations to find and introspect the __version__ symbol inside of the module .
The name of the package occurs both at the top of README. txt and inside of setup.py .
The short description is repeated twice : once in the title of the README. txt and once in the setup ( ) stanza of the setup.py .
Finally , the directory structure of this project is ridiculous .
If , as the setup .py clearly states , I am writing the cursive .
tools module , why should I even include both a cursive and a tools directory ?
Since the only legitimate activity that I can undertake in constructing this module is to place files inside of cursive .
tools , why do directories exist where files could collect outside of this one depository ?
Obviously , the above arguments hold only for pure - Python packages ; when C extensions and other special effects come into play , then excellent reasons arise for a complicated directory structure , sophisticated metadata , and possibly documentation above and beyond that distributed with binary versions of the package .
But for normal packages , I am finished with writing and distributing a setup.py by hand .
Toward perfecting Pyron
My new tool for Python package building , Pyron — which , for those keeping score , is my very first bitbucket - hosted project ( and I am very much enjoying these first few weeks of using Mercurial , since Guido made the big decision at the end of PyCon last month ) — is not yet mature enough to warrant a first release on PyPI .
Please check out the development version if you want to take a first look at Pyron .
And , yes , Pyron currently has to include a setup.py of its own , which will not disappear until I release the first version and it can become self - hosting !
Please note that Pyron is only for developers !
The sdist archives and the eggs produced for a Pyron - powered project are completely standard ; the end users and developers installing a module will not be affected by your choice to use Pyron .
It simply keeps your project repository cleaner by inferring package metadata on the fly rather than making you maintain a setup.py in version control along with your Python package .
A package developed with pyron only needs two files : README.txt and __init__.py .
The two files quoted above will work just fine .
These simply need to sit in the same directory , like this :
. / cursive .
tools / README . txt . / cursive .
tools / __init__ .
py
See ?
All of the actual meat of the cursive .
tools module remains when the files are stored like this , while the while repetition and boilerplate disappears !
Check out the Pyron README . txt ( or , of course , the same information as formatted in its project page on PyPI ) for more details about how it works ; here , I will just make three last observations :
Sometimes I had to choose between best practices when deciding how Pyron would operate .
Where , for example , should it find the package name ?
Instead of looking at the title of the README . txt , as it currently does , one could imagine my having written it to look somewhere in __init__.py ( but there seems to be no agreed - upon place for a package to name itself ) , or even at the name of the directory in which the package is sitting ( but often the directory will not be named cursive .
tools , but something like branches / 0.1 or even just trunk ) .
In each case , I have tried to choose the most obvious and easy - to - maintain convention , and the real point is that there be some common idiom for everyone to fall into line with as more and more packages in the future abandon their setup.py files and start using Pyron .
, as it currently does , one could imagine my having written it to look somewhere in ( but there seems to be no agreed - upon place for a package to name itself ) , or even at the name of the directory in which the package is sitting ( but often the directory will not be named , but something like or even just ) .
In each case , I have tried to choose the most obvious and easy - to - maintain convention , and the real point is that there be common idiom for everyone to fall into line with as more and more packages in the future abandon their files and start using Pyron .
Sometimes no best practice existed , and I had to , frankly , make things up .
Where should the author of a package go , without a setup .py file ?
In a special metadata file that I would have to invent ?
In some formatted region of the README . txt file ?
By choosing instead that it go inside an __author__ symbol in setup.py , I hope that I have at least preserved symmetry with an existing best - practice while , again , making future Python projects as readable as possible should Pyron use become widespread .

Pyron should become more sophisticated in the future , and eliminate even more repitition .
It currently needs project dependencies , for example , to be defined as a __requires__ constant in a package 's __init__.py file .
In the future , Pyron will hopefully gain the ability to inspect a project 's import statements and make intelligent guesses about its dependencies that could often eliminate any need for explicit dependency declarations .
Thanks to Pyron , I am now happily working away on my cursive packages , and they should soon see their first releases .
I can now sleep at night , knowing that boilerplate and repetition have finally vanished from my development code .

Rem Koolhaas ’ latest project - The Prada Transformer - is not just a building , but also a statement on today´s state of architecture .
Dubbed the anti-blob , this “ object ” rejects all common blobby shapes we have seen lately .
Simple geometrical shapes ( a circle , a cross , a rectangle and an hexagon ) enclose a space that depending on its rotation results on different spaces suitable for fashion exhibitions , cinema , art exhibitions and other special events .
Each face is the platform on which these activities take place , while also being served by the other faces enclosing the space .
A few weeks ago we showed you part of the construction progress , which is already finished and opened in April 15th with a fashion exhibition ( Waist Down – Skirts by Miuccia Prada , see video of animated skirts at the exhibition ) , that will be opened until May 31 when the Transformer will rotate into Cinema mode .
Architecture photographer Iwan Baan recently visited the Prada Transformer and shared with us this impressive photo set of the Transformer on Exhibition mode ( see more after the break ) .
For me , search for the ultimate flexible space and the use of regular shapes puts several things in question .
Transformable architecture is nothing new , but in times on which “ mixed use ” seems to be the 2nd typical characteristic of a building after “ green ” , this project makes a stand .
No fancy shapes , no wind diagrams , no fancy structure , no shiny surfaces , no eye candy renderings .
No blob .
Just , a simple building .
FASHION EXHIBITION
April 25th – May 31st : Waist Down – Skirts by Miuccia Prada .
Exhibition showcasing a collection of skirts , ranging from the first - ever Prada show to recent ones .
CINEMA
June 26th – July 5th : Flesh , Mind and Soul .
Film festival co-curated by Alejandro González Iñárritu ( director Babel , 21 Grams ) .
ART EXHIBITION
July 30th – August 20th : Beyond Control .
Exhibition by the Prada Foundation .
SPECIAL EVENT
September 8th – Fashion Event , the final flip of the Transformer .

Sir Fred Hoyle , the late astrophysicist acclaimed for developing the theory of how stars forge hydrogen and helium into the heavier elements found throughout the universe , did not get the credit he deserved for a 1954 paper that outlined the idea , because he failed to spell out a key equation , a former colleague says .
Hoyle , who died in 2001 at the age of 86 , was something of a tragic figure in science .
Unlike the vast majority of cosmologists , he never accepted the big bang theory of the universe , preferring the idea of an unchanging or steady state cosmos .
And in his later years he embraced the view that life on Earth originated in outer space .
When journals refused to accept his papers exploring the idea , he reached out to the public directly by writing books for a popular audience .
Long before descending into scientific infamy , Hoyle made what should have been a lasting contribution with a 1954 Astrophysical Journal paper laying out a process by which stars heavier than 10 suns would burn hydrogen and helium at their cores into heavier elements through a progressively hotter series of nuclear fusion reactions .
As such a star aged , it would end up structured like an onion , with the heaviest elements ( iron and nickel ) at the core and layers of progressively lighter elements toward the surface .
When the star finally exploded in a supernova , it would scatter these elements into space , where they would seed still - forming star systems .
Prior to Hoyle 's work , most experts believed that the elements had been born in a flurry of nuclear fusion during the big bang ( now dated to around 13.7 billion years ago ) .
But instead of citing the 1954 study , Clayton says , researchers discussing fusional element formation , or nucleosynthesis , typically reference a 1957 paper co-authored by Hoyle and three colleagues , which went into greater detail but on other facets of the problem , says Donald Clayton , professor emeritus of physics and astronomy at Clemson University in South Carolina .
At a recent conference commemorating the 50th anniversary of that paper , known as B2FH for the initials of its authors ( Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge , now at the University of California , San Diego , along with the late Willy Fowler of the California Institute of Technology and Hoyle ) , Clayton said that of 30 major nucleosynthesis papers published between 1960 and 1973 , 18 cited B2FH and only one gave the nod to Hoyle 's 1954 paper .
Writing in Science , Clayton attributes the misplaced citation to the fact that neither paper included a relatively straightforward equation that was implicit in Hoyle 's 1954 work .
" Hoyle 's equation , " as Clayton calls it , relates the mass of heavy elements ejected by dying stars to the rate of their death and the change in abundance of the various isotopes produced during successive nuclear reactions .
" He was an expert mathematician .
It 's a shame he did n't decide to just write the equation , " says Clayton , who was a student of Fowler 's and collaborated with both Hoyle and him .
A pithy equation gives other researchers " something to hang their hat on . "
Now researchers most likely cite B2FH without having read the founding papers in detail , he adds .
Stanford Woosley , an astrophysicist at the University of California , Santa Cruz , and the organizer of the recent B2FH conference , notes that more than half a dozen researchers " contributed unique and important insights to the founding of nuclear astrophysics , " including each of the B2FH authors .
" But I agree , " he notes , " that Hoyle 's 1954 paper is underappreciated and undercited . "
In Clayton 's view , Hoyle missed his chance to secure his legacy in 1957 when he and Fowler , fresh from an astronomy conference at the Vatican , were editing a draft of the paper written by the Burbidges .
The finished product " was a great paper , but they did not go over the ground Hoyle had laid out , " says Clayton , who adds , " Hoyle was never very interested in proofreading . "
Geoffrey Burbidge says that Hoyle " certainly solved the problem of the origin of the elements . "
As he recalls it , however , B2FH " was very much a collaboration . "
Hoyle , he says , was not the type to leave something important out of a paper just because editing it was a little time - consuming .
One thing everybody agrees on is that Hoyle was shortchanged in 1983 , when Fowler shared the Nobel Prize in Physics ( with Subramanyan Chandrasekhar ) for his work on nucleosynthesis .
Clayton says the Nobel Committee 's decision probably had more to do with Hoyle 's rejection of scientific orthodoxy than any missing equation .
" Fred marginalized himself , " Clayton says .
" He made himself look like a sorehead who only cared about the steady state universe and life from outer space . …
He made himself look foolish . "

Scrupts are somewhat similar to Klapaucius 's favorive pritons and gentle zits - however their social function seems entirely different . ;-)
What was that " Famous Philip K. Dick Letter " regarding Lem ?
On September 2 , 1974 Philip K. Dick sent the following letter to the FBI ( Please keep in mind Mr. Dick was most probably suffering from schizophrenia ) :
Philip K. Dick to the FBI , September 2 , 1974
I am enclosing the letterhead of Professor Darko Suvin , to go with information and enclosures which I have sent you previously .
This is the first contact I have had with Professor Suvin .
Listed with him are three Marxists whom I sent you information about before , based on personal dealings with them : Peter Fitting , Fredric Jameson , and Franz Rottensteiner who is Stanislaw Lem 's official Western agent .
The text of the letter indicates the extensive influence of this publication , SCIENCE - FICTION STUDIES .
What is involved here is not that these persons are Marxists per se or even that Fitting , Rottensteiner and Suvin are foreign - based but that all of them without exception represent dedicated outlets in a chain of command from Stanislaw Lem in Krakow , Poland , himself a total Party functionary ( I know this from his published writing and personal letters to me and to other people ) .
For an Iron Curtain Party group - Lem is probably a composite committee rather than an individual , since he writes in several styles and sometimes reads foreign , to him , languages and sometimes does not - to gain monopoly positions of power from which they can control opinion through criticism and pedagogic essays is a threat to our whole field of science fiction and its free exchange of views and ideas .
Peter Fitting has in addition begun to review books for the magazines Locus and Galaxy .
The Party operates ( a U..S. ] publishing house which does a great deal of Party - controlled science fiction .
And in earlier material which I sent to you I indicated their evident penetration of the crucial publications of our professional organization SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS OF AMERICA .
Their main successes would appear to be in the fields of academic articles , book reviews and possibly through our organization the control in the future of the awarding of honors and titles .
I think , though , at this time , that their campaign to establish Lem himself as a major novelist and critic is losing ground ; it has begun to encounter serious opposition :
Lem 's creative abilities now appear to have been overrated and Lem 's crude , insulting and downright ignorant attacks on American science fiction and American science fiction writers went too far too fast and alienated everyone but the Party faithful ( I am one of those highly alienated ) .
It is a grim development for our field and its hopes to find much of our criticism and academic theses and publications completely controlled by a faceless group in Krakow , Poland .
What can be done , though , I do not know .
Why was Stanislaw Lem expelled from the SFWA ( Science Fiction Writers of America ) in 1976 ?
The following quote from J. Madison Davis ' book on Stanislaw Lem gives an answer to your question :
Lem has always been critical of most science fiction , which he considers ill thought out , poorly written , and interested more in adventure that ideas or new literary forms . (...)
Those opinions provoked an unpleasant debate in the SFWA [ the " Lem affair " ] .
Philip José Farmer and others were incensed by Lem 's comments (...) and eventually brought about the removal of the honorary membership ( ... ) .
Other members , such as Ursula K. Le Guin , then protested the removal ( ... ) and the SFWA then offered Lem a regular membership , which he , of course , refused in 1976 .
Asked later about the " affair , " he remarked , that his opinions of the state of science fiction were already known when he was offered an honorary membership (... ) .
He also added he harboured no ill feelings towards the SFWA or U.S. writers in particular , " ... but it would be a lie to say the whole incident has enlarged my respect for SF writers " .
Where did Lem describe his war experiences ?
Mr. Lem's war experiences and their influence on his perception of chance and coincidence are quite well discussed in his autobiographical essay .
More on this topic can be found in the volumes : A Perfect Vacuum , Imaginary Magnitude and other apocryphal works .
In " Solaris " words like " cosmonauts " and " communism " are not used even though Stanislav Lem wrote the book during the times of the cold war .
And why is the main character called Kris Kelvin ( a typical American or English name ) ?
Mr. Lem always preferred " astronauts " to " cosmonauts " .
As to communism and Kris Kelvin : there was no politics in " Solaris " , hence there was no necessity to use the word " communism " ( or " capitalism " for that matter ) .
And yes - the name Kris Kelvin may sound British or American .
Kelvin is actually a Scottish name , taken from the River Kelvin which runs down from the southern Highlands to the River Clyde .
When the physicist William Thomson became a peer , he took the title Lord Kelvin in honour of the river , which runs very close to the campus of Glasgow University , where he researched and taught .
Among his many works on energy and the nature of heat , he wrote an influential paper on the concept of an absolute zero temperature ; the scale he proposed is now widely used and and is measured in degrees Kelvin .
Stanisław Lem was of course fascinated by limits and boundaries - and whatever lies beyond them .
[ we are grateful to professor Laurence Davies for the above clarification ]
Will Solaris ever be translated directly into English ?
The first translation of " Solaris " into English was indirect ( via French ) .
Since the publisher was reluctant to consider a new one , the Lem Estate comissioned a new translation straight from the original .
The new , 2011 canonical translation of " Solaris " by professor Bill Jonston is now available as an e-book or an audiobook .
King , 44 , no longer drinks alcohol or uses drugs .
He ’s ten months sober , and has recently found peace with the LAPD officers who scarred both his life and the LAPD .
Thirteen months later , on April 29 , 1992 , LAPD officers , Stacy Koon , Laurence Powell , Theodore Briseno and Timothy Wind , were acquitted of assaulting King .
The city ’s mounting racial unrest ignited .
That was the first day of the Los Angeles Riots .
More than fifty people would lose their lives , and damages would exceed hundreds of millions of dollars .
Rodney King ’s near - death plunge to infamy began with a twelve - pack of malt liquor .
King ’s intoxicated , high - speed driving on March 3 , 1991 united him a group of Los Angeles Police Department officers .
Their boots , billy clubs , and Taser , would beat the 25 year - old King into the history books .
Today marks the seventeenth anniversary of the Los Angeles Riots .
In recognition of Wednesday April 29 , 1992 , LAist presents a special feature with one the era 's most recognizable figures .
On a recent Friday night King could be found sharing the strength and hope of his journey with a Multiple Sclerosis recovery group .
“ I spoke and I sung a little song for them , just something off the top of my head , ” King told LAist .
Though King grew up singing , he admitted it had been a while since his last performance .
“ It was real therapeutic for me .
It ’s been cool getting out there , supporting other people . ”
While not afflicted with M.S. , King had spent decades battling another chronic , debilitating disease .
King ’s alcoholism , his incessant drinking despite the cost , had given him a life he did n’t want .
Celebrity Rehab
Struggling to get on the wagon , King jumped at the chance to appear on VH1 ’s “ Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew . ”
In doing so he received televised treatment under the care of Dr. Drew Pinsky , a board certified M.D. with an addiction medicine specialty .
The first episode showed King days prior to admittance at the Pasadena Recovery Center .
He was heavily intoxicated and working as a tow truck operator .
He nearly crushed himself attempting to tow a vehicle .
“ I could n’t believe it , ” King said of the incident he did n’t remember .
Working on the tow truck alongside King were his drinking buddies also hailing from the Pasadena area .
“ Those were the kind of guys I hang around when I ’m drinking , ” he said .
“ They do n’t look after nobody ’s safety , they just sit out and drink all day and tell lies . ”
Rodney King , Today
Despite previous stints at rehab centers , King would consistently return to drinking .
Throughout these stays he was filled with shame .
He believed the stigma of calling oneself an “ alcoholic ” was worse than the disease itself .
King hoped appearing on “ Celebrity Rehab ” would show the still - suffering this was n't how he felt anymore .
“ People can look at it like they need to go in and get a tune - up , and not feel so embarrassed , ” he said of treatment centers .
“ If someone gets that message , then it has been really worth it . ”
King hoped someone might watch the show and say “ ’ with that person going in there , let me try and find me a place I can go in . ’ ”
All In the Family
“ I watched people die over alcoholism in my family on almost a yearly basis , ” said King of a childhood where alcoholism was visible on both sides of his family .
At age five , King ’s hard - drinking aunt nearly killed King and his brother .
Forbidden from attending a party at his grandmother ’s house , King ’s resentful aunt “ took a [ molotov ] cocktail , and threw it up under the house , ” he recalled .
He and his brother were in the basement playing with his grandmother ’s old metal soldiers and army cars when the “ the cocktail hit -- poof , flamed up , went bust . ”
Somehow no one was injured in the blaze .
March 1992
King had been laid off from his union construction job with C.C. Myers .
To make ends meet he had been working as an usher at Dodgers Stadium .
While King loved the Dodgers , the work was n’t nearly as fulfilling as union construction .
After six months away , C.C. Myers offered King bridge construction work on the 101 freeway .
Full of joy , King , bought a night ’s worth of booze for himself and friends .
He had a twelve - pack all to himself .
“ I was supposed to go back that Monday , ” he said .
The Beating
King ’s Hyundai was speeding west on the 210 freeway north of Los Angeles .
His intoxicated mind swam with childhood memories of his father getting “ stomped and kicked on by the police , ” he said .
“ I never thought I ’d get caught up in one of those kind of beatings . ”
“ I knew what kind of dudes followed a police chase , ” said King .
He finally stopped on Foothill Boulevard in Lake View Terrace near Sylmar .
Multiple police cars surrounded him .
“ I knew it was n’t going to be nothing nice . ”
King was first met by Officer Melanie Singer .
Behind her , King could see the other officers readying their billy clubs .
“ I told her ' tell them they do n’t have to do this . ' "
Non-responsive , she walked away as the other officers charged King .
Despite the presence of African - American officers , the words of the charging officers was “ straight racist , ” he said .
Standing aside , the African - American officers did not participate in The Beating .
" Whoever black that was standing around was probably scared for their job .
It was like a routine that you just know goes on . ”
Wrapping his arms around his head , King knew to protect his brain .
He told himself “ you better live through it . ”
King recalled being Tasered .
“ It heated my body so hot to where ... I ca n’t explain it . ”
As the blows from the officers ’ black boots and clubs persisted , King thought he had died .
“ I woke up halfway - dead a couple days later , ” he said .
“ It was like dying and coming back . ”
April 29 , 1992
For King , the LA Riots were both horrific and surreal .
“ It was scary because people were dying , ” he said .
“ It was like I could see the world right there in front of me , from my TV .
The world had gotten so close -- it was all about me , running from those cops , and being drunk that night . ”
King ’s drinking worsened .
“ I had to have something to drink , ” he said of the time .
“ It was really wild . ”
On the third day of the LA Riots , full of emotion and fighting a hangover , King issued his famed plea for peace .
“ People , I just want to say , you know , can we all get along ?
Can we get along ?
Can we stop making it , making it horrible for the older people and the kids ?...
It 's just not right .
It 's not right . ” - Rodney King , May 1 , 1992
Legal Woes
In 1993 King ’s lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles was settled in civil court .
Awarded $ 3.8 million in damages ( King claimed to have walked away with less than half of that after legal fees , ) he later found out his payday might have been seven times larger .
“ ’ We put $ 25 million away and you did n’t even come close to it , ’ ” King claimed a Los Angeles city official said before him .
“ He told my attorney , ‘ you did n’t even come close to us . ’
Basically , ‘ get your scraps off the table and get the hell out of here . ’
It was nasty . ”
The Road To Forgiveness
On the third episode of “ Celebrity Rehab , ” Dr. Drew uncovered that King had not therapeutically dealt with his 1991 trauma .
King had unsuccessfully tried to bury his strong feelings .
That only resulted in more drinking .
“ There is no point in trying to process much of anything when someone is using , ” Dr. Drew told LAist .
“ Resentment is sometimes the only feeling an alcoholic or addict knows .
Trying to get to a place of forgiveness for something like what Rodney had experienced would be essentially impossible . ”
Once King had been sober for a few months Dr. Drew felt King was in a headspace where he “ could find closure and forgiveness . ”
The doctor prescribed his patient a large dose of forgiveness .
Dr. Drew knew that it would give King a significantly greater chance at sustained sobriety .
The Spot Today
King had been back to “ The Spot ” before .
“ We were working on a job out there , and I walked down near the water just to reminisce , remember when my dad used to take all the kids out there , ” he said .
The Beating was adjacent to the Hansen Dam , a location where King spent his childhood fishing .
" I could n’t help but think about The Beating .
Being out there , it ’s so real , I remember it so dang clear .
Then , it was kind of like ‘ why did this happen to me ? ’ ”
Return To The Spot
Dr. Drew and King retraced the 1991 car chase , and visited The Spot for the “ Celebrity Rehab ” follow - up “ Sober House . ”
King had penned a letter expressing his forgiveness of the officers whom he had spent years resenting .
He read it , then deposited flowers and a bible on the roadside .
“ This time I was able to focus on how I wound up in a spot like that , ” King said .
“ I thought it was really nice going back to The Spot , and walking away from it with the Doctor .
It shows I can put it behind me . ”
King knew that anger had fueled his alcoholism for years .
“ A lot of times when I was angry , I would get myself some booze , not knowing it was only putting a Band - Aid on , ” he said .
“ The only way to resolve things is without anger , that ’s what I ’m learning .
Emotions will kill you if you dwell on them . ”
On their visit , both King and Dr. Drew were surprised to note a soon - to - open children ’s museum .
“ They built the L.A. County Children ’s Museum on the site of the beating !
That ’s crazy , ” Dr. Drew wrote on his VH1 blog .
“ We talked to the directors and they were like , ‘ Yeah , we heard that happened somewhere around here . ’
It happened eight feet from there ! ”
“ I feel very honored to have been there with him for that experience , ” said Dr. Drew .
“ What was surprising to me was the incredible clarity and speed with which Rodney seemed to come to terms with this incident .
Speaking to his family , I found that this is not out of character for Rodney . ”
" Sober House " Episode 6
Today
King said that he ’s constantly approached by people grateful for his public recovery .
“ It gives me the motivation to want to stay clean , just to hear people say they saw me on the program and they ’ve been sober for about three months , ” he said .
More focused on his recovery than ever , King said “ it ’s a fight everyday .
Your disease will creep on you . ”
These days King stays busy , something he considers an asset to his sobriety .
He ’s writing a book , telling the story he knows best : his own .
He also may open a sober living recovery home , and perhaps form a foundation for homeless teens .
If you ’re ever fishing at Big Bear you may see the 6 ’3 ” King spearing carp .
“ Fishing -- that ’s my thing , ” he said .
“ They have some huge , nice carp up there . ”
Whether it ’s speaking for those battling Multiple Sclerosis , or alcoholism , King wants to be of service .
“ Our time here on Earth is so short , ” he said .
“ Whatever we become in the next life is from what we did here on Earth . ”
He said a great way to make an impact is through simple acts of kindness .
“ It ’s no more than shaking a hand , saying hi to a person you probably would ’ve never spoke to . ”
“ I ’m happy to have made it through it , shoot , I ’m going to tell you , ” King said with a laugh and big smile .
“ It take a minute to lose it all -- life goes so fast .
Maybe I ’ll sing about it one day . ”

What do you think of Rodney King 's journey ?
Comment below !
A group of researchers from San Francisco State University since 2006 has been studying how currents move in the San Francisco Bay - hoping to make it easier to navigate and help clean up spills like the one caused by the Cosco Busan tanker .
Now , though , the project is in jeopardy because of a cut - off in California coastal - protection funds .
Operating out of the Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies , a San Francisco State field research station in Marin County , students and their professors use land - based , high - frequency radar devices to track surface water movement in San Francisco Bay and the outlying California coastline .
The study is part of the Coastal Ocean Currents Monitoring Program , which looks at tidal movement along the entire California coastline .
The radar devices , which look like large radio antennas , are strategically placed around the bay in places where the public will not easily be able tamper with them .
Radar devices positioned at the Romberg center , Crissy Field , Treasure Island and Sausalito emit a high frequency that bounces off moving water currents and back to the radar antennas .
The shift in frequency is then measured and sent to technicians at the Romberg center who determine where and at what speed the currents are moving .
Funding for the project , totaling $ 21 million , was made possible by Propositions 40 and 50 , California coastal protection acts that passed in 2002 .
Researchers say the monitoring offers several scientific purposes , including studying bottom levels of the food chain and the tidal currents of the Farallon Islands .
It also has more practical purposes .
" We 've helped predict where oil and sewage spills will drift in the bay , " said Toby Garfield , a geosciences professor at San Francisco State and principal investigator for the project .
The program worked with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the organization that oversaw the Cosco Busan oil spill cleanup in 2007 , to help track where the oil plume was headed and what beaches would be affected .
Authorities originally thought that the plume would hit the Farallon Islands , but the monitoring was able to show that the oil would drift past and not hit the islands - sparing pre-emptive cleanup efforts , Garfield said .
" Observations of ocean currents are helpful with starting a model for oil spill cleanup , " said Jordan Stout , scientific support coordinator with the NOAA .
" Having a clear picture of what the currents are doing will help determine where the currents will be going in the next few days . "
In addition to helping with cleanup , scientists at the center want to show that this form of radar is valuable for port cities that have a lot of commercial and recreational boat traffic .
" It 's kind of invaluable to have radar like this in big coastal cities , " said Max Hubbard , a geosciences graduate student who has been working on the project since August .
" There are so many tankers and cargo ships coming in and out of the bay - for them to know what the currents are doing is very important . "
Hubbard is the only student currently working on the project .
While the water current data have been collected since the project 's inception in 2006 , continual monitoring is necessary if the scientists want to help clean up future oil and sewage spills .
Hubbard and Garfield would like to continue monitoring ocean currents and hope data will soon be available for all mariners navigating the San Francisco Bay .
A Dec. 19 stop - work order halted funding for California general - obligation bonds , but monitoring is still in progress because Garfield has been able to find alternative financing .
" We 're subsisting off grants , federal and state , that are not bond funded - although these sources are drying up , " Garfield said .
As they continue to monitor currents and seek funding , the scientists hope their work is not in vain .
" I have a year of San Francisco Bay water - current data , " Hubbard said .
" But if the funding stops , the data could stop flowing . "
And the business people with the corporate jet wo n’t just arrive faster ; they ’ll also show up better prepared .
After all , most companies send teams of people , and in their own airplane they ’re free to discuss confidential information or polish up that PowerPoint presentation .
What ’s more , they can use the phones , their BlackBerrys and the Internet en route .
In other words , these jets are offices that move .
Just look at Wal - Mart .
That company ’s success is due , in part , to its fleet of hard - working , bare - bones Learjets that shuttle managers , executives and sales staff from their headquarters in Arkansas to towns throughout the country .
The reliance on business aircraft began with its founder , Sam Walton , flying a small single - engine plane ( still the most common type of business aircraft ) to scout out store locations .
Here ’s another thing :
The aircraft and their systems are , for the most part , made here in the United States , by union and non-union workers , in places like Indianapolis and Cincinnati ; Wichita , Kan . ; and Cedar Rapids , Iowa .
And with their impressive performance and construction , they ’re prized throughout the world .
In 2007 , about half the business jets delivered by American manufacturers went to foreign buyers that paid more than $ 3 billion for them .
Manufacturers elsewhere , including in Japan and Germany , once tried to compete , but they were so utterly trounced by American ingenuity and craftsmanship that they simply gave up .
There are foreign - made business aircraft , to be sure ; for example , Citigroup had planned to buy a Falcon , made by the highly regarded French company Dassault .
But even those are stuffed with American - made avionics , engines , subsystems and interiors .
Indeed , Dassault ’s largest plant is in Little Rock , Ark. , where some 2,000 workers complete Falcon interiors and ready them for delivery .
Finally , the members of Congress who are so irate about Citigroup ’s almost - purchase would do well to remember this : business jets are also widely employed by our government for search and rescue missions , surveillance , medical evacuations and crew training .
Of course , their value as speedy , secure executive transports is also much appreciated and used by high - ranking military and civilian officials , including , yes , many congressmen .
A business jet has even served , when the president needs something less than a jumbo , as a diminutive Air Force One .
If you truly need to be there and there and there and back by seven , business aircraft may provide the only way .
This is an industry that helps further the country ’s commerce and interests  and it deserves a bright future , not a public drubbing .
Hoping to avoid the network neutrality woes of its cable rival Comcast , Cox Communications plans to begin Feb .
9 testing new bandwidth management practices designed to slow traffic that is n't " time - sensitive " during periods of peak network usage .
" During the occasional times the network is congested , this new technology automatically ensures that all time - sensitive Internet traffic - such as Web pages , voice calls , streaming videos and gaming - moves without delay , " Cox states on its policy site .
" Less time - sensitive traffic , such as file uploads , peer - to - peer and Usenet newsgroups , may be delayed momentarily - but only when the local network is congested . "
Cox 's former network management practices were based on traffic prioritization and protocol filtering , approaches that landed Comcast in trouble with the FCC ( Federal Communications Commission ) for violating the agency 's network neutrality principles .
In August 2008 , the FCC ruled that Comcast violated the agency 's Internet policy when it throttled P2P traffic by BitTorrent during times of peak network load .
The agency also found that Comcast misled consumers by not properly disclosing its P2P policy .
The FCC did n't fine Comcast , but ordered Comcast to stop blocking traffic , disclose to the FCC the full extent of the cable giant 's traffic practices and keep the public informed of its future network management plans .
After switching to a " protocol - agnostic " network management plan , Comcast is again under FCC scrutiny over charges that the cable company 's new management practices degrade the sound quality of VOIP ( voice over IP ) services such as Vonage and Skype that compete with Comcast 's own VOIP service .
Cox said Jan. 27 its new network management scheme is " based on the time - sensitive nature of the Internet traffic itself , and we believe it will lead to a smoother Internet experience with fewer delays . "
The company also states on its network policy site that the new approach " is not based on the owner or source of the traffic .
For example , most Internet video competition comes in the form of downloadable and streaming video from the Internet . "
The Internet advocacy group Free Press , which successfully brought and pressed the network neutrality complaint against Comcast , was not impressed with the new Cox plan .
" As a general rule , we 're concerned about any cable or phone company picking winners and losers online , " Ben Scott , policy director of Free Press , said in a statement .
" These kinds of practices cut against the fundamental neutrality of the open Internet .
We urge the FCC to subject this practice to close scrutiny and call on Cox to provide its customers with more technical details about exactly what it 's doing . "
Scott said Cox gives little indication about how its new practices will affect Internet users , or if they comply with the FCC's Internet policies .
" The lesson we learned from the Comcast case is that we must be skeptical of any practice that comes between users and the Internet , " Scott added .
" Cox customers will certainly want to know more about how the company is interfering with their Internet traffic and what criteria it uses to discriminate . "
Public Knowledge , another prominent Internet watchdog and close ally of Free Press , was critical of the Cox network management plans .
" The sketchy details of the Cox system make little sense , " Gigi Sohn , president and co-founder of Public Knowledge , said in a statement .
" Usenet is a text - based service , just as is most of e-mail .
There should be no distinction between them .
Video streaming takes up much more network capacity than peer - to - peer , yet is given Cox 's seal of approval . "

Venetia Phair , who was 11 years old when she suggested Pluto as the name of the newly discovered planet , has died in England .
She was 90 .
She died at home in Epsom , south of London , on April 30 , her family said .
The cause of death was not disclosed .
Phair suggested the name to her grandfather at breakfast in 1930 .
“ My grandfather , as usual , opened the paper , The Times , and in it he read that a new planet had been discovered .
He wondered what it should be called .
We all wondered , ” she recalled in a short film , “ Naming Pluto , ” released earlier this year .
“ And then I said , ‘ Why not call it Pluto ? ’
And the whole thing stemmed from that . ”
Her grandfather was Falconer Madan , the retired librarian of the Bodleian Library at Oxford University .
He relayed the suggestion to his friend Herbert Hall Turner , professor of astronomy at Oxford , who on that day was at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society , where possible names for the planet were being discussed .
Turner then passed on the suggestion to Clyde W. Tombaugh , who made the discovery at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona .
When the name was publicly announced May 1 , 1930 , Phair said her grandfather rewarded her with a five - pound note .
( The same purchasing power today would be about 230 pounds , or $ 350 . )
“ This was unheard of then .
As a grandfather , he liked to have an excuse for generosity , ” she told the BBC in 2006 .
She was fascinated by astronomy , and recalled playing a game at school using clay lumps to mark out the relative positions of the planets .
She was also a keen student of mythology and knew about Pluto , the Roman name for the Greek god of the underworld , Hades .
“ There were practically no names left from classical mythology .
Whether I thought about the dark and gloomy Hades , I ’m not sure , ” she told the BBC .
She tartly rejected any suggestion that the planet was named for the Disney dog .
“ It has now been satisfactorily proven that the dog was named after the planet , rather than the other way round .
So , one is vindicated , ” she said .
The International Astronomical Union downgraded Pluto in 2006 to a dwarf planet -- based on the observation that Pluto was a large chunk in the Kuiper Belt of solar debris .
Phair said she was indifferent about Pluto ’s change of status , “ though I suppose I would prefer it to remain a planet . ”
Born Venetia Burney on July 11 , 1918 , she studied mathematics at Cambridge University , and taught economics and math until retiring in the 1980s .
An asteroid discovered in 1987 was named in her honor : 6235 Burney .
Her husband , Maxwell Phair , died in 2006 .
She is survived by their son , Patrick .

Submitted by Edward Harrison of the site Credit Writedowns
I last posted on “ Credt Writedowns ” on Thursday before the Easter Holidays in two posts very much at odds with one another .
The overall thrust of the first post was that the financial services industry in the United States was due to gain from some very advantageous circumstances in 2009 .
Meanwhile , the later re-post pointed out the continued fragility of the U.S. economy and banking system and focused on liquidity and solvency as unresolved issues .
I would like to bring these two posts together here because I believe the concept behind the dichotomy is best described as the Fake Recovery .
Why ‘ Fake ’ ?
This is a fake recovery because the underlying systemic issues in the financial sector are being papered over through various mechanisms designed to surreptitiously recapitalize banks while monetary and fiscal stimulus induces a rebound before many banks ’ inherent insolvency becomes a problem .
This means the banking system will remain weak even after recovery takes hold .
The likely result of the weak system will be a relapse into a depression - like circumstances once the temporary salve of stimulus has worn off .
Note that this does not preclude stocks from large rallies or a new bull market from forming because as unsustainable as the recovery may be , it will be a recovery nonetheless .
The real situation
In truth , the U.S. banking system as a whole is probably insolvent .
By that I mean the likely future losses of loans and assets already on balance sheets at U.S. financial institutions , if incurred today , would reveal the system as a whole to lack the necessary regulatory capital to continue functioning under current guidelines .
In fact , some prognosticators believe these losses far exceed the entire capital of the U.S. financial system .
Witness a recent post by Nouriel Roubini :
The RGE Monitor new estimate in January 2009 of peak credit losses ( available in a paper for our RGE clients ) suggested that total losses on loans made by U.S. financial firms and the fall in the market value of the assets they are holding would be at their peak about $ 3.6 trillion ( $ 1.6 trillion for loans and $ 2 trillion for securities ) .
The U.S. banks and broker dealers are exposed to half of this figure , or $ 1.8 trillion ; the rest is borne by other financial institutions in the US and abroad .
The capital backing the banks ’ assets was last fall only $ 1.4 trillion , leaving the U.S. banking system some $ 400 billion in the hole , or close to zero even after the government and private sector recapitalization of such banks and after banks ’ provisioning for losses .
Thus , another $ 1.4 trillion would be needed to bring back the capital of banks to the level they had before the crisis ; and such massive additional recapitalization is needed to resolve the credit crunch and restore lending to the private sector .
Now , obviously , if we were to face up to this situation , there would be no chance of recovery as the capital required to recapitalize the banking system would mean a long and deep downturn well into 2010 and perhaps beyond .
This is not politically acceptable as 2010 is an election year .
Nor is the nationalization of large financial institutions acceptable to the Obama Administration .
Moreover , bailing out banks to the tune of trillions of dollars while the economy is in depression is equally unacceptable to the American electorate .
The Obama Administration is keenly aware of this fact .
These constraints , some artificial and others very real , leave the Administration with limited options .
Engineer recovery
With the preceding constraints in mind , we should remember that the first priority of elected officials in Washington is not necessarily to make the best long - term choices for the American people , but rather to get re-elected in order to have the opportunity to make those choices .
It should be patently obvious that a downturn which began in December 2007 would be fatal to many politicians if allowed to continue well into 2010 .
This is why recovery of some sort must take place before that time – irrespective of whether it is sustainable .
How to engineer recovery is another question altogether .
Here again there are a set of political constraints which make things more challenging .
First , there are large swathes of the population that are uncomfortable with the huge debt load and deficit spending that a stimulus - induced recovery creates .
Moreover , a government - sponsored nationalisation or recapitalisation plan would only increase this deficit spending and these debts .
As a result , the Obama Administration has crafted a plan to circumvent these obstacles .
Moderate fiscal stimulus .
The Obama Administration decided not to seek massive stimulus earlier this year because they deemed it non-viable politically .
This clears the first obstacle : deficit hawks .
Most economists understand that the output gap that has opened up in the American economy is $ 2 trillion or more whereas the Obama stimulus package was only $ 800 billion .
That leaves a massive hole in output in the U.S. Moreover , the immediate effective stimulus is less .
Much of this ‘ stimulus ’ will be saved or will not come into play until months from now .
Obviously , this is not going to meet the grade ( See my comments on this from February ) .
Quasi - fiscal role for the Fed .
Having partially assuaged deficit hawks , Obama still needed to close the output gap .
Enter the Federal Reserve .
You will have noticed that the Federal Reserve has added legacy assets as eligible for the TALF program .
In effect , this allows banks to slip tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars in so - called toxic assets off their balance sheets .
Mind you , these are assets already on the books impairing banks ’ ability to loan money .
Under normal circumstances , one would expect the Federal Government to take these assets out of the system ( bad bank , good bank , nationalization ) after being given legislative approval to do so .
However , as I have previously stated this approval is not going to be forthcoming .
This is why the Federal Reserve is taking these assets on .
In so doing , the Federal Reserve is taking on a quasi - fiscal role that re-capitalizes the banking system in order to stimulate the economy by increasing credit availability .
Quasi - fiscal role for the FDIC .
The new PPIP is a similar end - run around Congress .
After all , the role of the FDIC is that it “ maintains the stability and public confidence in the nation ’s financial system by insuring deposits , examining and supervising financial institutions , and managing receiverships . ”
Meanwhile , the PPIP has the FDIC guaranteeing dodgy assets in a massive transfer of wealth from taxpayers to banks and select investors .
( See my previous comments on this issue ) .
End of mark - to - market as we knew it .
You should have noticed that most of the assets written down in the past two years have been marked - to - market .
Securities traded in the open market are marked to market .
Loans held to maturity are not .
This is one reason that large international institutions which participate in the securitisation markets have taken the lion ’s share of writedowns , despite the low percentage that marked - to - market assets represent on bank balance sheets .
But , this should end because of new guidelines in marked - to - market accounting .
However , the new guidelines do have two major implications .
First , there are still many distressed loans on the books of U.S. banks that if marked to market would reveal devastating losses .
Second , there will also now be many distressed securities on bank balance sheets that if marked - to - market would reveal yet more losses .
In essence , the new guidelines are helpful only to the degree that it prevents assets being marked down due to temporary impairment .
If much of the impairment is real , as I believe it is , we are storing up problems for later .
Interest rate reductions .
One reason often given for a large increase in writedowns at financial institutions had been the coming reset of Alt - A adjustable - rate mortgages in 2009 .
With the subprime writedowns mostly accounted for , a souring of the much larger pool of Alt - A and Prime residential mortgage loans is the real Armageddon scenario .
Well , part of this problem has been temporarily relieved because the Federal Reserve has reduced short - term interest rates to near zero and has begun trying to manipulate long - term interest rates lower by buying long - dated treasury securities .
Bank margin increases .
Key to the whole program is banks ’ ability to earn massive amounts of money and re-capitalize themselves through retained earnings as opposed to shedding assets or receiving additional paid - in capital ( see post from last April on these three methods of recapitalizing ) .
The market for bank assets is distressed and few banks can get enough capital from private sources or investors .
Therefore , Obama ’s plan hinges on the ability to allow these banks to earn shed loads of money as quickly as possible .
If the banks cannot do this , we are going to have a big problem very quickly ( Of course , I think the can ) .
The stimulus to come from these measures is still in the pipeline and , by the end of this year , will probably add a big kick to the economy .
You should note that only the fiscal stimulus required legislative approval .
All of the other ‘ stimulus ’ has been done without Congressional approval and largely without Congressional oversight .
These activities have been specifically designed to be opaque .
The government ’s claims of wanting to increase transparency ring hollow ( see my post on Bloomberg ’s suit against the Fed as an example of what is really happening ) .
I should also mention that the Federal Reserve has been a large factor here .
It is acting in concert with the executive branch in a non-arms length fashion which I believe will have consequences regarding Fed independence down the line .
Other positive economic factors
There are a number of so - called green shoots ( a phrase coined by Norman Lamont ) of note .
Jobless claims have plateaued and comparisons to last year are actually declining ( see post ) .
The U.S. trade deficit is declining significantly as U.S. import demand has fallen off a cliff .
Inventory liquidation will put U.S. manufacturers in a better position by Q4 and help make quarterly and yearly comparisons favourable .
I linked to the first two bullets of these other factors .
And I wanted to spend a little time on factor number three because I think it is important .
Niels Jensen of Absolute Capital Partners has a very solid write - up on this in his most recent newsletter : ( do sign up for his free newsletter because it is quite informative .
Click here to see the newsletters and sign up . )
Turning my attention to the global economy , after a rather muted beginning , manufacturers around the world have now begun to react aggressively to the economic downturn and inventories are falling aggressively .
Chart 5 below depicts US manufacturing inventories as published recently by the Census Bureau .
Inventory changes can have a meaningful impact on GDP .
There is one example from the 1981 - 82 recession where the inventory correction subtracted 5 % ( annualised ) from GDP in just one quarter .
The current inventory correction is very negative for GDP in Q1 and possibly also in Q2 , but it is very difficult to quantify the effect it is going to have .
We will have to wait and see .
However , as we must remind ourselves , the stock market is not trading on what is going to happen in Q1 and Q2 of this year .
Projecting at least 6 - 9 months ahead , the stock market is probably already looking ahead to Q4 and possibly even Q1 of next year .
And the inventory adjustment currently underway is very bullish for GDP growth later this year and into next .
The reason is simple .
Manufacturers always overreact .
Come Q3 or Q4 , they will suddenly sit up and realise that inventories have fallen too much and that they need to produce more .
There is no reason to believe that this recession will be any different .
Obviously , this means that U.S. Q1 and perhaps even Q2 GDP will be very low due to the subtraction of inventories now being purged .
However , when we get to Q3 and Q4 , this effect will be gone and quarterly and yearly comparisons will look favourable .
So the inventory purge may mean a huge upside surprise to GDP in the second half of the year and early 2010 – potentially enough to see positive GDP numbers .
A brief reminder of what lurks beneath
Despite the positives from the previous section , there are significant headwinds which may even preclude a positive GDP number .
They include :
Rising joblessness
Increased savings as households rebuild balance sheets
Spending cuts by local and state governments
Decreased capital spending by companies
A calamitous GM bankruptcy
Moreover , credit availability –and hence GDP will be constrained by numerous factors including the following :
Declining home values
Increasing foreclosures
Commercial property writedowns
Credit card - related writeoffs
Junk bond defaults
All of this means that a cyclical rebound is not a foregone conclusion at all .
Tying the threads together
You should be under no illusion that the coming rebound is permanent .
Much of it is not .
What we are seeing is the makings of a cyclical recovery that might begin as early as Q4 2009 or Q1 2010 .
How long or robust that recovery is remains to be seen .
Moreover , it is still questionable whether we will get any meaningful recovery at all in spite of the ‘ green shoots ’ because the banking system in the United States is severely undercapitalised and more asset writedowns are coming due .
This is a fake recovery underneath which many problems remain .
Nevertheless , banks are going to earn a lot of money and that is bullish for their shares – at least in the medium - term .
Yes , the stock market is overbought right now .
However , if banks put together some decent earnings reports over the next few quarters , their shares will rise .
Furthermore , if the banks can earn enough , this cyclical recovery will have legs as banks will then have enough capital to resume lending and that is supportive of the broader market as well .
It is still too early to tell how this will play out over the longer - term .
For now , I am much more positive on financials , and somewhat positive on the broader market as well .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Eight firefighters and a gas employee were injured Thursday when a gas leak at a strip mall exploded in Forestville , Maryland , officials from the Prince Georges County Fire Department said .
An explosion at a Maryland strip mall injured eight firefighters and a gas employee .
Two of the firefighters were admitted to the burn unit at Washington Hospital Center and both were listed in fair condition Thursday night , Prince George 's County Fire and EMS spokesman Mark Brady said .
One of the firefighters sustained second - degree facial burns and injuries from flying debris , Brady said , while the other sustained chest injuries from flying debris .
The others injured in the blast were treated and released , the officials said .
Officials believe the explosion was caused by accidental ignition of natural gas , Brady said .
Watch the building explode »
The source of the ignition was not immediately determined , Brady said , adding , " we may never know exactly what happened due to the nature of the explosion . "
A caller alerted the fire department to the leak at around 12:30 p.m. , Brady said .
Shortly after the firefighters arrived at the evacuated building , the explosion occurred , he said .
He estimated the blast caused $ 2.5 million in damage to six stores in the strip mall .
At the time the leak was discovered , five stores were open .
The fire department evacuated 45 employees and customers from the area just moments before the explosion , Brady said .

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman , who twice previously rejected Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie 's attempts to purchase a team and relocate it to southern Ontario , remains firm in his stance .
Joining a panel of commissioners from Major League Baseball , the National Football League and the National Basketball Association on Wednesday , Bettman briefly addressed Balsillie 's latest offer to buy the financially strapped Phoenix Coyotes for $ 212.5 million US .
" Yes I do , " Bettman said when he was asked by a CNBC reporter after the panel session if he envisioned the Coyotes beginning the 2009 - 10 season in Phoenix .
" We fix the problems .
We do n't run out on cities , " Bettman told the other commissioners , in reference to past economic troubles facing NHL teams in Pittsburgh , Buffalo and Ottawa .
" This is not about whether we want a franchise in southern Ontario .
This is not about whether Mr. Balsillie would make a suitable owner and one the league would approve . "
Bettman added the NHL's 30 team owners , not the league commissioner , vote on whether someone would be approved as an owner .
Balsillie , 48 , made the offer to Coyotes majority owner Jerry Moyes , consenting to buy the team if he can move it , presumably to Hamilton or the Kitchener - Waterloo region , where he runs Research In Motion Ltd. , maker of the popular BlackBerry mobile device .
The NHL reacted swiftly , responding to the petition of sale and relieving Moyes of his duties with the Coyotes .
" We 're just getting the [ sale ] papers and reviewing them and we 'll probably be in court dealing with this whole issue , " Bettman told CNBC .
True to Bettman 's word , the NHL announced later Wednesday that it will indeed appear in federal bankruptcy court in Phoenix on Thursday .
" Obviously , if this is an attempt to circumvent league rules , then we 're going to have to deal with it , " said Bettman .
Asked how this could happen , Bettman said : " Somebody , and you 'll have to ask the people who were involved in doing it , devised a strategy which somehow they think might entitle them to do something they might not otherwise be entitled to do . "
Balsillie also agreed to provide $ 17 million in bridge financing to keep the Coyotes operating in advance of the proposed sale .
" I am excited to move closer to bringing an NHL franchise to what I believe is one of the best unserved hockey markets in the world — southern Ontario — a market with devoted hockey fans , a rich history , a growing and diversified economy and a population of more than seven million people , " Balsillie said in a statement on Tuesday .
In 1996 under Bettman 's watch , the Coyotes left Winnipeg , where they were known as the Jets .
Balsillie is travelling to Orlando , Fla. , on Wednesday and was unavailable for further comment .
Bettman had been planning to meet with Moyes when news of the Coyotes formally filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection surfaced Tuesday .
A hearing is said to be scheduled for Thursday .
A spokesman for the city of Glendale , Ariz. , where the team 's arena is located , told reporters last week that the NHL had assumed control of the Coyotes and that team ownership paid $ 351,000 in overdue rent on Feb. 25 — reportedly after receiving an unspecified loan from the league .
In May 2007 , former Nashville Predators owner Craig Leipold entered into a letter of agreement to sell the NHL franchise to Balsillie for $ 238 million , and Balsillie initiated a season - ticket drive in Hamilton before Leipold pulled out of the deal .
Three years earlier , Balsillie was thwarted in his attempts to buy the Penguins for $ 175 million when Bettman intervened and reportedly imposed restrictions that would keep the team in Pittsburgh .
Balsillie has also been rumoured to be in the market to purchase the Buffalo Sabres , but he would not comment on rumours he met with team owner Tom Golisano in December 2007 .
A study by the Aerospace Corporation , conducted at the request of NASA to disprove the viability of an option to switch Orion to an alternative Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle ( EELV ) , has found both the Atlas V Heavy and Delta IV Heavy are capable of launching Orion on both ISS and Lunar missions .
Meanwhile , former NASA administrator Mike Griffin once again dismissed all alternatives to Ares I as unviable , due to the efforts already spent on Constellation .
EELV / Orion Study :
The Californian - based Aerospace Corporation has provided independent technical and scientific research , development , and advisory services to the space program for over 40 years .
They were approached by NASA to conduct a study on replacing Ares I with an EELV , focusing on the Delta IV - H. The ULA ( United Launch Alliance ) were asked to contribute a limited review of the technical elements of the study .
However , they were not given access to the cost or schedule data that was to be used in the findings .
It is claimed the study was called for by Mr Griffin , in order to disprove growing references that an EELV could close the gap between shuttle retirement and the first manned flight of Orion ( Orion 2 ) , currently scheduled for March 2015 – although that date is currently based on a “ zero confidence ” schedule , pending a summit meeting to find solutions to funding and schedule disconnect issues , found during the ongoing PMR ( Program Milestone Review ) process .
The results for both the Delta IV - H and Atlas V- H are encouraging , and point towards large margins on both the ISS and Lunar Orion vehicle .
However , that is only part of the story .
“ ISS ( requirement of 19.2 t ) .
Delta IV - Heavy = 24.2 t. Atlas V Heavy = 25.4 t. Lunar ( requirement of 21.8 t ) .
Delta IV - H = 26.3 t. Atlas V - H = 27.3 t , ” noted information acquired by L2 .
The Delta IV - H numbers include use of the RS - 68A , which is an upgraded version of the current RS - 68 – currently undergoing testing and due to come into service in a few years time .
It is also noted that the ULA used the same ascent trajectory constraints as Ares I , such as the LAS ( Launch Abort System ) jet at Upper Stage Ignition ( +30 sec , - 30x100 nmi injection ) .
The data did , however , point towards the ULA being required to optimize their current trajectory elements , although that would be refined after an “ apples - to - apples ” comparison with Ares I – which was the focus of the study .
On costs , information notes a new , dedicated launch pad ( LC - 37A ) for Delta IV - H – if required – would cost around $ 750 M , although sources claim it would be a lower dollar figure .
An alternative Vehicle Integration Building ( VIB ) and Mobile Launch Platform ( MLP ) for Atlas V - H on LC - 41 would cost around $ 350 M .
It would also cost another $ 350 m and 30 months to finish non-recurring work and field Atlas V-H .
The issue of “ Black Zones ” – often cited by Constellation managers as a negative issue with the EELVs – has been closed , and is not deemed to be a restrictive issue for “ human rating ” the vehicles .
However , ULA ’s estimate of $ 400 M to human rate the Delta IV - H – and a figure of around $ 200 m to carry out the same process on an Atlas V - H – are deemed as “ wildly off base ” by NASA sources , who claim it would take many billions and many years to satisfy NASA ground rules .
Those sources refused to expand on what their larger estimates are based on .
A major negative point for switching to EELV relates to the NASA workforce , especially at the Marshall Space Flight Center ( MSFC ) , and other “ shuttle derived ” centers and contractors .
Currently , a percentage of the shuttle workforce have – or will be – transitioned over to Constellation , although several thousand will still lose their jobs at the end of the shuttle program .
A switch to EELV would see the job losses rise dramatically , according to NASA sources , who add it would also destroy the skill set .
It is also claimed that either an Atlas V - H or a Delta IV - H would be ready to launch with the existing Orion until 2014 , which is later – but potentially more realistic – than previous claims reported in the media .
A large gap in US manned space flight would still exist without shuttle extension , although the current five year gap until Ares / Orion ’s IOC ( Initial Operating Capability ) is unstable , and likely to grow , even if the upcoming PMR summit finds short term solutions to the funding shortage and schedule disconnects .
Mike Griffin Speech :
With a new NASA administrator expected to be announced very shortly – within days some sources claim – the seriousness of NASA ’s funding through the transition to a return to the moon , and the future aim of manned missions to Mars was bluntly outlined by the former NASA administrator , during a speech on April 17 to the National Space Club Goddard Dinner .
Citing the proposed Fiscal 2010 budget outline released by President Obama , Mr Griffin notes the current plan to retire the space shuttle in 2010 as “ good news ” – despite the growing schedule pressure of needing to complete nine missions in around one and a half years , and the resulting gap of at least five years – a situation that grew worse under his watch .
“ A few weeks ago , President Obama released his new administration ’s proposed Fiscal 2010 budget .
For those of us who understand the value of human space exploration , of going once again beyond the shoals of low Earth orbit , the words accompanying the budget release were encouraging , ” noted Mr Griffin on a transcript of his speech .
“ The President ’s budget reiterated support for the retirement of the Space Shuttle and its replacement by the initial Constellation elements , continuation of International Space Station operations after 2015 , and for human lunar return by 2020 .
All of that is good news . ”
However , Mr Griffin then went on the offensive , claiming the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) is responsible for the Constellation Program ’s problems , noting they have removed $ 15 billion from the NASA pot since President Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration ( VSE ) .
“ Work at the staff level continues out of view of the nation ’s elected leadership , and in the recent passback to NASA from the Office of Management and Budget , the news is not so good .
After a small increase this year , Exploration Systems at NASA goes down by $ 3.5 billion over the next four years .
“ When combined with earlier reductions of almost $ 12 billion during the Bush Administration , well over $ 15 billion has been extracted from the Exploration Systems budget in the five short years since the new space policy was announced .
Funding for lunar return in the Constellation program was already less than $ 4 billion in the years prior to 2015 .
“ This was to be allocated to early work on the Ares V heavy - lifter , and the Altair lunar lander .
With only a half - billion dollars now available , this work cannot be done . ”
Noting the change of direction within the Agency since the loss of Columbia and her crew on STS - 107 , Mr Griffin added : “ in the last five years two presidents and two Congresses have provided the top - level direction necessary to ensure that the root cause of Columbia ’s loss – the lack of a guiding strategic vision for NASA – never happens again .
“ But apparently something more is needed .
We ’re not matching the words with the necessary actions at the staff level .
How soon we forget .
“ Let me be clear .
In a democracy , the proper purpose of the OMB is not to find a way to create a Potemkin Village at NASA .
It is not to create the appearance of having a real space program without having to pay for it .
It is not to specify to NASA how much money shall be allocated for human lunar return by 2020 .
“ The proper purpose of the OMB is to work with NASA , as a partner in good government , to craft carefully vetted estimates of what is required to achieve national policy goals .
The judgment as to whether the stated goals are too costly , or not , is one to be made by the nation ’s elected leadership , not career civil service staff . ”
After noting the advances made by other countries in their goals of building towards exploration , and the resulting threat they pose in overtaking the US as the world leader in “ defining , occupying , and extending the human frontier , ” Mr Griffin turned his attentions towards the criticism of Ares I , saying “ so what ? ” to the possibility there are better alternatives available , given the amount of money and effort that would have been wasted on Ares , if it was to be cancelled at this stage of development .
“ I ’ve grown impatient with the argument that Orion and Ares I are not perfect , and should be supplanted with other designs , ” he noted .
“ I do n’t agree that there is a better approach for the money , but if there were , so what ?
“ Any proposed approach would need to be enormously better to justify wiping out four years worth of solid progress .
Engineers do not deal with “ perfect ” .
Your viewgraphs will always be better than my hardware .
“ A fictional space program will always be faster , better , and cheaper than a real space program .
“ No one can wrest leadership in space from the United States .
We ’re that good .
But we can certainly cede it , and that is the path we are on .
“ In this 40th anniversary year of Apollo , we need to ask ourselves some hard questions .
Do we actually want to have a real space program ?
Do we want to be a leader in space , a leader on the frontier ?
Or do we just want to talk about what we used to do , and what we plan to do , someday ? ”

After a recent trip to California , I was reminded what it is like to have a mass transit infrastructure that can take you just about anywhere you want to go .
Unfortunately , the U.S. rail infrastructure has withered significantly since its zenith in the early twentieth century , and unlike many of its European and Asian counterparts , it has almost zero high - speed rail service , excluding the Acela Express between Boston and Washington , D.C .
But things might be changing on the rail front , partly because of the machinations of an Obama administration steeped in the loco - centric history of the biggest rail hub in the country – Chicago .
>> See also : Economic Stimulus Includes $ 1,000 for Mass Transit Riders
When members of Congress sat down to hammer out the final details on the economic stimulus package , President Obama ’s Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel greatly upped the ante for high - speed rail , asking House - Senate negotiators for $ 10 billion — far more than either bill had allotted .
“ I put it in there for the president , ” Emanuel said .
“ The president wanted to have a signature issue in the bill , his commitment for the future . ”
“ High - speed rail is the infrastructure bank , ” said Emanuel , and the legislation gives Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood discretion to assign “ priority to projects that support the development of intercity high - speed rail service . ”
But parsing those projects out will be no easy task .
Several promising rail corridors are hoping they are recipients of some of that $ 10 billion , including a high - speed rail project in California connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles .
However , building a high - speed rail infrastructure is much more expensive at this stage in the game than it would have been decades ago , had we been keeping up with the Casey Jones ’ .
And while $ 10 billion sounds like a lot , the cost of just one of the proposed high - speed rail lines , the 460 - mile line connecting New York City , Albany and Buffalo , is estimated at $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion .
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has 60 days to come up with a strategic plan for the funds .
That 's the chorus in the financial pundit community .
Peter Davis of Capital Gains and Games offers a cogent summary of the reasons why not , channeling the FDIC's Sheila Bair .
In summary :
No US institution currently has the legal authority to take over a multinational financial conglomerate .
Banks are relatively simple operations , and the FDIC has extensive experience in resolution of a liquidation .
But banking and insurance and stockbroking and securities underwriting and capital markets trading all piled into one institution are vastly more complicated -- there is , after all , a reason why each of these businesses have different regulators .
The argument for breaking banks into commercial and investment banking does n't seem to have made much sense from an economic standpoint , but it may have made sense from a regulatory standpoint .
At least in the US , no regulator had the expertise to oversee these giant companies .
The FDIC does not have the funding to perform these kinds of takeovers .
The FDIC is basically an insurance pool -- it is structured to handle a market with enough small players to constitute an actuarial universe .
Since it was set up , however , we have built up institutions big enough , and idiosyncratic enough , to swamp the actuarial pool .
Other countries have regulatory oversight of these financial conglomerates too , and they may object to a U.S. takeover .
Our global institutions are woefully inadequate to regulate global capital markets .
I think that capital controls are a terrible idea , for reasons I will outline anon , but if we do n't want them we 'd better figure out better ways to coordinate global actions like these .
We need the financial equivalent of war -- specifically , World War II , when countries terrified of existential threats cooperated more than they really wanted to .
This tracks what I am hearing elsewhere .
In brief , the banks we want to nationalize are too big and complicated to be nationalized ; the banks we could nationalize do n't need it .
I 'm beginning to have a lot more sympathy for Japanese banking regulators .
Today , in a landmark decision , former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori was convicted for torture , kidnapping and forced disappearances committed during the early 1990s .
This is a crucial victory in the struggle against impunity for human rights violations in Peru and a triumph for justice worldwide .
Javier Zúñiga , an Amnesty International delegate who observed the trial noted :
“ Justice has been done in Peru .
This is historic .
Now it is vital that all of those responsible for human rights violations committed in Peru , including those perpetrated prior to the government of Alberto Fujimori , be brought before the courts . ”
Peru ’s Supreme Court ruled in the cases of Barrios Altos ( in which 15 men , women and children were executed in 1991 ) , La Cantuta ( in which nine students and a university lecturer were kidnapped and later killed in 1992 by members of the Colina Group , a paramilitary force within the Peruvian Army ) and the SIE basements ( where two kidnap victims were held ) .
The decision , which was unanimously adopted by the three presiding judges , concluded that Fujimori bore individual criminal responsibility in all three cases because he had effective military command over those who committed the crimes .
Amnesty International has been closely following the trial of Alberto Fujimori .
We have incontrovertible evidence documenting serious human rights violations and crimes against international law – such as torture , killings and enforced disappearance – were committed .
Given their widespread and systematic nature , these constituted crimes against humanity .
The trial of Fujimori was highlighted in Amnesty ’s short documentary , Justice without Borders .

Put Your Passwords on a Post - it Posted by Sean @ 16:07 GMT Facebook is slowly but surely defending itself against aggressive spam runs .
There 's some speculation among experts .
Why Facebook ?
Has Facebook become a keystone from which to launch and steal all of an individual 's passwords ( i.e. banking and commerce sites ) ?
Once you have Facebook , can you then compromise the primary e-mail account and everything else along with it ?
Maybe so , but regardless of why — the sheer gravity of Facebook makes it a target .
Its growth and size is tremendous .
Let 's take Finland as an example .
There are over one million estimated Facebook accounts and there are only 5.3 million people living in Finland .
The regional network has over 544,000 members .
Anything that size will be a target for scammers .
Wherever good people go , miscreants will follow .
So of course it's an excellent policy to maintain complex passwords that are unique to each site .
Right ?
Here 's an idea .
Write down your passwords .
Seriously .
And once you write them down , put them in your wallet .
Think about it .
What else do you carry in your wallet ?
That 's right , your bank cards .
And your bank cards contain your account name and account number .
That 's kind of like your online account names and passwords .
Only this is the key —
It 's a two part password .
Because your account name and bank card number also requires your PIN .
So take a look at this screenshot .
What do you see ?
Passwords on a Post - it , only examples of course … non-dictionary ones at that .
Keep another three common characters in your head , and you 'll have complex 10 character passwords .
And you can insert those extra characters in the front , middle , or end .
What do we mean ?
It 's like this .
The first three characters in this example are based on the website , " aMA " represents Amazon.com .
And it can be written several ways , such as " AMa " or " aMa " or " AMA " , etc .
A good method should be easy for you to remember .
The next ( or other ) part , " 2242 " as in our example , should be something completely random .
This is the part that you really need to write down and keep safe so that you do n't forget it .
And then you should use a method to add three more characters ( your " PIN " ) to every password .
Something such as " 35 ! "
So the full password then becomes " aMA224235 ! " or " aMA35!2242 " or " 35 !aMA2242 " .
Our other example would be " gMA35N135 ! " .
Your PIN should never be written down , keep that bit of information in your head .
Just like your bank card 's PIN .
Note that our example does not include an e-mail address on the Post - it .
What happens if your wallet is stolen ?
You call the bank and cancel your cards .
And what about your Post - it ?
If it does n't include your e-mail address or your PIN , you can reset your passwords in a timely fashion on a new piece of paper .
You 're good to go .
Using this methodology , you can maintain complex and unique passwords , and still have something handy for when you forget them .
Because we all do forget stuff from time to time .
And if you 're phished on one site , such as Facebook , your other accounts are n't sharing the same password .
Oh , one last piece of advice .
Do n't put the Post - it on your monitor !
And not on the underside of your keyboard either … everyone 's familiar with that location too .
La même planète , pas le même monde

Sur cette superposition d'images crée dynamiquement par le site sautter .com / map , vous pouvez contempler la différence entre la carte de la ville du Caire réalisée par GoogleMaps et celle provenant d' OpenStreetMap .
Pendant environ six mois ( décembre 2008 à mai 2009 ) , chacun a pu constater un écart d'une centaine de mètres entre les deux cartes .
Notez que ce décalage est resté spécifique au Caire .
Il n'existait pas à Paris New York , pas plus qu'à Pyongyang Comment expliquer cette différence ?
Il faut tout dabord comprendre que la différence ne provient pas des processus de réalisation de ces deux cartes , qui sont relativement similaires :
Googlemaps est réalisée à partir de données collectées sur le terrain par des opérateurs professionnels équipés de GPS officiant pour des sociétés telles TéléAtlas .
OpenStreetMap a pour source les données enregistrées par des contributeurs bénévoles , eux- aussi équipés de GPS .
Jusque - là rien ne permet d'expliquer la différence entre les deux cartes ; les GPS des premiers n'étant pas meilleurs que les GPS des seconds .
Il faut donc chercher plus loin pour comprendre qui a fait l'erreur .
Un indice permet d'affirmer que c'est bien Googlemaps qui présente une vision erronée de la réalité géographique : c'est la superposition des visions satellite et cartographique de Google .
C'est donc bien
Google qui est dans l'erreur !
Peut - on considérer que cela soit un bug ?
C'est possible , mais comment imaginer que personne chez Google n'ait remarqué ce décalage affectant la carte de l'une plus grandes métropoles du monde , cela pendant six mois ?
Une autre hypothèse réaliste peut expliquer la chose , c'est tout simplement une pression du gouvernement égyptien pour que Google maquille ses données .
L'Égypte est en effet bien connue pour sa parano ïa envers le terrorisme et Google a plusieurs fois montré qu'il était sensible aux pressions des gouvernements , et notamment celles du gouvernement français , comme le montre limage suivante où une station découte en Dordogne a été floutée « sans raison » par Google .
Les données OSM peuvent être fausses localement , si un contributeurs fait volontairement ou non une erreur , mais il n'est dans le pouvoir de personne de modifier les données sur une zone aussi vaste que la ville du Caire ( 2 ) .
Mais alors pourquoi le gouvernement égyptien n'a -t - il pas exercé la même pression sur OpenStreetMap ?
Ou bien pourquoi , cela n'a t'il eu aucun effet ?
Google est un opérateur commercial .
Les données
Google sont centralisées sur les serveurs qu'il contrôle .
Google a une raison sociale sur laquelle des pressions gouvernementales peuvent s'exercer .
A linverse , OpenStreetMap ( OSM ) est une fondation basée en Angleterre .
Les données cartographiques OSM sont aussi centralisées sur un serveur au moment de leur création , mais OSM n'a aucun contrôle sur l'action des contributeurs .
De plus , les données OSM sont librement diffusables par qui le désire selon les termes de la licence CC by - sa .
Ainsi , il existe quantité de serveurs distribuant les données OSM .
Les données OSM peuvent être fausses localement si un contributeur fait une erreur ( quelle soit volontaire ou non ) , mais personne au sein de la fondation na le pouvoir de modifier les données sur une zone aussi vaste que la ville du Caire ( 1 ) Au - delà de cette interprétation , il faut observer que Googlemaps et OpenStreetMap ont des architectures très différentes .
Google a une architecture centralisée , fonctionnant suivant ce que j'appelle ici une perspective temporelle OpenStreetMap a aussi une architecture centralisée au moment de la création des données , mais celle - ci sont ensuite largement distribuées et deviennent parfaitement incontrôlables par le centre .
La passerelle entre ces données est réalisée , non pas par un centre ou une autorité quelconque , mais par une sorte de " norme d'interopérabilité " permettant aux divers logiciels exploitant les données de se comprendre et de fonctionner ensemble .
Cette architecture relève de ce que j'appelle une perspective numérique dont le " code de fuite " est précisément la norme d'interopérabilité citée plus haut .
L'écart entre les représentations du territoire produites par GooGleMap et d' OpensStreetMap peut sembler bien peu de chose , mais cela traduit des différences d'architectures techniques , humaines et politiques considérables .
Bref , perspective temporelle ou perspective numérique , ce n'est pas le même monde !*

Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told NBC's David Gregory that there are some differences of note between President Obama and President Bush .
GATES : I think that probably President Obama is somewhat more analytical , and he makes sure he hears from everybody in the room on an issue .

GREGORY : A marked difference from his predecessor ?
GATES : President Bush was interested in hearing different points of view but did n’t go out of his way to make sure everybody spoke if they had n’t spoken up before .
John Amato : Gates takes a measured swipe at Bush 's overall governing abilities .
More analytical means a much more intelligent look into the issues and President Obama demonstrated that on the campaign .
Former Bushie Dan Bartlett had to make a DVD about the horrors occurring during Hurricane Katrina so he knew what was going on because his own people were n't telling him .
And as Bob Somerby put it :
[ In this in - depth article , veteran designer Davies looks at games from Call Of Duty 4 through Dead Space to analyze the art of game level pacing . ]
Introduction
" Pacing " is a word bandied around a lot when talking about level design , but it is actually a very complex concept to pin down .
Just how does the pace affect the player 's perception of the level and what is it that sets a well paced level apart from a poorly paced one ?
The Fundamentals
With these questions ringing in my ears I was determined to try and delve a little deeper into just what constitutes level pacing , but I found very little literature on the subject .
Instead I decided to focus my efforts on breaking down the core elements of what determines pace itself .
In doing so I identified several key aspects of game pace :
Movement Impetus -- the will of the player to move through the level .
-- the will of the player to move through the level .
Threat -- the notion of danger .
-- the notion of danger .
Tension -- the atmosphere and mood of the level or perceived danger which is reflected in the player .
-- the atmosphere and mood of the level or perceived danger which is reflected in the player .
Tempo -- the level of actual action currently being experienced by the player .
Movement Impetus
Movement impetus is the will or desire of a player to move forwards through a level .
There are several ways in which the player can be pushed into moving or stalled from pushing forwards in order to affect the movement impetus and thus the pace of the action .
There are many elements that increase impetus to move :
Introduce a threat from behind -- as long as the threat is significant it will cause the player to want to move away from it .
-- as long as the threat is significant it will cause the player to want to move away from it .
Present an objective ahead -- dangling the carrot is one of the most effective methods of encouraging movement .
A clearly defined goal is vital in creating this urge to follow it .

Impose a time limit -- quite obviously the restriction of a time limit will encourage the player to not hang around .
Too many imposed time limits can be extremely frustrating however .

Narrow physical options -- limiting the space in which to travel -- i.e. long corridors as opposed to open spaces , limits the amount of choice available to the player and in turn increases the speed at which they tend to move .

Draw the eye -- items of interest will pull the player towards them .
Judicious use of these will help to pull the player through parts of the level .
Bear in mind that once they reach the item of interest they are likely to pause at that point .

Architectural pressure -- specific forms of architecture promote movement .
Walls that angle down , long corridors , junctions , etc all have psychological impact upon the player .

Snatch desired object -- taking away a desired object will often trigger the player into chasing after it .
-- taking away a desired object will often trigger the player into chasing after it .
NPC leads the way -- having a third party lead the player though the level will nearly always directly affect the movement impetus .
Continual movement keeps the tempo high , but it is undesirable in many ways .
Often players want time to take stock , catch their breath , formulate a plan or even just soak up the atmosphere -- it provides a break from constant travel .
Also in production terms continual travel often requires much more real estate in which to move -- this is both a production risk and possibly a technical issue .
Conversely there are also many elements that decrease impetus to move :
Wow moments -- stunning scenery , dramatic actions , impressive vistas or other elements that halt the player for a while .

Obstacle -- something blocking the progress ahead will decrease movement impetus and force the player to find a way around or a way to clear the blockage .

Altered movement -- a different movement method may require more thought , such as scaling walls via handholds .

Introducing a threat ahead -- a group of enemies ahead , a flaming pit or any other potential threat will slow the player whilst they plan to deal with it , then execute said plan .
-- a group of enemies ahead , a flaming pit or any other potential threat will slow the player whilst they plan to deal with it , then execute said plan .
Increased tension -- when tension is particularly high ( usually through a high perceived threat and good atmosphere ) then the player will often be fearful of moving quickly .
Dead Space is a classic example of this -- many players tend to move slowly to ready themselves for sudden attacks .

Multiple Routes / Open World -- choice requires thought and thought slows movement impetus .
Multiple routes and open world games offer a plethora of choice .
Perhaps the ultimate example of slowed impetus is the moment when a player exits the sewer in Oblivion and sees the huge expanse of the world before them .
It takes a moment or two just to take it all in .

Taking stock of inventory ( collecting items ) -- whenever a player encounters an item they are likely to slow down to investigate .
Complex inventory systems will also require management that will slow movement impetus .
Further still -- having collectible items in the first place will encourage exploration .

-- moments of dialog with NPCs or getting into the character will generally require more involvement from the player , and will thus slow movement impetus .
Story exposition -- generally the exposition of story will require the player 's attention and will thus slow movement impetus .
Constantly slowing movement impetus can also be dangerous , as it can prevent the player having a feeling of progression .
A balance needs to be struck in providing a sense of movement and accomplishment and allowing the player time to themselves to explore , soak in the atmosphere or to take stock of their situation .
Threat ( Actual Danger )
The pace of the game can also be increased by the sense of peril that is experience by the player .
The more threat the player believes they are under , the quicker their pulse , the more nervous and often more panicked them are .
Threat can come in many forms -- each form having a different feel of pacing .
For example combat tends to be more frantic and higher paced than traversing an environment , even though the end result -- death -- could potentially occur in either situation .
Generally the level of threat felt by the player is determined by whether the threat is being caused by an external force -- an enemy , an encroaching hazard , etc , or whether is a danger that will result from the player 's own mistake .
Threats from external forces tend to have a much higher level of pace than those that will result from a player 's mistake , as they have time to gather their thoughts and create a plan when they have control .
Proximity of a threat also has a huge influence on the feel of the threat .
An enemy at a distance is not nearly as threatening as one very close by .
This is something that stealth based games can really use to their advantage ( and is something that can also build a great sense of tension ) .
Adding a time limit to a task automatically increases the level of actual danger , as the control the player has over the game world has been reduced -- there are now limits placed upon them which can induce a level of panic .
Following is a letter to the New York Times :
To the Editor :
In  Maybe the Fed Should Go Negative ( Economic View , April 19 ) N. Gregory Mankiw suggests that negative interest rates could kick - start the economy .
A way to achieve this , he argues , is for the Federal Reserve to produce enough inflation to motivate people to borrow and spend .
But ca n’t our current problems be traced to unsustainable levels of borrowing and spending ?
Keeping that merry - go - round spinning will only prolong and deepen the crisis .
Remember that someone has to save in order for someone else to borrow , and that savings squandered on consumption are not available for investment .
Economies grow precisely because consumers do not spend but loan their savings to businesses to fund capital investment instead .
The column argued that more inflation may be preferable to current economic problems .
But with its ability to wipe out savings and stifle investment , inflation is the ultimate weapon of financial destruction .
At best such a plan trades short - term gain for long - term pain .
Ask anyone in Argentina if it ’s a deal worth making .

Zipper Machine on I -95 James River Bridge Project
These photos show the Zipper Machine in action on May 3 , 2001 .
The machine is in the process of moving the temporary concrete median barrier over one lane .
This is done to close one half of the bridge so that deck replacement operations can take place on the closed half , while one lane each way with a center emergency lane operates on the other half .
The closure begins at 7:00 PM and ends at 6:00 AM the following morning , occurring Monday through Friday .
You may wonder how I got such a great view looking down on this operation .
The James Monroe state office building is right next to I -95 in downtown Richmond , and I am standing at the edge of the plaza that surrounds the building .
The building is 25 stories tall .
The " Zipper Machine " is rather impressive ; it 's a huge truck - like device that lifts the movable concrete median barrier about 6 inches off of the roadway , shifts it over , and then places it back down onto the roadway .
The barrier is comprised of segments about 5 feet long , with strong interlocking steel brackets that hold the segments of the barrier together , so that it can " flow " through the Zipper Machine as well as have linear connectivity if a motor vehicle collides with it .
Jersey - type median barriers weigh 500 pounds per linear foot or more , so it takes a large powerful machine to perform this task , and it moves at 3 to 4 miles per hour .
There is over a mile of movable barrier on the project , and it took about 20 minutes to move the entire barrier .
Actually it takes two passes to do this , twice moving the barrier over by one lane ; in other words , the barrier needs to be moved two lanes in all at the daily start of work , and then back two lanes at the daily end of work .
The movable barrier is " parked " right next to the permanent highway median barrier when the bridge has its full 6 lanes open to traffic .
It 's all visible in the photo if one looks closely .
Each barrier segment has a two - sided flange at the top , and the " zipper channel " has two tracks of closely - spaced small wheels that the flanges roll over .
While it moves slowly , it will move a mile of barrier in 20 minutes , which would take a crew of four all day to move and expose all of them to the traffic while placing the barriers .
That would involve a small truck crane to lift and replace the barrier segments one at a time , and a means to detach and reattach the interlocking steel brackets that hold the segments of the barrier together .
The Zipper Machine does it far more efficiently .
Both front and rear wheel trucks are steerable , and you can see a steering wheel and steering crewman at each end of the machine .
The Zipper Machine is actually a quite large vehicle , when seen up close .
It takes a tremendous amount of power to move a heavy concrete median barrier , and to do it as quickly as this machine does it .
It is fairly quiet when in operation , though .
The motor is not loud , and the lowering of the barrier segments back down to the roadway provides a quiet ' plunk - plunk - plunk ' sound that is not very noticeable even when you are standing under the bridge when the machine passes across the deck overhead .
As you can see , each side of the bridge ( actually two separate bridges that are about two feet apart ) has been restricted to one lane each way as the temporary concrete median barrier is being shifted over .
Construction workers , trucks , machinery and a large truck crane are already moving into place to begin work on another section of bridge deck replacement on the northbound side .
The lighter - toned deck is the portion that has already been replaced .

A wrap of cocaine can cost just £ 25 Evidence has emerged which points to a link between cocaine use and violent behaviour in Britain 's city centres .
Figures from Greater Manchester Police suggest that 41 % of people arrested for violence had taken cocaine or crack cocaine , by itself or with other drugs .
The force took samples from 1,000 people arrested for offences such as assault , wounding and affray in the seven months to March last year .
The charity DrugScope revealed the results in its magazine , DrugLink .
The survey was part of an article which considered whether mixing alcohol and cocaine was a recipe for disaster .
Similar findings had been reported in the Liverpool area after a separate study , run last summer by John Moores University .
Aggressive behaviour Chief Inspector Dave Boon , who leads Greater Manchester Police 's drug intervention programme , said while only a small number of offenders had been tested so far , the statistics were important .

" We cannot afford to ignore the link between violence , drugs and alcohol that is apparent in city centres all over the UK every weekend , " he said .
" What this survey is doing is trying to prove that link and developing ways to manage the problem . "
DrugScope chief executive Martin Barnes said : " The investigation carried out by our magazine does suggest some link between powder cocaine use and violent and aggressive behaviour .
" However , because the drug is so often taken in combination with alcohol we need to be cautious about claims that cocaine alone can lead to violent offending . "
Cocaine is more widely used in Britain than ever , while the average price has halved in a decade .
A wrap can cost as little as £ 25 .
Further research will be conducted this year , with police keen to establish whether there is a link between alcohol , cocaine and domestic violence .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The official overseeing tribunals for Guantanamo Bay inmates has said the U.S. military tortured a Saudi man accused of planning to take part in the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , prompting calls for his release .
The outside of the " Camp Five " detention facility is seen at U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay December 10 , 2008 , in this image reviewed by the U.S. military .
REUTERS / Mandel Ngan / Pool
“ We tortured Qahtani , ” Susan Crawford said in an interview with the Washington Post published on Wednesday .
“ His treatment met the legal definition of torture .
And that ’s why I did not refer the case ” for prosecution .
Crawford , a retired judge who also worked in the Reagan administration , is the first senior Bush administration official responsible for reviewing practices at Guantanamo to publicly state that a detainee was tortured .
Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have said that the United States does not torture .
The American Civil Liberties Union described the admission as “ stunning ” but said the Bush administration was still planning , on its final full day in office , to prosecute other detainees who had been tortured .
A hearing is scheduled for January 19 , a day before President - elect Barack Obama takes office .
He is expected to issue an executive order to close the Guantanamo Bay prison .
Crawford told the Post the techniques used in Qahtani ’s case were authorized but applied in an overly aggressive and too persistent manner .
“ This was not any one particular act ; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him , that hurt his health .
It was abusive and uncalled for .
And coercive .
Clearly coercive .
It was that medical impact that pushed me over the edge ” to call it torture , Crawford said .
CHENEY DEFENDS POLICY
Cheney said he did not know the details of Qahtani ’s interrogation but defended the use aggressive techniques , which he insisted were legal , to gain information .
“ It ’s entirely possible that it was a problem in terms of how one specific prisoner was handled .
I ca n’t claim perfection , ” Cheney told PBS television ’s “ News Hour . ”
“ I can tell you what the policy was .
I can tell you that we had all the legal authorization we needed to do it , including the sign - off of the Justice Department , ” he said .
“ I can tell you it produced phenomenal results for us and a great many Americans are alive today because we did all that . ”
U.S. defense officials said a review of Qahtani ’s 2002 interrogation concluded the methods were lawful at the time .
But Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said investigators did note the “ cumulative effect ” of aggressive interrogations on the alleged 20th hijacker .
“ The application of the techniques in a cumulative sort of way raised some concerns , ” he said without providing details .
The Defense Department no longer allows those “ special interrogation techniques , ” which Whitman said were used on a very small number of detainees at the prison in Cuba .
The CIA , however , is allowed to use more aggressive interrogation techniques than the military .
AMNESTY CALLS FOR RELEASE
Crawford dismissed war crimes charges against Qahtani in May 2008 but he remains at Guantanamo .
Crawford said he is dangerous and that she would be hesitant to say ‘ Let him go . ’
The Center for Constitutional Rights , a New York - based group that represents Qahtani and other Guantanamo detainees , said he should be released to Saudi Arabia .
“ The fact is , if the only evidence against an individual is obtained through torture , there is no reliable evidence .
Period , ” the group said in a statement .
Amnesty International said Qahtani should be freed unless the U.S. government was prepared to recharge him promptly before an independent court , not a military commission .
U.S. officials say Qahtani was denied entry to the United States a month before the September 11 attacks and was planning to be the plot ’s 20th hijacker .
He was later captured in Afghanistan .
Despite Obama ’s pledge to close the Guantanamo prison , which still holds about 250 men , it is unlikely to shut until U.S. officials settle legal and practical issues , including where to house its occupants .
The Senate Armed Services Committee said last month former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ’s decision to authorize aggressive interrogation techniques at Guantanamo in 2002 contributed directly to detainee abuse there and at other prisons which opened up the United States to accusations of torture .
A new front opened up in the Westminster expenses scandal last night after it emerged that MPs are travelling around the world on hundreds of trips a year paid for by the taxpayer and foreign governments .
Research by The Independent on Sunday has uncovered details of nearly 200 fact - finding missions and study tours to more than 60 countries in the past two years – equivalent to two trips for every week of the year .
The visits , many of which are paid for by public funds , are over and above the overseas work of select committees , which already takes MPs around the globe .
Those not funded by the taxpayer are offered as " freebies " by foreign governments , whose guests often fly business class and stay in luxury hotels .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Some of the tours clearly have serious aims , including MPs paying visits to Israel and Palestine and Iraq to learn about the conflicts in those countries .
But others appear to be more questionable , including junkets organised by the hundreds of all - party parliamentary groups created for the sole intention of forging links with different countries – including destinations such as the Cayman Islands and the Maldives .
There are 140 all - party country groups in Parliament , allowing their members to organise visits to to " forge links " with governments .
The all - party Maldives group , for example , says its purpose is to " work as a forum for those parliamentarians who wish to better understand the Maldives " .
While none of the MPs has broken any rules , the perception that hundreds of them are accepting free junkets risks further damage to the electorate 's trust in Parliament .
Where host nations are spending the money , often it is during parliamentary term time , effectively on taxpayers ' time .
Visits by all - party groups , which are not funded by the taxpayer but rely on sponsorship and funding by the governments of the nations they visit , have to be declared in the MPs ' register of interests .
But there are a number of organisations
MPs use to travel abroad which are paid for out of public money and do not have to be recorded in the register .
They include the Inter - Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) and the UK branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and cost the taxpayer £ 3.3 m a year .
Both are decades old and are used to forge links with politicians from around the world with exchange trips .
Yet reports written by IPU members give a hint of the comfortable lifestyle some of our MPs are enjoying at taxpayers ' expense , including :
t Sir John Butterfill , the Tory grandee who claimed for " servants quarters " on the taxpayer , led an IPU delegation of MPs and peers to Iceland last year , which included bathing in the volcanic springs of the Blue Lagoon .
t Margaret Moran , the Labour MP who is standing down after claiming £ 22,500 for dry rot at her fiancé 's house , led a delegation to Thailand which included a lavish reception hosted by the British ambassador .

Sir Peter Viggers , the Tory MP who is standing down after trying to claim on expenses £ 1,645 for a duck house , has been on four trips in two years , including a taxpayer - funded IPU visit to Saudi Arabia .
A report of the trip boasts of how the MPs were treated to a " number of lunches , dinners and receptions " by their hosts .
Hundreds of MPs are members of the all - party country groups , which are separate from , but sometimes funded by , the IPU .
While their members have not necessarily visited those countries yet , the groups effectively provide an open door to a free visit .
Many of the country groups have laudable aims , such as many in Africa and other developing countries .
The register of all - party groups shows Labour MP John Austin is a member of 52 groups , followed by Tory MP Nigel Evans on 44 .
Julie Kirkbride , who is standing down as Tory MP for Bromsgrove at the next election after public fury about her expenses , is a member of 26 , the fifth highest of all MPs .
Hugo Swire , a former Tory frontbencher and chairman of the Conservative Middle East Council , was among several Tory MPs visiting Dubai last year .
The register shows he did not declare the visit , but Mr Swire said he had declared everything with the Electoral Commission , and usually recorded trips in the register .
" I would be very surprised if it has been missed off , " he added .
" The Conservative Middle East Council tries to expose what is going on in the Middle East .
Not a penny piece of taxpayers ' money is spent on our trips . "
Three MPs have gone on six parliamentary trips in the past two years , according to the register of interests : Mr Evans , MP for Ribble Valley , Andrew Rosindell , Tory MP for Romford , and Jim Sheridan , the Labour MP for Paisley and Renfewshire .
Roger Berry , Labour MP for Kingswood , said : " The job of the IPU internationally is to promote good relations between parliamentarians which is a good way to promote democracy , peace and security between countries .
As with inward trips , we meet parliamentarians , ministers , NGOs and others to listen and learn . "
Lindsay Hoyle , Labour MP for Chorley , said of his July 2008 trip to the Cayman Islands : " It was in recess and it did n't cost the taxpayer anything .
It was paid for by the Cayman Islands , who had invited us to talk on democracy and the environment . "
Independent and former Conservative MP Bob Spink said of the trip to Thailand in 2006 led by Ms Moran : " I spent a lot of time on that trip urging Thailand to take firm action with the Burmese military junta relating to Aung San Suu Kyi .
I 'm not sure if taxpayers would consider this value for money but I think British MPs have a duty to fight for justice and freedom . "
Alun Michael , defending his role in a trip to Brazil for the Internet Governance Forum in 2007 , said : " Have you ever been to Brazil in November ?
It 's like Cardiff on a wet November day . "
Labour MP Howard Stoate , defending a visit to India in February 2008 , said : " This trip was really important for forging long - term economic links with one of our main trading partners , which I think will benefit Britain in the future .
While I do n't advocate such trips if they are a regular occurrence , they can be extremely useful . "
Alan Duncan , Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton , said : " Many Arab countries are taking very important steps towards more democratic structures .
They wish to learn from us and we often have a lot to learn from them . "

One Step Closer to a Compostable Car , Thanks to Bioplastics
May 12th , 2009 by Tina Casey
Some time in the sparkling green future , the global food giant Archer Daniels Midland might have a hand in developing the world ’s first compostable car .
And we might have to thank the Belgians for that , too .
Sounds far - fetched , right ?
Not when you throw in the U.S. military and a small Massachusetts company that specializes in bioplastics .
The Bioplastics Connection
Massachusetts - based Metabolix is working with the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program ( SERDP ) , to develop its proprietary bioplastic , Mirel™ for military use in food packaging .
The logistics are compelling .
Tons of plastic go into wrapping and shipping MRE ’s and base food supplies .
Disposing of all that waste requires fuel , which in turn requires a convoy , and convoys need to be manned – and in some cases , defended .
Cutting down on non-biodegradable waste is one way to trim costs and improve troop safety .
The Archer Daniels Midland Connection
ADM has teamed up with Metabolix in a joint venture called Telles , to market Mirel bioplastic .
The first plant capable of producing Mirel bioplastic in commercial quantites is under construction next to an ADM corn mill in Clinton , Iowa , expected to go online later this year .
In the great green scheme of things , corn is not an ideal feedstock , but it ’s possible that alternatives are in the future ; Metabolix is working on other crops such as switchgrass and oilseeds .
Biodegradable or Compostable ?
Biodegradability refers to the capability of a material to be converted into carbon dioxide by microorganisms .
Compostability is held to a higher standard – a lot of them , in fact .
In order to be considered compostable , a material has to meet standards for heavy metals and any other substance that could affect the plants that grow in it .
Enter the Belgians
This is where the rubber hits the road .
A Belgian firm called Vinçotte is emerging as a leader in certifying materials for meeting European Norm ( EN ) standards for compostability .
In addition to covering Europe , Vinçotte is also active in Morocco , Japan , and the U.S.
The applicable standard is EN 13432 : 200 .
On May 6 , Metabolix announced that Vinçotte has certified Mirel bioplastic for compostability with its OK Compost and OK Compost HOME marks , meaning that the material is certified to biodegrade appropriately for compost under both industrial and household conditions .
EN Bioplastic Standards , the U.S. Military , and Compostable Cars
With the U.S. military and “ supermarket - to - the - world ” ADM both throwing their considerable weight behind a bioplastic that ’s not merely biodegradable but compostable , there ’s a chance for the economics of scale to kick in .
One thing holding bioplastics back from the mass market is price , so once that barrier falls , anything is possible .
Researchers are already working on a way to make car parts out of coconut husks , so using a compostable bioplastic does n’t stretch the imagination that much farther .
For that matter , the U.S. military is also looking into recycling used bioplastic to make diesel fuel .
The next step : how big is the market for an edible car ?

More than 100 people are in police custody after a series of pre-dawn raids described as the biggest takedown in Ontario history .
About 1,000 police officers executed more than 100 search warrants during the bust of " unprecedented scale , " Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair said this morning .
Police from across the province , including Ontario Provincial Police , burst into apartment buildings and homes as early as 5 a .m. in an effort to dismantle both high and low - level operatives of various criminal organizations .
" We have achieved the purpose that we set out to do today , " Blair said .
Police continued to make arrests and seize property throughout the morning .
Project Fusion , as police are calling today 's takedown began last year and focused on crimes dating back to 2003 , Chief Bill Blair told a news conference at police headquarters today .
The investigation focused on two street gangs , MNE ( Markham Road / Eglinton Avenue East ) and the 400 Crew ( 400 McCowan Rd. ) located in southeast Toronto , Blair said .
" But there is an overarching criminal enterprise that supplies weapons and drugs to the street gangs . "
Blair said they do n't have a name but " they have been extremely well organized and sophisticated in their operation . "
One hundred homes and 61 vehicles around the GTA were the targets of search warrants .
Police arrested 125 people .
Some face weapons trafficking and criminal organization charges but there were also those facing less serious offences and they were released from custody .
Prosecutors will try to detain the accused who face the most serious charges .
No names have been released .
" This is the culmination of a complex and obviously successful organized crime investigation . "
Undercover police and Emergency Task Force officers toting battering rams and assault rifles took part in the operation .
Richard Jauvin was startled out of bed just after 5 a.m. , awakened by a loud boom coming from outside .
At first he thought someone was breaking into his car .
" I heard people yelling , ' Police ! ' "
Jauvin said , " and then I knew exactly what was happening . "
Jauvin said he ran to the window of his Scarborough bungalow and saw about nine SWAT team officers storming into the house next door , rifles in hand .
Police used a battering ram to break through the door .
" It was crazy , " he said .
Jauvin shook his wife Tina awake , after watching as his 16 - year - old neighbour was led away by police .
An 11 - year - old girl , who also lives in the one - storey house on Sedgemount Rd , , near Markham Rd. and Eglinton Ave. , is now with her grandmother , a police source said .
Mattresses in the home were flipped up and police scoured the premises .
Tina , a 22 - year resident of the quiet street , said she and her husband have seen many expensive cars pulling up into their neighbour 's driveway over the three summers the family has lived there .

Cheeky Dave Rogers Moons Fans During Match Between Dundalk FC And St Patrick ’s Athletic : Video
If you ’re going to express yourself to your opponent ’s fans , it ’s best to keep your pants on while doing so .
During a soccer match in Ireland between Dundalk FC and St. Patrick ’s Athletic last Friday , Dundalk ’s Dave Rogers dropped his shorts and mooned the fans ( shown around 55 seconds into the above video – safe for work ) .
The incident , which has been dubbed “ Arse Gate ” , led to Rogers getting an immediate red card .
Dundalk did n’t wait to punish him either , and he was summarily dropped from the club after showing his naked ass .
The team issued a statement that said , “ Following an incident during the Dundalk v St Patrick ’s Athletic match in Oriel Park on Friday night , Dave Rogers has been dismissed , with immediate effect , due to gross misconduct .
The club will not tolerate this type of behaviour from any member of our squad . ”
Because really , who wants to see a pale English or Irish ass ?
Rogers sacked by Dundalk [ RTE ]

Wilkins Ice Shelf Collapse in Google Earth
The news came out just a few days ago that the last remaining bridge of ice connecting two islands in Antarctica disintegrated and the Wilkins Ice Shelf is now just a pile of broken ice .
Now , the National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) has released a Google Earth time animation showing satellite photos of the break - up of the Wilkins Ice Shelf over the past few weeks , including the final bridge collapse .
You can watch the time animation of the photos of the collapse here ( 600 Kbytes ) .
After the file loads , just hit the play button in the time slider that appears in the upper left of Google Earth .
This and other interesting Google Earth content is available at the NSIDC site .

I ’ve been meaning for a long time to write more about the projects I ’m working on .
I ’ve had this web space for ages and have never really done anything useful with it , and I ’ve decided the time has come to change that .
Why Haskell ?
Lately most of my personal project time has been spent hacking on Haskell code .
I ’m a strong proponent of functional programming : my years of research and study in computer science and in programming have lead me to the conclusion that functional programs are simpler , shorter , more likely to be correct , and quicker to write than programs written in standard industry languages like Java or C ++.
I did most of my graduate work in Standard ML .
Back then ( 2001 –2003 ) , Haskell was still pretty immature , not very fast , and even more “ boutique ” than it is now .
ML , “ Standard ” and otherwise had several industrial - strength compilers , reasonable standard libraries , and a small but dedicated user community .
The tables have turned : Haskell has improved so much in the past six years , it ’s uncanny .
The GHC compiler is getting acceptably close to C’s performance ( between 2X – 3X in my experience ) , libraries are proliferating , the user community is thriving .
Much progress has been made on a lot of the old issues ( e.g. : “ space leaks everywhere ” ) .
Haskell is definitely my choice for the current “ best of breed ” functional language .
So when choosing the “ technology stack ” for this website , I decided that I would write the backend in Haskell .
In a pathetic attempt at evangelism , I ’m also releasing the code on my github page as a tutorial in the hope that it might help other people to make their own happstack websites , or at least see an example of a functioning ( albeit simple ) one “ in the wild . ”
Haskell web frameworks
A quick survey of Hackage yields a bunch of web toolkits , of varying levels of immaturity .
My main requirements are : simple , flexible , easy to use fast , preferably supporting bytestrings .
does n’t gobble or leak memory
After a bit of research I settled on happstack .
Happstack is still under - documented and a little over - complicated in parts , and I wo n’t be trusting my data to its “ MACID ” system anytime soon ; but it supports bytestrings , it ’s modular enough to be used in mix - and - match fashion , and it ’s quick : on my last - gen Macbook Pro , it serves up static files about half as fast as Apache .
This is pretty impressive given that Apache uses sendfile ( ) to serve static files , avoiding a couple of copies and context switches in the process .
For an equivalent dynamic program I suspect the race might be a little closer .
It has been predicted that Apple will have sold 45 million iPhones by the end of 2009 .
And that ’s before it hits China .
There are n’t hundreds of type - related apps for the iPhone , but here are few ; and a few type - related tips too .
( Helvetica Moleskine give - away details at the end ) .
i Phone apps
Recently released , MyFonts ’ What The Font for iPhone is a terrific little app .
The biggest barrier is not MyFonts ’ image recognition technology ( which has proven itself online ) , but the dreadfully inadequate iPhone camera .
However , despite that it does a pretty good job .
Just ensure that the lighting is good .
And remember , that even with a great photo and big type , there are no guarantees .
Although the MyFonts database of type is big , there are numerous foundries and faces that just are n’t there .
For example , you wo n’t see the likes of H&FJ and the Gothams .
There ’s a review of the app over at DesignWorkPlan .
See my font identification post for further resources .
The next app ( free ) is imaginatively named Fonts .
It ’s incredibly ugly ( I refuse to post the app home screen here , lest it set off a migraine ) , but it lists the iPhone ’s system fonts .
Knowing which fonts are installed on the iPhone will help with your font stacks .
So , if you ’ve chosen Lucida Grande , and wonder why it does n’t display as Lucida Grande on the iPhone , then this app shows you why .
[ iTunes link ]
FontShuffle from FontShop is aimed at helping you find typefaces .
You can home in on a selction of faces by selecting from a number of categories and sub-categories ( general to specific ) ; e.g. serif > french > or sans serif > grotesque .
It ’s you pocket type catalogue :
It was recently updated with 50 % more fonts .
Again , it ’s a free app .
I think it could be educational too — in teaching the basic type categories .
[ iTunes link ]
The next is a fun little game by the name of Kern .
Not easy to describe how this one works , so take a look at the Kern site for instructions .
Basically you play at letter spacing .
More fun than it sounds .
Price : a mere $ 0.99 .
[ iTunes link ]
Another game , and one that can be quite addictive , is iLT ’s own FontGame :
I ’ll talk to the Kari , the maker of the FontGame , and see if we can develop it further .
And of course you do n’t need an iPhone to play this one .
There ’s also a regular ( no pun intended ) version of the FontGame .
Would be happy to hear your suggestions for improvements , or additions to the game .
i Phone font tip
I ’ve heard many complaining that they do n’t have access to accents ( diacritics ) on the iPhone .
If you do n’t already know , then you simply have to press and hold down the key , and you ’ll see a list of alternates , like so :
The standard US keyboard has quite a few accents , but if you want something like ý ( y acute ) , as in Josef Týfa , then simply turn on the Czech keyboard : settings > general > international > keyboards .
Micellaneous
ShinKanji is n’t for everyone , but if you ’re interested in Japanese , then this is really useful .
Includes handwriting recognition .
Just draw the character ( Kanji ) with your finger , and it finds it in the extensive Japanese dictionary :
The Lite version is free .
The standard ShinKanji , with an expanded dictionary and alternate input and search methods is $ 5.99 ( much cheaper than an electronic dictionary ) .
Might be worth consulting before you get that gorgeous Japanese tattoo .
Type themed wallpapers for iPhone from TypeNuts :
Even some for the G1 & BlackBerry .
I promise to add more for those devices .
And the lovely poolga .
Not all type - themed , but lovely , nonetheless :
I wonder what ’s next for the iPhone .
Imagine a mobile version of FontStruct , or … well , I have some ideas too , so stay tuned .
So , if you ’re an iPhone developer and you ’re interested in collaborating , then please mail me .
If you have your own type - related tips & resources for the iPhone or other mobile devices , then please share below .
And , if you ’ve used any of the above , let me know what you think .
My apologies to those who do not have or do n’t want an iPhone .
Helvetica Moleskine give - away
I mentioned here that I ’d be giving away some of these beautiful limited edition Helvetica Moleskines , produced by the Helvetica Project in Japan :
I have already given away three .
I have another two to give away .
The winners get to choose black or red .
I paid full price , plus postage , so although I ’d love to give them all away , I ’m stretching it with five .
Of course , if there are any philanthropic souls out there who ’d like to donate some cash , then I ’ll give away even more ( and mention you , if you so desire ) .
So , how to win one ?
I ’ll give one away to someone in the comments below ( might regret that ) ; the other I ’ll give to a random twitter user who tweets about iLT .
It need n’t be a tweet about this competition .
And you need n’t tweet multiple times .
No prizes for driving twitter users crazy with iLT tweets !
I ’ll announce the winners within the next few days .
Always difficult to know how to run these give - aways ; if you have a better idea , then do let me know .
The remaining 10 , I will sell .
Not sure of the price ( approx US$ 30 + postage ) .
I ’ll set up a shop with someone like bigCartel .
Hope to have it live by Monday .
I will also have some limited edition handmade bags ( made from sail cloth , and until now , not available outside of Japan ) :
I ’ll try to post some better photos later .
And , another type - related Moleskine project .
More details to follow .
Other give - away winners
@justincraigen got a copy of the font management app , Suitcase Fusion 2 .
Courtesy of Extensis .
Winner of the Bolda Display font give - away is @chergaoui .
I used twitRand to choose the winner ( and did some quick checks for multiple accounts ) .
Coming up …
A monster - sized the week in type , and a number of educational articles , including one all about the zero ( promise it ’s not as boring as it sounds ) ; some more translations ( German & Japanese ) … oh , and that iPhone app , and lots more .
Have a great week , and thanks for reading .
Investing Basics : Fundamental Analysis
One of the best things you can do for yourself when it comes to investing is to take a deep interest in your portfolio and the investments that you choose to invest in .
Whether it ’s a retirement account , a self - directed mutual fund or a desire to see what you can do in the stock market now that everything is on sale , it is important to have a grasp of the fundamentals underlying the companies you are considering .
This idea of looking into the factors that provide the big picture of a company ’s overall health is known as fundamental analysis .
If you want to increase your chances of long - term investment portfolio success , it is important to analyze the investments you have or are planning to make– and to understand what makes them good ( or poor ) choices .
What is fundamental analysis ?
Fundamental analysis goes beyond the daily ups and downs of a stock and focuses on the company behind the stock .
Fundamental analysis is about looking at the way a company does business , how sound it looks and what the future prospects of the company might be .
Some of the factors to consider when analyzing the fundamentals of a company include :
Is the company making a profit ?
This can be a tough one to consider right now , since so many companies are not making profits due to the recession .
But you can get a feel for a company ’s performance by looking at what sort profits it was making before , and by looking into the reasons that the company ’s profits have tapered off .
And there are some companies that are still making profits , even during the recession .
Focusing on these right now could be a good idea .
Related to profits are whether or not margins are growing , and whether revenues are increasing .
You should also consider the competitive landscape to understand if the profits can be maintained in the future .
Can the company repay its debt ?
All companies have debt .
It ’s part of doing business .
But you should look at how much debt the company has .
And whether or not the company can repay its obligations .
This can be done by carefully looking at the debt levels of the company , its cash flow and the amount of ‘ interest coverage ’ , i.e. the ratio between the cash flow and the amount of interest the company owes on its debt in a year .
Is there potential for growth ?
How likely is it that the company can maintain its position against or — even better — beat its competition ?
What are the future prospects for the company ?
Do you see potential for growth ?
Do the products and / or services offered offer quality or fulfill a need ?
Does the company adapt to the changing times ?
Can the company expand its market by selling globally ?
What is the management like ?
Does management try to do what ’s best for the company ?
Also , be aware of whether the management is qualified and competent .
Look for the accounting practices used by the company .
Is management trying to “ cook the books ” with creative money shuffling ?
One of the ways to gauge how committed the management is to the success of the company is by looking at how much stock of the company does the management own as well as recent transactions .
If you find that the management owns a large portion of the stock , and has been recently acquiring more stock , it is typically an indicator that the management believes that the company is well positioned for future growth and the stock price is attractive for investment .
Having significant ‘ skin ’ in the game also ensures that the management will be focused on making decisions that increase shareholder wealth .
When you consider the fundamentals of a company , it is important to realize that there are quantitative issues and qualitative issues to consider .
Quantitative issues are those that deal almost exclusively with numbers .
This is looking at the way money flows through the company , understanding balance sheets and income statements , and considering the assets v. liabilities of a company in cold , hard numbers terms .
The qualitative side of fundamental analysis requires that you look at the intangible aspects .
What is the character of the company ?
Qualitative fundamental analysis requires that you look at the caliber of the management team and the ethical standards upheld by the company .
Competitive advantage and the business model of the company are also qualitative factors .
Using fundamental analysis to make long - term investing decisions
Fundamental analysis is often used by buy and hold investors who want to own stock in companies that have long - term earning potential .
A company with sound fundamentals and conservative accounting is more likely to be profitable in the long run .
These are companies that make solid decisions that prepare them to survive economic down cycles and thrive afterward .
A company with good capitalization , positive cash flow , a well - thought out business model and a management that is intelligent , competent and ethical is more likely to survive and offer solid returns over time .
Of course , such companies also offer lower returns than some of the flashier companies .
You trade the possibility of astounding short - term earnings for long - term solidity and a greater degree of security .
Fundamental analysis can be used for more than just choosing stocks to invest in .
It is possible to apply the big picture analysis to wider trends in economies , industries and sectors .
Fundamental analysis can also be applied to funds , currencies and commodities .

' Say you were n't raped in jail and we 'll let you live ' , pregnant British woman told in Laos prison
A pregnant British woman arrested for heroin - smuggling in Laos has been told she must testify in court that she was not raped in prison in order to escape the firing squad .
Samantha Orobator , who is five months pregnant , was arrested in August at Wattay airport in the capital Vientiane for trying to smuggle 1.5 lb of heroin .
The 20 - year - old from South London goes on trial this week and will be asked to declare publicly that she was not raped in Phonthong prison , one of Asia ’s most squalid jails .
Samantha Orobator is facing the death penalty for heroin - smuggling
If Orobator co-operates , she will be transferred from Laos to a UK prison under a new treaty signed between the two countries on Thursday , but if not , her trial will be postponed and she will return to jail in Laos .
If she faces trial again after the birth of her child , she will not have the immunity from execution that pregnancy gives her under the Laos penal code .
A Laos government spokesman , Kenthong Nuanthasing , said : ‘ She will tell the court , otherwise she will stay here .
Nobody can guarantee that she will not face the firing squad . ’
Laos ’s leaders are sensitive to suggestions that Orobator might have been raped in jail and appear to be using her trial to try to quash the allegation .
‘ We do n’t want the outside world to blame us , ’ Nuanthasing added .
Squalid :
The prison where Samantha Orobator is being held
Asked who fathered the baby , Nuanthasing said : ‘ It is a mystery – maybe it is a baby from the sky . ’
Orobator has already written a letter declaring she was not raped and that she had not had sex while in prison , The Mail on Sunday has learned .
Although officials claim Phonthong prison is a women - only jail with female guards , staff there said it had male and female guards and separate male and female blocks .
A French former inmate who spent five months there in the Nineties said : ‘ Female prisoners were coerced into sex with promises from guards that they would get them off the death penalty , get them a shorter sentence or make life inside more comfortable for them . ’
Human rights lawyer Anna Morris flew to Vientiane last week to represent Orobator but has so far been refused permission to see her .
Fifty Years Ago , Fish Were Bigger ; Fifty Years From Now , They 'll Be Gone
A treasure trove of historical evidence finds that the fish your grand - dad claimed was " this big " may well have been
Showcasing the world ’s most expensive homes , these stunning homes are amongst the world ’s most exclusive luxury properties but with the credit crunch in full swing , selling these homes might prove a little difficult !
Check out these pads ( in no particular order ) .
Southhampton , Village Oceanfront Sanctuary New York – $ 80 m
The interior space of this 13,500 square feet home runs across four stories and contains nine bedrooms , 11 bathrooms , four powder rooms and a movie theatre .
The home is situated between a pond and the ocean giving it a unique position , and there is 1,000 feet of shore front and 1,000 feet of pond front .
Villa La Leopolda – $ 500 m
Formerly the home of Bill Gates , but now belonging to really rather rich Roman Abramovich , the Villa La Leopolda in Nice , France would set you back roughly £ 250,000,000 ( $ 1/2 a billion ) .
Its 10 acres of lush , garden - filled grounds require an astounding 50 gardeners to look after it along with the best home insurance that money can buy .
Mikhail Prokhorov , Russia ’s richest man had to pull out on the much reported deal to purchase Villa Leopolda , a $ 750 million estate in Côte d’Azur , the South of France after seeing a good portion of his amassed fortune lost in the current global recession .
The much reported sale was widely speculated over and now it seems that all the excitement has been for nothing .
But the saga continues as the current owners of the villa simply refuse to hand Prokhorov back his initial deposit of € 44 million .
Even though his lawyers are seeking a refund , they might be out of luck since the French law states that purchasers lose their deposits if they pull out after the sales agreement has been signed .
Since having set new property records with this deal last summer , the French Riviera went nuts with the news leaving many property owners excited at the prospects of selling their own nearby homes .

Antilla Mumbai ( $ 1 Billion ) – the world ’s most expensive home
Antilla Mumbai is the most expensive house in the world costing $ 1 Billion .
A custom - build 27 story towering mansion , Antilla in Mumbai is the home of the world ’s 5th richest man called Mukesh Ambani , head of Indian petro-chemical giant Reliance Industries , which is India ’s most valuable firm by market capitalisation .
1 Billion dollars !
If you could get someone to make the loan at current standard ( US ) jumbo mortgage rates , the monthly payment on a 30 - year loan would be about 12.5 million dollars .
Of course , a $ 2 billion loan is not going to go into the standard mortgage market , even for jumbo loans .
A spate of green skyscrapers have shot up in the last few years , as people learn that buildings account for more CO2 emissions than any other single source .
At the same time , we ’ve seen a rise in greenwashing by companies recognizing the market value of green and making false claims to fit the category .
In an exemplary meeting of these two trends , we have just discovered a building in progress in Mumbai that calls itself the greenest of all the buildings in the Maximum City of 13 million people .
If ever there were a literal interpretation of a deceptive green façade , this is it .
Renderings of the 27 - story Antilla building depict a highrise that could n’t be greener .
It ’s covered in foliage , with living walls enclosing all four sides , hanging gardens and green rooftop .
Just a few days ago , the architects boasted about its environmental features – primarily that the walls of plants will increase green space and combat urban heat island effect .
But look behind the green façade , and as far as we can tell , there ’s nothing else sustainable about the materials or construction .
Architecture firm Perkins +
Will does n’t include the project on their site , but this week mentioned no other green features besides the literal green .
The Antilla is being built for Reliance Industries Ltd , India ’s largest private sector enterprise ( with revenues exceeding $ 25 billion ) , and the Ambani family , who own the company .
Reliance is a petrochemical corporation whose earnings come from exploring , producing , refining and marketing oil and gas .
They are the world ’s largest producer of polyester fiber , and a runner - up for several others .
The building will stand on Mumbai ’s Altamount Road , where real estate costs as much as $ 1800 / square foot .
Although Mumbai is the densest city in the world , with almost 30,000 people per square kilometer , this 500 + foot tall building will only be 27 floors where normally a building of this height would be 60 , so that each floor can have exceptionally high ceilings , and 35,000 square feet of the entire building area will be the residential quarters of the Ambani’s .

BOGOTA , Colombia ( CNN ) --
A carrier pigeon in Colombia gave new meaning to the term " jailbird " when officials discovered that it was trying to smuggle cell phone parts into a high - security prison , a news report said .
The carrier pigeon has Colombian authorities concerned there may be a new way to smuggle goods into prisons .
The bird was carrying the contraband on its back in a little suitcase , the Caracol news outlet said Monday .
Heavy rains prevented the plumed smuggler from entering the prison in north central Colombia , said the police chief in Boyaca state , Juan Carlos Polania .
Authorities are worried , Polania said , because this is a newly discovered way of smuggling goods into the prison , and officials have no way of combating it .
They also are wondering whether any of the many pigeons that live in or near the prison are pulling double duty .
As for the miscreant bird , he was taken to an animal shelter in the city of Soraca .

A man who opened fire at an oil training institute in Azerbaijan on Thursday killed 12 people and injured 13 before turning the gun on himself , officials said .
Police were not releasing details about the shooting at Baku's Azerbaijan State Oil Academy , which is recognized as a major international training centre for oil industry specialists .
But the country 's Interior Ministry and state prosecutors released a joint statement on Thursday that said the suspect , Georgian citizen Farda Gadyrov , 29 , entered the building , climbing five floors and shooting everyone he encountered .
Gadyrov then shot and killed himself with the gun , a semi-automatic Makarov pistol , when he saw police approaching , the statement said .
Thirteen people , including the gunmen , were killed in the incident and 13 were wounded , the Health Ministry said .
Two foreign citizens from Syria and Sudan were among the dead , a police source told Reuters .
Government officials said they do not believe there was a political motive behind the attack .
Neither police nor the joint statement issued on Thursday speculated on a possible motive .
Witnesses said the gunman walked the hallways of the academy just after classes began at about 9 a.m. local time and aimed his gun at the heads of anyone within range .
" We were in an exam , we heard gunshots , " Turkish student Bekir Belek told CNN - Turk .
" We went out of the classroom in panic and saw a gunman opening fire on everyone .
Three of my friends were shot . "
Shooting causes chaos
There were conflicting witness reports in local media about the number of gunmen involved in the incident .
But officials confirmed it was only one man .
Televised images showed students leaving the building and helping others who appeared to be injured .
Other images showed victims lying face down inside the academy 's corridors .
" There were bodies at each floor , " said Ibrahim Kar , another Turkish student who was transferred to hospital .
Roads were closed in the area and special police forces were sent in to surround the building , the Interior Ministry said .
Azerbaijan is a mainly Muslim former Soviet republic with a population of about 8.3 million on the shores of the Caspian Sea , where it holds vast reserves of oil and gas .
" I feel deep regret , and consider this a terrible incident for our society , " Education Minister Misir Mardanov told reporters .

There are plenty of reasons to avoid bottled water : contamination and disease issues , limited freshwater supply –and now energy concerns .
Researchers Peter Gleick and Heather Cooley at the Pacific Institute in Oakland , CA have completed the first comprehensive , peer - reviewed energy analysis of bottled water , and the results are n’t pretty .
Producing just one bottle of water requires between 5.2 and 10.2 million joules of energy per liter – 2,000 times the energy needed to produce tap water , which uses only 0.0005 joules per liter .
The numbers are even more disturbing on a large scale .
US consumers bought over 33 billion liters of bottled water in 2007 , requiring 32 - 53 million barrels of oil , or one - third of one percent of total US energy consumption .
That ’s a lot of oil wasted on what we can get for free out of the tap .
Bottled - water lovers who just ca n’t wean themselves off the energy - sucking stuff should at least stick to locally - produced brands , according to Gleick and Cooley .
For purified water distributed within Los Angeles , 1.4 million joules per liter of energy are used for transportation .
In comparison , spring water shipped from Fiji to LA requires 4 million joules per liter , and spring water sent from France to LA uses 5.8 million joules per liter .
Still unconvinced ?
25 percent of bottled water is actually just tap water in a bottle , and oftentimes is n’t even treated .
And tap water in the US has more stringent treatment standards than bottled water anyway .
Bottled water companies have reason to be worried .
Sales have been spiraling downward in the past few years–largely thanks to environmental and health concerns .

Leaders from business , labor and civil society call on governments to demand greater transparency from companies in this time of crisis
Mar. 10 / CSRwire / - AMSTERDAM , 10 March 2009 - Global leaders from business , labor and civil society today declared their belief that the lack of transparency in the existing system for corporate reporting has failed its stakeholders .
In issuing The Amsterdam Declaration on Transparency and Reporting , Board Members of the Global Reporting Initiative called on governments to introduce policies requiring companies to address publicly environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) factors .
The declaration states that the root causes of the current economic crisis would have been moderated by a global transparency and accountability system based on the exercise of due diligence and the public reporting of ESG performance .
It calls on governments to take leadership in rebuilding a revitalized and resilient economic system through :
Introducing policy requiring companies to report on ESG factors or publicly explain why they have not done so .
Requiring ESG reporting by their public bodies – in particular : state owned companies , government pension funds and public investment agencies .
Integrating sustainability reporting within the emerging global financial regulatory framework being developed by leaders of the G20 .
Professor Mervyn King , Chair of The Board of Directors at GRI , Chair of the UN Global Corporate Governance Committee and former Judge on the Supreme Court of South Africa said : " As we seek to rebuild our economic system following the financial crisis , transparency on economic , social and governance issues from our companies must be paramount .
Regulators , financial markets , companies and civil society will need comprehensive information on which to assess strategic risks and opportunities . "
The signatories to the declaration emphasize that the focus on the current financial crisis threatens to mask the sustainability crisis which itself poses an even greater risk to our economies and societies .
" Only through a new reporting model , which takes account of forward looking data , as well as previous corporate financial data , will we be able to work out how companies are positioned to meet these future challenges , " added Ernst Ligteringen , Chief Executive of The Global Reporting Initiative .
Notes to Editors
1. Full text of The Amsterdam Declaration on Transparency and Reporting
We , The Board of The Global Reporting Initiative ( GRI ) believe that the lack of transparency in the existing system for corporate reporting has failed its stakeholders .
While we recognize that certain governments have shown leadership on corporate sustainability disclosure , we call on all governments to extend and strengthen the global regime of sustainability reporting .
In particular , assumptions about the adequacy of voluntary reporting must be re-examined .
We , The Board of GRI , conclude that :
The root causes of the current economic crisis would have been moderated by a global transparency and accountability system based on the exercise of due diligence and the public reporting of environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) performance .
The profound loss of trust in key institutions is best addressed by the adoption of a global reporting framework that enhances transparency and is informed by the legitimate interest of all key sectors of society .
A revitalized and resilient economic system will only be sustained if it accounts for the full costs and value of ESG activity .
Introducing policy requiring companies to report on ESG factors or publicly explain why they have not done so .
Requiring ESG reporting by their public bodies – in particular : state owned companies , government pension funds and public investment agencies .
Integrating sustainability reporting within the emerging global financial regulatory framework being developed by leaders of the G20 .
Therefore the Board of GRI calls on governments to take leadership by : Beyond this we emphasize that the focus on the current financial crisis threatens to mask the century 's defining sustainability crisis which itself poses an even greater risk to our economies and societies .

3. About The Global Reporting Initiative
The Global Reporting Initiative has pioneered the development of the world ’s most widely used sustainability reporting framework and is committed to its continuous improvement and application worldwide .
This framework sets out the principles and indicators that organizations can use to measure and report their economic , environmental , and social performance .
www.globalreporting.org
Introduced on March 17 , 2009 , S. 624 – Senator Paul Simon Water for the World Act of 2009 commits the United States to ensuring safe , affordable , and sustainable water and sanitation to 100 million people by 2015 .
According to Water Advocates :
More than 1.1 billion people lack access to safe water and 2.6 billion people lack even basic sanitary facilities .
Â
Diseases caused by unsafe drinking water and inadequate sanitation remain humanityâ€™s most serious public health threat , causing 80 % of the sicknesses in developing countries and annually killing between 2 and 5 million people , mainly young children .
Lack of water and sanitation undermines the sustainability of other critical needs , including education , economic development , nutrition , environmental health and gender equality .
Although 100 million is only a small percentage of the worldwide need , the Water for the World Act of 2009 is the U.S. response to the Millennium Development Goals for water and sanitation .
This bipartisan legislation would create an â€œOffice of Waterâ€ at USAID headed by a â€ œDirector for Safe Water and Sanitationâ€  .
Â
This department would be responsible for implementing the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 . Â
From the text of the Paul Simon World Water Act of 2009 :
(6) The effects of climate change are expected to produce severe consequences for water availability and resource management in the future , with 2,800,000,000 people in more than 48 countries expected to face severe and chronic water shortages by 2025 .
The World Water Act of 2009 would “ increase the capacity of the Department of State to address international issues regarding safe water , sanitation , integrated river basin management , and other international water programs . ”
Â
It recognizes that clean water is essential for peace and security around the world .
Â
The bill has been referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations .
A Contextual Analysis of the December 2008 UN Report
Since Rwanda and Uganda invaded the Congo in 1996 , they have pursued a plan to appropriate the wealth of Eastern Congo either directly or through proxy forces .
The December 2008 United Nations report is the latest in a series of U.N. reports dating from 2001 that clearly documents the systematic looting and appropriation of Congolese resources by Rwanda and Uganda , two of Washington and London ’s staunchest allies in Africa .
However , in the wake of the December 2008 report , which clearly documents Rwanda ’s support of destabilizing proxy forces inside the Congo , a series of stunning proposals and actions have been presented which all appear to be an attempt to cover up or bury the damning U.N. report on the latest expression of Rwanda ’s aggression against the Congolese people .
The earliest proposal came from Herman Cohen , former assistant secretary of state for African affairs under George Herbert Walker Bush .
He proposed that Rwanda be rewarded for its well documented looting of Congo ’s wealth by being a part of a Central and / or East African free trade zone whereby Rwanda would keep its ill - gotten gains .
French President Nicholas Sarkozy would not be outdone ; he also brought his proposal off the shelf , which argues for essentially the same scheme of rewarding Rwanda for its 12 - year war booty from the Congo .
Two elements are at the core of both proposals .
One is the legitimization of the economic annexation of the Congo by Rwanda , which for all intents and purposes represents the status quo .
And two is basically the laying of the foundation for the balkanization of the Congo or the outright political annexation of Eastern Congo by Rwanda .
Both Sarkozy and Cohen have moved with lightning speed past the Dec. 12 , 2008 , United Nations report to make proposals that avoid the core issues revealed in the report .
The U.N. report reaffirms what Congolese intellectuals , scholars and victims have been saying for over a decade in regard to Rwanda ’s role as the main catalyst for the biblical scale death and misery in the Congo .
The Ugandan and Rwandan invasions of 1996 and 1998 have triggered the deaths of nearly 6 million Congolese .
The United Nations says it is the deadliest conflict in the world since World War II .
The report “ found evidence that the Rwandan authorities have been complicit in the recruitment of soldiers , including children , have facilitated the supply of military equipment , and have sent officers and units from the Rwandan Defense Forces ” to the DRC .
The support is for the National Congress for the Defense of the People , or CNDP , formerly led by self - proclaimed Gen. Laurent Nkunda .
The report also shows that the CNDP is sheltering a war criminal wanted by the International Criminal Court , Gen. Jean Bosco Ntaganda .
The CNDP has used Rwanda as a rear base for fundraising meetings and bank accounts , and Uganda is once more implicated as Nkunda has met regularly with embassies in both Kigali and Kampala .
Also , Uganda is accepting illegal CNDP immigration papers .
Earlier U.N. reports said that Kagame and Museveni are the mafia dons of Congo ’s exploitation .
This has not changed in any substantive way .
The report implicates Tribert Rujugiro Ayabatwa , a close advisor to Paul Kagame , president of Rwanda .
Rujugiro is the founder of the Rwandan Investment Group .
This is not the first time he has been named by the United Nations as one of the individuals contributing to the conflict in the Congo .
In April 2001 , he was identified as Tibere Rujigiro in the U.N. Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as one of the figures illegally exploiting Congo ’s wealth .
His implication this time comes in financial contributions to CNDP and appropriation of land .
This brings to light the organizations he is a part of , which include but are not limited to the Rwanda Development Board , the Rwandan Investment Group , of which he is the founder , and Kagame ’s Presidential Advisory Council .
They have members as notable as Rev. Rick Warren , business tycoon Joe Ritchie , former British Prime Minister Tony Blair , Scott Ford of Alltell , Dr. Clet Niyikiza of GlaxoSmithKline , former U.S. president Bill Clinton and many more .
These connections provide some insight into why Rwanda has been able to commit and support remarkable atrocities in the Congo without receiving even a reprimand in spite of the fact that two European courts have charged their top leadership with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
It is only recently that two European nations , Sweden and the Netherlands , have decided to withhold aid from Rwanda as a result of their aggression against the Congolese people .
The report shows that the Congolese soldiers have also given support to the FDLR and other armed groups to fight against the aggression of Rwanda ’s CNDP proxy .
One important distinction must be made in this regard .
It appears that the FDLR support comes more from individual Congolese soldiers as opposed to overall government support .
The Congolese government is not supporting the FDLR in incursions into Rwanda ; however , the Rwandan government is in fact supporting rebel groups inside Congo .
The Congolese population is the victim of the CNDP , FDLR and the Congolese military .
The United Nations report is a predictable outgrowth of previous reports produced by the U.N. since 2001 .
It reflects the continued appropriation of the land , theft of Congo ’s resources , and continuous human rights abuses caused by Rwanda and Uganda .
An apparent aim of these spasms is to create facts on the ground – land appropriation , theft of cattle and other assets – to consolidate CNDP / Rwandan economic integration into Rwanda .
Herman Cohen ’s “ Can Africa Trade Its Way to Peace ? ” in the New York Times reflects the disastrous policies that favor profits over people .
In his article , the former lobbyist for Mobutu and Kabila ’s government in the United States and former assistant secretary of state for Africa from 1989 to 1993 argues , “ Having controlled the Kivu provinces for 12 years , Rwanda will not relinquish access to resources that constitute a significant percentage of its gross national product . ”
He adds , “ The normal flow of trade from eastern Congo is to Indian Ocean ports rather than the Atlantic Ocean , which is more than a thousand miles away . ”
Continuing his argument , he believes that “ the free movement of people would empty the refugee camps and would allow the densely populated countries of Rwanda and Burundi to supply needed labor to Congo and Tanzania . ”
Cohen ’s first mistake in providing solutions to the conflict is to look at the conflict as a humanitarian crisis that can be solved by economic means .
Uganda and Rwanda are the aggressors .
Aggressors should not define for the Congo what is best , but rather it is for the Congo to define what it has to offer to its neighbor .
A lasting solution is to stop the silent annexation of Eastern Congo .
The International Court of Justice has already weighed in on this matter when it ruled in 2005 that Congo is entitled to $ 10 billion in reparations due to Uganda ’s looting of Congo ’s natural resources and the commission of human rights abuses in the Congo .
It would have in all likelihood ruled in the same fashion against Rwanda ; however , Rwanda claimed to be outside the jurisdiction of the court .
The United States and Great Britain ’s implication is becoming very clear .
These two great powers consider Rwanda and Uganda their staunch allies and , some would argue , client states .
These two countries have received millions of dollars of military aid , which in turn they use in Congo to cause destruction and death .
Rwandan President Paul Kagame is a former student at the U.S. military training base Fort Leavenworth and Yoweri Museveni ’s son , Lt. Gen. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni , graduated from the same U.S. military college in the summer of 2008 .
Both the United States and Great Britain should follow the lead of the Dutch and Swedish governments , who have suspended their financial support to Rwanda .
With U.S. and British taxpayers ’ support , we now see an estimated 6 million people dead in Congo , hundreds of thousands of women systematically raped as an instrument of war and millions displaced .
A political solution will resolve the crisis , and part of that requires pressure on Rwanda in spite of Rwanda ’s recent so - called “ house arrest ” of Laurent Nkunda .
African institutions such as the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) and the African Union are primed to be more engaged in the Congo issue .
Considering Congo ’s importance to Africa , it is remarkable that they have been so anemic in regard to the Congo crisis for so long .
Rwanda ’s leader , Paul Kagame , cannot feel as secure or be as arrogant as he has been in the past .
One of his top aides was arrested in Germany as a result of warrants issued by a French court and there is almost global consensus that pressure must be put on him to cease his support of the destabilization of the Congo and its resultant humanitarian catastrophe .
In addition to pressure on Kagame , the global community should support the following policies :
1. Initiate an international tribunal on the Congo .
2. Work with the Congolese to implement a national reconciliation process ; this could be a part of the international tribunal .
3 . Work with the Congolese to assure that those who have committed war crimes or crimes against humanity are brought to justice .
4 . Hold accountable corporations that are benefiting from the suffering and deaths in the Congo .
5 . Make the resolution of the Congo crisis a top international priority .
Living is a right , not a privilege , and Congolese deaths must be honored by due process of the law .
As the implication of the many parties in this conflict becomes clear , we should start firmly acknowledging that the conflict is a resource war waged by U.S. and British allies .
We call upon people of good will once again to advocate for the Congolese by following the prescriptions we have been outlining to end the conflict and start the new path to peace , harmony and an end to the exploitation of Congo ’s wealth and devastation of its peoples .
Day runs courses for amateur and professional cooks in an old farmhouse on the edge of the Lake District .
There are two kitchens , one modern , one historic .
A rediscovered local delicacy , a juniper - smoked mutton leg , hangs from a beam .
Dressers , tables and walls hold a collection of about 400 moulds , some for jellies but also ones for bavarois and other mousses .
In the centre of the main room is a magnificent fireplace flanked by Day ’s collection of spits , including a clockwork contraption he made using old pictures for reference that rings a bell when it needs winding up .
This is no dusty display of antiques .
Every­thing is positioned for use .
Day takes great delight in the way his 18th - century sorbetière can make ices twice as fast as a modern machine ( admittedly with more than twice the effort ) .
The transition threatens to be a time of great tension : there are already tribal wars in Africa , disturbances in many places including rioting in Greece .
Urban conditions will become especially difficult .
But now we face the dawn of the Second Half of the Age of Oil when supply declines from natural depletion , meaning that debt goes bad ( as is already happening ) and the economy contracts .
Today 's oil supply support 6.7 billion people , but by 2050 the supply will be enough to support no more than about 2.5 billion in their present way of life .
So the challenges of using less and finding other energy sources is great .
In short , the population only doubled over the first 17 centuries of the last millennium .
But then came coal followed by oil and gas , and the population increased six - fold .
These new energy sources , especially oil , the easiest , allowed the rapid expansion of industry , transport , trade and agriculture allowing the economy to expand greatly .
It was accompanied by the growth of financial capital as banks lent more than they had on deposit , confident that Tomorrow 's Expansion was collateral for Today 's Debt .

We do have a solar panel on the roof , providing hot water from about May to October .

NJ : Do you think the media are playing the issue down ?
Has there been much coverage of the issue in the mainstream media ?
Any ideas as to why ?
CC : The media is now taking a serious interest : a trail of journalists and TV crews have been here over the past few years .
The BBC and no less than Korean TV was here recently .
There are of course vested interests ( BP for example ) keen to suppress Peak Oil but I think the word is out .
NJ : How about governments ?
Are they playing the issue down , and if so , what examples can you give ?
Do you think any governments are approaching Peak Oil correctly ?
Who ?
CC : The position of governments is changing .
They are heavily influenced by classical economics and badly advised by such practitioners for whom finding oil is just a matter of investment .
The International Energy Agency is the OECD watchdog , although in practice more of a consumers lobby ( not wanting OPEC to know its strength ) .
Ten years ago internally it recognised that peak oil would arrive around 2010 , but issued no more than a coded message .
Now as Peak Oil arrives it changes its tune , for fear of losing credibility , and begins to admit to it under the slogan let 's leave oil before it leaves us .
I happen to know the Irish Minister , who understands the position perfectly and is trying to prepare , but he tells me that the political obstacles are very great .
It is promising that Obama has renewables high on his agenda and seems to recognise that the attempted conquest of Iraq 's oil failed .
Oil discovery in Britain peaked in the 1970s and should have alerted the government that the inevitable corresponding peak of production would follow , but Mrs Thatcher believed in the free market , and exploited the resources as fast as possible , which accelerated depletion .
Britain exported its surplus at low prices but now faces rising imports at high prices .
Russia now seems to be aware of its power by controlling Europe 's gas supply , and will likely try to conserve what is left for its own use rather than export , which makes sense .
It is a big subject , and does not exactly give one much confidence in government .
NJ : It is sometimes said that there are billions of barrels of oil reserves locked up in Canada ’s tar sands .
Can you say anything about these reserves with respect to peak oil ?
What are the challenges faced when bringing this oil to market ?
CC :
The resource in the ground of tarsand in Canada and elsewhere is huge , but extraction is slow and costly , yielding a low or even negative net energy return .
My guess is that oil prices in the future will range in the $ 50 - 100 range as higher prices would dampen demand by economic recession .
If so this is a constraint on developing tarsands ( some projects are said to be viable only at $ 90 + ) ... and indeed restrain the development of renewable energy ) .

NJ : The discovery of oil peaked some 40 years ago – how much oil are we discovering now and what potential is there for further discoveries -- new , significant discoveries ?
Does the Arctic represent another Saudi Arabia ?
How about the Antarctic ?
CC : It is difficult to get good information on recent discovery , but my best estimate is that it is running in the 5 - 10 billion barrel a year range .
The accessible world has now been thoroughly explored , such that all the major productive provinces and large fields within them have been found .
Attention now turns to the deepwater and Polar regions .
I think that the main deepwater areas have also already been found : they depend on very exceptional geological conditions as most of the oceans are definitely non-prospective .
I do not entertain great hopes for the Polar regions because I think they are generally deficient in effective source rock , and that seal integrity has been impaired by vertical movements of the crust due to the weight of fluctuating ice caps .
There are a few freak occurrences , such as Prudhoe Bay in Alaska , but generally Polar seems to be a gas - prone domain , with sniffs of encouragement that eventually disappoint .
It is unlikely to have any material impact on Peak Oil .
NJ : How familiar do you think the senior staff of Western oil majors are with the concept of peak oil ?
Do they see it as a serious problem either for their business or the wider global economy ?
CC : In earlier years , major oil companies did tend to be run by people with exploration experience , for whom peak oil has long been evident ( Harry Warman once Exploration Manager of BP was one of the first to publish on it ) , but now most are run by financiers and engineers , who lack the deeper resource insights .
But generally I think they understand .
The Seven major companies are now reduced to four by merger , which is a sign of contraction , and they are selling off subsidiary refineries and marketing chains , evidently recognising that falling supply will give downstream over - capacity .
But remember that the job of managers is to sing to the Stock Market to protect their shareholders ' interests under the present system whereby the merits of a firm dividend have surrendered to speculative movements on the Market , which is largely a public relations exercise , as these brokers can have little real understanding of the businesses in which that take positions ( " investment " is hardly the word ) .
It is simply not the job of oil company managers to concern themselves with global issues .
But that said they do begin to hint and half admit to the obvious truth : Total and Chevron are probably the most forthright , with BP being the least .
NJ : How does oil form , when did it form , where does it form - what does this tell us about the likelihood of finding significant new oil in the middle of the Atlantic ... or in the Arctic ?
CC :
The bulk of the world 's oil was formed under special conditions of global warming 90 and 150 million years ago .
Algae proliferated in warm sunlit tropical waters , and the hot surface water prevented normal circulation such that stagnant anoxic conditions occurred at depth .
The algal organic remains were accordingly preserved in rifts .
On burial to about 2000 meters , it was cooked enough to be converted into oil , which then began to move upwards .
Much escaped or was dissipated , but some was trapped at the top of geological structures ( arch - like anticlines or against faults ) .
In addition to these two main epochs there were other local occurrences of little global significance .
Naturally , the older the source - rock the greater the chance of loss over geological time .

NJ : What is your opinion on reserve growth ? "
CC : Assessing the size of an oilfield early in its life poses no particular scientific challenge , although it is naturally subject to a degree of uncertainty .
Reporting its size is another matter .
The oil companies were subject to strict Stock Exchange rules designed to prevent fraudulent exaggeration while smiling on under - reporting as commercial prudence .
Accordingly the major companies reported only as much as they needed to deliver a satisfactory financial outcome .
The resulting upward revisions gave a comforting but misleading image of reserve growth .
Those days are however substantially over as the giant fields offering the main scope for upward revision mature .
OPEC for its part greatly exaggerated in the 1980s when they were vying with each other for quota based on what they reported as reserves .
The industry has developed various technologies ( steam , nitrogen , CO2 injection and horizontal drilling plus sophisticated seismic to map the reservoirs in detail ) which can increase the recovery , and hence give reserve growth .
But the scope for doing so could easily have been foreseen early in the life of the field , even if it was not normal to report it .
NJ : At the ASPO meeting after the Barcelona conference you were talking about retiring from the newsletter at the end of 2008 - and after around 1000 items .
The future plan was for individual national ASPO chapters to produce newsletters , or submit items for someone else to correlate .
Is that still going ahead ?
CC : Yes , I am a bit undecided about the future of the ASPO Newsletter .
Obviously I can't keep doing it for ever , and also the main message has been delivered , so I find myself touching more and more on political subjects on which I lack any expertise .
ASPO has evolved as a loose organisation lacking any normal management or cohesion or rules , but that is a good thing as the different entities can do whatever is appropriate and possible in their own countries .
I suppose in one sense the Newsletter does hold them together giving a certain common purpose .
One model might be to rotate the overall direction ( including the newsletter ) , but in practice I doubt if that will happen .
In one sense its mission has been accomplished as dealing with life in the Second Half of the Oil Age when everything is in decline calls for very different approaches .
NJ : Are we progressing towards implementing technologies to utilize alternative energy sources at a fast enough rate to prevent an economic collapse , or at least to minimize the impact the advent of Peak Oil is having / will have on the global economy ?
CC : I doubt that renewable energies will ever replace oil and gas sufficiently to maintain the past order of things or still less allow economic growth to continue .
They are of course greatly needed for the surviving communities .
My own preference is tidal energy to tap the massive regular lateral flows of water .
Apparently they can build funnel - like walls on the sea bed forcing the tides to speed up through the constriction , and turn a rotor , generating electricity .
But apparently such schemes did not compete with cheap oil and gas so far .
There is of course massive scope for using less energy : turning off all those loudspeakers and TV screens in public places would help .
NJ : What effect do the new technologies have on the projections for when production will peak ?
CC : I do n't think new technologies will have any impact on the date of peak , which I estimate to have been passed in 2008 ( " all liquids " ) , but they can of course ameliorate the subsequent decline .
I think most of the necessary technologies are already well known , so the issue is more about applying them than inventing a magic wand .
NJ : There is a lot of debate about why oil prices were so high during this summer , why they 've dropped so quickly since then .
What is the explanation for this ?
Were high prices due to " speculation " as many have argued or was it supply and demand , or both , or something else ?
CC : I think that Regular Conventional oil peaked in 2005 and prices began to rise , although the shortfall was partly made up by costly tarsands and deepwater production .
The rising price trend attracted the interest of the traders who started buying futures and so forth .
It might also have made sense for the industry to keep the tanks full , watching them appreciate in value .
But eventually the rising price had an adverse impact on the real economy and the shrewd traders started to unload , selling short on the futures market .
The industry too might have started draining its tanks .
But perhaps more important was the flood of petrodollars that the high prices delivered to the governments and royal families of the Middle East , where it still costs $ 10 - 15 to produce oil .
They probably sent the surplus to western banks who promptly loaned it out on ever less sure collateral .
The petrodollars were not really money in the sense of representing work or barter , but simply profiteering from shortage .
The whole flimsy financial edifice has now crashed , and some of the sillier governments are now pumping yet more fictional money into the system to encourage new consumption .
Such policies may briefly succeed , but will only make the subsequent crash worse .
We enter a new world , as the principal energy that drove the anomalous past two centuries heads into decline from natural depletion .
This is not necessarily a doomsday message .
I have known many simple people in different parts of the world who smiled and laughed not being part of the consumer society .
There are encouraging signs .
A BBC film crew who was here recently told me that they had become so convinced of the Peak Oil issue , which they had studied to make their programme , that they had decided to quit the BBC and buy a small farm in the west of England on which to build a simple sustainable future .
That was most encouraging , I thought .

Photojournalist Neil 's slideshow , which looks in part at Peak Oil , can be viewed here .
First , there is no drug that will magically give you a craving for other drugs you have never had .
That is a belief in witchcraft , not science .
Hemp was George Washington 's primary crop , and a secondary crop for Thomas Jefferson , so hemp has been around in America for a long time , without apparently causing much destruction in society .
Each sailing ship carried several tons of hemp in its rope and sails , so cultivation of hemp was a major industry .
Even though cannabis was widely grown , there were no allegations that it led to harder drugs .
In 1910 , they believed that the certain steppingstone to opiate addiction was " eating Mexicanized food " .
The fundamental idea comes from America 's puritanical history .
It is the idea that pleasure is sinful , and small pleasures lead to cravings for larger pleasures .
In this example , those who crave spicy food will inevitably crave larger pleasures , such as opium .
In the 1920s , some states outlawed marijuana because of the belief that heroin addiction would lead to the use of marijuana - just the opposite of the modern myth .
Cannabis had been widely known and used in many medicinal compounds for hundreds of years , so there was ample evidence in the 1930s to know whether there was a connection between marijuana and harder drugs .
In 1937 , Harry Anslinger , head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics , testified before Congress that there was no connection at all between marijuana and heroin .
In the testimony for the Marihuana Tax Act he said :
ANSLINGER : This drug is not being used by those who have been using heroin and morphine .
It is being used by a different class , by a mostly younger group of people .
The age of the morphine and heroin addict is increasing all the time , whereas the marihuana smoker is quite young .
MR. DINGELL : I am just wondering whether the marihuana addict graduates into a heroin , an opium , or a cocaine user .
MR. ANSLINGER : No , sir ; I have not heard of a case of that kind .
I think it is an entirely different class .
The marihuana addict does not go in that direction .
MR. DINGELL : And the hardened narcotic user does not fall back on marihuana .
MR. ANSLINGER : No , sir : he would not touch that .
The reason marijuana had to be outlawed , he said , was because it caused insanity , criminality , and death .
One example he gave was of two young lovers who became so crazed after smoking a joint that they eloped and got married .
Marijuana causes people to become so crazy that they get married .
The other reasons he gave were no more sensible .
The hemp industry representatives who testified were uniformly surprised and mystified to hear that a dangerous drug could be made from this widespread and common crop .
The American Medical Association testified that they knew of no evidence that marijuana was a dangerous drug .
( 2,3,4 )
The US Government encouraged farmers to grow hemp during World War II , because it was vital to the country 's war effort .
There were no claims at the time that marijuana would lead to harder drugs .
( 2,3,10 )
In 1944 , the La Guardia Committee Report on Marihuana confirmed Mr. Anslinger 's statement -- there was no connection at all between marijuana and heroin .
( 6 )
In 1951 , the story changed .
Harry Anslinger was testifying for the Boggs
Act about why he needed more money and men to enforce the marijuana laws .
Just before he testified , the head of the Federal addiction research program testified that they knew for certain that all of the reasons that had been given for outlawing marijuana in 1937 were entirely bogus .
They knew for certain that marijuana did not cause insanity , criminality and death .
Anslinger was left with no reason for tougher laws so he made up -- on the spot , with not a shred of evidence -- the assertion that marijuana is the certain stepping stone to heroin addiction .
He directly contradicted his own testimony from 1937 .
It has been the basis of US marijuana policy ever since .
( 2,3 )
Since that time , the Federal drug enforcement officials have tried to support this myth with the idea that most heroin addicts started with marijuana , and statistics which seem to show that marijuana users are more likely to have used cocaine .
The first assertion would get a failing grade in any freshman Logic class .
The second can be explained by the fact that people who engage in one risk - taking behavior are likely to engage in other risk - taking behaviors .
It , too , would earn a failing grade in freshman Logic .
In 1970 , the Canadian Government did their largest study ever of the subject , and found no connection between marijuana and heroin .
In 1972 , the US Government did their largest study ever of the subject , and found no connection between marijuana and heroin .
This was also the conclusion of the largest study ever done by Consumers Union , published the same year .
Every major study of the marijuana laws in the last 100 years has concluded that the only connection between marijuana and heroin is that they are both prohibited and , therefore , sold in the same black market .
The most recent study of the subject was the report of the US Institute of Medicine on medical marijuana .
They reported :
Instead it is the legal status of marijuana that makes it a gateway drug .
In other words , the people who support prohibition are using the bad effects of prohibition as justification for prohibition .
The conclusion of all the research is that we have a " gateway drug policy " .
It is the laws that create the problem .

I. The Poverty of Attention
I ’m going to pause here , right at the beginning of my riveting article about attention , and ask you to please get all of your precious 21st - century distractions out of your system now .
Check the score of the Mets game ; text your sister that pun you just thought of about her roommate ’s new pet lizard ( “ iguana hold yr hand LOL get it like Beatles ” ) ; refresh your work e-mail , your home e-mail , your school e-mail ; upload pictures of yourself reading this paragraph to your “ me reading magazine articles ” Flickr photostream ; and alert the fellow citizens of whatever Twittertopia you happen to frequent that you will be suspending your digital presence for the next twenty minutes or so ( I know that seems drastic :
Tell them you ’re having an appendectomy or something and are about to lose consciousness ) .
Good .
Now : Count your breaths .
Close your eyes .
Do whatever it takes to get all of your neurons lined up in one direction .
Above all , resist the urge to fixate on the picture , right over there , of that weird scrambled guy typing .
Do not speculate on his ethnicity ( German - Venezuelan ? ) or his backstory ( Witness Protection Program ? ) or the size of his monitor .
Go ahead and cover him with your hand if you need to .
There .
Does n’t that feel better ?
Now it ’s just you and me , tucked like fourteenth - century Zen masters into this sweet little nook of pure mental focus .
( Seriously , stop looking at him .
I ’m over here . )
Over the last several years , the problem of attention has migrated right into the center of our cultural attention .
We hunt it in neurology labs , lament its decline on op - ed pages , fetishize it in grassroots quality - of - life movements , diagnose its absence in more and more of our children every year , cultivate it in yoga class twice a week , harness it as the engine of self - help empires , and pump it up to superhuman levels with drugs originally intended to treat Alzheimer ’s and narcolepsy .
Everyone still pays some form of attention all the time , of course — it ’s basically impossible for humans not to — but the currency in which we pay it , and the goods we get in exchange , have changed dramatically .
Back in 1971 , when the web was still twenty years off and the smallest computers were the size of delivery vans , before the founders of Google had even managed to get themselves born , the polymath economist Herbert A. Simon wrote maybe the most concise possible description of our modern struggle :
“ What information consumes is rather obvious :
It consumes the attention of its recipients .
Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention , and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it . ”
As beneficiaries of the greatest information boom in the history of the world , we are suffering , by Simon ’s logic , a correspondingly serious poverty of attention .
If the pundits clogging my RSS reader can be trusted ( the ones I check up on occasionally when I do n’t have any new e-mail ) , our attention crisis is already chewing its hyperactive way through the very foundations of Western civilization .
Google is making us stupid , multitasking is draining our souls , and the “ dumbest generation ” is leading us into a “ dark age ” of bookless “ power browsing . ”
Adopting the Internet as the hub of our work , play , and commerce has been the intellectual equivalent of adopting corn syrup as the center of our national diet , and we ’ve all become mentally obese .
Formerly well - rounded adults are forced to MacGyver worldviews out of telegraphic blog posts , bits of YouTube videos , and the first nine words of Times editorials .
Schoolkids spread their attention across 30 different programs at once and interact with each other mainly as sweatless avatars .
( One recent study found that American teenagers spend an average of 6.5 hours a day focused on the electronic world , which strikes me as a little low ; in South Korea , the most wired nation on earth , young adults have actually died from exhaustion after multiday online - gaming marathons . )
We are , in short , terminally distracted .
And distracted , the alarmists will remind you , was once a synonym for insane .
( Shakespeare : “ poverty hath distracted her . ” )
This doomsaying strikes me as silly for two reasons .
First , conservative social critics have been blowing the apocalyptic bugle at every large - scale tech - driven social change since Socrates ’ famous complaint about the memory - destroying properties of that newfangled technology called “ writing . ”
( A complaint we remember , not incidentally , because it was written down . )
And , more practically , the virtual horse has already left the digital barn .
It ’s too late to just retreat to a quieter time .
Our jobs depend on connectivity .
Our pleasure - cycles — no trivial matter — are increasingly tied to it .
Information rains down faster and thicker every day , and there are plenty of non-moronic reasons for it to do so .
The question , now , is how successfully we can adapt .

Although attention is often described as an organ system , it ’s not the sort of thing you can pull out and study like a spleen .
It ’s a complex process that shows up all over the brain , mingling inextricably with other quasi-mystical processes like emotion , memory , identity , will , motivation , and mood .
Psychologists have always had to track attention secondhand .
Before the sixties , they measured it through easy - to - monitor senses like vision and hearing ( if you listen to one voice in your right ear and another in your left , how much information can you absorb from either side ? ) , then eventually graduated to PET scans and EEGs and electrodes and monkey brains .
Only in the last ten years — thanks to neuroscientists and their functional MRIs — have we been able to watch the attending human brain in action , with its coordinated storms of neural firing , rapid blood surges , and oxygen flows .
This has yielded all kinds of fascinating insights — for instance , that when forced to multitask , the overloaded brain shifts its processing from the hippocampus ( responsible for memory ) to the striatum ( responsible for rote tasks ) , making it hard to learn a task or even recall what you ’ve been doing once you ’re done .
When I reach David Meyer , one of the world ’s reigning experts on multitasking , he is feeling alert against all reasonable odds .
He has just returned from India , where he was discussing the nature of attention at a conference with the Dalai Lama ( Meyer gave a keynote speech arguing that Buddhist monks multitask during meditation ) , and his trip home was hellish : a canceled flight , an overnight taxi on roads so rough it took thirteen hours to go 200 miles .
This is his first full day back in his office at the University of Michigan , where he directs the Brain , Cognition , and Action Laboratory — a basement space in which finger - tapping , card - memorizing , tone - identifying subjects help Meyer pinpoint exactly how much information the human brain can handle at once .
He ’s been up since 3 a.m. and has by now goosed his attention several times with liquid stimulants : a couple of cups of coffee , some tea .
“ It does wonders , ” he says .
My interaction with Meyer takes place entirely via the technology of distraction .
We scheduled and rescheduled our appointment , several times , by e-mail .
His voice is now projecting , tinnily , out of my cell phone ’s speaker and into the microphone of my digital recorder , from which I will download it , as soon as we ’re done , onto my laptop , which I currently have open on my desk in front of me , with several windows spread across the screen , each bearing nested tabs , on one of which I ’ve been reading , before Meyer even had a chance to tell me about it , a blog all about his conference with the Dalai Lama , complete with RSS feed and audio commentary and embedded YouTube videos and pictures of His Holiness .
As Meyer and I talk , the universe tests us with a small battery of distractions .
A maximum - volume fleet of emergency vehicles passes just outside my window ; my phone chirps to tell us that my mother is calling on the other line , then beeps again to let us know she ’s left a message .
There is , occasionally , a slight delay in the connection .
Meyer ignores it all , speaking deliberately and at length , managing to coordinate tricky subject - verb agreements over the course of multi-clause sentences .
I begin , a little sheepishly , with a question that strikes me as sensationalistic , nonscientific , and probably unanswerable by someone who ’s been professionally trained in the discipline of cautious objectivity :
Are we living through a crisis of attention ?
Before I even have a chance to apologize , Meyer responds with the air of an Old Testament prophet .
“ Yes , ” he says .
“ And I think it ’s going to get a lot worse than people expect . ”
He sees our distraction as a full - blown epidemic — a cognitive plague that has the potential to wipe out an entire generation of focused and productive thought .
He compares it , in fact , to smoking .
“ People are n’t aware what ’s happening to their mental processes , ” he says , “ in the same way that people years ago could n’t look into their lungs and see the residual deposits . ”
I ask him if , as the world ’s foremost expert on multitasking and distraction , he has found his own life negatively affected by the new world order of multitasking and distraction .
“ Yep , ” he says immediately , then adds , with admirable ( although slightly hurtful ) bluntness : “ I get calls all the time from people like you .
Because of the way the Internet works , once you become visible , you ’re approached from left and right by people wanting to have interactions in ways that are extremely time - consuming .
I could spend my whole day , my whole night , just answering e-mails .
I just ca n’t deal with it all .
None of this happened even ten years ago .
It was a lot calmer .
There was a lot of opportunity for getting steady work done . ”

Over the last twenty years , Meyer and a host of other researchers have proved again and again that multitasking , at least as our culture has come to know and love and institutionalize it , is a myth .
When you think you ’re doing two things at once , you ’re almost always just switching rapidly between them , leaking a little mental efficiency with every switch .
Meyer says that this is because , to put it simply , the brain processes different kinds of information on a variety of separate “ channels ” — a language channel , a visual channel , an auditory channel , and so on — each of which can process only one stream of information at a time .
If you overburden a channel , the brain becomes inefficient and mistake - prone .
The classic example is driving while talking on a cell phone , two tasks that conflict across a range of obvious channels : Steering and dialing are both manual tasks , looking out the windshield and reading a phone screen are both visual , etc .
Even talking on a hands - free phone can be dangerous , Meyer says .
If the person on the other end of the phone is describing a visual scene — say , the layout of a room full of furniture — that conversation can actually occupy your visual channel enough to impair your ability to see what ’s around you on the road .
The only time multitasking does work efficiently , Meyer says , is when multiple simple tasks operate on entirely separate channels — for example , folding laundry ( a visual - manual task ) while listening to a stock report ( a verbal task ) .
But real - world scenarios that fit those specifications are very rare .
This is troubling news , obviously , for a culture of BlackBerrys and news crawls and Firefox tabs — tools that , critics argue , force us all into a kind of elective ADHD .
The tech theorist Linda Stone famously coined the phrase “ continuous partial attention ” to describe our newly frazzled state of mind .
American office workers do n’t stick with any single task for more than a few minutes at a time ; if left uninterrupted , they will most likely interrupt themselves .
Since every interruption costs around 25 minutes of productivity , we spend nearly a third of our day recovering from them .
We keep an average of eight windows open on our computer screens at one time and skip between them every twenty seconds .
When we read online , we hardly even read at all — our eyes run down the page in an F pattern , scanning for keywords .
When you add up all the leaks from these constant little switches , soon you ’re hemorrhaging a dangerous amount of mental power .
People who frequently check their e-mail have tested as less intelligent than people who are actually high on marijuana .
Meyer guesses that the damage will take decades to understand , let alone fix .
If Einstein were alive today , he says , he ’d probably be forced to multitask so relentlessly in the Swiss patent office that he ’d never get a chance to work out the theory of relativity .
II .
The War on the Poverty of Attention
For Winifred Gallagher , the author of Rapt , a new book about the power of attention , it all comes down to the problem of jackhammers .
A few minutes before I called , she tells me , a construction crew started jackhammering outside her apartment window .
The noise immediately captured what ’s called her bottom - up attention — the broad involuntary awareness that roams the world constantly looking for danger and rewards : shiny objects , sudden movements , pungent smells .
Instead of letting this distract her , however , she made a conscious choice to go into the next room and summon her top - down attention — the narrow , voluntary focus that allows us to isolate and enhance some little slice of the world while ruthlessly suppressing everything else .
This attentional self - control , which psychologists call executive function , is at the very center of our struggle with attention .
It ’s what allows us to invest our focus wisely or poorly .
Some of us , of course , have an easier time with it than others .
Gallagher admits that she ’s been blessed with a naturally strong executive function .
“ It sounds funny , ” she tells me , “ but I ’ve always thought of paying attention as a kind of sexy , visceral activity .
Even as a kid , I enjoyed focusing .
I could feel it in almost a mentally muscular way .
I took a lot of pleasure in concentrating on things .
I ’m the sort of irritating person who can sit down to work at nine o’clock and look up at two o’clock and say , ‘ Oh , I thought it was around 10:30 . ’ ”
Gallagher became obsessed with the problem of attention five years ago , when she was diagnosed with advanced and aggressive breast cancer .
She was devastated , naturally , but then realized , on her way out of the hospital , that even the cancer could be seen largely as a problem of focus — a terrifying , deadly , internal jackhammer .
It made her realize , she says , that attention was “ not just a latent ability , it was something you could marshal and use as a tool . ”
By the time she reached her subway station , Gallagher had come up with a strategy :
She would make all the big pressing cancer - related decisions as quickly as possible , then , in order to maximize whatever time she had left , consciously shift her attention to more positive , productive things .
One of the projects Gallagher worked on during her recovery ( she is now cancer free ) was Rapt , which is both a survey of recent attention research and a testimonial to the power of top - down focus .
The ability to positively wield your attention comes off , in the book , as something of a panacea ; Gallagher describes it as “ the sine qua non of the quality of life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience . ”
It is , in other words , the Holy Grail of self - help : the key to relationships and parenting and mood disorders and weight problems .
( You can apparently lose seven pounds in a year through the sheer force of paying attention to your food . )
“ You ca n’t be happy all the time , ” Gallagher tells me , “ but you can pretty much focus all the time .
That ’s about as good as it gets . ”
The most promising solution to our attention problem , in Gallagher ’s mind , is also the most ancient : meditation .
Neuroscientists have become obsessed , in recent years , with Buddhists , whose attentional discipline can apparently confer all kinds of benefits even on non-Buddhists .
( Some psychologists predict that , in the same way we go out for a jog now , in the future we ’ll all do daily 20 - to - 30 - minute “ secular attentional workouts . ” )
Meditation can make your attention less “ sticky , ” able to notice images flashing by in such quick succession that regular brains would miss them .
It has also been shown to elevate your mood , which can then recursively stoke your attention : Research shows that positive emotions cause your visual field to expand .
The brains of Buddhist monks asked to meditate on “ unconditional loving - kindness and compassion ” show instant and remarkable changes :
Their left prefrontal cortices ( responsible for positive emotions ) go into overdrive , they produce gamma waves 30 times more powerful than novice meditators , and their wave activity is coordinated in a way often seen in patients under anesthesia .
Gallagher stresses that because attention is a limited resource — one psychologist has calculated that we can attend to only 110 bits of information per second , or 173 billion bits in an average lifetime — our moment - by - moment choice of attentional targets determines , in a very real sense , the shape of our lives .
Rapt ’s epigraph comes from the psychologist and philosopher William James : “ My experience is what I agree to attend to . ”
For Gallagher , everything comes down to that one big choice : investing your attention wisely or not .
The jackhammers are everywhere — iPhones , e-mail , cancer — and Western culture ’s attentional crisis is mainly a widespread failure to ignore them .
“ Once you understand how attention works and how you can make the most productive use of it , ” she says , “ if you continue to just jump in the air every time your phone rings or pounce on those buttons every time you get an instant message , that ’s not the machine ’s fault .
That ’s your fault . ”
Making the responsible attention choice , however , is not always easy .
Here is a partial list , because a complete one would fill the entire magazine , of the things I ’ve been distracted by in the course of writing this article : my texting wife , a very loud seagull , my mother calling from Mexico to leave voice mails in terrible Spanish , a man shouting “ Your weed - whacker fell off !
Your weed - whacker fell off ! ” at a truck full of lawn equipment , my Lost - watching wife , another man singing some kind of Spanish ballad on the sidewalk under my window , streaming video of the NBA playoffs , dissertation - length blog breakdowns of the NBA playoffs , my toenail spontaneously detaching , my ice - cream - eating wife , the subtly shifting landscapes of my three different e-mail in - boxes , my Facebooking wife , infinite YouTube videos ( a puffin attacking someone wearing a rubber boot , Paul McCartney talking about the death of John Lennon , a chimpanzee playing Pac - Man ) , and even more infinite , if that is possible , Wikipedia entries : puffins , MacGyver , Taylorism , the phrase “ bleeding edge , ” the Boston Molasses Disaster .
( If I were going to excuse you from reading this article for any single distraction , which I am not , it would be to read about the Boston Molasses Disaster . )
When the jackhammers fire up outside my window , in other words , I rarely ignore them — I throw the window open , watch for a while , bring the crew sandwiches on their lunch break , talk with them about the ins and outs of jackhammering , and then spend an hour or two trying to break up a little of the sidewalk myself .
Some of my distractions were unavoidable .
Some were necessary work - related evils that got out of hand .
Others were pretty clearly inexcusable .
( I consider it a victory for the integrity of pre-web human consciousness that I was able to successfully resist clicking on the first “ related video ” after the chimp , the evocatively titled “ Guy shits himself in a judo exhibition . ” )
In today ’s attentional landscape , it ’s hard to draw neat borders .
I ’m not ready to blame my restless attention entirely on a faulty willpower .
Some of it is pure impersonal behaviorism .
The Internet is basically a Skinner box engineered to tap right into our deepest mechanisms of addiction .
As B. F. Skinner ’s army of lever - pressing rats and pigeons taught us , the most irresistible reward schedule is not , counterintuitively , the one in which we ’re rewarded constantly but something called “ variable ratio schedule , ” in which the rewards arrive at random .
And that randomness is practically the Internet ’s defining feature :
It dispenses its never - ending little shots of positivity — a life - changing e-mail here , a funny YouTube video there — in gloriously unpredictable cycles .
It seems unrealistic to expect people to spend all day clicking reward bars — searching the web , scanning the relevant blogs , checking e-mail to see if a co-worker has updated a project — and then just leave those distractions behind , as soon as they ’re not strictly required , to engage in “ healthy ” things like books and ab crunches and undistracted deep conversations with neighbors .
It would be like requiring employees to take a few hits of opium throughout the day , then being surprised when it becomes a problem .
Last year , an editorial in the American Journal of Psychiatry raised the prospect of adding “ Internet addiction ” to the DSM , which would make it a disorder to be taken as seriously as schizophrenia .
A quintessentially Western solution to the attention problem — one that neatly circumvents the issue of willpower — is to simply dope our brains into focus .
We ’ve done so , over the centuries , with substances ranging from tea to tobacco to NoDoz to Benzedrine , and these days the tradition seems to be approaching some kind of zenith with the rise of neuroenhancers : drugs designed to treat ADHD ( Ritalin , Adderall ) , Alzheimer ’s ( Aricept ) , and narcolepsy ( Provigil ) that can produce , in healthy people , superhuman states of attention .
A grad - school friend tells me that Adderall allowed him to squeeze his mind “ like a muscle . ”
Joshua Foer , writing in Slate after a weeklong experiment with Adderall , said the drug made him feel like he ’d “ been bitten by a radioactive spider ” — he beat his unbeatable brother at Ping - Pong , solved anagrams , devoured dense books .
“ The part of my brain that makes me curious about whether I have new e-mails in my in - box apparently shut down , ” he wrote .
The most advanced Buddhist monks become world - class multitaskers .
Meditation might speed up their mental processes enough to handle information overload .
Although neuroenhancers are currently illegal to use without a prescription , they ’re popular among college students ( on some campuses , up to 25 percent of students admitted to taking them ) and — if endless anecdotes can be believed — among a wide spectrum of other professional focusers : journalists on deadline , doctors performing high - stakes surgeries , competitors in poker tournaments , researchers suffering through the grind of grant - writing .
There has been controversy in the chess world recently about drug testing at tournaments .
In December , a group of scientists published a paper in Nature that argued for the legalization and mainstream acceptance of neuroenhancers , suggesting that the drugs are really no different from more traditional “ cognitive enhancers ” such as laptops , exercise , nutrition , private tutoring , reading , and sleep .
It ’s not quite that simple , of course .
Adderall users frequently complain that the drug stifles their creativity — that it ’s best for doing ultrarational , structured tasks .
( As Foer put it , “ I had a nagging suspicion that I was thinking with blinders on . ” )
One risk the scientists do acknowledge is the fascinating , horrifying prospect of “ raising cognitive abilities beyond their species - typical upper bound . ”
Ultimately , one might argue , neuroenhancers spring from the same source as the problem they ’re designed to correct : our lust for achievement in defiance of natural constraints .
It ’s easy to imagine an endless attentional arms race in which new technologies colonize ever - bigger zones of our attention , new drugs expand the limits of that attention , and so on .
One of the most exciting — and confounding — solutions to the problem of attention lies right at the intersection of our willpower and our willpower - sapping technologies : the grassroots Internet movement known as “ lifehacking . ”
It began in 2003 when the British tech writer Danny O’Brien , frustrated by his own lack of focus , polled 70 of his most productive friends to see how they managed to get so much done ; he found that they ’d invented all kinds of clever little tricks — some high - tech , some very low - tech — to help shepherd their attention from moment to moment : ingenious script codes for to - do lists , software hacks for managing e-mail , rituals to avoid sinister time - wasting traps such as “ yak shaving , ” the tendency to lose yourself in endless trivial tasks tangentially related to the one you really need to do .
( O’ Brien wrote a program that prompts him every ten minutes , when he ’s online , to ask if he ’s procrastinating . )
Since then , lifehacking has snowballed into a massive self - help program , written and revised constantly by the online global hive mind , that seeks to help you allocate your attention efficiently .
Tips range from time - management habits ( the 90 - second shower ) to note - taking techniques ( mind mapping ) to software shortcuts ( how to turn your Gmail into a to - do list ) to delightfully retro tech solutions ( turning an index card into a portable dry - erase board by covering it with packing tape ) .
When I call Merlin Mann , one of lifehacking ’s early adopters and breakout stars , he is running late , rushing back to his office , and yet he seems somehow to have attention to spare .
He is by far the fastest - talking human I ’ve ever interviewed , and it crosses my mind that this too might be a question of productivity — that maybe he ’s adopted a time - saving verbal lifehack from auctioneers .
He talks in the snappy aphorisms of a professional speaker ( “ Priorities are like arms :
If you have more than two of them , they ’re probably make - believe ” ) and is always breaking ideas down into their atomic parts and reassessing the way they fit together : “ What does it come down to ? ” “ Here ’s the thing . ”
“ So why am I telling you this , and what does it have to do with lifehacks ? ”
Mann says he got into lifehacking at a moment of crisis , when he was “ feeling really overwhelmed by the number of inputs in my life and managing it very badly . ”
He founded one of the original lifehacking websites , 43 folders.com ( the name is a reference to David Allen ’s Getting Things Done , the legendarily complex productivity program in which Allen describes , among other things , how to build a kind of “ three - dimensional calendar ” out of 43 folders ) and went on to invent such illustrious hacks as “ in - box zero ” ( an e-mail - management technique ) and the “ hipster PDA ” ( a stack of three - by - five cards filled with jotted phone numbers and to - do lists , clipped together and tucked into your back pocket ) .
Mann now makes a living speaking to companies as a kind of productivity guru .
He Twitters , podcasts , and runs more than half a dozen websites .
Despite his robust web presence , Mann is skeptical about technology ’s impact on our lives .
“ Is it clear to you that the last fifteen years represent an enormous improvement in how everything operates ? ” he asks .
“ Picasso was somehow able to finish the Desmoiselles of Avignon even though he did n’t have an application that let him tag his to - dos .
If John Lennon had a BlackBerry , do you think he would have done everything he did with the Beatles in less than ten years ? ”
One of the weaknesses of lifehacking as a weapon in the war against distraction , Mann admits , is that it tends to become extremely distracting .
You can spend solid days reading reviews of filing techniques and organizational software .
“ On the web , there ’s a certain kind of encouragement to never ask yourself how much information you really need , ” he says .
“ But when I get to the point where I ’m seeking advice twelve hours a day on how to take a nap , or what kind of notebook to buy , I ’m so far off the idea of lifehacks that it ’s indistinguishable from where we started .
There are a lot of people out there that find this a very sticky idea , and there ’s very little advice right now to tell them that the only thing to do is action , and everything else is horseshit .
My wife reminds me sometimes : ‘ You have all the information you need to do something right now . ’ ”
For Mann , many of our attention problems are symptoms of larger existential issues : motivation , happiness , neurochemistry .
“ I ’m not a physician or a psychiatrist , but I ’ll tell you , I think a lot of it is some form of untreated ADHD or depression , ” he says .
“ Your mind is not getting the dopamine or the hugs that it needs to keep you focused on what you ’re doing .
And any time your work gets a little bit too hard or a little bit too boring , you allow it to catch on to something that ’s more interesting to you . ”
( Mann himself started getting treated for ADD a year ago ; he says it ’s helped his focus quite a lot . )
Mann ’s advice can shade , occasionally , into Buddhist territory .
“ There ’s no shell script , there ’s no fancy pen , there ’s no notebook or nap or Firefox extension or hack that ’s gonna help you figure out why the fuck you ’re here , ” he tells me .
“ That ’s on you .
This makes me sound like one of those people who swindled the Beatles , but if you are having attention problems , the best way to deal with it is by admitting it and then saying , ‘ From now on , I ’m gonna be in the moment and more cognizant . ’
I said not long ago , I think on Twitter — God , I quote myself a lot , what an asshole — that really all self - help is Buddhism with a service mark .
“ Where you allow your attention to go ultimately says more about you as a human being than anything that you put in your mission statement , ” he continues .
“ It ’s an indisputable receipt for your existence .
And if you allow that to be squandered by other people who are as bored as you are , it ’s gonna say a lot about who you are as a person . ”

Embracing the Poverty of Attention
Sometimes I wonder if the time I ’m wasting is actually being wasted .
Is n’t blowing a couple of hours on the Internet , in the end , just another way of following your attention ?
My life would be immeasurably poorer if I had n’t stumbled a few weeks ago across the Boston Molasses Disaster .
( Okay , seriously , forget it : I hereby release you to go look up the Boston Molasses Disaster .
A giant wave of molasses destroyed an entire Boston neighborhood 90 years ago , swallowing horses and throwing an elevated train off its track .
It took months to scrub all the molasses out of the cobblestones !
The harbor was brown until summer !
The world is a stranger place than we will ever know . )
The prophets of total attentional meltdown sometimes invoke , as an example of the great culture we ’re going to lose as we succumb to e-thinking , the canonical French juggernaut Marcel Proust .
And indeed , at seven volumes , several thousand pages , and 1.5 million words , À la Recherche du Temps Perdu is in many ways the anti-Twitter .
( It would take , by the way , exactly 68,636 tweets to reproduce . )
It ’s important to remember , however , that the most famous moment in all of Proust , the moment that launches the entire monumental project , is a moment of pure distraction : when the narrator , Marcel , eats a spoonful of tea - soaked madeleine and finds himself instantly transported back to the world of his childhood .
Proust makes it clear that conscious focus could never have yielded such profound magic : Marcel has to abandon the constraints of what he calls “ voluntary memory ” — the kind of narrow , purpose - driven attention that Adderall , say , might have allowed him to harness — in order to get to the deeper truths available only by distraction .
That famous cookie is a kind of hyperlink : a little blip that launches an associative cascade of a million other subjects .
This sort of free - associative wandering is essential to the creative process ; one moment of judicious unmindfulness can inspire thousands of hours of mindfulness .
It ’s possible that we ’re evolving toward a new techno - cognitive nomadism , in which restlessness will be an advantage .
My favorite focusing exercise comes from William James : Draw a dot on a piece of paper , then pay attention to it for as long as you can .
( Sitting in my office one afternoon , with my monkey mind swinging busily across the lush rain forest of online distractions , I tried this with the closest dot in the vicinity : the bright - red mouse - nipple at the center of my laptop ’s keyboard .
I managed to stare at it for 30 minutes , with mixed results . )
James argued that the human mind can’t actually focus on the dot , or any unchanging object , for more than a few seconds at a time :
It ’s too hungry for variety , surprise , the adventure of the unknown .
It has to refresh its attention by continually finding new aspects of the dot to focus on : subtleties of its shape , its relationship to the edges of the paper , metaphorical associations ( a fly , an eye , a hole ) .
The exercise becomes a question less of pure unwavering focus than of your ability to organize distractions around a central point .
The dot , in other words , becomes only the hub of your total dot - related distraction .
This is what the web - threatened punditry often fails to recognize : Focus is a paradox — it has distraction built into it .
The two are symbiotic ; they ’re the systole and diastole of consciousness .
Attention comes from the Latin “ to stretch out ” or “ reach toward , ” distraction from “ to pull apart . ”
We need both .
In their extreme forms , focus and attention may even circle back around and bleed into one other .
Meyer says there ’s a subset of Buddhists who believe that the most advanced monks become essentially “ world - class multitaskers ” — that all those years of meditation might actually speed up their mental processes enough to handle the kind of information overload the rest of us find crippling .
The truly wise mind will harness , rather than abandon , the power of distraction .
Unwavering focus — the inability to be distracted — can actually be just as problematic as ADHD .
Trouble with “ attentional shift ” is a feature common to a handful of mental illnesses , including schizophrenia and OCD .
It ’s been hypothesized that ADHD might even be an advantage in certain change - rich environments .
Researchers have discovered , for instance , that a brain receptor associated with ADHD is unusually common among certain nomads in Kenya , and that members who have the receptor are the best nourished in the group .
It ’s possible that we ’re all evolving toward a new techno - cognitive nomadism , a rapidly shifting environment in which restlessness will be an advantage again .
The deep focusers might even be hampered by having too much attention : Attention Surfeit Hypoactivity Disorder .
I keep returning to the parable of Einstein and Lennon — the great historical geniuses hypothetically ruined by modern distraction .
What made both men’s achievements so groundbreaking , though , was that they did something modern technology is getting increasingly better at allowing us to do :
They very powerfully linked and synthesized things that had previously been unlinked — Newtonian gravity and particle physics , rock and blues and folk and doo - wop and bubblegum pop and psychedelia .
If Einstein and Lennon were growing up today , their natural genius might be so pumped up on the possibilities of the new technology they ’d be doing even more dazzling things .
Surely Lennon would find a way to manipulate his BlackBerry to his own ends , just like he did with all the new technology of the sixties — he ’d harvest spam and text messages and web snippets and build them into a new kind of absurd poetry .
The Beatles would make the best viral videos of all time , simultaneously addictive and artful , disposable and forever .
All of those canonical songs , let ’s remember , were created entirely within a newfangled mass genre that was widely considered to be an assault on civilization and the sanctity of deep human thought .
Standards change .
They change because of great creations in formerly suspect media .
Which brings me , finally , to the next generation of attenders , the so - called “ net - gen ” or “ digital natives , ” kids who ’ve grown up with the Internet and other time - slicing technologies .
There ’s been lots of hand - wringing about all the skills they might lack , mainly the ability to concentrate on a complex task from beginning to end , but surely they can already do things their elders can ’t — like conduct 34 conversations simultaneously across six different media , or pay attention to switching between attentional targets in a way that ’s been considered impossible .
More than any other organ , the brain is designed to change based on experience , a feature called neuroplasticity .
London taxi drivers , for instance , have enlarged hippocampi ( the brain region for memory and spatial processing ) — a neural reward for paying attention to the tangle of the city ’s streets .
As we become more skilled at the 21st - century task Meyer calls “ flitting , ” the wiring of the brain will inevitably change to deal more efficiently with more information .
The neuroscientist Gary Small speculates that the human brain might be changing faster today than it has since the prehistoric discovery of tools .
Research suggests we ’re already picking up new skills : better peripheral vision , the ability to sift information rapidly .
We recently elected the first - ever BlackBerry president , able to flit between sixteen national crises while focusing at a world - class level .
Kids growing up now might have an associative genius we do n’t — a sense of the way ten projects all dovetail into something totally new .
They might be able to engage in seeming contradictions : mindful web - surfing , mindful Twittering .
Maybe , in flights of irresponsible responsibility , they ’ll even manage to attain the paradoxical , Zenlike state of focused distraction .
A 5 - pound missile the size of a loaf of French bread is being quietly tested in the Mojave Desert north of Los Angeles as the military searches for more deadly and far more precise robotic weapons for modern warfare .
In the next month or so , researchers at the Naval Air Warfare Center at China Lake expect to test a 2 - foot - long Spike missile that is about a “ quarter of the size of the next smallest on the planet , ” said Steve Felix , the missile project ’s manager .
Initially intended for use by ground troops against tanks , these small guided missiles have been reconfigured to launch from unmanned airplanes to destroy small vehicles .
In the test , the missile will be fired from a remote - controlled helicopter and aimed at a moving pickup truck .
If the test is successful , it will mark another milestone in the development of weapons for unmanned aircraft , a nascent field reminiscent of the early days of flight nearly a century ago when propeller - driven biplanes were jury - rigged with machine guns .

In recent months , the U.S. has used Predator robotic planes equipped with video cameras to carry out search - and - destroy missions against Al Qaeda hide - outs in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
These attacks highlighted the rapidly changing face of warfare .
But it was no big deal at China Lake , where weapons have been getting smaller , more precise and more powerful for a decade .
The new missiles being developed here are minuscule compared with the older , 100 - pound Hellfire missiles in use today in Central Asia .
A Predator , which can carry two or three Hellfires , would be able to hold as many as a dozen Spikes , extending its capabilities .
At the same time , experts say , smaller unmanned planes that could not carry weapons before could become deadly attack aircraft .
It is just these kinds of new weapons that Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates emphasized last week as he outlined one of the most sweeping shifts in military spending priorities in decades .
Among his priorities were buying 50 more Predator planes and putting more money into armed unmanned aircraft .

“ We must re-balance this department ’s programs in order to institutionalize and enhance our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead , ” Gates said .
Engineers at the sprawling China Lake complex , one of the nation ’s largest weapons test facilities with 6,600 workers , are hoping to be at the forefront .
“ We ’re sort of at the same stage as we were in 1914 when we began to arm airplanes , ” said Steven Zaloga , a military analyst with the Teal Group Corp .
Pentagon officials say robotic planes have been particularly effective .
As a result , demand for them has climbed sharply and Pentagon planners have rethought how they develop and deploy new weapon systems , analysts said .

That ’s because the threat to U.S. security is n’t from superpower rivals with state - of - the - art fighter jets and nuclear submarines , but from international terrorists who are more likely to engage in smaller - scale , guerrilla - type warfare , they said .
In such warfare , robotic planes , originally intended to provide video images of potential threats , are becoming one of the more effective weapon delivery systems , they said .
The aircraft can circle over an area for extended periods -- up to 24 hours in some cases -- looking for elusive targets .
Once a target is identified , remote operators can launch a missile to destroy it within minutes .
In the past , such missions often involved several aircraft and sometimes took hours or even days .
That is not bad in traditional warfare but useless for fighting terrorists in pickup trucks .

In recent months , the Predator planes , made by Rancho Bernardo , Calif . - based General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. , have been used to launch more than three dozen missile strikes against Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders , military officials say .
The unmanned aerial vehicles , known as UAVs , are fitted with video cameras and other sensors to identify and track potential targets .
They are remotely controlled by operators in an air - conditioned room thousands of miles from the battlefield on a base outside Las Vegas .
“ Ten years ago , shooting a rocket out of a UAV was a stunt .
Now it ’s a normal operating procedure , ” said John Pike , president of Globalsecurity .org , a website for military policy research .
With the demand for these planes growing , engineers at China Lake have increased their focus on developing weapons for pilotless planes and figuring out ways they can be used .
So many of the engineers at China Lake , once the nation ’s bastion for developing bigger and deadlier bombs and missiles , are now looking at making weapons smaller , more precise and , in some cases , less destructive .

Last year the Navy began using a bomb developed at China Lake that it says “ significantly reduced ” so - called collateral damage -- unintended casualties .
The bomb was meant for killing “ extremely sensitive targets ” without hurting people near them , China Lake officials said .
Details are still classified , but a 500 - pound bomb that would have demolished an entire building was modified to kill certain targets while leaving others unhurt or with only slight injuries .
Engineers are hoping to apply the technology to the weapons being developed for UAVs .
“ It ’s one of our success stories , ” said Bland Burchett , project manager for the Low Collateral Damage Bomb , also know as Loco .
“ We added precision and reduced the collateral damage area significantly . ”
Elsewhere on the base 150 miles from Los Angeles , a new unmanned systems unit has been created to help troops quickly figure out ways that UAVs can be used to fight a battle or complete a mission .

The unit is populated by some of the youngest engineers at the base , many of them just out of college , reflecting the computer video - gaming influence .
They tinker with circuit boards and video cameras that will be used on robotic planes , some barely bigger than a kite .
One of their recent assignments was to improve the quality of images relayed by the planes so that Marines could identify potential targets more clearly .
In another building , a team of engineers has been working on making guided missiles smaller and cheaper , yet more precise and deadly .
The Spike , which uses commercially available computer chips and components , is expected to cost about $ 5,000 a pop , compared with more than $ 100,000 for the current generation of guided missiles .
“ You can put them on smaller UAVs and thus have more of them , ” Pike said .

He noted that the fast - paced advances in computers and electronics have helped weapons developers .
“ That ’s why there have been such amazing outbursts of creativity in munitions . ”

The Federal Government has aborted its tender process for its new national broadband network - allowing Telstra to become involved if it wishes .
The Government had been expected to reveal today its private sector partners for the network , in which it has promised to invest up to $ 4.7 billion .
But Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and other ministers announced at an early morning news conference that the tender process was being terminated after advice from an independent panel of experts that none of the national proposals offered value for money .
" The panel noted the rapid deterioration of the global economy had a significant impact on the process , " Mr Rudd and the ministers said in a statement .
Instead , it will create a new company to build a more ambitious and expensive network , at an expected cost of $ 43 billion over 8 years .
The Government will be the majority shareholder in the company but will seek significant private sector investment .
The network will connect 90 % of homes , schools and workplaces with speeds of up to 100 megabits per second via optical fibre to the home technology , and the rest of the country with speeds of 12 megabits per second via wireless and satellite technology .
Telstra was excluded from the tender after it failed to put in a bid complying with requirements .
But there has been widespread speculation that the venture cannot effectively operate without Telstra 's involvement , and that a deal might be possible when a new boss replaces the outgoing Telstra chief Sol Trujillo .
The Government will make an initial investment of $ 4.7 billion in the company but intends to sell its interest within five years after the network is fully operational .
The new network will deliver high speed broadband to 90 % of the country through optical fibre .
The service would be up to 100 times faster than that presently available , Mr Rudd said .

REUTERS / Christian Hartmann
ZURICH ( Reuters ) - Swiss bank Credit Suisse has started closing down the offshore accounts of U.S. clients who have not declared the money to the U.S. authorities , a newspaper reported on Sunday .
The Sonntagszeitung newspaper said the bank had about 2,500 - 5,000 U.S. clients with undeclared offshore accounts worth about 3 billion francs , without citing its sources .
The paper said Credit Suisse had started parting company with its U.S. offshore clients , giving them the option of moving their accounts to its CS Private Advisors subsidiary , which would report the accounts to the U.S. tax authorities , or writing them a check .
It quoted an unnamed Credit Suisse manager as saying the bank was only applying the new “ zero tolerance ” policy in individual cases for now but was considering a more general withdrawal from the U.S. offshore business .
Credit Suisse was not immediately available for comment on the article .
Sonntagszeitung quoted a spokesman as declining to confirm the report , but noting the tougher approach of foreign authorities on offshore wealth management in recent times .
“ CS sticks to all valid rules and regulations in various countries , ” a spokesman told the newspaper .
The move comes after rival UBS said last year it would stop offering offshore services to U.S. citizens after U.S. authorities alleged that the Swiss bank has helped rich Americans hide money away from the taxman in Swiss accounts .
A newspaper reported earlier this year that Credit Suisse was writing to its U.S. clients holding Swiss accounts asking them to sign a form that would reveal them to U.S. tax authorities .
Thanks again to Leon Kreitzman for four fascinating articles about biological clocks in everything from peonies to people .
My sabbatical is rapidly drawing to a close — but it is n’t over yet !
My guest for the next three weeks is Steven Strogatz , a professor of applied mathematics at Cornell University and the author of “ The Calculus of Friendship : What a Teacher and a Student Learned about Life While Corresponding about Math , ” to be published in August .
Please welcome him .
— Olivia
By Steven Strogatz
As one of Olivia Judson ’s biggest fans , I feel honored and a bit giddy to be filling in for her .
But maybe I should confess up front that , unlike Olivia and the previous guest writers , I ’m not a biologist , evolutionary or otherwise .
In fact , I ’m ( gasp ! ) a mathematician .
One of the pleasures of looking at the world through mathematical eyes is that you can see certain patterns that would otherwise be hidden .
This week ’s column is about one such pattern .
It ’s a beautiful law of collective organization that links urban studies to zoology .
It reveals Manhattan and a mouse to be variations on a single structural theme .
The mathematics of cities was launched in 1949 when George Zipf , a linguist working at Harvard , reported a striking regularity in the size distribution of cities .
He noticed that if you tabulate the biggest cities in a given country and rank them according to their populations , the largest city is always about twice as big as the second largest , and three times as big as the third largest , and so on .
In other words , the population of a city is , to a good approximation , inversely proportional to its rank .
Why this should be true , no one knows .
Even more amazingly , Zipf ’s law has apparently held for at least 100 years .
Given the different social conditions from country to country , the different patterns of migration a century ago and many other variables that you ’d think would make a difference , the generality of Zipf ’s law is astonishing .
Keep in mind that this pattern emerged on its own .
No city planner imposed it , and no citizens conspired to make it happen .
Something is enforcing this invisible law , but we ’re still in the dark about what that something might be .
Many inventive theorists working in disciplines ranging from economics to physics have taken a whack at explaining Zipf ’s law , but no one has completely solved it .
Paul Krugman , who has tackled the problem himself , wryly noted that “ the usual complaint about economic theory is that our models are oversimplified — that they offer excessively neat views of complex , messy reality .
[ In the case of Zipf ’s law ] the reverse is true : we have complex , messy models , yet reality is startlingly neat and simple . ”
After being stuck for a long time , the mathematics of cities has suddenly begun to take off again .
Around 2006 , scientists started discovering new mathematical laws about cities that are nearly as stunning as Zipf’s .
But instead of focusing on the sizes of cities themselves , the new questions have to do with how city size affects other things we care about , like the amount of infrastructure needed to keep a city going .
For instance , if one city is 10 times as populous as another one , does it need 10 times as many gas stations ?
No .
Bigger cities have more gas stations than smaller ones ( of course ) , but not nearly in direct proportion to their size .
The number of gas stations grows only in proportion to the 0.77 power of population .
The crucial thing is that 0.77 is less than 1 .
This implies that the bigger a city is , the fewer gas stations it has per person .
Put simply , bigger cities enjoy economies of scale .
In this sense , bigger is greener .
The same pattern holds for other measures of infrastructure .
Whether you measure miles of roadway or length of electrical cables , you find that all of these also decrease , per person , as city size increases .
And all show an exponent between 0.7 and 0.9 .
Now comes the spooky part .
The same law is true for living things .
That is , if you mentally replace cities by organisms and city size by body weight , the mathematical pattern remains the same .
For example , suppose you measure how many calories a mouse burns per day , compared to an elephant .
Both are mammals , so at the cellular level you might expect they should n’t be too different .
And indeed , when the cells of 10 different mammalian species were grown outside their host organisms , in a laboratory tissue culture , they all displayed the same metabolic rate .
It was as if they did n’t know where they ’d come from ; they had no genetic memory of how big their donor was .
But now consider the elephant or the mouse as an intact animal , a functioning agglomeration of billions of cells .
Then , on a pound for pound basis , the cells of an elephant consume far less energy than those of a mouse .
The relevant law of metabolism , called Kleiber ’s law , states that the metabolic needs of a mammal grow in proportion to its body weight raised to the 0.74 power .
This 0.74 power is uncannily close to the 0.77 observed for the law governing gas stations in cities .
Coincidence ?
Maybe , but probably not .
There are theoretical grounds to expect a power close to 3/ 4 .
Geoffrey West of the Santa Fe Institute and his colleagues Jim Brown and Brian Enquist have argued that a 3/4 - power law is exactly what you ’d expect if natural selection has evolved a transport system for conveying energy and nutrients as efficiently and rapidly as possible to all points of a three - dimensional body , using a fractal network built from a series of branching tubes — precisely the architecture seen in the circulatory system and the airways of the lung , and not too different from the roads and cables and pipes that keep a city alive .
These numerical coincidences seem to be telling us something profound .
It appears that Aristotle ’s metaphor of a city as a living thing is more than merely poetic .
There may be deep laws of collective organization at work here , the same laws for aggregates of people and cells .
The numerology above would seem totally fortuitous if we had n’t viewed cities and organisms through the lens of mathematics .
By abstracting away nearly all the details involved in powering a mouse or a city , math exposes their underlying unity .
In that way ( and with apologies to Picasso ) , math is the lie that makes us realize the truth .

ROYAL OAK , Mich. , May 7 ( UPI ) -- A Royal Oak , Mich. , official says the city is considering a zoning ordinance that would pave the way for legal medical marijuana stores .
City Planner Doug Hedges said the ordinance would mandate any state - registered medical marijuana suppliers , also known as caregivers , to operate in the general business district of the city , The Detroit News said Thursday .

" The act does allow a caregiver to be compensated for services so they are a potential commercial activity , " Hedges said .
" We thought it best to treat them as a business .
We do n't allow home occupations in Royal Oak where a customer visits a home . "
Current Michigan state law currently limits the number of registered patients for whom an approved medical marijuana supplier can grow to five .
Each client represents 2.5 grams and 12 plants the registered supplier can possess at a given time .
Hedges said if the City Commission passes the proposal after discussing it next Tuesday , he expects a group of caregivers to open a store together to pool their patients .

THE stink of flatulence and rotten eggs could provide a surprising lift for men .
Hydrogen sulphide ( H 2 S ) causes erections in rats and may one day provide an alternative to Viagra for men .
The penis is packed with spongy tissue that produces an erection when it fills with blood .
Nitric oxide ( NO ) helps relax the walls of arteries that supply the penis , allowing extra blood to flow in .
Viagra works by blocking an enzyme that destroys NO .
The police have always faced a degree of suspicion from the public .
The founders of the Met dressed their men in blue rather than the more military red to underline their civilian role .
Keeping the peace is one of society 's toughest jobs and one that our police have performed sometimes successfully , sometimes not .
Unfortunately , the events of the past week will be remembered as a low point .
The arrest , early on Monday , of 114 demonstrators in a school outside Nottingham on suspicion of conspiracy to cause criminal damage and aggravated trespass , long before they managed to get anywhere near the Ratcliffe - on - Soar coal - fired power station , smacked of intimidation ; the bail restrictions then placed on them draconian and deeply unsettling in a free society .
The investigation into leaks at the Home Office that led to the arrest of Damian Green appears to have gone far beyond remit , with officers fishing for emails to Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty .
And news that Ian Tomlinson , the news - paper vendor shoved to the ground during G20 , died of internal bleeding rather than a heart attack , is shocking .
If all this was n't enough , there is a wealth of video evidence online showing excessive force being used against demonstrators .
Yet it 's increasingly clear we cannot trust the police account of events .
The Met has dodged , denied and delayed its response to questions over its conduct .
Chakrabarti acknowledges that " public order policing is a tough and thankless job " .
That is indisputable , but to succeed the police must have the trust of the public .
It shows just how far we are from that ideal when officers are being spotted at demonstrations with their ID tags deliberately obscured .
No police force should tolerate such brutish arrogance .
This aggression is no doubt linked to the government 's nasty habit of writing laws that prefer the convenience of security forces to the rights of free citizens .
But the police are public servants , not government enforcers .
Their job is to keep the peace , not clear the streets of dissent .
CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) -- News Corp. NWSA , +0.21 % NWS , +0.54 % Chairman Rupert Murdoch , commenting on the most severe worldwide economic downturn in decades , said Wednesday that " it is increasingly clear that the worst is over . "
Speaking to analysts on a conference call , Murdoch said : " There are emerging signs in some of our businesses that the days of precipitous declines are done and that revenues are beginning to look healthier . "

Baucus & Grassley -- paid off to kill health care reform
I was shocked when I read a memo from Republican strategist Dr. Frank Luntz laying out plans to dismantle any effort to give all Americans access to quality health care .
Dr. Luntz , the man who developed language designed to promote preemptive war in Iraq and distract from the severity of global warming , is at it again -- this time with a messaging strategy designed to sink our historic opportunity for health care reform .
Let 's be clear : this is not a strategy to push certain ideas about health reform .
It is a strategy intended solely to kill reform efforts altogether .
In his own words , Dr. Luntz has stated , " You 're not going to get what you want , but you can kill what they 're trying to do . "
Not surprisingly , since the American public is strongly in favor of fixing the broken health care system , the Luntz strategy is predicated on deception .
In his memo , Dr. Luntz lays out multiple ways that opponents of health care reform can trick and manipulate the American public .
One strategy that stood out to me is to call efforts to reform our broken health care system a " bailout for the insurance industry . "
This is ridiculous .
This statement is developed to serve the same interests who stopped at nothing to derail health care reform in the 90's , who blocked health care coverage for low - income children , and whose top Medicare priority for 15 years has been transferring money from seniors and taxpayers to the insurance industry .
... So expect a massive misinformation campaign coming to a health care debate near you .
Opponents using Dr. Luntz 's doublespeak will argue for a " balanced , common sense approach " to health care but what they really want is to keep the system the way it is .
They 'll say that a public plan will not be " patient centered , " but their real goal is to block accessible health care for every American .
They 'll say reform will deny Americans " choice " even when every American will be allowed to keep their health insurance and their doctor .
They 'll claim that the " quality of care will go down , " while callously ignoring the fact that millions of Americans have no health care at all and millions more are denied the medications and procedures they need .
What we are seeing , yet again , is that while Dr. Luntz and his clients may have excellent polling data , they are utterly clueless about what the American people want .
But , I have to give Dr. Luntz credit on one front : he points out that Republicans need to appear to be on the " right side of reform " or they lose the health care argument .
The problem is that you can't fake support for reform .
You 're either for improving the quality and affordability of health care or you 're against it .
You 're either for expanding coverage to every American or you 're against it .
At the end of the day , no matter what talking points they use , each member of Congress is going to have to vote for or against improving our broken health care system .
I was determined to write about health care reform today .
At 6 this morning we started off with the best of intentions to expose insurance industry shill Ben Nelson , only to be led down the garden path by the tragic story of Republican sore loser Carrie Prejean .
Then I realized no one has written about the GOP health care strategy articulated by pollster Frank Luntz -- nearly as foolish as right - wing marketing novice Leigh Scott 's solution to the Republican image problem , i.e. , persuading voters that Republicans are fun-loving punk rockers at heart .
But two people who know a lot more about this -- health care , not punk rockers -- language expert George Lakoff and Senator Jeff Merkley have already got it covered But , alas , Senator Merkley does n't have to go all the way across the aisle to the powerless Republicans to find who 's killing health care reform .
The moment the Senate 's most powerful champion of health care reform was stricken with a brain tumor , Montana 's corrupt corporate shill , Max Baucus , swooped in and grabbed responsibility for the most important problem facing the Senate : health care .
Responsibility shifted from Kennedy 's progressive - oriented Committee on Health , Education , Labor and Pensions ( with members like Merkley , Sheldon Whitehouse , Sherrod Brown , Jack Reed , and Tom Harkin ) to Baucus ' much more corporate - oriented Finance Committee ( filled with some of the worst bribe - taking whores in the Senate , from Baucus himself to Blanche Lincoln , Chuck " have I got a deal for you " Schumer , Tom Carper , Jay Rockefeller , Bill Nelson ) .
Baucus has taken $ 2,797,381 from the health care industry , more than any other Democrat who did n't run for president ( unless you count Republican Arlen Specter as a Democrat , along with his $ 3,914,733 in conveniently legalized bribes ) .
Of course both of these guardians of working families are adamantly opposed to a public health insurance option -- and to everything else that the insurance industry tells them to oppose .
Oh , and speaking of the Insurance Biz , they gave Baucus another $ 1,170,313 and Specter $ 1,020,130 .
Now Baucus is one slick fella ; sly and jovial at the same time .
Watch how smooth he is in this video when confronted by American citizens who have the temerity to petition Congress for health care reform .
On the other hand , he did n't pull out a gun and shoot anyone , clearly what Chuck Grassley ( R - IA ) would have preferred .

The triple Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt has been involved in a car accident in Jamaica but walked away with only scratches .
Bolt , along with his brother and a female passenger , was taken to a hospital in Spanish Town , near Kingston , where the Jamaican sprinter was treated before being sent home .
Bolt 's manager , Norman Peart , said that the 22 - year - old sustained nothing worse than scratches from thorn bushes when he stepped out of the car on the side of the road .
" We are very relieved he's OK , " Peart said .
" Everybody is fine . "
He is reported to have had a thorn stick him on the soft part of his left foot , after he stepped out of the car which overturned in a ditch off the highway .
The extent of the damage to the car was unclear .
The injury may see Bolt miss an invitational meeting in Kingston on Saturday .
He is also due to run a 150 m street race in Manchester on May 17 .
" We will see how he is in the next few days before his coach will decide if he is able to run on Saturday , " Bolt 's agent said
Police sergeant David Sheriff reported that Bolt lost control of his BMW M3 – a present given to him by his sponsors at Puma after his performances at the Beijing Olympics – after apparently speeding on a rain - slicked highway west of Kingston .
The car , Bolt 's favourite , is believed to have been left in a ditch .
Bolt , 22 , attended a specialist BMW M driver school at the Nürburgring in Germany last year to learn how to handle the high - performance car .
The IAAF world athlete of the year won the 100 m and 200 m at the Beijing Olympics and was part of the Jamaica team that won the 4x100 relay – all in world record times .
" We are keeping a close watch on Usain and will update the public as necessary , " said Peart .
" We also want to use the opportunity to thank the public for all the calls of concern and the show of affection for Usain . "
Deriving Functor
Hello
Ghc people , I have been working on adding support for " derive Functor " to ghc .
I have a patch that mostly works , but there are some problems : 1 . Ghc reports the correct instance when I use - ddump - deriv : , but that instance is not subsequenctly used .
Instead I get a warning like : Warning : No explicit method nor default method for `fmap '
In the instance declaration for ` Functor ( Cont r ) '
What could be going on here ?
The full output is attached .
2 . As far as I understand the code , there would need to be three traversals of a data type T to derive an instance Functor T : - First to determine whether the deriving should be allowed at all ( checkSideConditions ) -
Then to determine the constraints needed ( mk_data_eqn ) - Finally to make the body of the instance ( gen_Functor_binds )
This seems a bit redundant , and currently the code only does the last pass .
It would make more sense to report any errors during this pass as well .
I do n't understand how the constraints are determined in TcDeriv , for instance for the type data T1 a b c = T1 a deriving ( Eq ) it seems as if Eq constraints are added for all of {a , b , c} , but somehow only a constraint Eq a ends up in the final instance .
How does that work ?
The ( experimental ) patch was too large to attach , it can be found at http://twan.home.fmf.nl/files/deriv-functor-experimental1.patch.gz
By the way : is there any advantage ( besides readability ) to generating the code " fmap f " instead of " \x -> fmap f x " ?

Dr. Lambert explained how those brigands , like today ’s Somalis , usually kept their hostages alive .
It was n’t out of any enlightened sense of humanity .
It was simply good business .
They only hanged captives from giant hooks or carved them into little pieces if they resisted .
The Barbary pirates used small wooden boats , often powered by slaves chained to the oars , to attack larger European ships .
They were crude but effective , like today ’s Somali swashbucklers , who in November commandeered a 1,000 - foot - long Saudi oil tanker from a dinghy in the Gulf of Aden , a vital shipping lane at the mouth of the Red Sea .

But the Barbary pirates ’ bravado became their demise  something the Somalis might keep in mind .
The pirates ’ way of doing business was described this way at the time : “ When they sprang to the deck of an enemy ’s ship , every sailor held a dagger in each hand and a third in his mouth , which usually struck such terror in the foe that they cried out for quarter at once . ”
The quote is from Thomas Jefferson , then America ’s ambassador to France , after he and John Adams , the envoy in London , got the description from Tripoli ’s envoy to Britain in 1786 .
And that underscores a key point .
The Barbary pirates actually had an ambassador  who met with Jefferson and Adams , no less .
The pirates worked for a government .
The Barbary rulers commissioned them to rob and pillage and kidnap , and the rulers got a cut .
It was all official .
And open .
It was truly state - sponsored terrorism .
And the Western nations ’ response was to pay “ tribute , ” a fancy word for blackmail .
If a country paid tribute , the 18th - century pirates would leave its ships alone .
Today , shipping companies fork over as much as $ 100 million in ransoms to the Somali pirates , a strategy that saves their cargoes but also attracts more underemployed Somali fishermen into the hijacking business .
The United States tried to play nice with the Barbary pirates and even inked a few treaties .
That language , too , has a striking ring .
The Barbary States were Muslim , as is Somalia .
And America stressed that this was not about God .
Many Republicans [ particularly those up for re-election next year ] say privately they would appreciate the opportunity to move beyond the Bush administration , and that Cheney 's outspokenness does not help their cause .
But publicly , few are willing to kick Cheney to the curb .
“ One of the things the media could do -- some of the media -- is to move the debate off Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh .
This is probably not the future of the Republican Party . "
Sunday 's TV pundits laid out two very distinct visions of how the Republican Party can try to stop its slide into oblivion .
Cheney , declaring that one of the last of the nationally respected members of his party , Colin Powell , is n't even a Republican anymore , opted for Door # 1 : continuing to transform the GOP into the intolerant , small - minded , regionally - based party of Rush Limbaugh .
The party 's last presidential candidate weakly , almost apologetically , piped up that Republicans have to reach out to people beyond the base , " a handful of uber - wealthy patricians who want to protect their inherited privilege at any cost ... and a big mass of pork - rind eating , truck nutz sporting , bitter sons of Jefferson Davis .
" Although most Republican Party elders have been pushing 3 younger right - wing extremists as " the future " -- Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) , Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) and Kevin McCarthy ( R - CA ) -- the party is still seen as mired in the past and stuck with the Bush Regime albatross around its neck .
Cheney has pushed himself forward as the party 's leading voice , defending the previous administration and its failed policies , especially torture , and taking on the unseemly and unprecedented role of viciously attacking the new president .
And then you 've got the increasingly bloody knife fight between Romney , Huckabee , Gingrich and Palin , each vying to be the Republican nominee for 2012 -- in case something goes terribly wrong and the party can stage a come - back .
It must have been a tough day to get relevant guests today so John King dragged out Bill Bennett 's carcass to pontificate on how Sarah Palin is n't the future of the GOP -- and neither is Limbaugh .
He was pushing Ryan , Mike Pence , Pyush Jindal , Jon Kyl and David Petraeus .
( Donna Brazile was pushing Meghan McCain : " She ’s refreshing , she ’s honest and she ’s a face that could really help them galvanize young people and independents . ” )

Any abusive relationship tends to end with a long , slow phase of mounting disappointment followed by a sudden , irreversible snapping point .
The descent to rock bottom may take years but when you get there , the force of impact still shocks , and it 's precisely this shock that gives you the strength to walk away .
Take smoking , for instance .
You can light up for years , hating yourself and the habit a little bit more with each accumulated puff , yet remain hopelessly locked in nicotine 's pointless embrace , until one day you find yourself scrabbling through the kitchen bin , picking potato peelings off a dog end because it 's 11 pm and the shops are closed and GOD YOU NEED A FAG . . . when you catch sight of your sorry junkie - arsed reflection in the shiny bin lid and undergo an epiphany of self - disgust , vowing to quit there and then .
I bring this up because I suspect that across the country , people are undergoing similar epiphanies every day .
Not about cigarettes , but politicians .
My personal snapping point was reached last week , at the precise moment Jack Straw announced the government was vetoing the Information Tribunal 's order for the release of cabinet minutes relating to that whole invasion - of - Iraq thing .
Come on , you remember Iraq : that little foreign policy blip millions of us protested against to absolutely zero avail , because Straw and his pals figured they knew best , even though it turned out they did n't and - oops !
- hundreds of thousands of lives were lost as a result .
Remember the footage of that screaming little boy with his limbs blown off ?
Maybe not .
Maybe you felt a shiver of guilt when you saw that ; guilt that you had n't personally done enough to prevent it ; should 've shouted louder , marched further .
Or maybe it stunned you into numbness .
Because what was the point in protesting any more ?
These people do what they want .
They do what they want , these people , and you and I are cut out of the conversation .
I 'm sure they 're dimly aware we still exist .
They must spot us occasionally , through the window , jumping up and down in the cold with our funny placards . . . although come to think of it , they can't even see us through the window , since they banned peaceful protest within a mile of Parliament .
Instead they pick us up on a monitor , courtesy of one of the 15bn CCTV cameras that scrutinise our every move in the name of security .
On the screen you 're nothing but a tiny monochrome blob ; two - dimensional and faceless .
And that 's just how they like it .
Straw and co blocked the release of the minutes , claiming that to actually let us know what was going on would set a dangerous precedent that would harm good government .
Ministers would n't speak frankly at cabinet meetings if they felt their discussions would be subjected to the sort of scrutiny that , say , our every waking move is .
In other words , they'd be more worried about the press coverage they'd get than the strength of their arguments .
Well , boo hoo .
Surely craven pussies like that should n't be governing anyway ?
Having pissed in the public 's face , Straw went on to shake the final drips down its nose , writing a defence of the government 's civil liberties record in this paper in which he claimed " talk of Britain sliding into a police state is daft scaremongering , but even were it true there is a mechanism to prevent it - democratic elections . . .
People have the power to vote out administrations which they believe are heavy - handed . "
Thanks , Jacksy - can I call you Jacksy ? - but who the hell are we supposed to vote in ?
Despite a bit of grumbling , the Tories supported the veto .
Because they would n't want cabinet minutes published either .
It 's all over .
The politicians have finally shut us out of their game for good and we have nowhere left to turn .
We 're not part of their world any more .
We do n't even speak the same language .
We 're the ants in their garden .
The bacteria in their stools .
They have nothing but contempt for us .
They snivel and lie and duck questions on torture - on torture , for Christ 's sake - while demanding we respect their authority .
They monitor our every belch and fart , and insist it 's all for our own good .
Straw wrote , " If people were angels there would be no need for government . . .
But sadly people are not all angels . "
That rather makes it sound as though he believes politicians are n't mere people .
Maybe they 're the gods of Olympus .
Maybe that 's why they 're in charge .
Thing is , they could get away with this bullshit while times were good , while people were comfortable enough to ignore what was happening ; when people were focusing on plasma TVs and iPods and celebrity gossip instead of what the politicians were doing - not because they 're stupid , but because they know a closed shop when they see one .
But now it looks as if those times are at an end , and more and more of us are pulling the dreampipes from the back of our skulls , undergoing a negative epiphany ; blinking into the cold light of day .
Consequently the police are preparing for a " summer of rage " .
To the powers that be , that probably just means more tiny monochrome blobs jumping up and down on the long - distance monitor for their amusement .
Should it turn out to be more visceral than that , they 'll have no one to blame but themselves .
This week Charlie managed to convince himself he was coming down with the winter vomiting bug three times despite a total lack of symptoms : " Apparently , it comes on so fast the first sign you 've got it is the sight of puke shooting unexpectedly from your own mouth , followed almost immediately by an involuntary trouser - soiling evacuation of the bowels . "
A mortar shell struck the only functioning medical facility in Sri Lanka 's northern civil war zone Tuesday , killing 49 patients and bystanders and wounding more than 50 others , separatist fighters and a health worker in the area said .
The attack came after a weekend of heavy shelling that killed hundreds of civilians in the area .
The military has denied accusations that it was still shelling the tiny coastal strip still under insurgents ' control , which is packed with an estimated 50,000 civilians .
Separatist spokesman Seevaratnam Puleedevan said a shell hit the hospital Tuesday morning .
" They are still counting the dead bodies , " he said .
A health worker at the makeshift hospital confirmed the attack , saying one mortar shell landed in the admissions ward that had been set up in a temporary shelter about 7:30 a.m. , killing patients and bystanders and sending dozens fleeing for their lives .
A hospital administrator was among those killed and another 56 people were wounded , the staffer said , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media .
Shelling was still going on hours after the attack , but the hospital was not again hit , the worker said .
Puleedevan said civilians were fleeing in all directions inside the tiny war zone seeking safety .
" There 's no place to seek shelter or protect themselves , " he said .
He called on the international community to force the government to stop its offensive against the militants .
Sri Lanka 's 25 - year - old civil war has pitted Tamils , an ethnic minority in the country , against the Sinhalese - controlled government .
The conflict has killed an estimated 70,000 people .
Accurate reporting on the war is difficult because journalists are banned from conflict zones , while most foreign reporters are barred from entering the country in the first place .
Das Vorgehen des Redmonder Softwarekonzerns gegen TomTom und Open Source solle offenbar Anwender verunsichern , die zunehmend Interesse an quelloffener Software zeigen .
Microsofts Klage , TomTom habe acht Patente verletzt , dürfte vor Gericht keine Chance haben , meint der Linux - Verband LIVE .
So würde Microsoft in je zwei Klagepunkten die „ Innovationen " FAT - Dateisystem und Verwendung von Internet - fähigen Computern in Fahrzeugen sowie die Speichermethoden auf austauschbaren Medien und geografische Ortungssysteme für sich reklamieren .
Laut Verband waren diese Techniken jedoch vor Microsofts Patenteinreichungen bekannt , alles andere als innovativ , und ihre Nutzung durch andere Unternehmen sei jahrelang von Microsoft geduldet worden .
Damit habe der Konzern nach den Urteilen US - amerikanischer Gerichte in den letzten Jahren seine Patentansprüche verwirkt .
„ Microsoft macht Trivialpatente für sich geltend " , kommentierte Elmar Geese , Vorsitzender des Linux - Verbands .
„ Diese Techniken hat das Unternehmen selbst als De-Facto - Standards durchgesetzt , auch indem es ihre Verwendung nicht beanstandete , sondern sogar förderte .
Dass sie nun kostenpflichtig gemacht werden , zeigt , wie gefährlich so genannte Industriestandards sind .
Standards müssen offen sein . "
Patente , so das Fazit Geeses , verhindern jeglichen Wettbewerb und damit jede Form innovativer Wertschöpfung : „ Dass Microsoft glaubt , triviales wie die Verwendung von Internet - fähigen Rechnern im Auto , damit im Prinzip auch die Nutzung von Notebooks im PKW , für sich beanspruchen zu können , muss jedem Entscheider die Absurdität von Softwarepatenten vor Augen führen . "
Als Motiv der Klage gegen TomTom vermutet der Verband , dass Microsoft durch Schlagzeilen in der Presse die Öffentlichkeit zu irritieren versucht .
Microsoft greife zur alten Taktik „ Fear , Uncertainty and Doubt " ( FUD ; Angst , Unsicherheit und Zweifel ) , um das zunehmende Interesse von Anwendern in Unternehmen und öffentlichen Verwaltungen an Linux und Open - Source - Software einzudämmen .
Das Vorgehen des Konzerns zeige , dass seine in jüngster Zeit zu beobachtende Betonung von Interoperabilität und Koexistenz mit der Open - Source - Welt nur Rhetorik und Propaganda waren .
Den Verantwortlichen in Politik und Wirtschaft werde die Klage demonstrieren , dass der Konzern seine " monopolistischen Bestrebungen " unverändert verfolge .
After a week of epic battle , Ashton Kutcher has beaten CNN Breaking News to the top of the Twitter heap , becoming the first Twitter user ever to reach 1,000,000 followers .
As an incentive to follow him on Twitter , Ashton pledged to donate 10,000 anti-Malaria bed nets for World Malaria Day if he won .
Now that victory is his , momentum behind that pledge is growing .
Just today , he 's gotten Demi Moore , Oprah , Ryan Seacrest , and CNN to donate between 10,000 and 20,000 nets .
It looks like P. Diddy might be next .
Ashton now has the opportunity to turn his Twitter celebrity into something with real - world impact .
Sign the petition below to ask Ashton turn this attention to a new goal : raising $ 1,000,000 for bed nets for Malaria No More .
After you 've signed the petition , we urge you to make your own donation of $ 10 for a bed net by clicking here , where we 're tracking all the donations this has inspired .
If this looks familiar , it 's time to go 5GHz .
Single - router setup
And ... that 's it .
If you 've got a Mac - only household , you do n't have to do anything else -- your Macs will automatically use the 5GHz network and get the higher speeds , while your other devices will hop on at 2.4GHz .
However , we 're guessing you 're more like us , and you 've got lots of different systems to support , so you might want to back off the full - auto here and split out the 5GHz network with its own SSID :
It 's a little less seamless , but you 'll be able to manually set all your 5GHz - capable devices to use the faster network .
Setup with any other dual - band router is more or less the same -- just make sure you 've got both radios going .
Two - router setup
Plug in your el- cheapo router and do what you need to do to skip the guided setup .
You do n't need it .
Connect to whatever default network it creates out of the box , point your browser to the setup screen ( typically located at 10.0.1.1 , 10.0.2.1 , or 192.168.1.1 ) , and look for the access point config screen :
The IP address here should be in the NAT range as the one used by your main router , so make sure you do n't put in a 10.0 address if you 're runnning a 192.168 network or vice versa .
( Check your other network to make sure . )
Other than that , all you really have to do is pick an unique SSID that 's different from your 5GHz network and set a password , and you 're all set .
Connect a short Ethernet cable between the LAN ( not WAN ! ) ports of both routers , and enjoy -- you 've got the best of both worlds .
Whichever way you choose to go , we 're pretty sure you 'll be happier running at 5GHz -- it makes wireless networking seem like a viable alternative to Ethernet , which is not something we ever thought we 'd say .
And besides , you needed a weekend project , right ?
And that 's it -- you can begin enjoying 5GHz immediately .
You 'll notice that file transfers are much faster , HD video streaming is now a realistic possibility , and wonder of wonders , you 've become much more attractive overnight .
But what about your cellphones and older devices ?
Let 's get that 2.4GHz access point set up and bring them back online .
Plug in your el- cheapo router and do what you need to do to skip the guided setup .
You do n't need it .
Connect to whatever default network it creates out of the box , point your browser to the setup screen ( typically located at 10.0.1.1 , 10.0.2.1 , or 192.168.1.1 ) , and look for the access point config screen :
The IP address here should be in the NAT range as the one used by your main router , so make sure you do n't put in a 10.0 address if you 're runnning a 192.168 network or vice versa .
( Check your other network to make sure . )
Other than that , all you really have to do is pick an unique SSID that 's different from your 5GHz network and set a password , and you 're all set .
Connect a short Ethernet cable between the LAN ( not WAN ! ) ports of both routers , and enjoy -- you 've got the best of both worlds .
Whichever way you choose to go , we 're pretty sure you 'll be happier running at 5GHz -- it makes wireless networking seem like a viable alternative to Ethernet , which is not something we ever thought we 'd say .
And besides , you needed a weekend project , right ?
Next , make sure you 're set up to use " wide channels . "
This bundles two 802.11n channels together , and it's a big reason for the speed boost .
Again , this can be hidden -- on an Airport you have to click the " Wireless Options " button .
Okay , so first things first : you need to make sure your laptops and other devices support 5GHz 802.11n .
If you 've got a Mac with a Core 2 Duo , you 're all set .
PC users will need to check their gear -- you should be fine if you have a recent - vintage 802.11n
WiFi chipset , but if not , you 'll have to pony up for a USB or PC Card adapter , which is ugly but worth it .
Next , you 're going to need to decide if you want to run a two - router setup or consolidate to a single box .
If you 've got a newer 5GHz - capable router already installed and you like it , we 'd say your best bet is to just add a cheap second unit -- configuration is n't that hard , and you 'll actually end up with a more flexible rig .
On the other hand , if you 've got an older router or you want the simplest possible networking setup , an upgrade to one of the new dual - bands on the market might be in order , since the experience is seamless -- Apple 's AEBS will even auto - select the fastest connection for you .
That said , after having run both setups , we 've settled on having two routers -- it 's a little messier , but the sysadmin in us secretly likes having redundant hardware in the house in case something goes awry .
What can we say ?
We 're nerds .
If running two routers is too messy for you or you do n't already have a 5GHz - capable router , a single dual - band router is the way to go -- the Airport Extreme we 're going to use here is $ 179 , but you can find other brands on sale for $ 100 or so .
Plus , setup is dead simple -- ready ?
But what if you 've already got a 5GHz - capable router that works well ?
It 's not going to be as easy as the single - box setup , but it 's not exactly hard , either -- you just need to flip the right switches and plug in a good cheap router to serve as your 2.4GHz access point .
We use a $ 30 Belkin , but you 've got tons of options here -- you do n't need any extra bells or whistles , just reliable operation .
Configure your main router as you normally would , giving it a unique SSID and selecting 5GHz - only operation where appropriate .
Generally this 'll be under a wireless settings menu , but different manufacturers put it in different places .
Earth Day was officially born in 1970 after a proclamation by its founder , Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson in September 1969 that stated a “ nationwide grassroots demonstration on the environment ” would take place in Spring of 1970 .
Thirty - nine years later , Earth Day is alive and well and nothing gets me more excited than knowing that billions ( yes billions ) of people around the world are thinking about the earth and reflecting upon the harm we are causing .
On the other hand , there will always be a fringe group of people who spend Earth Day burning plastic bags , idling their SUVs , and dumping solid waste into lakes and ponds .
That may sound like fun and all , but I ’d rather spend my earth day doing something more constructive .
Earth Day ’s founder Gaylord Nelson was a revolutionary in his day .
Like myself , I can imagine that every day was an “ Earth Day ” for Nelson .
Nelson did n’t pass a legislation to celebrate Earth Day so that only he himself could reflect on the earth ; he wanted the world to reflect on the earth .
Nelson summarizes his view on the economy versus the environment in this wonderful phrase :
“ The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment , not the other way around . ”
You see , Nelson believed that the economy would n’t exist without a healthy environment , and placing economic development before the environment can only leave us to regret what we have left our children to deal with .
Nelson also believed that overpopulation was a major cause of the environmental issues of that day .
Given the post - war baby boom , this was a common position to take in those days .
Many people still have this same concern about overpopulation , but I strongly believe that the earth can thrive even at its current level of population ; we just need to address the overconsumption nature of our current lifestyles in addition to embracing initiatives that address sustainability .
The most important environmental issues of today ( in my opinion ) are :
Climate Change
Air and Water pollution
Sustainable energy solutions
Solid waste diversion / Consumer packaging
Urban Sprawl / spread / low - density housing
Loss of cultivatable farm - land
Lack of Water Conservation
Earth Day 1990 led to an increased awareness about recycling which ultimately planted the seed for the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil .
The 1992 summit was a wake - up call that resulted in the creation of the Kyoto Protocol .
I wanted to share some of the things that I practice on a day - to - day basis to help reduce my personal impact on the environment :
Responsible energy consumption :
Never use a dryer , hang - dry clothes , use less hot water , shorter showers , turn off lights , environmentally - friendly bulbs , unplug electronics .

Reduction in Carbon emissions :
Eat less meat , purchase carbon offsets when you absolutely need to travel , drive less .
… and some other options that are becoming available in some cities :
Bullfrog power – purchase energy exclusively from sustainable , renewable sources .
– purchase energy exclusively from sustainable , renewable sources .
Green - bin organic recycling – Currently only available to house dwellings in Toronto , but should become available to condominium complexes in the near future .
Sustainable living is an attainable pursuit that starts at home .
There is nothing more frustrating than someone telling you that they have no concern about their personal impact on the earth because it does n’t matter in the grand scheme of things .
When everybody does their part , it adds up and it really does matter .
If we all contribute in our own way , we will leave the earth a better place for our children to live in .

It will be interesting to see how Google 's new geo- locator service , called Latitude , plays with small business .
Launched yesterday , Latitude transmits the user 's location back to Google for display using the service 's online maps .
The location information comes from a GPS - equipped Smart phones or by triangulation using cell towers .
An opt - in service , Latitude also works with laptop computers .
It 's easy to think of business uses for Latitude , such as tracking service people as they move from call - to - call .
Delivery vehicles might also be tracked , and the service could also be used to make certain the closest resource is always sent to a customer 's request .
And I have n't even touched on the value of tracking specific people , certain to be a boon to the personal assistants and group admins of the world .
I suppose bosses could also use the service to keep an eye on their charges to make sure they are where they are supposed to be .
The business value of Latitude only works if the service updates frequently enough to be useful in near real - time .
It also lacks the bells and whistles associated with commercial vehicle tracking systems .
Those systems are expensive , however , and since Latitude is from Google you can bet the price will be right .
I would not be surprised , however , to see application developers build commercial versions of the service sometime later .
The downside of Latitude is the amount of extremely personal information , such as the details of all a person 's travels that is sent to Google .
I know people who simply do n't trust Google to not become evil , if the company has n't already .
They wonder why the company offers so many free applications unless it has some way to monetize them that is n't obvious to the user .
Latitude also does n't seem very well - suited for tracking a large number of people at once , though I could be mistaken about this .
As soon as it's available for the iPhone , I plan to test Latitude is a real world application .
My wife works for an Emergency Medical Services provider and carries a second - generation iPhone with the built - in GPS receiver .
I 'll be interested to see how well Latitude keeps up with her ambulance as it goes out on runs .
You might want to try a similar test in your organization .
I am pretty sure that business will find some most useful applications for Google Latitude .
Please tell me about yours .

Pictures San Francisco's main thoroughfare as seen from the front window of a moving Market Street cable car , before the downtown area was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire .
This unusual record has been called the first " structural film " because it follows exactly the externally imposed structure of the car ride .
Here is a post from the SFGate blog that explains some of the history of this film and how film scholar David Kiehn discovered that it was in fact produced in 1906 ( just before the quake and fire ) , not 1905 : http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/stew/detail?entry_id=62237
Shotlist
A TRIP DOWN MARKET STREET : taken from the front of a street car starting from about 9th and Market and going down to the Ferry Building at the foot of Market and turning around / autos / streetcars / people .
LC synopsis ( taken from website ) reads :
This film , shot from the front window of a moving Market Street cable car , is a rare record of San Francisco 's principal thoroughfare and downtown area before their destruction in the 1906 earthquake and fire .
The filmed ride covers 1.55 miles at an average speed of nearly 10 miles per hour .
While there is no production or copyright information on the film , the state of completion of the Flood Building and the Monadnock Building indicate that the year is 1905 .
Also , the apparent position of the sun in relation to the time visible on the Ferry Building clock point to early September as the month .
Market Street , graded through sand dunes in the 1850's , is 120 feet wide , and nearly 3.5 miles long .
The street runs northeast from the foot of Twin Peaks to the Ferry Building .
Different street grids , diagonal on the northwest side and parallel on the southeast side , create several awkward diagonal intersections along Market Street , contributing to the chaotic traffic situation that is evident in the film .
San Francisco 's cable cars , which first began operations in 1873 , have no power of their own , and operate by " gripping " a moving cable beneath a slot in the street .
This is the origin of the name " south of the slot " for the South - of - Market Street district .
The Market Street lines , dating from 1883 , merged in 1902 to form the United Railroads of San Francisco .
Dark cars served westerly neighborhood lines extending along McAllister , Hayes and Haight streets , light cars served southwesterly neighborhoods , with the lines extending along Valencia and Castro streets .
The Market Street section of the lines ended at the Ferry Building , where passengers boarded ferries for Oakland , Alameda , or Berkeley , across San Francisco Bay .
East of Sutter Street , horse cars ran along Market Street .
Independently owned , they ran on side tracks to the Ferry Building .
A few electric streetcars , dating from 1892 , are seen in the film crossing Market Street .
Market Street itself reverted to electric streetcars in 1906 , following the earthquake and fire .
In all , the film shows some thirty cable cars , four horse cars and four streetcars .
An interesting feature of the film is the apparent abundance of automobiles .
However , a careful tracking of automobile traffic shows that almost all of the autos seen circle around the camera / cable car many times ( one ten times ) .
This traffic was apparently staged by the producer to give Market Street the appearance of a prosperous modern boulevard with many automobiles .
In fact , in 1905 the automobile was still something of a novelty in San Francisco , with horse - drawn buggies , carts , vans , and wagons being the common private and business vehicles .
The near total lack of traffic control along Market Street emphasizes the newness of the automobile .
Granite paving stripes in the street marking ignored pedestrian crosswalks , making the crossing of Market Street on foot a risky venture .
The pedestrian " islands " for homeward - bound downtown cable car commuters are among the few signs of order visible in the film .
The following is a scene - by - scene description of the film : [ Frame : 0300 ( part 1 ) ]
The film begins looking northeast on Market Street just west of the intersection of Hyde , Grove and 8th streets .
The dark building at right is the Odd Fellows Hall and the grey building beyond ( across 8th St. ) is the Grant Building ( 1905 ) .
A white postal service automobile is at left center .
The three large buildings receding down Market Street at left are [ 0319 ( part 1 ) ] the Murphy Building ( 1889 ) , [ 0353 ( part 1 ) ] the Donohoe Building ( 1890 ) , and the Flood Building ( 1905 ) .
The distant tower of the Call Building ( 1897 ) is at center right .
Roadwork is underway at far left , and a city water wagon is at right .
[ 0428 ( part 1 ) ]
After a break in continuity , the film jumps ahead one block and approaches the intersection of Taylor St. and Golden Gate Ave. on the left .
[ 0565 ( part 1 ) ]
The view includes the prominent Flood Building on the left , the distant Ferry Building in the center , the domed Call Building at right center and the Emporium department store ( 1896 ) with the white side wall , on the right .
The newly finished Call Building , the largest office building in the west , was the latest addition to San Francisco 's skyline in a building boom that had begun in the 1890's .
All of the buildings named above were either rebuilt or refitted after the 1906 earthquake and fire .
[ 0603 ( part 1 ) ]
The cut masonry facade at right , beyond 6th , is Hale Brothers Dry Goods . [ 1216 ( part 1 ) ]
A street sweeper is at work on the right .
[ 1488 ( part 1 ) ]
The column at left is the Native Sons Monument ( 1897 ) at the Mason / Turk Streets intersection .
Honoring California 's admission into the Union in 1850 , it now stands at the intersection of Montgomery and Market streets .
[ 1885 ( part 1 ) ]
As a lady boards a cable car , a man gets off and crosses Market Street carrying a baby .
[ 3086 ( part 1 ) ]
At left , one of the downtown home - bound cable car commuter " islands " comes into view . [ 3321 ( part 1 ) ]
Next , the entry awning of the Emporium department store appears on the right , while beyond , the California Academy of Sciences Building ( 1891 ) and the old Flood Building ( 1888 ) , which were not rebuilt after 1906 , can be seen .
[ 3615 ( part 1 ) ]
A confused pedestrian dodges traffic at center as an umbrella - carrying businessman boards a cable car .
Ahead , [ 4000 ( part 1 ) ] a group of young women , dressed according to age , await a cable car .
On the left , the " flatiron " Phelan Building is largely in shadow and beyond , at the Kearny / Geary streets intersection , the double - blank rear wall of the Mutual Savings Bank ( 1902 ) and the dark Chronicle Building ( 1890 ) can be seen [ 4143 ( part 1 ) ] .
Next , a dark , low - slung drayage cart crosses to the right , beneath a wall advertisement for Sanborn and Vail Wholesalers [ 4432 ( part 1 ) ] .
As the camera approaches the Stockton / Ellis Street intersections , a shuttered electric streetcar ( perhaps a mail car ) crosses from Ellis Street [ 4596 ( part 1 ) ] .
For the next two blocks we will pass through the busiest portion of Market Street , with the main business district extending along the streets to the left ( north ) . [ 4766 ( part 1 ) ]
A policeman and a lady dressed daringly in white are seen at right before a jumble of Victorian facades between 4th and 3rd streets , and at center [ 5018 ( part 1 ) ] a father and sailor - suited son appear .
Beyond them [ 5580 ( part 1 ) ] we encounter an impatient commuter who raises a hand hoping to stop our cable car .
[ Cataloger 's note : the first 2060 frames of part 2 ( approx . 1:10 ) are repeated from the end of part 1 ] [ Frame : 2160 ( part 2 ) ]
A sign for " Pianos " is at upper right .
As the camera approaches the Kearny / Geary Street intersection , several buildings come into view .
At left the Mutual Savings Bank and , across Kearny , the Chronicle ( newspaper ) Building and the rear of the Crocker Building [ 2765 ( part 2 ) ] .
In the distance at the center is the Ferry Building , and closer in , the row of repeated bays is the great Palace Hotel ( 1873 ) , the largest and most luxurious hotel in the west .
Next to the hotel is the unfinished Monadnock Building and the white - walled Hearst ( Examiner newspaper ) Building ( 1897 ) at the corner of 3rd Street .
At the far right , ( on the near side of 3rd Street ) is the columned entry of the Call ( newspaper ) Building .
For obvious reasons , this Market Street intersection was called " Newspaper Row " or " Newspaper Corner . "
All of these buildings were rebuilt or refitted after 1906 .
Ahead [ 2970 ( part 2 ) ] an electric streetcar crosses the very busy intersection from Kearny to 3rd Street .
At left note the flags flying in the breeze while at right the camera passes a wooden structure built to protect pedestrians beneath the unfinished Monadnock Building .
[ 3490 ( part 2 ) ]
Well - dressed businessmen cross the street and ahead [ 3681 ( part 2 ) ] on the right are two newspaper boys .
Next , [ 4010 ( part 2 ) ] an electric sightseeing streetcar crosses to Kearny Street .
Note the activity at this busy intersection [ 4380 ( part 2 ) ] .
At left , in shadow , is the Crocker Building [ 4575 ( part 2 ) ] and beyond ( across the Montgomery / Post Streets intersection ) is the Union Trust Bank .
We pass a group of women in fashionable hats at right [ 4645 ( part 2 ) ] , and as we approach the Montgomery / Post Streets and New Montgomery Street intersection the Union Trust Bank and Hobart Building [ 4945 ( part 2 ) ] are seen at left , while on the right is the 1870 Victorian style Grand Hotel .
An automobile full of joyriders at left [ 6410 ( part 2 ) ] will return back to the Ferry Building from here .
Note the bright sunshine and strong shadows here , while the fluctuating light levels may indicate that fog is passing overhead .
Having passed through the heart of downtown , the camera approaches the Sansome / Sutter Streets intersection , where a Western Union clerk ( from his Hobart Building office ) hopes for a ride [ 6695 ( part 2 ) ] .
Next comes San Francisco's wholesale district , where coffee , tea , and spice companies , as well as various light industrial businesses , were located .
Note the many large drayage wagons [ 6927 ( part 2 ) ] .
Next is the Battery / Bush Streets and 1st Street intersection .
From here to the Ferry Building is filled land in the former Yerba Buena Cove of gold rush days .
At right is the Sheldon Building ( 1887 ) . [ 7358 ( part 2 ) ]
A businessman with very tight shoes crosses Market Street and later , [ Frame : 0100 ( part 3 ) ] a lady in a white - feathered hat boards a cable car .
The spired building on the left [ 0547 ( part 3 ) ] is the McColl Building , located at the Davis and Pine streets intersection ; the turreted O'Brien Building ( 1890 ) at right is at the corner of Fremont Street .
Note the express wagon ahead of the camera [ 1290 ( part 3 ) ] .
The boy looks out the back as the driver looks back from the side .
The black driver is the only non-white person seen in the film ( San Francisco 's population was 95 % white in 1905 compared to 49 % in 1993 ) .
[ 1400 ( part 3 ) ]
A Sutter Street horse car approaches at left behind a heavily - laden drayage wagon .
Ahead on the right is a General Arthur Cigars wall advertisement [ 2300 ( part 3 ) ] .
The Ferry Building clock reads 3:17 as a California Street horse car , enroute to the Ferry Building , crosses in front of us [ 3000 ( part 3 ) ] .
Note the water on the street [ 3455 ( part 3 ) ] ( probably from a morning shower ) and the advertisement on the wall at right for Nathan Hale Havana Cigars .
The camera approaches East Street ( today called the Embarcadero ) and the Ferry Building cable car turntable .
Note the small cable car staff booth .
A People 's Express van crosses in front [ 4659 ( part 3 ) ] , followed by a cart enscribed " Eureka , California . " [ 4710 ( part 3 ) ]
The cable car has reached the end of the line .
The Ferry Building cornerstone reads , " Erected 1896 by the Board of the State Harbor Commission . "
( The building opened in 1898 and was finished in 1903 . )
A man 's beard blows in the wind [ 5318 ( part 3 ) ] as the car turns on the turntable ( pushed by staff ) , panning across the north section of East Street .
Note the advertisement for Owl Cigars [ 5614 ( part 3 ) ] and the Hotel Terminus sign on Market Street [ 5776 ( part 3 ) ] .

Ben invited his mother over for dinner .
During the meal , his mother could n’t help noticing how beautiful Ben ’s roommate was .
She had long been suspicious of a relationship between Ben and his roommate and this only made her more curious .
Over the course of the evening , while watching the two interact , she started to wonder if there was more between Ben and the roommate than met the eye .
Reading his mom ’s thoughts ,
Ben volunteered , “ I know what you must be thinking , but I assure you , Allison and I are just roommates . ”
About a week later , Allison came to Ben and said , “ Ever since your mother came to dinner , I ’ve been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle .
“ You do n’t suppose she took it , do you ? ”
Ben said , “ Well , I doubt it , but I ’ll write her a letter just to be sure . ”
So he sat down and wrote : “ Dear Mother , I ’m not saying you ‘ did ’ take a gravy ladle from my house , and I ’m not saying you ‘ did not ’ take a gravy ladle .
But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner . ”
Several days later , Ben received a letter from his mother which read :
“ Dear Son , I ’m not saying that you ‘ do ’ sleep with Allison , and I ’m not saying that you ‘ do not ’ sleep with Allison .
But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed , she would have found the gravy ladle by now .
Love , Mom ”
Fires everywhere in London ’s commercial banking district .
At this moment , details of how the fires were started are sketchy , but from the number of buildings ablaze the chances of an accidental cause seem unlikely .
Pictures sent in to gnews suggest the scale and locations of the fires would point to a sophisticated coordination of deliberate arson which elicits fears of terror links .
Raised suspicions abound as the fires coincided with President Barack Obama ’s arrival in London amid heavy security .
Leaders and dignitaries of the most powerful countries have been arriving in London since the beginning of the week in preparation for the G20 summit .
In all the chaos , the BBC has yet to feature the story , but if London eye - witnesses have any photos , videos or details to add to as it develops then please send them through to Gnews as soon as possible .
London was the centre of international tension this week over the G20 summit where the world ’s leaders are due to convene tomorrow in order to discuss the future of the world ’s economy .
A number of internet forums planned protests against the G20 .
Furthermore , protesters complained : “ Capitalism has been heating up our world for years , melting the icecaps , burning up the rainforests , pushing the planet to tipping point .
Now we ’re going to put the heat on them . ”
On the website , protestors claimed they would reclaim London : “ thrusting into the very belly of the beast : the Bank of England . ”
On Tuesday , the BBC reported that terrorist suspects had been arrested in Devon after the discovery of imitation firearms and “ firework like ” explosives at a flat in Plymouth .
Five people were originally arrested and taken to custody in connection with the weapons ; one woman was released on bail .
Luckily , the weapons , along with politically sensitive material were seized by Police .
Detectives believe the intention of the Devonshire group was to cause severe disturbance at the G20 protests .
Fears were abound that violence could escalate to the levels of the 1990 Poll Tax riots .
Around the end of March , a 61 - year - old gang member was arrested in Tokyo for swindling housewives .
His modus operandi was to peddle apples door - to - door -- offering five for 1,900 yen -- and then shortchanging women who paid him with a 10,000 yen note .
The story , widely reported in the vernacular media , demonstrates just how hard members of underworld syndicates have been hit by the economic recession .
" A yakuza lives by his manhood , " a member of a rival syndicate frowns to Spa ! ( May 5 - 12 ) .
" No outfit that puts up with such things can justify its existence . "
But it seems that hoods down on their luck have been reduced to earning their livelihood through such menial tasks such as being paid to stand in line to purchase concert tickets ; serving as matchmakers for men who want to tie up with cheap mistresses ; pushing homeowners to renovate aging dwellings ; and finding tenants for vacant bars and other shops in " neon " areas .
Still others moonlight as cabbies .
" Some yakuza have been reduced to such straits that they hold meetings in fast food restaurants instead of coffee shops in hotels , " remarks author Manabu Miyazaki , whose late father headed a Kyoto gang .
" During the bubble era in the 1980s , it was nothing for the more flamboyant ones to go through several million yen a night at clubs in Ginza or Roppongi .
Now , I 'm amused by what I 've been hearing about how they get into disputes over just a few thousand yen . "
On the other hand , some newly hired salarymen , particularly those in such fields as finance and real estate , are so dissatisfied with their company 's low remuneration packages they 've found it financially advantageous to do moonlighting jobs for gangs .
" The gangs are faced with aging membership and are having trouble recruiting , so they 're willing to go along and accept part - timers , " another source tells the magazine .
Even if salarymen prove incompetent as part - time gangsters , they are still obliged to cough up the gang membership fees , which they can apportion from their regular income .
So that makes them a steadier source of revenues than destitute yakuza .
On the other hand , one might say the salarymen show no real commitment to the traditional yakuza regimen .
" It 's hard to nurture them in the ways of the yakuza , " the source concedes .
" And they 're not amenable to communal living that real yakuza go through during their apprenticeships . "
Meanwhile , flashy imported cars seem to be another yakuza standby on the way out .
" We 've been changing from sedans to passenger vans like the Toyota Hi-Ace , " a gang member tells the magazine .
" They cost more than sedans but they get better mileage . "
The vans can be ordered with smoked glass windows , to at least maintain a more sinister or menacing image .
They are also less likely to get their driver pulled over for spot - checks by police .
So be on your guard for vans with smoked windows , Spa ! advises .
Better to humbly yield the right of way than risk a run-in with an intimidating hood .

Howard Davidowitz , chairman of Davidowitz & Associates has an interesting take on the economy that I happen to agree with .
Please tune into " The Worst Is Yet to Come " : If You 're Not Petrified , You 're Not Paying Attention .
The green shoots story took a bit of hit this week between data on April retail sales , weekly jobless claims and foreclosures .
But the whole concept of the economy finding its footing was " preposterous " to begin with , says Howard Davidowitz , chairman of Davidowitz & Associates .
" We 're in a complete mess and the consumer is smart enough to know it , " says Davidowitz , whose firm does consulting for the retail industry .
" If the consumer is n't petrified , he or she is a damn fool . "
Davidowitz , who is nothing if not opinionated ( and colorful ) , paints a very grim picture : " The worst is yet to come with consumers and banks , " he says .
" This country is going into a 10 - year decline .
Living standards will never be the same . "
" We 're now in Barack Obama 's world where money goes into the most inefficient parts of the economy and we 're bailing everyone out , " says Daviowitz , who opposes bailouts for financials and automakers alike .
" The bailout money is in the sewer and gone . "
Bailout Money Wasted
" The Plan : Dump $ 500 billion of toxic assets on to unsuspecting taxpayers via a public - private partnership in which 93 % of the losses are born by the taxpayer . "
Chrysler Hijacked
Chrysler 's plan to close about 25 % of its dealers is the natural outcome of a series of very unnatural events surrounding its bankruptcy , says Howard Davidowitz , chairman of Davidowitz & Associates .
Barack Obama 's plan is to " sustain the union " in an effort to secure future votes in five key Midwestern states , Davidowitz says , without hesitation .
" We the taxpayers are bailing out the union [ and ] bailing out Chrysler , which is an inefficient company that should n't survive and can't survive in the long run , anyway . "
More generally , the Chrysler saga is evidence of how " we keep putting more money into hopeless companies , " he says .
" That 's not the American way .
We let inefficient companies collapse and be replaced by more efficient companies .
That 's the only way this economy can work . "
By propping up inefficient companies and keeping zombie banks alive , Davidowitz says " we are exactly on the same path as Japan , " which is now two decades into its economic malaise .
" That 's a big problem for the financial stability of the U.S. , " says Davidowitz , who had a hard time envisioning an alternative to a very grim scenario for America : " With big government , mad borrowing , and not letting things fail , there 's no way we can have [ rising ] living standards , " he says .
President Obama and Geithner have declared that it does not matter what the law says - they are going to do whatever the hell they want .
They just got done ramrodding Chrysler bondholders with the exact same " deal " , shoved down their throats , and allegedly enforced with threats of tax audits and other jackbooted actions if the bondholders resisted in court .
FDR 's policies prolonged Depression by 7 years
Two UCLA economists say they have figured out why the Great Depression dragged on for almost 15 years , and they blame a suspect previously thought to be beyond reproach : President Franklin D. Roosevelt .
After scrutinizing Roosevelt 's record for four years , Harold L. Cole and Lee E. Ohanian conclude in a new study that New Deal policies signed into law 71 years ago thwarted economic recovery for seven long years .
The policies were contained in the National Industrial Recovery Act ( NIRA ) , which exempted industries from antitrust prosecution if they agreed to enter into collective bargaining agreements that significantly raised wages .
Because protection from antitrust prosecution all but ensured higher prices for goods and services , a wide range of industries took the bait , Cole and Ohanian found .
By 1934 more than 500 industries , which accounted for nearly 80 percent of private , non-agricultural employment , had entered into the collective bargaining agreements called for under NIRA .
Cole and Ohanian calculate that NIRA and its aftermath account for 60 percent of the weak recovery .
Without the policies , they contend that the Depression would have ended in 1936 instead of the year when they believe the slump actually ended : 1943 .
NIRA 's labor provisions , meanwhile , were strengthened in the National Relations Act , signed into law in 1935 .
As union membership doubled , so did labor 's bargaining power , rising from 14 million strike days in 1936 to about 28 million in 1937 .
By 1939 wages in protected industries remained 24 percent to 33 percent above where they should have been , based on 1929 figures , Cole and Ohanian calculate .
Unemployment persisted .
By 1939 the U.S. unemployment rate was 17.2 percent , down somewhat from its 1933 peak of 24.9 percent but still remarkably high .
By comparison , in May 2003 , the unemployment rate of 6.1 percent was the highest in nine years .
Recovery came only after the Department of Justice dramatically stepped enforcement of antitrust cases nearly four - fold and organized labor suffered a string of setbacks , the economists found .
" The fact that the Depression dragged on for years convinced generations of economists and policy - makers that capitalism could not be trusted to recover from depressions and that significant government intervention was required to achieve good outcomes , " Cole said .
" Ironically , our work shows that the recovery would have been very rapid had the government not intervened . "
How Democrats Failed to Learn From FDR's New Deal
Franklin Delanor Roosevelt is popularly regarded as the man who saved democratic capitalism with vigorous governmental intervention .
But a distinction must be drawn between FDR the brilliant politician who prepared the nation for World War II and kept Britain afloat after the defeat of France , and FDR the economic illiterate .
In the 1930s , the conventional wisdom was that capitalism had failed .
FDR apparently never challenged that assumption .
But the failure of government – not the free market – created the Great Depression .
The economic collapse could have been avoided .
In many cases , FDR ’s policies deepened the depression and created needless hardship for those he sought to help .
Here ’s how :
Tax Hikes
FDR nearly tripled the tax burden between 1933 and 1940 , boosting excise , income , inheritance , corporate , and dividend taxes and slapping a tax on “ excess profits . ”
The highest individual tax rate soared to 79 % .
High taxes sucked money out of the private sector , smothered entrepreneurship and killed incentives to work and invest .
By contrast , Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon helped spark an economic boom in the 1920s by backing a plan to slash the top individual tax rate to 25 % from 73 % .
High Employment Costs
The New Deal raised the cost of employment , making it expensive to hire new workers and contributing to the nation ’s high unemployment rate .
The National Industrial Recovery Act and the Davis - Bacon
Act mandated artificially high wages , further crimping private employment .
The new minimum wage cut demand for unskilled workers .
The new Social Security tax raised compensation costs .
Compulsory union membership often fostered violent tactics – and the goal was n’t increased efficiency or innovative products to grab market share .
The WPA and other government agencies “ created ” jobs , but at great cost – private sector employment was lower in 1940 than it was in 1929 .
Brutalizing Business
FDR railed against “ economic royalists ” and “ privileged princes ” who sought to establish an “ industrial dictatorship ” and a “ new despotism . ”
Roosevelt issued about 3,700 executive orders , many limiting business activity , and let lose a plague of anti-trust lawyers on American industry .
New securities laws made it difficult to raise capital .

Quick notes before things get crazy
OK , things might get a little crazy in this blog post so let ’s clear a few things up before we get moving .
I like the gritty details , and this article in particular has a lot of gritty info .
To reduce the length of the article for the casual reader , I ’ve put a portion of the really gritty stuff in the Epilogue below .
Definitely check it out if that is your thing .
This article , the code , and the patches below are for Linux and OSX for the x86 and x86_64 platforms , only .
Even though there are code paths for both x86 and x86_64 , I ’m going to use the 64bit register names and ( briefly ) mention the 64bit binary interface .
Let ’s assume the binary is built with - fno - omit - frame - pointer , the patches do n’t care , but it ’ll make the explanation a bit simpler later .
If you do n’t know what the above two things mean , do n’t worry ; I got your back chief .
How threads work in Ruby
Ruby 1.8 implements pre-emptible userland threads , also known as “ green threads . ”
( Want to know more about threading models ?
See this post . )
The major performance killer in Ruby ’s implementation of green threads is that the entire thread stack is copied to and from the heap every context switch .
Let ’s take a look at a high level what happens when you :
Thread.new { 10000.times { a << " a " a.pop } }
A thread control block ( tcb ) is allocated in Ruby .
The infamous thread timer is initialized , either as a pthread or as an itimer .
Ruby scope information is copied to the heap .
The new thread is added to the list of threads .
The current thread is set as the new thread .
rb_thread_yield is called to yield to the block you passed in .
Your block starts executing .
The timer interrupts the executing thread .
The current thread ’s state is stored : memcpy ( ) # 1 ( sometimes ) :
If the stack has grown since the last save , realloc is called .
If the allocator cannot extend the size of the current block in place , it may decide to move the data to a new block that is large enough .
If that happens memcpy ( ) is called to move the data over .
# 1 ( sometimes ) :
If the stack has grown since the last save , is called .
If the allocator cannot extend the size of the current block in place , it may decide to move the data to a new block that is large enough .
If that happens is called to move the data over . memcpy ( ) # 2 ( always ) :
A copy of this thread ’s entire stack ( starting from the top of the interpreter ’s stack ) is put on the heap .
The next thread ’s state is restored .
memcpy ( ) # 3 ( always ) : A copy of this thread ’s entire stack is placed on the stack .
Steps 9 and 10 crush performance when even small amounts of Ruby code are executed .
Many of the functions the interpreter uses to evaluate code are massive .
They allocate a large number of local variables creating stack frames up to 4 kilobytes per function call .
Those functions also call themselves recursively many times in a single expression .
This leads to huge stacks , huge memcpy ( ) s , and an incredible performance penalty .
If we can eliminate the memcpy ( ) s we can get a lot of performance back .
So , let ’s do it .
Increase performance by putting thread stacks on the heap
[ Remember : we are only talking about x86_64 ]
How stacks work – a refresher
Stacks grow downward from high addresses to low addresses .
As data is push ed on to the stack , it grows downward .
As stuff is pop ped , it shrinks upward .
The register %rsp serves as a pointer to the bottom of the stack .
When it is decremented or incremented the stack grows or shrinks , respectively .
The special property of the program stack is that it will grow until you run out of memory ( or are killed by the OS for being bad ) .
The operating system handles the automatic growth .
See the Epilogue for some more information about this .
How to actually switch stacks
The %rsp register can be ( and is ) changed and adjusted directly by user code .
So all we have to do is put the address of our stack in %rsp , and we ’ve switched stacks .
Then we can just call our thread start function .
Pretty easy .
A small blob of inline assembly should do the trick :
__asm__ __volatile__ ( " movq %0 , %%rsp
\t " " callq *%1
" :: " r " ( th -> stk_base ) , " r " ( rb_thread_start_2 ) ) ;
Two instructions , not too bad .
movq %0 , % %rsp moves a quad - word ( th - > stk_base ) into the %rsp.
Quad - word is Intel speak for 4 words , where 1 Intel word is 2 bytes .
callq *%1 calls a function at the address “ rb_thread_start_2 . ”
This has a side - effect or two , which I ’ll mention in the Epilogue below , for those interested in a few more details .
The above code is called once per thread .
Calling rb_thread_start_2 spins up your thread and it never returns .
Where do we get stack space from ?
When the tcb is created , we ’ll allocate some space with mmap and set a pointer to it .
/* error checking omitted for brevity , but exists in the patch = ] */ stack_area = mmap( NULL , total_size , PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC , MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANON , - 1 , 0 ) ; th-> stk_ptr = th-> stk_pos = stack_area ; th-> stk_base = th-> stk_ptr + ( total_size - sizeof ( int ) ) /sizeof ( VALUE *) ;
Remember , stacks grow downward so that last line : th-> stk_base = ... is necessary because the base of the stack is actually at the top of the memory region return by mmap ( ) .
The ugly math in there is for alignment , to comply with the x86_64 binary interface .
Those curious about more gritty details should see the Epilogue below .
BUT WAIT , I thought stacks were supposed to grow automatically ?
Yeah , the OS does that for the normal program stack .
Not gonna happen for our mmap ‘d regions .
The best we can do is pick a good default size and export a tuning lever so that advanced users can adjust the stack size as they see fit .
BUT WAIT , is n’t that dangerous ?
If you fall off your stack , would n’t you just overwrite memory below ?
Yep , but there is a fix for that too .
It ’s called a guard page .
We ’ll create a guard page below each stack that has its permission bits set to PROT_NONE .
This means , if a thread falls off the bottom of its stack and tries to read , write , or execute the memory below the thread stack , a signal ( usually SIGSEGV or SIGBUS ) will be sent to the process .
The code for the guard page is pretty simple , too :
/* omit error checking for brevity */ mprotect ( th -> stk_ptr , getpagesize ( ) , PROT_NONE ) ;
Cool , let ’s modify the SIGSEGV and SIGBUS signal handlers to check for stack overflow :
/* if the address which generated the fault is within the current thread 's guard page ... */ if ( fault_addr <= ( caddr_t) rb_curr_thread->guard && fault_addr >= ( caddr_t) rb_curr_thread->stk_ptr ) { /* we hit the guard page , print out a warning to help app developers */ rb_bug ( " Thread stack overflow !
Try increasing it ! " ) ; }
See the epilogue for more details about this signal handler trick .
Patches
As always , this is super - alpha software .
Benchmarks
The computer language shootout has a thread test called thread - ring ; let ’s start with that .
require ' thread '
THREAD_NUM = 403 number = ARGV.first.to_i threads = [ ] for i in 1..
THREAD_NUM threads << Thread.new ( i ) do |thr_num| while true Thread . stop if number > 0 number -= 1 else puts thr_num exit 0 end end end end prev_thread = threads .
last while true for thread in threads Thread .
pass until prev_thread.stop ?
thread.run prev_thread = thread end end
Results ( ARGV [ 0 ] = 50000000 ) :
Ruby 1.8.6 1389.52s Ruby 1.8.6 w/ heap stacks 793.06s Ruby 1.9.1 752.44s
A speed up of about 2.3 x compared to Ruby 1.8.6 .
A bit slower than Ruby 1.9.1 .
That is a pretty strong showing , for sure .
Let ’s modify the test slightly to illustrate the true power of this implementation .
Since our implementation does no memcpy ( ) s we expect the cost of context switching to stay constant regardless of thread stack size .
Moreover , the unmodified Ruby 1.8.6 should perform worse as thread stack size increases ( therefore increasing the amount of time the CPU is doing memcpy ( ) s ) .
Let ’s test this hypothesis by modifying thread - ring slightly so that it increases the size of the stack after spawning threads .
def grow_stack n=0 , &blk unless n > 100 grow_stack n+1 , &blk else yield end end require ' thread '
THREAD_NUM = 403 number = ARGV.first.to_i threads = [ ] for i in 1..
THREAD_NUM threads << Thread.new ( i ) do |thr_num| grow_stack do while true Thread . stop if number > 0 number -= 1 else puts thr_num exit 0 end end end end end prev_thread = threads .
last while true for thread in threads Thread .
pass until prev_thread.stop ?
thread.run prev_thread = thread end end
Results ( ARGV [ 0 ] = 50000000 ) :
Ruby 1.8.6 7493.50s Ruby 1.8.6 w/ heap stacks 799.52s Ruby 1.9.1 680.92s
A speed up of about 9.4 x compared to Ruby 1.8.6 .
A bit slower than Ruby 1.9.1 .
Now , lets benchmark mongrel + sinatra .
require ' rubygems ' require ' sinatra ' disable : reload set : server , ' mongrel ' get '/' do ' hi' end
Results :
Ruby 1.8.6 1395.43 request /sec Ruby 1.8.6 w/ heap stacks 1770.26 request/sec
An increase of about 1.26 x in the most naive case possible .
Of course , if the handler did anything more than simply write “ hi ” ( like use memcache or make sql queries ) there would be more function calls , more context switches , and a much greater savings .
Conclusion
A couple lessons learned this time :
Hacking a VM like Ruby is kind of like hacking a kernel .
Some subset of the tricks used in kernel hacking are useful in userland .
The x86_64 ABI is a must read if you plan on doing any low - level hacking .
Keep your CPU manuals close by , they come in handy even in userland .
Installing your own signal handlers is really useful for debugging , even if they are dumping architecture specific information .

Epilogue
Automatic stack growth
This can be achieved pretty easily with a little help from virtual memory and the programmable interrupt controller ( PIC ) .
The idea is pretty simple .
When you ( or your shell on your behalf ) calls exec ( ) to execute a binary , the OS will map a bunch of pages of memory for the stack and set the stack pointer of the process to the top of the memory .
Once the stack space is exhausted , and the stack pointer is push ed onto un-mapped memory , a page fault will be generated .
The OS ’s page fault handler ( installed via the PIC ) will fire .
The OS can then check the address that generated the exception and see that you fell off the bottom of your stack .
This works very similarly to the guard page idea we added to protect Ruby thread stacks .
It can then just map more memory to that area , and tell your process to continue executing .
Your process does n’t know anything bad happened .
I hope to chat a little bit about interrupt and exception handlers in an upcoming blog post .
Stay tuned !
callq side - effects
When a callq instruction is executed , the CPU pushes the return address on to the stack and then begins executing the function that was called .
This is important because when the function you are calling executes a ret instruction , a quad - word is popped from the stack and put into the instruction pointer ( %rip ) .
x86_64 Application Binary Interface
The x86_64 ABI is an extension of the x86 ABI .
It specifies architecture programming information such as the fundamental types , caller and callee saved registers , alignment considerations and more .
It is a really important document for any programmer messing with x86_64 architecture specific code .
The particular piece of information relevant for this blog post is found buried in section 3.2.2
The end of the input argument area shall be aligned on a 16 … byte boundary .
This is important to keep in mind when constructing thread stacks .
We decided to avoid messing with alignment issues .
As such we did not pass any arguments to rb_thread_start_2 .
We wanted to avoid mathematical error that could happen if we try to align the memory ourselves after pushing some data .
We also wanted to avoid writing more assembly than we had to , so we avoided passing the arguments in registers , too .
Signal handler trick
The signal handler “ trick ” to check if you have hit the guard page is made possible by the sigaltstack ( ) system call and the POSIX sa_sigaction interface .
sigaltstack ( ) lets us specify a memory region to be used as the stack when a signal is delivered .
This extremely important for the signal handler trick because once we fall off our thread stack , we certainly cannot expect to handle a signal using that stack space .
POSIX provides two ways for signals to be handled :
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon
Once they cross that red line , there 's no turning back .
Princess Leia Organa ( after Grand Moff Tarkin ( after Grand Moff Tarkin wipes out Alderaan ) , Star Wars Radio Dramas
" Tarkin , if ever there was a shred of humanity in you or these twisted creatures of yours , it 's dead now .
You 're at war with life itself .
You are enemies of the universe ... your Empire is doomed . "

Named for the boundary around a black hole from which there is no escape once crossed , this trope uses the black hole as a metaphor for evil ; the Moral Event Horizon refers to the first evil deed to prove a particular character to be irredeemably evil .
Note the word irredeemably .
It is a demonstration of permanent evil : the moment which confirms that this character will always be a bad person .
The moment where you realize that it 's simply not possible for them to wash away that damned spot of blood .
The moment any Freudian Excuse they may have loses all meaning .
While they may not have had a term such as this to define it , many authors clearly recognized it .
Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land referred to it as being the result of an act that was " so bad , so black " that it was basically unforgivable .
Meanwhile , multiple religions have the concept of " perdition , " where those who have committed a truly unpardonable sin are irrevocably doomed to punishment in the afterlife .
Advertisement :
Obviously , it follows from the definition that a character can't cross this boundary more than once .
Crossing it implies going from redeemable to irredeemable , and that 's it ; the other way around contradicts the definition .
Of course , that does n't mean they 'll always be getting worse .
Sometimes a character who has crossed the horizon will invoke I 've Come Too Far afterwards ... but they have still crossed the line .
Yet there are ways to stem the descent into a true monstrosity .
Sometimes all that stands between man and monster is a Single Tear ... or even a full - out weep .
Perhaps a show of respect for the enemy .
A Heel Realization that you 've gone too far .
Sometimes they become The Atoner .
But the act has been committed , and they will never fully succeed ...
And since it 's subjective , some characters will think you 've crossed it , while others may be still prepared to believe in your possible redemption .
Advertisement :
Just as with a real black hole , the closer you come to a Moral Event Horizon , the harder you must try to escape .
A Complete Monster lives on the other side of the Moral Event Horizon , but crossing the Moral Event Horizon does not automatically imply that the crosser is a Complete Monster .
The character can just be unambiguously evil ( and maybe even somewhat sympathetic ) ; the Moral Event Horizon is a black mark in their history that can never be forgiven .
A character who performs an act that should make them irredeemable but somehow gets away with it is a Karma Houdini .
Unless they realize it , feel horrible , and work their ass off to atone for that crossing .
Then maybe it'll evolve into Forgiven , but Not Forgotten ; that one crossing certainly will stay as a black mark , but they 're working to be a better person .
Such instances , however , are rare .
If they are written to have successfully redeemed themselves in universe with no one making any mention of their actions and treating them as if nothing had happened , it is almost certainly the sign of a bad writer , especially since most redemptions of that sort involve lots of hand - waving , contrived retcons or future plot twists , extreme whitewashing and heavily skewed character interpretations , or ( sometimes ) significant Values Dissonance .
Sometimes , however , there is a positive usage of a Moral Event Horizon .
If , in a work , a villain seems to be too ineffectual and pathetic to be a threat , yet the show wants to insist that it's a dangerous villain , letting the villain cross the Moral Event Horizon can be a good way to establish that villain 's caliber , that they 're meant to be opposed and taken seriously .
In other words , it can save a supposed villain from being a failure of a villain .
At the same time , it has to make sense ; a straight - up joke villain who has always been averse to doing anything beyond petty crimes suddenly jumping to raping a baby or burning an innocent captive to death is going to feel a lot more contrived than an ineffectual villain who has also consistently shown themselves to be a complete scumbag who is 100 % evil and just sucks at pulling off villainous plots doing the same .
When a hero crosses a Moral Event Horizon and it becomes questionable whether they can still be qualified as a hero , this is Designated Hero .
When people decide in - universe that someone has crossed this line , the character in question is considered Beyond Redemption .
No Real Life Examples ,
Thanks !
For one , calling a real person a villain is not allowed here .
Secondly , whether or not a real person has crossed this line is way too debatable ; we have enough trouble with fictional characters at times .

Comic Strips
Plants vs. Zombies reminds us why we love PopCap games so much .
It takes a well - worn genre — the tower defense game — creates what seems like overly simplistic gameplay , and adds in a dash of cartoony graphics .
The trick is that PopCap then continues to twist and shape and pervert the basic gameplay until you 're in the middle of something devilishly tricky , second - guessing your earlier decisions .
This is pure crack , even if it looks like the cutest game with zombies you 've ever seen .
The concept is simple : you are in your house , the zombies are trying to get to you to eat your brains , and your lawn is your last defense .
Instead of a twisty path to the goal , your lawn is made up of a grid system of five lanes with nine rows , to start with .
The zombies wo n't move from lane to lane , and you can only put one plant on each square .
The power you use to plant your defenses is the light from the sun , and it either falls from the sky or is created by your sunflowers .
Title Plants vs. Zombies Developer PopCap Games Publisher PopCap Games Price $ 19.99 , or $ 9.99 via Steam Platform PC , Mac
It 's a constant game of risk vs. reward .
Do I plant more sunflowers — which offer neither defense nor offense but create more sun to create more plants , or do I start strong with plants that shoot peas at the zombies ?
Do I lay down a walnut to stop the encroaching hoard , or am I too worried about the zombies that can simply pole - vault over them ?
Is this is a good time to use one of my exploding plants , or would the ensuing crater ruin a slot I could be using for another weapon ?
Holy hell , is that Michael Jackson dancing the choreography to " Thriller " ?
If you think you have the game mastered , things change .
You may have to deal with swimming pools , which means you 'll have to plan a lilly pad before you can put down anything else .
Or , you may be fighting at night , which means you have to create all your own sun-power while relying mostly on fungus - based attacks .
And this is just the beginning of the ways the game changes to get you to rethink your strategy ; there are also 48 plants you eventually get access to , but you can only bring so many seeds with you into battle .
So picking your weapons becomes very important as time goes on , and everyone will find a few favorites to add to their arsenal .
More depth than there first appears
While each level starts off simply , and you quickly learn some strategies , it wo n't be long until you 'll find your play escalating into worrying about getting overwhelmed while trying to collect all the sunlight dropping from the sky , worrying about the defenses you 've laid , wondering if you picked the right seeds to bring into battle , and getting freaked out when the game announces that a huge wave of zombies is approaching .
It only looks easy at first , and then you realize just how much you 're being asked to do as you climb up the ranks .
Every level gives you new seeds , or even new game modes , which means that you 're constantly being rewarded by playing .
It 's nearly impossible to enjoy a play session without unlocking something or seeing something new , which helps to keep you entranced with the game .
The PopCap 's odd humor is also here in full force , making this is an oddly charming game for something that challenges you to not die a screaming death at the hands of the dozens of zombies laying siege to your house .
There are minigames ; there is a funny almanac to read ; there are puzzles .
You may get control of the zombies at some point .
You can just chill in the Zen Garden .
In sum , the game is absolutely filled with things to do , outside of the long main game .
For $ 20 , this is a great buy , although right now it can be found for $ 10 on Steam .
For those of us with Macs , there is a version compatible with Intel - based hardware that launched alongside its PC cousin on day one .
This is a trend we'd like to see continue , even if our PowerPC brethren howl in anger and frustration .
Plants vs. Zombies is filled with content and surprises , it 's inexpensive , it runs on PC and Mac , and it's a version of the Tower Defense idea that actually feels fresh .
The only downside is that for some the difficulty may take a while to ramp up , but it does get challenging as you progress and are faced with more , and tougher , decisions .
This is a hard game to walk away from , and we 're guessing the PC and Mac releases are only the beginning .
This is a game that would work well on the iPhone , the DS , the PlayStation Network , and Xbox Live arcade ; we can expect the addiction , just like the zombie apocalypse , to spread faster than we 're comfortable with .
If you value your free time , find something else to buy .
Just saying .
Verdict : Buy
Sun Microsystems is putting support for the new Open Virtualization Format into its VirtualBox 2.2 virtualization software .
Sun announced the availability of VirtualBox 2.2 April 8 , less than a month after unveiling the beta of its virtualization offering .
Incorporating support for the Open Virtualization Format , or OVF , was important , according to Sun officials .
The standard is part of the DMTF ( Distributed Management Task Force ) initiative .
The OVF enables virtual machines or appliances - essentially preinstalled and preconfigured virtual machines - to be imported and exported .
Due to the combination of the standard with VirtualBox 2.2 , users can build virtual machines and then export them from a test and development situation and import them into a production environment , Sun officials said .
It also increases the interoperability between VirtualBox 2.2 software and any other technologies that support the OVF standard .
" VirtualBox has always been a fantastic tool for developers to [ use to ] create multiple virtual machines , network them together and deploy them using nearly any operating system , " Jim McHugh , vice president of data center software marketing at Sun , said in a statement .
" Now , with the new import and export features of the VirtualBox 2.2 release , users can quickly and easily put their development environments into production , on the desktop , the server or even in the cloud . "
Other new features of VirtualBox 2.2 include ramping up the speed of the software through hypervisor optimizations , and three - dimensional graphics acceleration for Linux and Solaris applications using the OpenGL standard , which enables use of a new class of applications that can be run in a virtual machine .
There also is support for Apple 's upcoming 64 - bit Snow Leopard platform , an increase in maximum memory size of guests to 16GB and a new host - interface networking mode , which makes it easier for users to run server applications in virtual machines , Sun officials said .
Sun touted the growth of the use of VirtualBox , which has had more than 11 million downloads worldwide since October 2007 .
During that time , there also were 3.5 million registrations , Sun said .
The VirtualBox software is free for personal use , although for wider enterprise deployments subscriptions start at $ 30 per user per year .

Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said his country is n’t adding to its nuclear arsenal and does n’t have to disclose the location of its weapons to the U.S .
Pakistan is “ not adding to our stockpile as such , ” Zardari said today on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” program .
“ Why do we need more ? ”
Asked whether Pakistan would tell U.S. intelligence officials where all its nuclear weapons are located , to allow for a joint strategy to keep them secure , Zardari said Pakistan is a sovereign country .
Data caps and metered billing have generated significant consumer resistance not because the idea of metered billing is always bad , but because the new packages on offer feel like highway robbery .
Proponents of such caps , like Time Warner Cable , often claim that people need to " pay their fair share " in order to fund future upgrades , so we rounded the quarterly earnings statements out last week from the major US ISPs in an attempt to gauge how accurate that argument might be .
It turns out that just about everyone is making huge margins in Internet access , revenue is surging even as costs drop , and companies like Time Warner Cable have actually reduced ( significantly ) their capital outlays on infrastructure .
Even those cable companies that are in the midst of their DOCSIS 3.0 upgrades are posting significant profits .
Here are the highlights .
Comcast .
Revenues for Internet access from Comcast are up , jumping from $ 1.57 billion in the first quarter of 2007 to $ 1.75 billion in the first quarter of 2008 to $ 1.91 billion in the first quarter of 2009 .
Even as Comcast has grown both its subscriber base and its revenues , though , its expenses for " High - speed Internet " have consistently fallen since 2007 .
It cost $ 142 million to deliver Internet access in the first quarter of 2007 , $ 138 million in the first quarter of 2008 , and $ 120 million in the first quarter of 2009 .
Over that period , not only has Comcast handled an increasing number of Internet subscribers , but each one of those subscribers has presumably been transferring more data on average .
Essentially , the story is the same wherever we look : healthy operating margins in all telecommunications services , even as companies roll out faster Internet services , add more users , and as Internet use per person increases dramatically .
As with all of these systems , of course , the costs of delivering Internet access do n't give a complete picture , since the same expenses can sometimes affect multiple systems .
If a cable company upgrades its hybrid - fiber coax plant , for instance , was that a TV , voice , or Internet upgrade ?
In Comcast 's case , the numbers also do n't include " technical labor . "
But the numbers do show that the actual cost of running high - speed Internet connections is dropping even as revenues ( and subscribers ) grow .
This is a key metric because other costs , such as tech support and truck rolls , are not costs that vary with an individual 's monthly data usage .
As for the argument that cable companies need even more money from users to pay for upcoming , expensive Internet upgrades , the numbers suggest that cable firms are doing pretty well .
Comcast , for instance , has an operating cash flow margin of 39 percent in the first quarter of 2009 , up from 37.8 percent a year earlier and 37.4 percent in the first quarter of 2007 — and it has been rolling out the ( relatively cheap ) DOCSIS 3.0 upgrades for some time already .
Time Warner Cable .
Time Warner Cable , which kicked off the most recent debate over metered billing and Internet data caps , likewise posted some excellent first quarter numbers .
The company 's overall revenues were up five percent from a year before , but when broken down by category , Internet access did much better — 11 percent higher .
In its 2008 annual report , TWC also indicates that its Internet expenses had dropped by about 12 percent , even as the revenues increased .
Back when it was still issuing statements trying to justify its unpopular data caps , the company stressed that the business was a good one now , but that it needed plenty of future cash to pay for all the upgrades that higher Internet use was forcing on the company .
But in the first quarter of 2009 , the company substantially cut its capital expenditures , from $ 846 million a year ago to $ 769 million for this last three months .
The slide highlighting the drop is titled " disciplined capital deployment . "
Cablevision .
Cablevision has already spent most of the money for its DOCSIS 3.0 upgrades , which it plans to roll out across New York in less than two weeks .
" Up to " 101 M bps access will be available for $ 100 a month , with no apparent data caps .
Given that this was precisely the setup that Time Warner Cable said might ruin it without switching to a capped data model , how is Cablevision 's revenue situation ?
The company has yet to release its first quarter numbers , but we can get a clear sense of the trends from its 2008 annual report .
Internet revenues are up , voice revenues are up , and cable TV revenues are up .
The company does n't break out its Internet expenses , but it does note that its overall " cable television " operating income ( which includes data , voice , and TV packages ) was 25.9 percent higher in 2008 than it was in 2007 .
Its business Internet service , Optimum Lightpath , fared even better , with a 129.8 percent improvement in its operating income .
Essentially , the story is the same wherever we look : healthy operating margins in all telecommunications services , even as companies roll out faster Internet services , add more users , and as Internet use per person increases dramatically .
Qwest .
Voice revenues are dropping at Qwest , as they are at most telcos , but Internet revenue is up .
For the first quarter of 2009 , Qwest pulled in $ 350 million from " mass market " Internet customers , up from $ 333 million a year before and $ 276 million two years ago .
Qwest also generates a bit of cash from wireless services , but this is small and dropping quickly .
So with the only real revenue growth coming in Internet access , how did Qwest do in the quarter ?
It posted significantly reduced expenses and a 54.7 percent operating margin — its highest in the last two years .
The growth in Internet subscribers and the growth in data traffic among those subscribers simply does n't correlate in any way with huge new expenses or lower profit margins — quite the opposite , in fact .
AT&T / Verizion .
AT&T and Verizon have both put out quarterly earnings statements , but neither has the detail needed to know just what their Internet revenues and expenses are doing relative to each other .
We do know that both companies reported healthy growth in broadband , especially among the high - speed U-verse and FiOS services , and that neither imposes any specific data cap on its services .
Due to the nature of DSL and the FiOS fiber - optic network , neither company has much to worry about in the way of local congestion , either — something that can dog cable installations .
Even with all this growth and with the infrastructure spending that the fiber deployments entail ( even U - verse requires fiber - to - the - node ) , both companies report that their wireline units are doing well .
AT&T 's voice revenues dropped more than $ 1 billion year - over - year , for instance , but its wireline division still made money and posted a $ 300 million increase in broadband revenue .
The bottom line .
Internet upgrades have real costs , of course .
When cable users increase their data usage , the ISP eventually needs to spend some cash to split the local node or upgrade the CMTS ( cable modem termination system ) to DOCSIS 3.0 .
But the costs are n't ruinously high .
The largest ISPs peer most of their traffic ; apart from running the peering point , such exchanges of traffic between major ISPs are free .
The infrastructure used for both cable and DSL was already in place and paid for ; even in the case of Verizon , which is running an expensive new fiber network , the company still does n't need to impose data caps or proffer insultingly low monthly data plans to recoup its investment .
Companies can say what they like , but when it comes time to reporting the numbers , it 's clear that being in broadband is a good place to be .

I was startled the other day to hear someone say that since the economic downturn started , applications to acquire federal nonprofit status have climbed 30 percent .
I doubt there 's been a sudden surge to do good for one 's fellow man ( although some of the increase may be due to that ) .
Rather , it appears that there 's a sense that nonprofit organizations somehow have it easier than their for - profit brethren and that " going nonprofit " is a way to circumvent the current economic difficulties .
I 've long felt that there 's a substantial public misunderstanding of what it means to be a non-profit organization .
So , on behalf of all the hard - working 501c3 organizations in our county ( conservatively estimated by Nonprofit Enterprise at Work as numbering at least 900 ) , let 's explore some facts and some common misperceptions .
Nonprofit organizations are dedicated to contributing to the public good .
Fact .
This is the raison d'etre of nonprofits .
To be recognized by the federal government as a nonprofit organization and achieve tax exempt status ( under section 501c3 of the Internal Revenue Code ) , an organization must make a compelling argument that it is being formed for the public benefit , focusing on charitable , religious , educational , and / or scientific purposes .
Establishing nonprofit status can be a lengthy and costly process .
Fact .
Obtaining federal nonprofit status does not happen overnight .
It can take anywhere from 6 months to more than year to complete the bureaucratic application process and can ( although not necessarily ) cost hundreds of dollars in legal fees .
Becoming a nonprofit is a not a quick fix solution to a business ' financial difficulties .
Financial data about nonprofit organizations is a matter of public record .
Fact .
Nonprofit organizations with even minimal income ( $ 25,000 per year and up ) are required to file a Form 990 with the federal government .
This document mimics the familiar income tax form and requests information on an organization 's income and expenditures , plus its board of directors , key activities and other data .
Since nonprofits benefit from public largesse ( in the form of tax relief ) , this information is publicly available for anyone to review - a transparency that not every business owner might welcome .
Nonprofits are n't really important to the economy .
Misperception .
Michigan benefits from more than $ 100 billion in economic activity from the nonprofit sector , including hospitals , human services agencies , and thousands of interest groups .
In Washtenaw County alone , nonprofit arts and cultural organizations represent a $ 165 million industry ( in 2002 dollars ) , employing ca. 2,600 FTE .
Grants to nonprofits are available for picking .
Misperception .
Grants are not funds that are handed out like candy simply because an organization has 501c3 status .
To think of grants like welfare money for nonprofits is a gross misperception .
Rather , think of grants like RFPs ( requests for proposals ) of the nonprofit world .
A funder ( be it the State of Michigan or a private entity like the Gates Foundation ) wants to accomplish a certain goal , such as making arts and cultural activities available to more people or eliminating the incidence of AIDS in Africa ) .
A nonprofit organization submits a grant proposal offering a strategy for accomplishing the funder 's goal ( e.g. , presenting low - cost concerts in a park , undertaking AIDS research ) .
If the proposal satisfies the funder 's goals , the proposal may be accepted and funds awarded , just as might happen with a contractor proposing to build a highway or fill roadway potholes .
Nonprofits do n't know how to operate " like businesses . "
Misperception .
Given the excesses taken by some business people on Wall Street , at Enron , and elsewhere , let 's just say thank God nonprofits do n't act like businesses !
On a serious note , nonprofit organizations are businesses and behave accordingly : paying rent , meeting payroll , and delivering services , etc .
In addition , many nonprofits routinely attain higher standards , conducting annual financial audits ( necessary to apply for some grants ) and each year identifying ways to attract investors ( aka sponsors and donors ) .
Not to mention , many nonprofits accomplish their work by motivating unpaid workers ( aka volunteers ) to perform a multitude of tasks ranging from the mundane to the creative .
How many for - profit business leaders could run their operations with only a smile and a pat on the back to motivate the troops ?
The bottom line ?
We need both nonprofit and for - profit organizations to have a healthy and properous community .
When each sector focuses on what it does best , we all benefit .

EU lawmakers and governments agreed on new rights for Internet users Thursday , aiming to protect them from arbitrary crackdowns on those who illegally download music and movies on the Internet .
EU Telecoms Commissioner Viviane Reding said a deal was reached after EU governments agreed to EU parliament demands to balance measures against illegal downloaders with a broader set of rights for telecom users .
The reforms were two years in the making .
They also include new privacy controls , consumer rights and increased competition for Internet and phone services _ key improvements that have been overshadowed by the fight over digital user rights .
Thursday 's proposal also includes other reforms to overhaul Europe 's telecoms market .
They include setting up a new EU - wide telecoms authority charged with ensuring fair competition , bolstering consumers ' rights to switch mobile or landline telephone operators within one working day , and expanding digital networks to provide faster broadband Internet service for users in rural areas .

The Beatles are God ( which makes Him a quadrinity rather than a trinity .
But that is a fine point for further theological study . )
In the beginning was the word , and the word was Beatles .
To modern music they are the alpha and the omega , the beginning and the end .
Or check out The Beatles Poured Evil into This World , a ( satiric ) hardcore religious website , if you want to find out what they were really about .
But this dude is apparently dead serious about a pact with Satan in Evil Beatles .

While I was being tackled by security guards at Washington 's Convention Center during the AIPAC conference for unfurling a banner that asked " What about Gaza ? , " my heart was aching .
I was n't bothered so much by the burly guards who were yanking my arms behind by back and dragging me - along with 5 other CODEPINK members - out of the hall .
They were doing their job .
What made my heart ache was the hatred I felt from the AIPAC staff who tore up the banner and slammed their hands across my mouth as I tried to yell out : " What about Gaza ?
What about the children ? "
" Shut the f --- up .
Shut the f--- up . " one staffer yelled , red - faced and sweating as he ran beside me .
" This is not the place to be saying that shit .
Get the f--- out of here . "
What makes my heart ache is thinking about the traumatized children I met on my recent trip to Gaza , and how their suffering is denied by the 6,000 AIPAC conventioneers who are living in a bubble - a bubble where Israel is the victim and all critics are anti-Semitic , terrorist lovers or , as in my case , self - hating Jews .
I found it fascinating that AIPAC 's executive director Howard Kohr opened the conference admitting that there was now a huge , international campaign against the policies of Israel .
He painted a picture of 30,000 people marching in Spain , Italian trade unionists calling for a boycott of Israeli products , the UN Human Rights Council passing 26 resolutions condemning Israel , an Israeli Apartheid Week that is building a global boycott , divestment and sanctions campaign .
This global movement , he warned , emanates from the Middle East , echoes in the halls of the United Nations and the capitals of Europe , is voiced in meetings of international peace organizations , and is spreading throughout the United States - from the media to town hall meetings , from campuses to city squares .
" No longer is this campaign confined to the ravings of the political far left or far right , " he lamented , " but increasingly it is entering the American mainstream . "
But Kohr failed to explain why there has been such an explosion in this movement , even among the American Jewish community .
He did n't tell the attendees that the world was shocked and outraged by Israel 's devastating 22 - day attack on Gaza that left over 1,300 people dead - mostly women and children .
He did n't mention the killing of civilians fleeing their homes , the use of white phosphorous , the bombing of homes , schools , mosques , hospitals , UN buildings , factories .
He did n't talk about the continuing , cruel blockade of the Gaza Strip that is keeping desperately needed humanitarian aid from reaching 1.5 million people and making rebuilding impossible .
There were no seminars at the conference by human rights groups like Amnesty International that are calling for an immediate and comprehensive suspension of arms to Israel .
Instead , one after another , U.S. elected officials eager to curry favor with AIPAC pledged continued U.S. financial support for Israel .
Senator Kerry , despite that fact that he was one of only a handful of legislators who visited Gaza , did n't say one word about the massive destruction he witnessed and pledged that as Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , he would do everything to ensure that the $ 30 billion in military aid to Israel is " delivered in full . "
" America will continue our military aid , and Israel will keep its military strength , " he insisted .
Instead of calling for talks with the democratically elected government of Hamas , Kerry said : " Hamas has already won one election - we cannot allow them to win another . "
He ended his speech shouting several times in Hebrew , " Am Yisrael Chai - Israel lives ! "
Even Vice President Biden , who at least told AIPAC that Israel should freeze new settlement activity , did n't say a word about the ongoing humanitarian crisis caused by Israel 's invasion and continued blockade of Gaza .
No U.S. officials , and there were hundreds at the conference , dared echo the call of the United Nations or the world community to lift the siege of Gaza .
Republican Congressman Eric Cantor was one of the most emotional speakers , portraying Israel as the victim of an evil global movement determined to wipe out Israel and all Jews .
Evoking the " shivering , naked victims who were herded into the gas chambers , " he wondered when it would become too late to protect Israel .
" When is it too late ? " , he repeated over and over .
I wonder the same thing .
When is it too late , I wonder , to stop Israel from destroying itself ?
When is it too late to tell AIPAC attendees that more violence and hatred is not the answer ?
When is it too late to open the hardened hearts of my people , once victims of a terrible holocaust , to realize that by occupying Palestine we have become they evil we deplore ?
When is it too late to restore meaning to the Hebrew term " tikkun olam " by truly working to heal the world ?
When is it too late for the Jews of the world to weep for the children of Gaza , recognizing that they , too , are the children of God ?
I could n't ask my questions at AIPAC .
My mouth was muzzled by the sweaty hands of hate - filled staffers demanding that I " shut the f --- up . "
But despite AIPAC 's massive funds and influence , I feel certain that more and more members of the Jewish community will step forward and refuse to be silent .
I just pray it is not too late .

Tim Kassouf from Baltimore , 24 , who calls himself “ a certified voice mail hater , ” said he had 68 messages , 62 of them unheard , in his cellphone mail box .
Scott Taylor , 41 , a senior manager at an e-commerce company in Phoenix , said voice mail was “ just totally an ineffective communication method , almost ancient now . ”

Like many others , Mr. Taylor advises callers on his outgoing message to try his cellphone or to send an e-mail message if they need to reach him right away .
It is good advice .
Research shows that people take longer to reply to voice messages than other types of communication .
Data from uReach Technologies , which operates the voice messaging systems of Verizon Wireless and other cellphone carriers , shows that over 30 percent of voice messages linger unheard for three days or longer and that more than 20 percent of people with messages in their mailboxes “ rarely even dial in ” to check them , said Saul Einbinder , senior vice president for marketing and business development for uReach , in an e-mail message .
By contrast , 91 percent of people under 30 respond to text messages within an hour , and they are four times more likely to respond to texts than to voice messages within minutes , according to a 2008 study for Sprint conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation .
Even adults 30 and older are twice as likely to respond within minutes to a text than to a voice message , the study found .
There are no definitive studies of how many voice mail messages American leave compared with earlier periods , but if the technology is heading toward obsolescence  as many communication experts suspect  the trend is being driven by young people .
Again and again , people under 25 recount returning calls from older colleagues and family members without bothering to listen to messages first .
Thanks to cellphone technology , they can see who called and hit the Send button to reply without calling their voice mail box .
“ Did n’t you get my message ? ” parents ask .
“ No , ” their children reply , “ but I saw that you called . ”
Jack Cathey , 20 , a college student in Lewisburg , Tenn. , said his parents and grandparents continued trying to leave him voice messages despite his objections .
“ Do you know your voice mail ’s full ? ” a family member asked him recently , failing to comprehend that , for his generation , that might not be a problem .
Here is what Toronto is not : Toronto is not dirty , dangerous , or poor .
Toronto is not a hell of lost liberties or a babble of cultural incoherence or a ruin of failed institutions .
Yet a popular argument against high levels of immigration suggests it should be .
In his 2004 book Who Are We? : The Challenges to America 's National Identity , the late Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington warned that " the United States of America will suffer the fate of Sparta and Rome , " should its founding Anglo - Protestant culture continue to wane .
Commenting sympathetically on Huntington 's argument , conservative writer John O'Sullivan asserts that if traditional patterns of national life are " removed or destroyed , then anomie , despair , and disintegration tend to be among the consequences . "
So we must take care to protect our precious cultural patrimony from the acid of " denationalizing " economic and cultural globalization .
We must keep outsiders out .
Successful societies ( so this argument goes ) owe their liberty and prosperity to distinct institutions which , in turn , depend on the persistence and dominance of the culture that established and nurtured them .
Should that culture fade — or become too diluted by the customs , religions , and tongues of outsiders — the foundation of all that is best and most attractive about that society cannot long last .
But somebody forgot to tell Toronto !
Nearly half the denizens of Canada 's most populous metropolis were born outside the nation 's borders — 47 percent according to the 2006 census , and the number is rising .
This makes Toronto , the fifth biggest city in North America , also the most diverse city in North America .
Neither Miami , nor Los Angeles , nor New York City can compete with Toronto 's cosmopolitan credentials .
Here is what Toronto is : the fifth most livable city in the world .
So said the Economist Intelligence Unit in a report last year drawing on indicators of stability , health care , culture , environment , education , and infrastructure .
( The Economist 's world champion of livability , Vancouver , harbors a treacherous 40 percent foreign - born population . )
Toronto is wealthy , healthy , well - educated , and much safer than any sizable American city .
In 2006 , its murder rate was 2.6 per 100,000 residents , which makes it less than half as deadly as Des Moines .
The most culturally mixed city on the continent truly is one of Earth 's closest approximations of urban paradise .
Of course , Canada 's legacy of slavery and segregation is far less brutal and defining than is America's .
And Canada does not share a long border with a much poorer country , millions of whose people will cross it looking for opportunity no matter what the law says .
High levels of low - skilled immigration from Mexico and Central America create real problems in the United States , and Americans are right to worry about them .
But these problems have solutions ( guest - worker programs , not walls ) and imply nothing about the general viability of healthy immigrant - rich societies .
The United States , this fabled land of immigrants , has fallen dismally far behind countries like Australia and Canada in openness to immigration .
The Statue of Liberty may as well be moved to Vancouver 's English Bay where the " huddled masses yearning to breathe free " are now rather more welcome than in New York Harbor .
Many Americans , convinced by arguments like Samuel Huntington's , have come to believe that the institutions we so rightly cherish are too dependent on a feeble , endangered cultural inheritance to survive the bustling presence of strange languages , exotic gods , and pungent foods .
That cultural fragility argument is false , and it deserves to die .
Toronto , which has an Anglo - Protestant heritage as strong as any , has proved it dead wrong .
In fact , Toronto shows that a community and its core institutions can not only survive a massive and growing immigrant population but thrive with one .
Multicultural Toronto and cities like it prove that the institutions of liberal modernity are robust .
Life within them is so good that people the world over flock to them .
And newcomers do not take these institutions for granted .
They have a stake in seeing them last .
They can and do make them stronger .
None of this is to say that Toronto does n't have its problems .
( Or that it ’s not boring to New Yorkers . )
But we would do well to learn the lessons of cultural accommodation and integration from our neighbors to the north .
American cities could host much larger immigrant populations and thrive .
Maybe someday an American city will place in the top 10 on the list of the world 's most livable places .
Maybe — if it becomes more like Toronto .
A report intending to portray the iPhone as " hated " in the Japanese market turns out to have been built upon fake quotations from industry writers and observers who were misrepresented by remarks attributed to them that they never made .
Their actual comments on the iPhone 's prospects in Japan are far more interesting .
A Wired article by Brian X Chen intended to correlate Softbank 's new promotional pricing for the iPhone in Japan with a national hatred of the device that left it without any buyers .
To write the article , Chen contacted Nobi Hayashi , a journalist in Japan who has frequently written on the smartphone market , to ask for his comments .
While Hayashi presented an extensive and interesting reply , his feedback did not show up in the article .
The Panasonic P905i : too complex or wonderful ?
Instead , Hayashi was cited as praising a Japanese phone and writing off the iPhone as lame .
â The cellular weapon of choice in Japan would be the Panasonic P905i , a fancy cellphone that doubles as a 3 - inch TV and features 3 - G , GPS , a 5.1 - megapixel camera , and motion sensors for Wii -style games .
' When I show this to visitors from the US , they 're amazed , ' according to journalist Nobi Hayashi , who adds , ' Carrying around an iPhone in Japan would make you look pretty lame .
'ââ 
Chen did n't interview Hayashi to write the article ; instead , Hayashi's comments about the P905i were lifted from another , earlier Wired interview with Haysashi from last summer .
In that piece , his comments were actually contrasting the flashy but excessively complex features of typical Japanese phones with the usability of the iPhone :
Hayashi owns a Panasonic P905i , a fancy cellphone that doubles as a miniature but crisp 3 - inch TV .
In addition to 3G and GPS , the device has a 5.1 - megapixel camera and motion sensors that enable Wii -style games to be played sitting on the train .
â When I show this to visitors from the U.S , they 're amazed , â Hayashi says .
â
They think there 's no way anybody would want an iPhone in Japan .
But that 's only because I 'm setting it up for them so that they can see the cool features .â 
In actuality , Hayashi says , the P905i is fatally flawed .
The motion sensors are painfully slow , and the novelty of using them is quickly replaced with frustration .
And while being able to watch TV anywhere is a spectacular idea , there 's no signal in the subways , and even above ground , the sound cuts out every few seconds .
After seeing the Wired article , Hayashi pointed out in his own blog that his comments on the P905 i were not only taken out of context , but also rather dated , as that model is from late 2007 .
He also says he never called the iPhone too lame to carry .
â My cellular weapon of choice , of course , â Hayashi wrote , âis an iPhone and my cellular weapon of choice to the foreigners is INFOBAR2 and I do n't even dare to charge my P905 i these days.â 
After Hayashi complained about being misrepresented , Chen edited the article to say â His cellular weapon of choice when he spoke to Wired.com June 2008 ?
A Panasonic P905i , a fancy cellphone that doubles as a 3 - inch TV .
It also features 3 - G , GPS , a 5.1 - megapixel camera and motion sensors for Wii-style games.â 
Who said iPhones are âpretty lameâ ?
The quote originally attributed to Hayashi , â Carrying around an iPhone in Japan would make you look pretty lame , â was then implied to come from another source in an updated version of the Wired article :
Cellphones are also more of a fashion accessory in Japan than in the United States , according to Daiji Hirata , chief financial officer of News2u Corporation and creator of Japan 's first wireless LAN .
And carrying around an iPhone in Japan could make you look pretty lame .
After seeing that line now attributed to him , Hirata responded that he'd never met Chen .
â I have never said ' And carrying around an iPhone in Japan could make you look pretty lame . '
I think most Japanese think iPhone is the coolest item .
At least I have and love iPhone.â 
Hirata had also been interviewed in a previous Wired article , where he made comments about phones in general as a fashion item , but those comments were n't even in regard to the iPhone .
â Cellphones are always part of any conversation , â he says .
â People are always using them and holding them , even in the middle of a meal , so they might not think you 're hip if you 're carrying an old one .â 
â If I am asked about iPhone as fashion view , â Hirata added in his defense in his own blog , â I will answer I feel iPhone is very fashionable and many Japanese too .
And I love the internet so I love iPhone.â 
Chen again changed his article , this time leaving the line about iPhones âlooking lameâ unattributed as an idea Chen himself originated : â Cellphones are also more of a fashion accessory in Japan than in the United States , according to Daiji Hirata , chief financial officer of News2u Corporation and creator of Japan 's first wireless LAN .
So that would suggest that in Japan , carrying around an iPhone â an outdated handset compared to Japanese cellphones â could make you look pretty lame.â 
News waits for no man
On his own site , Hayashi added , â I am a journalist .
And I used to be young .
And I sort of understand Brian Chen wanted to draw the conclusion fast .
Make a sensational article and become popular ( in my days , they were called yellow journalism .
I hope it does n't have any racial connotations ) .
When I blamed him , he used the very popular tactic of ' your answer did n't make it in time for deadline .'â 
But Hayashi notes that he promptly wrote up an extensive reply to Wired , as requested by Chen in an email soliciting his thoughts on the Japanese market : â I understand you 're pretty knowledgeable about cellphones in Japan , and I was wondering if you could happened to know why the iPhone is failing there .
Would you mind sharing your insights in this e-mail ?â 
Hayashi's reply , sent within same day , did n't provide Chen with the facts he was hoping to use .
â To answer your question , â Hayashi answered , â I do n't think iPhone is such a big failure in Japan.â 
i Phone failure invented in the media
â The perception of iPhone being a failure was created by a newspaper in Japan , Sankei Shimbun , â Hayashi noted in his original reply to Wired .
â Last fall , it wrote although Softbank tried to sell one million units by the end of 2008 , they only sold about 200,000 .
This article was wrong in two fronts .
â One is that Softbank nor Apple never publicly claimed they would sell 1 million units .
Second , their estimate of 200,000 units were also wrong .
Although Apple nor Softbank releases the real number of shipment , today , it is strongly believed that they have shipped more than 300,000 and possibly near 400,000 units in Japan .
â Interestingly , despite the negative press , Sankei Shimbun did release one of the most successful iPhone app in Japan after that article in which you can read the full Sankei Shimbun newspaper .
Also on January 11th , 2009 they looked back how iPhone did in the first six month and seem to have concluded it was n't that bad after all.â 
Changes in the Japanese market
â In December 2007 , â Hayashi wrote , âaccumulated number of cellphones in Japan surpassed 100,000,000 .
Today , more than 90 % of Japanese adults have one or more cell phones .
And some analyst have started warning the slow down of mobile phone sales in Japan .
â Some were optimistic because Japanese people change their cell phones so often .
Many people Chenge their phones in 1.5 - 2 years and those techie geeks would but a new phones almost every six months or so .
But this had to change , too .
â 2008 was a big turning point for Japanese mobile industry .
In early 2008 , Japanese ministry of internal affairs and communications asked all the mobile phone operators to change the way they sell their cell phones .
Before that Japan was abundant of 1 yen cell phones and even 0 yen cell phones with the real cost hidden in the 2 year contract and higher than international average monthly fee .
The ministry asked to display the real cost of the phone unit at the store front .
And because R&D cost for the Japanese high - tech phones kept going up for the past few years , the customers finally realized the real cost of the handset were actually more than 30,000 yen ( about $ 300 ) for the mid-range and more than 80,000 yen ( $ 800 ) for the high - end phones .
â Although , few people are paying it in full and are rather paying it monthly for 2 years ; still this notion of the real price deeply discouraged people from buying a new phone .
Then came the bad economy .
â So 2008 was the year that Japanese mobile phone industry sunk ; the total unit shipment of all operators combined went down for 18.7 % ( according to Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association ) to 42 million units which makes iPhone almost has the 1 % share ;
In January 2007 , Steve Jobs said he will have 1 % share of the worldwide market .
Well , in Japan , too .
They got that number of share in this very competitive market.â 
SoftBank in Japanese culture
Hayashi also commented on matters related to SoftBank , Apple 's exclusive mobile provider in Japan , including its signal coverage , market perception , and advertising .
â Of course , SoftBank is not perfect , â Hayashi wrote .
â In my perception , SoftBank has a few glitches as well [ that may impact iPhone adoption ] .â 
â One is the wireless coverage .
Although the coverage is more than 97 or 98 % ( ca n't find the figure right away , will check , if you need it ) much better than the average of US operators , it is still lower compared to NTT DoCoMo and KDDI .
But there is a reason .
The other two major carriers have access to 800 MHz frequency which the new comer SoftBank was not allowed to use ; SoftBank expect the government will license it but it wo n't happen until 2015 .
â Second , even though they make the most beloved TV commercials still they lack credibility from the older traditional Japanese .
Just as there are so many Windows users who would never even bother to try a Mac , there are so many NTT DoCoMo users who would never even bother to switch the operators .
Because you can trace back the root of NTT DoCoMo to the government owned Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation , people just trust it by it .
â And because SoftBank is a company run by Korean - Japanese businessman , Masayoshi Son , some older generation are skeptical .
Perhaps , there could even be racial discrimination involved , but whatever SoftBank does , bad press follows it .
SoftBank is struggling to build credibility toward Japanese press about the ' SoftBank would soon go bankrupt ' rumors ; if I go to quarterly report , most of the American Financial analyst and press ( and some Japanese ) seem to be convinced by what Masayoshi Son says , the bad press still continues .
â But if that turns out to harm the iPhone sales in Japan , I think Apple will change their deal with SoftBank and start selling iPhone through NTT DoCoMo as well .
Actually , Japanese press , including me , has been writing this for a long time ; and I think this has been harming SoftBank iPhone sales , too .
Those iPhone fans who use NTT DoCoMo right now kind of waited until the DoCoMo version comes out .
Some gave up and switched to SoftBank , some can't switch , so they added iPhone as the second phone , but there are still many who can't take either way and sticking with the old NTT DoCoMo phone .
â After iPhone came out , NTT DoCoMo had to go through a major re-organization but I believe they are still interested in iPhone.â 
i Phone is a paradigm shift
Sources cited in the Wired piece were n't the only Japanese writers to comment on it .
â As a long - term resident of Japan and Japanese cell - phone user , I think my iPhone is great in many ways , â Rick Cogley wrote on his own site .
â Japanese cell phones are indeed ' cutting edge , ' sure , but a lot of the stuff on them is gimmicky and used infrequently if at all .
I hear mention of ' 1Seg ' TV , but talk about an unpleasant user experience .
Watching TV was so confusing on my KDDI AU phone , that I gave up , even after reading the thick manual ( yes , I read Japanese ) .
Apple spends great gobs of time and money to make sure their Apps are not like that , though .
Apple products are of course not without their problems , but , they 're pretty easy to use .
That 's a huge accomplishment that the feature - hoarders making Japanese cell phones have not understood .
Are you listening , Panasonic , Kyocera , NEC , Sharp?â 
Cogley specifically noted a series of problems plauging Japanese phones :
Different interface per maker .
Kyocera is different from Sony is different from Sharp .
New software to sync with Outlook every time you buy a new phone and limited options to sync with Apple OS X Address Book .
Different data format per phone , which makes migrations hard .
Special formats required for built - in music players , especially Sony .
What a chore to get mp3's onto a Sony for playback !
Number portability was not an option until fairly recently .
Now , at least you can keep your number from company to company , for a monthly fee .
Limited standards adoption , for example in that only a proprietary bluetooth headset can be used with the device .
Incredibly poor English language text entry handling .
My last AU phone from Sony could not enter a space in certain modes and a carriage return in others !
Limited ability to switch interface into English .
Sony allows this , but my Sharp from a year before did not , for instance .
â Apple 's user interfaces are truly high quality compared to those of Japanese cellphones , but there are indeed a number of aspects about the iPhone which would pose a barrier to adoption , especially for a person very used to the Japanese cellphone ways or modes .
No infrared data or personal information exchange , none of the Japan - only stuff like Suica ( train pass ) or ' wallet ' function ( auto - debit credit card ) , no hook for a strap , and a different text entry method are some of the things that feel like obstacles .â â Apple 's user interfaces are truly high quality compared to those of Japanese cellphones , but there are indeed a number of aspects about the iPhone which would pose a barrier to adoption , especially for a person very used to the Japanese cellphone ways or modes .

Actual performance of the iPhone in Japan
Despite the upheaval in the Japanese mobile market described by Hayashi and the global economic downturn , reports of the iPhone 's demise in Japan and its purported lack of interest among the Japanese are particularly strange given that the iPhone 3G launched so successfully that it resulted in SoftBank grabbing up 215,400 new activations , more than half of the 391,500 new activations made in Japan , during its launch in July .
â We believe our large net growth was an iPhone effect , â SoftBank representatives said .
While the iPhone lacked some of the widely touted missing features of other Japanese phones , its full web browser and innovative multitouch user interface captivated users .
â Just the interface itself is enough reason for me to buy the iPhone , â Andrew Shuttleworth told MacWorld .
Apple 's success in selling the iPod to the Japanese market also helped pave the way for adoption of the iPhone 3G there .
And its notable missing features , including the â1 Segâ TV , were addressed by a wireless transmitter SoftBank began selling for iPhone users .
It rebroadcasts the UHF signals to the iPhone via WiFi .
This all happened before
Just a couple months after the iPhone 's Japanese launch , the Wall Street Journal attempted to similarly explain why the iPhone was supposedly failing in Japan .
That article was based on numbers from a market research company derived from a customer survey , not hard sales numbers .
It also assumed an initial goal of selling a million iPhones at launch , a goal that neither Apple nor SoftBank ever suggested .
The story of the failure of the iPhone to launch in Japan was itself recycled from the previous year , where it was widely reported that the iPhone had failed to meet a phony target of a million unit sales in its first weekend in the US .
In reality , Apple 's first weekend of sales netted over a quarter million sales , far above those of any other model on the market and one of the most spectacular consumer electronics product launches ever .
Apple 's entry into the smartphone market has faced fierce assaults in the media from groups who publish press releases based on dubious data more flattering to the companies that pay them to generate those reports than to Apple .
One recent example is ABI Research , which published a backhandedly condescending press release crediting Apple with finally reaching 1 % market share in the global mobile market , rather than comparing Apple 's sales to other smartphones .
Check out this demo reel of Levi Meeuwenberg doing some jaw - dropping " free running " .
Free running is very similar to Parkour in the athleticism required and specific techniques and movements used , but while Parkour is about getting from one place to another in as efficient a manner as possible , free running is less directed and more creative in nature .
As mentioned in that ancient post , when performing either of these activities , in addition to spending years developing a formidable set of technical skills , balance , physical strength , and kamikaze attitude , it 's important to be cognizant of some basic physics .
In order to lessen the impact upon landing after a fall , or to decrease the force upon a set of fingers while grabbing onto a wall , it is essential to reduce the acceleration during each collision as much as possible .
This requires increasing the time of impact by smoothly bending , flexing , or rolling during impact .
Let 's apply some of the physics by taking a quantitative example .
During impact with the ground , there are essentially two forces acting on your body -- the downward force of gravity and the upward force of the ground .
Applying Newton 's second law we get :
Fnet = Fground \- mg = ma
where mg is the weight force ( a.k.a. the force of gravity ) acting on your body .
So let 's say that Levi jumps from a height of 3.0 meters onto the ground .
How much force is the ground going to exert on him during impact ?
First , let 's apply conservation of energy to determine Levi 's speed just before contact .
The gravitational potential energy ( mgh ) due to his initial height relative to the ground is going to be converted into kinetic energy ( ½ mv2 ) just before landing .
So
Mgh = ½ mv2
and v = [ 2( 9.8m/s2 ) ( 3.0 m ) ]
1/2 = 7.7m/s
Now we have to bring him to a stop .
Let 's assume the lithe and wiry Levi has a mass of approximately 70 kg .
Now because
Fground = m(g + a ) = 70 kg ( 9.8 m/s2 \+ a )
we can see that the force of impact depends on the acceleration .
But a = Δv / Δt and therefore depends on the time of impact .
If he were to foolishly land on his heels with rigid locked knees this would result in a very small impact time -- as little as 0.01 or 0.02 seconds for this type of collision .
The result ?
Fground = 70 kg ( 9.8 m/s2 \+ 7.7m/s/0.01s ) = 55,000 N ( or about 12,000 pounds ) .
Ouch !
However , by bending and rolling , the time of impact can be increased to as much as 0.3 or 0.4 seconds .
By decreasing his velocity over this extended period of time , the force is substantially reduced .
Applying the above calculation with an acceleration time of 0.4 seconds we now get Fground = 2000 N ( 460 pounds ) .
It 's still a significant force but as you can see in the video quite manageable for someone with the proper skill , strength and technique .
Speaking of landing on the heels , notice that Levi never does that .
Impacts are always taken with the ball of the foot .
Landing on the ball allows for an increased impact time and less compression on the legs .
Now recall some previous posts on running shoes .
Did we not decide that the most efficient stride technique involved a mid- to fore - foot strike ?
It seems reasonable to propose that the most efficient stride is also the most natural stride for the running human , and might be expected to result in fewer injuries , relative to the much more jarring heel strike .
Most running shoes have big padded heels , making it easy for the unwary jogger to strike with the heels .
However , running barefoot , it 's relatively impossible to do that .
It 's just too painful .
You automatically impact on the front of the foot , much like Levi does when sticking a landing .
Interesting .
We 've talked about a pair of shoes meant to simulate barefoot running .
But what about the real thing ?
What about barefoot running itself ?
To be continued ...!

An Australian teenager , who was born female but lives as a male , has been given permission by a court to have both breasts surgically removed .
The 17 - year - old , known as Alex in court and referred to as a boy , has a psychological condition that makes him unhappy with his gender .
The Family Court in Melbourne said the removal of both breasts would help Alex to build a new life as a boy .
The decision has angered Catholic groups , who view it as irresponsible .
Alex has " gender identity dysphoria " , a psychological condition where a person believes they are the opposite sex , the Age newspaper reported .
Alex has been on hormone treatment since he was 13 to prevent menstruation , it said .
Social development
He applied to the court for a double mastectomy before he turned 18 - the age at which he would not need the court 's consent and which he would no longer receive social support services as a minor .
Family Court chief justice Diana Bryant said Alex , who lives life as a male , was socially constrained by the breasts , avoided being hugged and wore binding at the beach .
" So it was quite an impediment to his social development , which everyone thought was very important , " Judge Bryant was quoted as saying by the Age .
" Overwhelmingly , the evidence was that it was in his interests .
And I made that order .
" I wanted to make it quickly so that he could have the operation straight away . ''
Critics say that such radical surgery on a 17 - year - old is irresponsible and premature .
Campaigners have said that a man from Melbourne who had a sex - change operation in his early 20s was now suing his doctors because he regretted the decision .
Google ’s Chrome 2.0 web browser is now available as a public beta .
While still not quite ready for prime time , the Chrome 2.0 beta boasts some impressive speed gains , making it well worth the risk of using beta software .
The Chrome 2.0 beta features an updated version of the WebKit rendering engine , which powers not just Chrome , but Apple ’s Safari and other web browsers .
The version of WebKit in Chrome 2.0 is very close to same version that is part of Apple ’s Safari 4 beta release , which means not only is there a speed boost for Chrome 2.0 , but the browser also gets features like full - page zoom , autoscroll , and support for the same CSS gradients and reflections that Safari 4 offers .
Chrome ’s much - touted V8 JavaScript rendering engine has also seen an update , and Google claims that between the new version of WebKit and the new V8 engine , the Chrome 2.0 beta should be roughly twice as fast as Chrome 1.0 .
Windows users interested in giving the Chrome 2.0 beta a try , can grab the download from Google .
There ’s also good news for Linux users eagerly awaiting a usable version of Chrome .
While the “ usable ” part is still debatable ( Chromium for Linux is pre-alpha and lacks even support for basic features like tabbed browsing ) at the least the installation is a bit easier on Ubuntu and other Debian - based systems thanks to a new package installer .
Download Squad has more details on how to get the ( very experimental ) Chrome for Linux running on your system .
As for Mac users wanting Chrome , well , the project has seen some progress , but there ’s still not much to report ( and nothing to download ) .
You could always tide yourself over with Crossover Chromium , but realize it ’s a far cry from a true Mac-native version Chrome .

This is an attempt to demonstrate the existence of God using the Laws of Logic , also referred to as Logical Absolutes .
The oversimplified argument , which is expanded in outline form below , goes as follows : Logical absolutes exist .
Logical absolutes are conceptual by nature -- are not dependent on space , time , physical properties , or human nature .
They are not the product of the physical universe ( space , time , matter ) because if the physical universe were to disappear , logical absolutes would still be true .
Logical Absolutes are not the product of human minds because human minds are different -- not absolute .
But , since logical absolutes are always true everywhere and not dependent upon human minds , it must be an absolute transcendent mind that is authoring them .
This mind is called God.
Furthermore , if there are only two options to account for something , i.e. , God and no God , and one of them is negated , then by default the other position is validated .
Therefore , part of the argument is that the atheist position cannot account for the existence of logical absolutes from its worldview .
Increasingly fractious relations between the US and Israel hit a low unseen in nearly two decades today after the Jewish state rejected President Obama 's demand for an end to settlement construction in the West Bank and Washington threatened to " press the point " .
The dispute , which blew in to the open hours before Obama was to meet the Palestinian leader , Mahmoud Abbas , reflects the depth of the shift in American policy away from accommodating Israel to pressuring it to end years of stalling serious negotiations over the creation of a Palestinian state while continuing to grab land in the occupied territories .
Obama put down a marker at a difficult meeting with the Israeli prime
minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , in Washington this month when he demanded a halt to the perpetual expansion of settlements - which now house close to 500,000 Jews in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem - because they are a major obstacle to the establishment of an independent Palestine .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , pressed the point yesterday with an unusually blunt call for a halt to settlement growth , including the continued construction of so - called " outposts " , small informal settlements which are illegal even under Israeli law , as well as the building of new houses in existing Jewish enclaves which the government describes as " natural growth " .
Clinton said Obama " wants to see a stop to settlements - not some settlements , not outposts , not natural growth exceptions .
We think it is in the best interests of the effort that we are engaged in that settlement expansion cease . "
She said the Americans " intend to press that point " .
Israel is committed to stop all settlement construction under the 2003 US road map to peace .
Today the Israeli government spokesman , Mark Regev , said that construction will continue inside existing settlements .
" Israel ... will abide by its commitments not to build new settlements and to dismantle unauthorised outposts , " he said .
" As to existing settlements , their fate will be determined in final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians .
In the interim period , normal life must be allowed to continue in these communities . "
Israel defines normal life as the construction of homes to accommodate the children of Jewish settlers when they grow up and marry .
Critics say that almost nowhere else in the world is it considered a right to build a house next to your parents house .
Netanyahu has offered to remove 26 of more than 120 outpost settlements but both the US and Palestinians remain sceptical about Israeli commitments as similar promises have been made over recent years and repeatedly broken .
The former prime minister , Ariel Sharon , promised President George Bush to his face that the outposts would come down but instead the Israeli government continued to allow new ones to be constructed , often with the assistance of the military and other state authorities .
Settlements have long been viewed as a litmus test of Israel 's intent .
Even at the height of the Oslo peace process , Israel more than doubled the number of Jews it moved to live in the West Bank , raising fundamental questions among the Palestinians as to whether Israel was more interested in grabbing land than peace .
The dispute over settlements , and Netanyahu 's defiance of Obama 's call , is likely to set the tone for future relations as the White House attempts to radically change the US approach by pressing Israel to move swiftly toward serious negotiations to end the occupation and establish an independent Palestinian state .
Robert Malley , former special assistant for Arab - Israeli affairs to Clinton , said : " The surprise in this is not the Israeli position .
The surprise the forcefulness of the American one .
Rarely have we seen it at this pace and with this intensity and unambiguity .
The US has taken a position that does n't give much wriggle room at all to the Israeli government " .
But Malley said it remains unclear how far the White House will press Israel .
Some US analysts say that the settlement issue is a good one for Obama to use to press Netanyahu because even among Israel 's supporters in Congress there is not much backing for the continued expansion of Jewish enclaves in the Palestinian territories .
Other analysts say Obama will have to be careful not to allow a protracted dispute over the settlements to stall broader talks on the creation of a Palestinian state .
But questions remain over how far Obama is prepared to push Israel when Congress remains strongly sympathetic to the Jewish state and the pro- Israel lobby continues to wield powerful influence .
Obama 's public stand on settlements is also intended to strengthen Abbas who is politically weak and under pressure from Hamas .
Palestinian officials say Abbas plans to raise the settlement issue as one of the major obstacles to the peace process .
Israel 's intelligence minister , Dan Meridor , met in London earlier this week with the US Middle East envoy , George Mitchell , for follow up meetings after Netanyahu 's Washington visit at which the settlement issue was also pressed .

Democrats continue to have a field day with the Republican Party and Rush Limbaugh .
Tonight , the chairman of the DNC Tim Kaine , urged the GOP to stop following Rush Limbaugh and work with President Obama .
But , instead of joining Democrats in supporting the President ’s economic recovery plan , almost every single Republican in Congress chose to follow Rush Limbaugh by voting against a plan that will create or save 3.5 million jobs .
Now , instead of the denouncing Limbaugh ’s claim that he is rooting for the President to fail , my counterpart at the Republican National Committee proved who is really leading their party — calling Rush Limbaugh to apologize after courageously criticizing him just this weekend , ” Kaine said .
He continued , “ Americans want leaders who will work together to confront the challenges we face .
When Congress debates the President ’s budget , Republicans should stop following Rush Limbaugh and instead help the President create jobs , fix our schools , reform our health care system , make America energy independent , and lay the foundation for long - term growth in the 21st Century . ”
This is a smart strategy by the Democrats , because they have put the GOP on the defensive and completely taken control of the Republican message .
Advertisements
The bigger picture here is that after years of allowing the Republicans to frame their party first as the party of tax and spend , then as the home of those who hate America , the tables of have turned and the Democrats have made not Sarah Palin or Bobby Jindal , but Rush Limbaugh the angry white male face of the opposition party .
In the Democratic frame , the GOP is a bunch of out of touch blustering , bellowing , extremists .
Polling shows that the American people still trust the Democrats over Republicans by more than a 2 - 1 margin to fix the economy .
The Republican positions have proven only to be popular with conservatives .
Putting Rush ’s angry face on the GOP only serves to push Independents away from the GOP .
When Democrats suffered through a leadership vacuum , Republicans did the same thing to them .
If the Republican Party is n’t able to define itself , the Democrats will be more than happy to define them to the American people .
Democrats are also showing that behind the tough talk are a bunch of elected Republicans who are afraid of a talk show host .
The question Democrats are trying to provoke is , if the GOP ca n’t stand up to a formerly drug addled radio talker , how can they lead America ?
Irving D. Chais , who in his 45 years as the owner and chief surgeon of the New York Doll Hospital in Manhattan reattached thousands of heads , arms and legs ; reimplanted fake hair shorn by scissor - wielding toddlers ; and soothed the feelings of countless doll lovers , young and old , died on April 24 in Manhattan .
He was 83 and lived in Manhattan .
His daughter Dana Pisani said he died after a long illness .
In a cluttered , brightly lighted second - floor workshop at 787 Lexington Avenue , between 61st and 62nd Streets , Mr. Chais and two other doll doctors had hunched over operating tables ( well , work benches ) since 1965 .
Stacked nearby were boxes labeled “ hands , ” “ fingers , ” “ wrists , ” “ wigs , ” “ German eyes , ” “ French eyes , ” “ American eyes . ”
Lining the shelves and piled in boxes were thousands of dolls , new and antique , from as far away as Afghanistan and China .

On the surface debt elimination may sound far and away from what people think of when they think of survivalism .
The reality is the modern survival philosophy actually hinges on this tenet .
Before we delve deeply into the topic though lets just put it up against even the typical view of survivalism and ask if there is any place for debt - based living in the survival community .
Think of a typical image of a survivalist  even the stereotypical view : tough , able to live off the land , resourceful and ready to deal with any disaster .
Does this sound like the guy who whips out a Visa Card when the going gets tough ?
Would you expect to see a person working to build a homestead and a sustainable life using a credit card just for airline miles  ?
Or perhaps , would you expect someone living by the mantra of adapt , improvise and overcome to finance a lifestyle with a home equity loan ?
When I speak to mainstream media and they ask what is modern survivalism 
I always include debt reduction in the basic explanation and the response is generally some form or  that is another topic all together ,  the reality is the two are so intrinsically bound that you cant really discuss modern survivalism without addressing the cancer that is eating away at America , consumer debt .
Now there is a place to properly leverage debt ; very few people could afford to ever pay cash for a house , let alone a first house .
Still , even with the purchase of an asset like real property , debt is and has been abused for decades in the United States .
Say what you want about derivatives but it is debt that allowed their creation and default upon the debt that brought them to bear on our economy like a financial atomic bomb .
Survivalism is about far more then continuing to breathe tomorrow ; for the modern survivalist it is about sustainable living and above all survival of the family unit .
It is a sad fact that the number one cause of divorce today is debt and even when something like infidelity is blamed it is often the stress of debt that was the root cause .
When I refer to debt as a cancer ,  many people consider that an over statement .
Common responses are oh come on is nt that over reaching  or how can a person live without a credit card in 2009 .
So is debt really a cancer ?
To answer that lets examine exactly how cancer attacks and kills many people every year .
Most cancers that kill are at first unseen , the individual appears quite healthy and strong .
They go about their day - to - day lives as productive and happy individuals and look no different than those around them .
Yet inside the cancer is reproducing at an exponential rate , growing , metastasizing and spreading throughout the body .
This can go on for months or even years in many types of cancer .
The person might even go to their doctor often for checkups and be told everything is just perfect .
Cancer may be spreading to the pancreas and liver , setting up for a fatal blow but no symptoms are evident even to a trained professional .
Then one day the person starts to feel weakened , certain things that never caused pain now are creating discomfort .
Off to the doctor they go and even now are often just given a pain killer or some other drug and told they are just getting older all while the cancer is eating vital biological systems from inside .
In time the symptoms grow , tests are run and a diagnosis is made , often the prognosis is fatal , it is too late now to save the patient because the cancer has gone too far .
Faced with such a diagnosis patients first go into denial , then deal making ( usually with god and self ) , then anger , then acceptance .
They may still fight but they accept the reality that they will probably lose .
They try to live healthy , take any and every step to prevent eventual death but sadly for many , a lifetime of chemicals , stress and ignoring initial symptoms push the body too far and the battle is lost .
Now lets examine the effects of debt on an individual and see how it compares .
Consider a man ( we will call him Frank ) , Frank is 28 years old and got out of college about 5 years ago .
He was a good student but like many got through school on student loans .
For five years he has worked hard and paid minimums on his loans while climbing the corporate ladder .
He also met his wife , got married and now is about to buy his first house .
He buys a house with a payment of 25 % of their income , nicely inside the limit of 28 % .
Frank and his wife start a family , take vacations , use credit cards , have kids and live the  American dream . 
He keeps getting promoted so they upgrade the home ( everyone is doing it ) .
Frank is no fool ; he has a financial adviser who he meets with for checkups twice a year .
The advisor is comfortable with his debt because he is putting money in his IRA / 401 K like a smart investor .
Frank even suggests at times reducing contributions to increase his available cash and pay off debt but is advised to think long term and stay the course . 
Everyone looking at Frank from the outside sees his success , two new cars , and great kids in all sorts of activities .
One car is a huge SUV so mom can take the kids to soccer , etc .
He has a beautiful house , successful career and seems to be living a perfect life .
Yet inside his financial body all the debt is compounding exponentially and it is spreading too .
He gets a home equity loan , pays off some credit cards because it is smart .
After all he cuts the interest rates and the interest becomes a tax deduction .
Unfortunately in time the credit card balances go right back up and end up even higher then before .
More promotions come and more debt with them , trading up cars , now leasing them ( its what wealthy people do according to his financial adviser ) so he can trade them in every 23 years .
Everything is going just fine , minimal payments are made with ease and then the first symptom begins .
His wife take a break from shopping and does a bit of math and realizes that now at the age of 45 she and her husband will be 65 by the time all their debts are paid off if and only if they stop spending now .
She goes to Frank , they look at things and realize there is a problem , Frank talks about paying down some of the balance again with his advisor who as always says keep investing in tax - deferred accounts for retirement and to use other funds to pay on the debt , perhaps even get another home equity loan since the house has appreciated .
Crisis Preparedness Ha ... Spigarelli , Jack A. Best Price : $ 1.93 Buy New $ 10.50 ( as of 11:40 EST - Details )
Then one day the full - blown problems come to a head !
The economy tanks ( as it does from time to time ) but this time Frank gets laid off , his six - figure job becomes 450 a week in unemployment .
He is now looking at savings that might take him 3 months maximum with a huge house payment , huge credit card bills , funding for activities , huge car payments and no idea what to do about it .
Frank and his wife are now having marital problems , his investments are cut in half by a market crash , his bills are overdue , fees and interest compound and the lifestyle they have come to love is ruined .
Frank started in denial of the problem all while it continued to destroy his life , he then tries making deals with the creditors , deals with his wife and deals with relatives to try to get out of the mess and of course deals with god in the form of prayers .
His next step was likely anger , blaming everyone from the credit card companies , to the bank , to his financial advisor and even the company that laid him off .
The last step will be acceptance that his life has been torn apart ; often a divorce is the result if not major damage to the marriage .
The kids either deal with a broken home or massive stress from fighting parents and may have to do without many things they have come to expect .
There wont be any money for college for them , but hey at least they can get a loan .
For 17 years anyone looking at Frank thought he was the picture of financial health ; then almost overnight he appears to have been stricken with a financial death sentence .
Of course there was nothing overnight  about it , the debt started at 18 when he was full of dreams and told that an education was priceless ,  now at 45 during what is supposed to be the best time of his life he is dealing with a bankruptcy and often far worse .
The parallels between debt and cancer are so similar that they should honestly send a shiver up your spine .
Each allows the victim to appear healthy , perhaps look in even better shape than most of those around them , grows silently and at some point becomes terminal . 
Yet the good news is debt is 100 % under your control , can be easily managed and responsibly used only for the purchase of assets of sufficient value to mitigate any real risk for both lender and borrower .
Cancer can and does kill people that live very healthy and stress free lifestyles .
You can reduce the risk of cancer but you cant be 100 % sure it will not strike you .
With debt you can , you are the one that signs the contract , accepts the shiny credit card and uses it to buy shiny stuff .
Survivalism is about sustainability more than anything else .
The survivalist evaluates threats not just to life and property but to his way of life , his liberty and to the security of his family .
When honestly evaluated consumer debt or over - purchasing anything with debt is like bringing a venomous snake into your home .
The snake may never bite anyone , or if it does bite it may not kill but cause disfiguration , trauma and extreme pain .
Hence people dont tend to go out and capture rattlesnakes and turn them loose inside their homes .
The snake is useful , it has a purpose in controlling rodents and may even be beautiful to many people .
However , it also has a place , outside in the wild not inside a home crawling around the floor with your children .
In much the same way debt has a purpose , it is useful to leverage as a tool for investing in solid affordable assets .
Yet just like the snake if not 100 % controlled , disaster will be the result .
While debt reduction is not one of the sexy  survival topics like home defense , alternative energy or stocking up on food it is absolutely necessary in the creation of a sustainable lifestyle .
Remember tenet one  everything you do should improve your position in life even if nothing goes wrong .
Modern survivalism is not just about planning for disasters , it is also about planning for a lifestyle that you can maintain in good times or bad .
Most people in debt struggle with that during the best of times , to think that such a person can succeed when there is a disaster is foolhardy .
Finally you have to consider that while long - term the survivalist saves a great deal of money compared to most Americans , initially there are expenses in setting up a sustainable life .
These expenses revolve around the creation and purchase of long term assets .
The survivalist seeks to accumulate assets such as surplus food , functional permanent food production , paying for a home in full as quickly as possible , additional land to act as a fall - back location , etc .
The list of expenses for a survivalist to be self - sufficient seems unreachable for most working Americans .
Many never actually own a home let alone own second homes or land and by " own " I mean paid in full .
Most pantries are 2 weeks deep in food at most and even with that they can barely get by .
Why ?
The money they earn is spent on debt and attached interest before it is earned .
For many Americans their next 2030 years of income has already been spent .
Yet once free of this cancer even a modest income can , in just a few years , create very a sustainable lifestyle .
So while not something most people generally consider a survival topic eliminating , paying down and staying out of debt may be the most critical actions you can take as a modern survivalist .
Once you eliminate debt you will truly understand the meaning of the word freedom .
Freedom after all is the driving motivation in developing a sustainable life where you are free to choose your destiny rather than being forced to accept it .

Below is the latest issue of The Institutional Risk Analyst .
We did a lot of work on this one .
Look forward to your comments .

“ In the regulatory world , a ‘ side letter ’ is perhaps the most insidious and destructive weapon in the white - collar criminal ’s arsenal .
With the flick of a pen , underhanded executives can cook the books in enormous amounts and render a regulator helpless . ”
Fraud Magazine
“ What do many corporate buyers of insurance have in common with American International Group ?
Perhaps more than they would like to admit .
Like AIG , many companies in the past few years have bought finite insurance , which transfers a prescribed amount of risk for a particular liability .
What regulators now want to know is , how many companies , like AIG , have used finite insurance to artificially inflate their financial results ? ”
First , a housekeeping item .
On Monday , May 4 , 2009 , in partnership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) & the Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) , the Washington DC chapter of Professional Risk Managers ’ International Association ( PRMIA ) is presenting an important day - long conference on managing liquidity and market risk for financial institutions .
Speakers include some of the leading risk practitioners , investors , researchers , bank executives and regulators in the US financial community .
PRMIA free and sustaining members may register on the PRMIA web site .
Members of the regulatory community may register via the FDIC University .
IRA co-founder Christopher Whalen will participate in the conference and serve as MC .
See the PRMIA web site for more information on the program and speakers .
And yes , our favorite bank regulator is making the opening remarks . ;)
For some time now , we have been trying to reconcile the apparent paradox of American International Group ( NYSE : AIG ) walking away from the highly profitable , double - digit RAROC business of underwriting property and casualty ( P&C ) risk and diving into the rancid cesspool of credit default swaps ( “ CDS ” ) contracts and other types of “ high beta ” risks , business lines that are highly correlated with the financial markets .
In our interview with Robert Arvanitis last year , “ ‘ Bailout : It ’s About Capital , Not Liquidity ; Seeking Beta : Interview with Robert Arvanitis ’ , September 29 , 2008 , ” we discussed the difference between high and low beta .
We also learned from Arvanitis , who worked for AIG during much of the relevant period , that the decision by Hank Greenberg and the AIG board to enter the CDS market was , at best , chasing revenue .
No rational examination of the business opportunity , assuming that Greenberg and his directors were acting based on a reasoned analysis , could have resulted in a favorable decision to pursue CDS and other “ high beta ” risks , at least from our perspective .
In an effort to resolve this conundrum , over the past several months
The IRA has interviewed a number of forensic experts , insurance regulators and members of the law enforcement community focused on financial fraud .
The picture we have assembled is frightening and suggests that , far from just AIG , much of the insurance industry has been drawn into the world of financial engineering and has thus become part of the problem .
Below we present our preliminary findings and invite your comments .
One of the first things we learned about the insurance world is that the concept of “ shifting risk ” for a variety of business and regulatory reasons has been ongoing in the insurance world for decades .
Finite insurance and other scams have been at least visible to the investment community for years and have been documented in the media , but what is less understood is that firms like AIG took the risk shifting shell game to a whole new level long before the firm ’s entry into the CDS market .
In fact , our investigation suggests that by the time AIG had entered the CDS fray in a serious way more than five years ago , the firm was already doomed .
No longer able to prop up its earnings using reinsurance because of growing scrutiny from state insurance regulators and federal law enforcement agencies , AIG ’s foray into CDS was really the grand finale .
AIG was a Ponzi scheme plain and simple , yet the Obama Administration still thinks of AIG as a real company that simply took excessive risks .
No , to us what the fraud Bernard Madoff is to individual investors , AIG is to the global financial community .
As with the phony reinsurance contracts that AIG and other insurers wrote for decades , when AIG wrote hundreds of billions of dollars in CDS contracts , neither AIG nor the counterparties believed that the CDS would ever be paid .
Indeed , one source with personal knowledge of the matter suggests that there may be emails and actual side letters between AIG and its counterparties that could prove conclusively that AIG never intended to pay out on any of its CDS contracts .
The significance of this for the US bailout of AIG is profound .
If our surmise is correct , the position of Feb Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner that the AIG credit default contracts are “ valid legal contracts ” is ridiculous and reveals a level of ignorance by the Fed and Treasury about the true goings on inside AIG and the reinsurance industry that is truly staggering .
Does Reinsurance + Side Letters = CDS ?
One of the most widespread means of risk shifting is reinsurance , the act of paying an insurer to offset the risk on the books of a second insurer .
This may sound pretty routine and plain vanilla , but what most people do n’t know is that often times when insurers would write reinsurance contracts with one another , they would enter into “ side letters ” whereby the parties would agree that the reinsurance contract was essentially a canard , a form of window dressing to make a company , bank or another insurer look better on paper , but where the seller of protection had no intention of ever paying out on the contract .
Let ’s say that an insurer needs to enhance its capital surplus by $ 100 million in order to meet regulatory capital requirements .
They can enter into what appears to be a completely legitimate form of reinsurance contract , an agreement that appears to transfer the liability to the reinsurer .
By doing so , the “ ceding company ” – an insurance company that transfers a risk to a reinsurance company – gets to drop that $ 100 million in liability and its regulatory surplus increases by $ 100 million .
The reinsurer assuming the risk does actually put up the $ 100 million in liability , but with the knowledge that they will never have to actually pay out on the contract .
This is good for the reinsurer because they are paid a fee for this transaction , but it is bad for the ceding company , the insurer with the capital shortfall , because the transaction is actually a sham , a fraud meant to deceive regulators , counterparties and investors into thinking that the insurer has adequate capital .
Typically the fee is 6 % per year or what is called a “ loan fee ” in the insurance industry .
When it operates in this fashion , the whole reinsurance industry could be described as a “ surplus rental ” proposition , whereby an insurer literally loans another insurer capital in the form of risk cover , but with a secret understanding in the form of a side letter that the loan will be reversed without any recourse to the seller of protection .
You give me $ 6 million in cash today , and I will give you a promise that we both know I will never honor .
Does this sound familiar ?
What our contacts in the insurance industry describe is almost a precise description of the CDS market , albeit one that evolved in the reinsurance industry literally decades ago and has been the cause of numerous insurance insolvencies and losses to insured parties .
Or to put it another way , maybe the inspiration for the CDS market – at least within AIG and other insurers — evolved from the reinsurance market over the past two decades .
As best as we can tell , the questionable practice of using side letters to mask the economic and business reality of reinsurance transactions started in the mid-1980s and continued until the middle of the current decade .
This timeline just happens to track the creation and evolution of the OTC derivatives markets .
In particular , the move by AIG into the CDS market coincides with the increased awareness of and attention to the use of side letters by insurance regulators and members of the state and federal law enforcement community .
Keep in mind that what we are talking about here are not questionable risk management policies but acts of deliberate and criminal fraud , acts that often result in jail time for those involved .
As one senior forensic accountant who has practiced in the insurance sector for three decades told The IRA :
“ In every major criminal fraud case in which I have worked , at the center of the investigation were these side letters .
It was always very strange to me that on - site investigators and law enforcement officials consistently found that these side letters were being used to mask the true financial condition of an insurer , and yet none of the state regulators , the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) , nor federal law enforcement authorities ever publicly mentioned the practice .
They certainly did not act like the use of side letters was a commonplace thing , but it was widespread in the industry . ”
It is important to understand that a side letter is a secret agreement , a document that is often hidden from internal and external auditors , regulators and even senior management of insurers and reinsurers .
We doubt , for example , that Warren Buffet or Hank Greenberg knew the details of side letters , but they should have .
Just as a rogue CDS trader at a large bank like Societe General ( NYSE : SGE ) might seek to hide losing trades , the underwriters of insurers would use sham transactions and side letters to enhance the revenue of the insurer , but without disclosing the true nature of the transaction .
There are two basic problems with side letters .
First , they are a criminal act , a fraud that usually carries the full weight of an “ A ” felony in many jurisdictions .
Second , once the side letter is discovered by a persistent auditor or regulator examining the buyer of protection , the transaction becomes worthless .
You paid $ 6 million to AIG to shift risk via the reinsurance , but the side letter makes clear that the transaction is a fraud and you lose any benefit that the apparent risk shifting might have provided .
As the use of these secret side letters began to become more and more prevalent in the insurance industry , and these secret side deals were literally being stacked on top of one another at firms like AIG , the SEC began to investigate .
And they began to find instances of fraud and to crack down on the practice .
One of the first cases to come to the surface involved AIG helping Brightpoint ( NASDAQ : CELL ) commit accounting fraud , a case that eventually led the SEC to fine AIG $ 10 million in 2003 .
Wayne M. Carlin , Regional Director of the SEC’s Northeast Regional Office , said of the settlements : “ In this case , AIG worked hand in hand with CELL personnel to custom - design a purported insurance policy that allowed CELL to overstate its earnings by a staggering 61 percent .
This transaction was simply a ’ round - trip ’ of cash from CELL to AIG and back to CELL .
By disguising the money as ‘ insurance , ’ AIG enabled CELL to spread over several years a loss that should have been recognized immediately . ”
Another case involved PNC Financial ( NYSE : PNC ) , which used various contracts with AIG to hide certain assets from regulators , even though the transaction amounted to the “ rental ” of capital and not a true risk transfer .
As the SEC noted in a 2004 statement : “ The Commission ’s action arises out of the conduct of Defendant AIG , primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary AIG Financial Products Corp. ( “ AIG - FP ” ) , ( collectively referred to as “ AIG ” ) in developing , marketing , and entering into transactions that purported to enable a public company to remove certain assets from its balance sheet . ”
Click here to see the SEC statement regarding the AIG transactions with PNC .
The SEC statement reads in part : “ In its Complaint , filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia , the Commission alleged that from at least March 2001 through January 2002 , Defendant AIG , primarily through AIG - FP , developed a product called a Contributed Guaranteed Alternative Investment Trust Security ( “ C - GAITS ” ) , marketed that product to several public companies , and ultimately entered into three C - GAITS transactions with one such company , The PNC Financial Services Group , Inc. ( “ PNC ” ) .
For a fee , AIG offered to establish a special purpose entity ( “ SPE ” ) to which the counter - party would transfer troubled or other potentially volatile assets .
AIG represented that , under generally accepted accounting principles ( “ GAAP ” ) , the SPE would not be consolidated on the counter - party ’s financial statements .
The counter - party thus would be able to avoid charges to its income statement resulting from declines in the value of the assets transferred to the SPE .
The transaction that AIG developed and marketed , however , did not satisfy the requirements of GAAP for nonconsolidation of SPEs . ”
In both cases , AIG was engaged in transactions that were meant not to reduce risk , but to hide the true nature of the risk in these companies from investors , regulators and the consumers who rely on these institutions for services .
Keep in mind that while the SEC did act to address these issues , the parties involved received light punishments when you consider that these are all felonies that arguably would call for criminal prosecution for fraud , securities fraud , conspiracy and racketeering , among other things .
Indeed , this is one of those rare cases where we believe AIG itself , as a corporate person , should be subject to criminal prosecution and liquidation .
Birds of a Feather : AIG & GenRe
Click here to see a June 6 , 2005 press release from the SEC detailing criminal charges against John Houldsworth , a former senior executive of General Re Corporation ( “ GenRe ” ) , a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE : BRKA ) , for his role in aiding and abetting American International Group , Inc. in committing securities fraud .
The SEC noted : “ In its complaint filed today in federal court in Manhattan , the Commission alleged that Houldsworth and others helped AIG structure two sham reinsurance transactions that had as their only purpose to allow AIG to add a total of $ 500 million in phony loss reserves to its balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001 .
The transactions were initiated by AIG to quell criticism by analysts concerning a reduction in the company ’s loss reserves in the third quarter of 2000 . ”
But the involvement of the BRKA unit GenRe in the AIG mess was not the first time that GenRe had been involved in the questionable use of reinsurance contracts and side letters .
Click here to see an example of a side letter that was made public in a civil litigation in Australia a decade ago .
The faxed letter , which bears the ID number from the Australian Court , is from an insurance broker in London to Mr. Ajit Jain , a businessman who currently heads several reinsurance businesses for BRKA , regarding a reinsurance contract for FAI Insurance , an affiliate of HIH Insurance .
Notice that the letter states plainly the intent of the transaction is to bolster the apparent capital of FAI .
Notice too that several times in the letter , the statement is made that “ no claim will be made before the commutation date , ” which may be interpreted as being a warranty by the insured that no claims shall be made under the reinsurance policy .
By no coincidence , HIH and FAI collapsed in a $ 5.3 billion dollar fiasco that ranks as Australia ’s biggest ever corporate failure .
Click here to read a March 9 , 2009 article from The Age , one of Australia ’s leading business publications , regarding the collapse of HIH and FAI .
In 2003 , an insurer named Reciprocal of America ( “ ROA ” ) was seized by regulators and law enforcement officials .
An investigation ensued for 3 years .
According to civil lawsuits filed in the matter , GenRe provided finite insurance to ROA in order to make the troubled insurer look more solvent than it was in reality .
Several regulators and law enforcement officials involved in that case tell
The IRA that the ROA failure forced insurers like AIG and Gen Re to start looking for new ways to “ cook the books ” because the long - time practice of side letters was starting to come under real scrutiny .
“ These reinsurance deals made ROA look better than it really was , ” one investigator with direct knowledge of the ROA matter tells The IRA .
“ They went into the ROA home office in VA with the state insurance regulators and law enforcement , and directed the employees away from the computers and records .
During that three - year investigation , GenRe learned that local regulators and forensic examiners had put everything together and that we now understood the way the game was played .
I believe the players in the industry realized that that they had to change the way in which they cooked the books .
A sleight - of - hand trick that had worked for 25 years under the radar of regulators and investors was now revealed . ”
Several senior officials of ROA eventually were prosecuted , convicted of criminal fraud and imprisoned , but DOJ officials under the Bush Administration reportedly blocked prosecution of the actual managers and underwriters of ROA who were involved in these sham transactions , this even though state officials and federal prosecutors in VA were anxious to proceed with additional prosecutions .
AIG : From Reinsurance to CDS
While some reinsurers are large , well - capitalized entities that generally avoid these pitfalls , AIG was already a troubled company when it began to write more and more of these risk - shifting transactions more than a decade ago .
It is easy to promise the moon when people think that they can deliver , but because AIG and their clients saw how easy it was to fool regulators and investors , the practice grew and most regulators did absolutely nothing to curtail the practice .
It was easy for AIG to become addicted to the use of side letters .
The firm , which had already encountered serious financial problems in 2000 - 2001 , reportedly saw the side letters as a way to mint free money and thereby help the insurer to look stronger than it really was .
AIG not only helped banks and other companies distort and obfuscate their financial condition , but AIG was supplementing its income by writing more and more of these reinsurance deals and mitigating their perceived exposure via side letters .
A key figure in AIG ’s reinsurance schemes , according to several observers , was Joseph Cassano , head of AIG - FP .
Whereas the traditional use of side letters was in reinsurance transactions between insurers , in the case of both CELL and PNC neither was an insurer !
And in both cases , AIG used sham deals to make two non-insurers , including a regulated bank holding company , look better by manipulating their financial statements .
Falsifying the financial statements of a bank or bank holding company is an felony .
AIG - FP was simply doing for non-insurers what was common practice inside the secretive precincts of the insurance world .
The SEC did investigate and they did finally obtain a deferred prosecution agreement with AIG , which was buried in the settlement with then - New York AG Elliott Spitzer .
The key thing to understand is that if you look at many of these reinsurance contracts between ROA and Gen Re , they look perfect .
They appear to transfer risk and seem to be completely in order .
But , if you do n’t get to see the secret agreement , the side letter that basically says that the reinsurance contract is a form of window dressing , then you cannot understand the full implications of the transaction , the reinsurance agreement .
Not , several experts speculate , can you understand why AIG decided to migrate away from reinsurance and side letters and into CDS as a mechanism for falsifying the balance sheets and earnings of non-insurers .
Several observers believe that at some point in the 2002 - 2004 period , Cassano and his colleagues at AIG began to realize that state insurance regulators and the FBI where on to the reinsurance / side letter scam .
A number of experts had been speaking and writing about the issue within the accounting and fraud communities , and this attention apparently made AIG move most of its shell game into the world of CDS .
By no coincidence , at around this time side letters began to disappear in the insurance industry , suggesting to many observers that the industry finally realized that the jig was up .
It appears to us that , seeing the heightened attention from regulators and federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI on side letters , AIG began to move its shell game to the CDS markets , where it could continue to falsify the balance sheets and income statements of non-insurers all over the world , including banks and other financial institutions .
AIG ’s Cassano even managed to hide the activity in a bank subsidiary of AIG based in London and under the nominal supervision of the Office of Thrift Supervision in the US , this it is suggested to hide this ongoing activity from US insurance regulators .
Even though AIG had been investigated and sanctioned by the SEC , Cassano and his colleagues at AIG apparently were recalcitrant and continued to build the CDS pyramid inside AIG , a financial pyramid that is now collapsing .
The rest , as they say is history .
Now you know why the Fed and EU officials are so terrified about an AIG liquidation , because it will result in heavy losses to or even the insolvency of banks and other corporations around the globe .
Notice that while German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been posturing and throwing barbs at President Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been conciliatory toward the US .
But for the bailout of AIG , you see , President Sarkozy would have been forced to bailout SGE for a second time in two years .
So long as the Fed and Treasury can subsidize AIG ’s mounting operating losses , the EU will be spared a financial bloodbath .
But this situation is unlikely to remain stable for long with members of the Congress demanding an investigation of the past bailout , a process that can only result in bankruptcy for AIG .
Are the CDS Contracts of AIG Really Valid ?
The key point is that neither the public , the Fed nor the Treasury seem to understand is that the CDS contracts written by AIG with these various non-insurers around the world were shams – with no correlation between “ fees ” paid and the risk assumed .
These were not valid contracts as Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , Treasury Secretary Geithner and Economic policy guru Larry Summers claim , but rather acts of criminal fraud meant to manipulate the capital positions and earnings of financial companies around the world .
Indeed , our sources as well as press reports suggest that the CDS contracts written by AIG may have included side letters , often in the form of emails rather than formal letters , that essentially violated the ISDA agreements and show that the true , economic reality of these contracts was fraud plain and simple .
Unfortunately , by not moving to seize AIG immediately last year when the scandal broke , the Fed and Treasury may have given the AIG managers time to destroy much of the evidence of criminal wrongdoing .
Only when we understand how AIG came to be involved in CDS and the fact that this seemingly illegal activity was simply an extension of the reinsurance / side letter shell game scam that AIG , Gen Re and others conducted for many years before will we understand what needs to be done with AIG , namely liquidation .
Seen in this context , the payments made to AIG by the Fed and Treasury , which were then passed - through to dealers such as Goldman Sachs ( NYSE : GS ) , can only be viewed as an illegal taking that must be reversed once the US Trustee for the Federal Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York is in control of AIG ’s operations .

You know how we voters love it when we 're being placated !
So stories like this are leaked to make Obama look like he 's taking a strong stand - but actions are so much louder than words :
The Obama administration is engineering its new bailout initiatives in a way that it believes will allow firms benefiting from the programs to avoid restrictions imposed by Congress , including limits on lavish executive pay , according to government officials .
Administration officials have concluded that this approach is vital for persuading firms to participate in programs funded by the $ 700 billion financial rescue package .
The administration believes it can sidestep the rules because , in many cases , it has decided not to provide federal aid directly to financial companies , the sources said .
Instead , the government has set up special entities that act as middlemen , channeling the bailout funds to the firms and , via this two - step process , stripping away the requirement that the restrictions be imposed , according to officials .
Although some experts are questioning the legality of this strategy , the officials said it gives them latitude to determine whether firms should be subject to the congressional restrictions , which would require recipients to turn over ownership stakes to the government , as well as curb executive pay .
The administration has decided that the conditions should not apply in at least three of the five initiatives funded by the rescue package .

The myth of Europe curiously prevails By Caroline B. Glick
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com | Israelis are wild about Europe .
A poll carried out by the Konrad Adenauer foundation last month showed that a whopping 69 percent of Israelis , and 76 percent of Israeli Jews would like for Israel to join the European Union .
Sixty percent to Israelis have a favorable view of the EU .
This poll 's most obvious message is that as far Europe is concerned , Israelis suffer from unrequited love .
A 2003 Pew survey of 15 EU countries showed that 59 percent of Europeans consider Israel the greatest threat to world peace .
A poll taken in Germany the following year showed that 68 percent of Germans believe that Israel is pursuing a war of extermination against the Palestinians and 51 percent said that there is no difference in principle between Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians and German treatment of Jews during the Holocaust .
And it is n't simply Israel that they hate .
They do n't like Jews very much either .
In an empirical study published in 2006 , Professors Edward Kaplan and Charles Small of Yale University demonstrated a direct link between hatred for Jews and extreme anti-Israel positions .
A recent poll bears out the fact that levels of hostility towards Israel rise with levels of anti-Semitism .
According to a 2008
Pew survey , anti-Semitic feelings in five EU countries  Spain , England , France , Germany , and Poland  rose nearly 50 percent between 2005 and 2008 .
Whereas in 2005 , some 21 percent of people polled acknowledged they harbor negative feelings towards Jews , by last year the percent of self - proclaimed anti-Semites in these countries had risen to 30 percent .
In Spain levels of anti-Semitism more than doubled from 21 percent in 2005 to 46 percent in 2008 .
Not surprisingly , increased hatred of Jews has been accompanied by increased violence against Jews .
Just last week for instance , three men assaulted Israel 's ambassador in Spain Rafi Shotz as he and his wife walked home from a soccer game .
They followed after him and called out , " dirty Jew , " " Jew bastard , " and " Jew murderer . "
A crowd of people witnessed the assault , but no one rose to their defense .
Shotz was lucky .
As Israel 's ambassador he had two policemen escorting him and so he was not physically threatened .
The same was not the fate of Holocaust survivors who assembled at Mauthausen death camp in Austria last week to commemorate the 64th anniversary of the camp 's liberation by American forces .
As Jewish survivors of the camp where 340,000 people were murdered mourned the dead , a gang of Austrian teenagers wearing masks taunted them screaming " Heil Hitler , " and " This way for the gas ! "
They opened fire with plastic rifles at French Jewish survivors , wounding one in the head and another in the neck .
And Austria is not alone .
From Germany to France , Belgium , England , Holland , Sweden , Norway and beyond , Jewish kindergartens and day schools , restaurants and groceries have been firebombed and vandalized .
The desecration of Jewish cemeteries and synagogues has become an almost routine occurrence .
Jewish leaders from Norway to Germany to Britain to France have warned community members not to wear kippot or Stars of David in public .
Rabbis have been beaten all over the continent .
There is no state sanction for anti-Jewish violence in Europe .
But in many places it is either brushed off as insignificant , or justified as a natural byproduct of the Palestinian conflict with Israel .
In at least one case , the official downplaying of the significance of anti-Jewish sentiments and violence has had murderous consequences .
In January 2006 Ilan Halimi , a French Jew was kidnapped by a gang of Muslim sadists .
For an entire week , the police ignored the anti-Semitic nature of the attack  and hence the imminent danger to Halimi 's life  in spite of the fact that his kidnappers made threatening phone calls to Halimi 's parents where they recited verses from the Koran while Ilan was heard screaming out in pain from his torture in the background .
In the end , Halimi was tortured continuously for 20 days before he was dumped at a railhead naked , with burns and cuts over eighty percent of his battered body and died of his wounds shortly after he was found .
Some have attributed the rise in European anti-Semitism to the rapid growth of Muslim minorities throughout the continent .
This explanation has much to recommend it .
Levels of anti-Semitism among most Muslim minority populations in Europe are exceedingly high .
According to Kaplan and Small 's study , European Muslims are eight times more likely than non-Muslims to be openly anti-Semitic .
And Franco Frattini , the EU official responsible for combating anti-Semitism told the Jerusalem Post last year that some 50 percent of anti-Jewish attacks in Europe are conducted by Muslims .
But while European Muslims are a major factor in the rise of anti-Jewish violence , they are a bit player when it comes to the overall prevalence of anti-Jewish attitudes .
For example , with 46 percent of Spaniards negatively disposed towards Jews , and with Muslims making up only 3 - 5 percent of Spaniards , we learn that nearly half of Christian Spaniards are anti-Semitic .
And as the 2008 Pew survey shows , European hatred of Jews is growing at a fast clip .
Indeed , it is growing two and a half times faster than European hatred of Muslims .
In all likelihood , these negative trends for Jews are only going to escalate in the coming years .
Politicians interested in being elected have already begun exploiting the rise in anti-Jewish sentiments to increase their electoral prospects .
In the 2005 British elections for instance , the Labor Party under Tony Blair depicted then Conservative Party leader Michael Howard as the hateful anti-Semitic icon Fagin from * Oliver Twist * in a campaign poster .
Another Labor poster depicted Howard and fellow politician Oliver Letwin as flying pigs .
This state of affairs bodes ill for Israel 's future relations with Europe .
In most cases , European politicians pander to the growing constituency of anti-Semites by adopting hostile policies towards Israel .
These policies then serve to further justify anti-Semitic attitudes and so the number of European anti-Semites continues to grow , and in turn , European hostility to Israel increases .
All of this brings us back to Europhilic Israel .
If the majority of Israelis were to get their way , and Israel joined the EU , we would find ourselves subsumed into a transnational political entity that increasingly rejects Israel 's right to exist .
No doubt recognizing the political advantage to be garnered by attacking Israel , last year Spanish investigative magistrate Judge Fernando Andreu Merellesis decided to use a specious complaint submitted by the discredited Palestinian Center for Human Rights to launch a war crimes investigation against Israel 's top political and military leaders .
Against the stated will of Spain 's state prosecution , Merellesis announced last week that he is proceeding with his investigation into claims that a dozen senior Israeli leaders committed a war crime when they approved the 2002 decision to target Hamas terror master Salah Shehadah .
As a non-member of the EU , EU courts have no power to enforce their rulings against Israelis .
Today the only thing Israelis need to worry about is that we will be arrested if we visit Europe .
This is inconvenient , but not impossible to live with .
Were Israel to join the EU however , EU laws would supersede Israeli laws .
European courts could compel Israeli courts to enforce their rulings .
Israel , in short would find itself subsumed in a hostile political entity that could simply adjudicate and legislate it out of existence .
So what explains Israel 's unrequited love affair with Europe ?
There is no all - encompassing explanation for the EU 's popularity in Israel .
It is a function of a number of complementary causes .
The most important among them is the abject failure of the Israeli media to examine European anti-Semitism and its implications for European policy towards Israel in any coherent fashion .
Rather than recognize that European anti-Semitism and its concomitant hostility towards Israel is the consequence of internal European dynamics , the Israeli media tend to cast both as a function of Israel 's actions .
Doing so certainly makes for neat , easily digestible news stories , but it also trivializes the situation .
Moreover , by acting as though Israel 's actual behavior is at all relevant to European treatment of Jews and the Jewish state , the local media effectively buy into cynical European moves to belittle the significance of anti-Jewish violence .
They give credence to false European claims that the firebombing of synagogues is simply the regrettable consequence of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
Then there is the issue of Israel 's constant quest to end its international isolation .
For many Israelis , it is tantalizing to think that we can end our international isolation by joining the EU .
The EU is seen as a club of rich and cultured countries with which Israel would benefit from merging .
This view again is nurtured by the media which have failed to report on the failure of the European welfare state model .
In light of the media 's refusal to tell the story of Europe 's hostility towards Jews and the Jewish state , or the story of the EU 's severe economic problems , it is not surprising that precious few Israeli politicians have a clear understanding of Europe .
Successive foreign ministers  from Shimon Peres to Silvan Shalom to Tzipi Livni to Avigdor Lieberman have all voiced varying degrees of support for Israeli membership in the EU .
Their statements have never been challenged in debate .
Finally , there is the nostalgia that many Israelis feel towards the old pre-war Europe from their grandparents ' stories .
That long gone Europe , where young women and men would walk along the promenades in Berlin , Paris , Antwerp and Prague holding hands and eating ice cream , breathing in the air of Heinrich Heine and Franz Kafka has been kept alive in the imaginations of generations of Israelis .
Many of them work today as leading journalists , movie directors and actors .
For many Israelis then , the myth of Europe is more familiar than the real Europe .
Looking to a future of an increasingly Jew - hating Europe it is clear that Israel and Israelis must quickly divest ourselves of our delusions about Europe .
For Israel to competently contend with Europe in the coming years , it will be essential that both our political leaders and Israeli society as a whole gain a firm grasp of where Europe stands in relation to both the Jewish people and the Jewish state .
With a burgeoning and deeply anti-Semitic Muslim minority , and with a Christian majority increasingly comfortable with flaunting traditional anti-Semitic attitudes , dispensing with anti-Jewish myths ranks low on the priority list for most European leaders .
In contrast , for Israel , gazing at this unfolding European state of affairs , it is clear that abandoning our adoration for a mythological Europe is one of the most urgent items on our national agenda .

ToneMatrix :
This pattern makes a perfect ringtone .
Flash - Audio guru Andre Michelle , the very creator of the Hobnox - audiotools , made a new soundtoy !
The ToneMatrix is a simple sinewave - synth , that is visually and conceptional similar to the Tenori - On or the Monome .
I just managed to make some great ringtone - like loops , that fitted perfectly into the ambient - music that was playing here .
Smoothing and inspiring .
Well designed .
Definitely worth a try .
CHARLESTON , S.C – Two months after the local atheist organization here put up a billboard saying “ Do n’t Believe in God ?
You Are Not Alone , ” the group ’s 13 board members met in Laura and Alex Kasman ’s living room to grapple with the fallout .
The problem was not that the group , the Secular Humanists of the Lowcountry , had attracted an outpouring of hostility .
It was the opposite .
An overflow audience of more than 100 had showed up for their most recent public symposium , and the board members discussed whether it was time to find a larger place .
And now parents were coming out of the woodwork asking for family - oriented programs where they could meet like - minded nonbelievers .
“ Is everyone in favor of sponsoring a picnic for humanists with families ? ” asked the board president , Jonathan Lamb , a 27 - year - old meteorologist , eliciting a chorus of “ ayes . ”
More than ever , America ’s atheists are linking up and speaking out — even here in South Carolina , home to Bob Jones University , blue laws and a legislature that last year unanimously approved a Christian license plate embossed with a cross , a stained glass window and the words “ I Believe ” ( a move blocked by a judge and now headed for trial ) …
Polls show that the ranks of atheists are growing .
The American Religious Identification Survey , a major study released last month , found that those who claimed “ no religion ” were the only demographic group that grew in all 50 states in the last 18 years .
Nationally , the “ nones ” in the population nearly doubled , to 15 percent in 2008 from 8 percent in 1990 .
In South Carolina , they more than tripled , to 10 percent from 3 percent .
Not all the “ nones ” are necessarily committed atheists or agnostics , but they make up a pool of potential supporters .
RTFA .
Well done enough that I thought at first it came from the Guardian [ sorry , NYT ] .
So – disclaimer : I was an atheist by age 13 .
Proper philosophical materialist by 18 .
Science has n’t bumped into any information changing either of those conclusions in the ensuing years .
Currently GM has a few more than 30 Cruze - shell mule prototypes running around the proving grounds and in various test facilities .
These cars have been performing flawlessly .
Though containing a near - final Chevy Volt powertrain and battery , they do not possess the true Chevy Volt interior or exterior design .
The next critical stage in Volt development process will be the building of true to form and function Chevrolet Volt prototypes .
This particular level of vehicle are known as integration vehicles or as GM calls them , IVers .
Andrew Farah , the Volt 's lead engineer actually has a countdown clock in his office revealing that 63 days from today , assembly of the first true Volt will start .
All the parts will be lined up at the low volume assembly facility and will begin to come together that day .
Andrew notes the first one will take longer to produce , but for all intents and purposes will come to life on June 1st .
They will then be built at a rate of roughly 10 per week until a total fleet of over 80 is completed .
Those cars " will look , taste , smell , and feel like the Volt .
They are the Volt , " said Farah " my goal is by Forth of July to be out driving several of them .
"
By the fall , it could be argued that GMs Volt fleet will surpass the size of the fleets of many of the start - up electric car manufacturers .
According to Greg Ceisel , GM's Voltec manager , 2010 will bring several more build stages .
" We 've got several phases leading up to the production launch where we build larger and larger batches , " says Ciesel " in each phase as we perfect the production process , make sure we 've got all the fit finish and other details exactly correct and that the quality of the vehicle meets our standards before we go into the first vehicles that will ultimately be saleable vehicles that will be shipped to the dealerships .
"
He said there will be " a hundred or so " of these final pre-production Volts that will also act as a captured test fleet for mostly GM employees .
By November of 2010 the first saleable Volts will begin being built at the Hamtramck plant and shipped to dealerships .

The Pirate Bay trial ( mercifully ) began its wrap - up today , with closing statements from prosecutor Hakan Roswall and the entertainment industry lawyers who are simultaneously pressing their cases .
Roswall spent his time recapping the case , and then asked the court to toss the defendants in a jail cell for one year — down from the two - year maximum that could have been requested .
Contributing to infringement
Roswall dropped several charges on the second day of the trial for the purpose of streamlining the case , Ars was told , which leaves contributory copyright infringement as the main charge .
The Pirate Bay might not host content itself , but if its main use is as a middleman that arranges illegal peer - to - peer transfers , Roswall said that the site could be held responsible .
" A person who is holding someone 's coat while they assault someone else is complicit in the crime , " he said , according to Swedish paper The Local .
And Monique Wadsted , the lawyer for the movie industry , told the court that it was a basic point of Swedish law that one can't just walk around with eyes closed when one knows that crimes are being committed .
Wadsted also claimed that The Pirate Bay was built for piracy , and she noted that site admins do in fact police the site for child pornography , inactive torrents , and misleading descriptions .
Given that sort of control over the material , is it credible simply to see The Pirate Bay as a hand - off forum that allows all sorts of user postings for which it can not be held liable ?
The defense is continuing to claim that the European Union e-commerce directive passed in 2000 protects them from liability .
The relevant part of the directive is Article 12 , the " mere conduit " section , which says that a " service provider " is not liable for the information transmitted by its users .
The rule applies only to " service providers , " raising the question of whether The Pirate Bay qualifies , and it only applies when three conditions are met : the service provider must not 1 ) initiate the transfer , 2 ) select the receiver of the transfer , 3 ) modify the transfer in any way .
The Pirate Bay team wants a ruling from a European court on whether the directive applies to the site , but prosecutor Hakan Roswall says that wo n't be necessary .
Though he admits the directive applies , " It does n’t mean some sort of immunity for middlemen , " he told the court .
" And there is no reason to request an opinion from the European Court . "
Organized and rich ?
At least on these issues , the facts are not in serious dispute ; the question is a matter of law and interpretation .
When it comes to the duties , organization , and income from The Pirate Bay , though , even the agreement on facts disappears .
Roswall and the entertainment industry lawyers again repeated their claim that the site rakes in plenty of money — perhaps 10 million kronor ( $ 1 million ) a year in profit .
These amounts do n't appear to be based on bank balance information or canceled checks , though , but on a calculation of the number of site . torrent files accessed in a year , multiplied by some projected ad rate , multiplied by the number of ads each downloader would likely see .
The numbers led defendant Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi to reply , " Prosecution claims 64 adspaces on TPB .
But there 's two to four .
And they count the earned money on number of adspaces . "
The projected income figure also lead to an outburst from fellow defendant Gottfried Svartholm Warg during a court recess .
" It 's totally absurd , those numbers are totally disconnected from reality , " he said .
And then , referring to the prosecutor : " The old bastard 's crazy . "
In addition to revenue questions , the prosecution team does n't believe the various Pirate Bay stories about decentralized organization , ad - hoc decision - making , and all the rest of it .
Closing statements attempted to show a stronger level of organization than the site backers admit to , and Kolmisoppi was accused of being far more than just a site spokesman .
" Oh , I 'm apparently the boss of everybody I know , " Kolmisoppi then tweeted .
Not like Google
Finally , industry lawyers attacked the repeated Pirate Bay claim that they are essentially like Google .
While it is true that Google returns links to all sorts of illegal and infringing content , and that The Pirate Bay hosts legal material , the lawyers claimed that the big difference between the two sites is the fact that one cooperates with rights - holders and one does not .
We heard this claim during the trial when John Kennedy of music trade group IFPI flew up from London and talked about his antipiracy team and how they are in daily communication with Google .
The Pirate Bay , on the other hand , famously posted ( and then ridiculed ) the letters it received from rights - holders asking for material to be removed from the site .
End of the " spectrial "
As the " spectrial " wraps up , we were again reminded today that it is about more than spectacle , theater , and shenanigans ; jail time is at stake .
Roswall asked the court for a one - year sentence , while Wadsted thought the defendants deserved far more time in a cell .
Tomorrow , the four defendants will make their own closing statements , and the trial wraps up on Wednesday morning .
You may want to thank David French in advance .
Because , in the event that a comet or asteroid comes hurtling toward Earth , he may be the guy responsible for saving the entire planet .
French , a doctoral candidate in aerospace engineering at North Carolina State University , has determined a way to effectively divert asteroids and other threatening objects from impacting Earth by attaching a long tether and ballast to the incoming object .
By attaching the ballast , French explains , " you change the object 's center of mass , effectively changing the object 's orbit and allowing it to pass by the Earth , rather than impacting it . "
Sound far - fetched ?
NASA 's Near Earth Object Program has identified more than 1,000 " potentially hazardous asteroids " and they are finding more all the time .
" While none of these objects is currently projected to hit Earth in the near future , slight changes in the orbits of these bodies , which could be caused by the gravitational pull of other objects , push from the solar wind , or some other effect could cause an intersection , " French explains .
So French , and NC State Associate Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Andre Mazzoleni , studied whether an asteroid - tether - ballast system could effectively alter the motion of an asteroid to ensure it missed hitting Earth .
The answer ?
Yes .
" It 's hard to imagine the scale of both the problem and the potential solutions , " French says .
" The Earth has been hit by objects from space many times before , so we know how bad the effects could be .
For example , about 65 million years ago , a very large asteroid is thought to have hit the Earth in the southern Gulf of Mexico , wiping out the dinosaurs , and , in 1907 , a very small airburst of a comet over Siberia flattened a forest over an area equal in size to New York City .
The scale of our solution is similarly hard to imagine .
" Using a tether somewhere between 1,000 kilometers ( roughly the distance from Raleigh to Miami ) to 100,000 kilometers ( you could wrap this around the Earth two and a half times ) to divert an asteroid sounds extreme .
But compare it to other schemes , " French says , " They are all pretty far out .
Other schemes include : a call for painting the asteroids in order to alter how light may influence their orbit ; a plan that would guide a second asteroid into the threatening one ; and of course , there are nukes .
Nuclear weapons are an intriguing possibility , but have considerable political and technical obstacles .
Would the rest of the world trust us to nuke an asteroid ?
Would we trust anyone else ?
And would the asteroid break into multiple asteroids , giving us more problems to solve ? "
The research was first presented last month at the NC State Graduate Student Research Symposium in Raleigh , N.C .
The research , " Trajectory Diversion of an Earth - Threatening Asteroid via Elastic , Massive Tether - Ballast System , " has also been reviewed and accepted for presentation this September at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics SPACE 2009 Conference and Exposition in Pasadena , CA .

You know , if I had n't been a reporter and did n't know how heavily politicized ( and blind to actual justice ) most prosecutors are , I might actually swallow this horse hooey :
WASHINGTON ( AP ) --
The Supreme Court has overturned a long - standing ruling that stops police from initiating questions unless a defendant 's lawyer is present , a move that will make it easier for prosecutors to interrogate suspects .
The high court , in a 5 - 4 ruling , overturned the 1986 Michigan v. Jackson ruling , which said police may not initiate questioning of a defendant who has a lawyer or has asked for one unless the attorney is present .
The Michigan ruling applied even to defendants who agree to talk to the authorities without their lawyers .
There 's a good reason for this .
In case you have n't noticed , criminals are rarely intelligent and they 're often easily coerced .
You know that bit on cop shows where they use a copy machine as a " lie detector " ?
Some cops actually do that .
The court 's conservatives overturned that opinion Tuesday , with Justice Antonin Scalia saying " it was poorly reasoned , has created no significant reliance interests and ( as we have described ) is ultimately unworkable . "
Scalia , who read the opinion from the bench , said their decision will have a " minimal " effects on criminal defendants .
" Because of the protections created by this court in Miranda and related cases , there is little if any chance that a defendant will be badgered into waiving his right to have counsel present during interrogation , " Scalia said .
I do n't know where Scalia grew up , but apparently his life experience is very different from mine !
I knew too many kids who got arrested and coerced into confessions to give this much credence .
The Michigan v. Jackson opinion was written by Justice John Paul Stevens , the only current justice who was on the court at the time .
He dissented from the ruling , and in an unusual move read his dissent aloud from the bench .
It was the first time this term a justice had read a dissent aloud .
" The police interrogation in this case clearly violated petitioner 's Sixth Amendment right to counsel , " Stevens said .
Overruling the Jackson case , he said , " can only diminish the public 's confidence in the reliability and fairness of our system of justice . "
Do n't worry , Justice Stevens .
We lost confidence in the " reliability and fairness of our system of justice " a long time ago !
Every single ( even moderately successful ) web browser ’s logo has been round …
Why ?
The most obvious explanation is that Internet Explorer had a round logo and , considering it enjoyed a 95 % market share in 2002 , everyone else fell in line ( Netscape switched to their round logo after IE had already made massive gains ) .
Secondly , with the importance of putting forth a world wide web vibe it seems logical that you would end up with a bunch of globes .
But what about Internet Explorer itself ?
Why are the IE and NCSA Mosaic logos round ?
Was it on a designer ’s whim ?
Considering these products were mostly if not entirely the work of engineers ; it ’s a bit more practical than that .
When NCSA Mosaic came out in the 90’s it was the first graphical web browser .
With an accessible UI design , and killer features like icons , bookmarks and pictures , it ’s what really kick - started the online information revolution .
It had a

Digg 's new URL - shortening feature is aggregating as much controversy for the popular web site as it is traffic .
Critics are taking aim at the structure of DiggBar — a toolbar appearing at the top of a browser when users click a link at Digg .
The bar displays the content of other sites in a frame , keeping web surfers inside the Digg domain rather than sending them directly to the source of content .
Defenders say Digg still sends traffic to other sites , which receive pageviews as normal .
But critics say the toolbar is a suffocating eyesore .
" When you call it ' framing someone else 's site , ' everyone agrees it 's bullshit , " said John Gruber , writer of Daring Fireball , on his Twitter .
" When you call it ' The DiggBar , ' it 's Web 3.5 Awesome . "
To express his sentiments , Gruber crafted a special version of his web site for DiggBar users , which directs them to a page reading , " Dear Digg , Go fuck yourself .
Your pal , JG . "
Those turned off by DiggBar find it reminiscent of web sites in the 1990s that utilized frames to separate sections .
Framing raised a number of issues that ultimately rendered it into a retired design method .
First , frames were not cross-compatible , meaning web sites with frames would display inconsistently between different browsers .
Also , some web sites used frames to trap visitors inside their sites even when linking to external content , effectively hijacking traffic .
Lastly , web designers today embrace clean and simple interfaces , so framing was dropped because it just looked tacky .
Thus , critics of the DiggBar feel they 're taking in a breath of stale air .
Before Thursday 's launch of the DiggBar , Digg would simply display headlines with their Digg point scores next to them .
Clicking on a Digg link directed a user to the source of content .
Now , when links are submitted to Digg , the site automatically shortens the URL into an address beginning with
" www.digg.com. "
The DiggBar stays at the top of the page , and users never leave Digg unless they click the " X " button to close the bar or a small , gray URL displayed under the submission title .
The DiggBar can be disabled altogether in user preferences , but dissatisfied users say
Digg should have launched the feature as an option rather than a default setting .
" It 's very 1.0 thinking that you 're going to put someone else 's site in your frame and let the user know , ' You 're still within the Digg world but we 're allowing you to view this thing that we have provided the platform for you to visit , " said Rob Rose , vice president of marketing at CrownPeak .
Clint Ecker , a contributing writer and web developer at Ars Technica , said the DiggBar offends him as a content provider .
He quipped that the shortened Digg
URLs detract from attention to the web addresses for the actual providers of content .
" [ Digg is ] really pissing off a lot of people who could really just stop using Digg , " said Ecker , noting that the DiggBar also displays its own advertisements .
However , there are plenty of fans of the DiggBar .
Brent Csutoras , an internet marketing consultant who specializes in social media , praised the
DiggBar as a very positive move .
In Digg 's defense , Csutoras said unlike past sites imposing frames , the DiggBar is not intrusive , because it is only a quarter - inch strip at the top of a page .
For Digg users , the DiggBar will be very convenient , as they will no longer have to leave Digg to view content before deciding to vote it up or down .
As for content providers , Csutoras said the DiggBar will only improve traffic to their sites .
He noted that the DiggBar features buttons to share Digg links via Facebook , Twitter and e-mail .

In recent months , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and other regulatory officials have made much ado about those “ toxic ” securities the Wall Street demons concocted by bundling together thousands of mortgages and dicing them up a dozen different ways to sell to investors .
The big problem , as we ’ve all learned by now , is that it ’s next to impossible to figure out what the accursed things are worth .
Wall Street firms and pretty much everyone else went by their exchange price rather than by analyzing the loans within .
Which all worked out just fine until the underlying subprime mortgages began defaulting like mad .
All of a sudden , nobody wanted to trade in these byzantine assets , and banks that owned heaps of them were in serious trouble .
It ’s easy to see why government regulators might want to do something about all of this .
The trouble is that much of Geithner ’s new $ 100 billion program to help Wall Street hedge funds purchase “ toxic assets ” from banks — and which could put us on the hook for up to $ 500 billion — does n’t involve these securities at all .
Instead , about half of that money goes to a Legacy Loans Program to help hedge funds purchase relatively conventional loans .
Yes , plain old loans , as opposed to the nightmarishly complicated mortgage - backed securities that have America ’s finance sector scratching its head .
“ This is a big surprise to me , ” says New York University economics professor Lawrence J. White , who helped spearhead the government ’s response to the savings and loan crisis during the 1980s .
“ I do n’t know why they ’re doing it . ”
Why , indeed ?
A March 23 press release from the Treasury Department claims Geithner ’s plan will “ reduce uncertainty ” on bank balance sheets and help banks and investors figure out what the loans are worth .
Yet that ’s never really been the issue .
Sure , valuing loans involves a bit of forecasting :
You have to predict whether a borrower will keep her job , stay healthy , not accumulate other debts , and so forth .
But these factors are comparatively easy to calculate .
“ If you ’re talking about individual loans , you can put some value on it , ” says Ann Graham , a former litigator with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) who now teaches law at Texas Tech University .
“ It ’s far easier than evaluating these exotic mortgage - related securities . ”
Geithner ’s loan strategy goes beyond merely missing the point .
Given years of lax federal oversight , the plan all but guarantees — see if this theme sounds familiar — a windfall for banks that lied to regulators and investors so that they ’d be allowed to lend out far more money than they could realistically afford to .
To understand this , a little background is useful : A bank that trades heavily in mortgage - backed securities is in trouble if the market for those assets dries up — and it has , and they are — but regular loans are different .
So long as a bank intends to sit on them and collect the interest rather than sell them to another company , the government lets that bank use its own secret financial formula to determine the loan values .
In short , banks have carte blanche to claim their assets are worth far more than they really are —
White refers to this as “ trust me ” accounting .
Given this long leash , banking executives have naturally inflated the book value of their mortgages .
And even as more and more of their customers fail to make payments , bankers have proved reluctant to admit their hubris and take a hit on the balance sheet .
Why is that ?
Well , the government says banks have to keep enough assets on hand to cover their behinds if things go south .
So if a bank that has foolishly overextended itself admits it was overvaluing its loan assets all along , it will fall short of this critical regulatory requirement .
And when that happens , under the “ prompt corrective action ” laws enacted after the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s , federal regulators are obliged to invoke the N - word : nationalization .
But Geithner ’s plan is voluntary , meaning that if the naughty banks do n’t like the price that hedge fund investors are offering , they can simply turn the deal down .
And no bank on the precipice of nationalization is going to voluntarily sell loans to Wall Street for less than it has been claiming they ’re worth .
Doing so would be corporate suicide .
Instead , the only way a troubled bank will likely participate is if it receives an absurdly generous price for its dubious assets — a full - fledged bailout , in other words .
“ I ’m troubled about the pricing aspect of the plan , ” notes Graham .
Still confused ?
Consider this scenario : FirstFed Financial is a California bank whose stock — down 98 percent in the past year — now trades at about 50 cents per share .
That gives it a market value of $ 6.8 million , but the company ’s most recent quarterly accounting statement puts its liquidation value — based on how its executives value its loans — at $ 256.5 million , or $ 18.74 per share .
Clearly , investors do n’t believe the loans are worth anywhere near what the company claims .
But if FirstFed sells its loans under Geithner ’s plan , it will almost certainly score prices close to , or perhaps higher than , those book values .
That ’s because FirstFed , like many banks these days , has allowed itself a razor - thin capital cushion .
If it sells off its loans too cheaply , regulators will be legally obligated to step in and take it over .
Treasury ’s treatment of mortgage - backed securities — the more convoluted toxins — is less sinister .
Since these assets from hell can only be valued at market prices due to their sheer complexity , getting hedge funds to trade them may at least theoretically serve some useful valuation function .
The government is basically letting fund managers make a huge bet , while guaranteeing that we ’ll cover most of the losses if things do n’t work out .
A similar strategy will apply to the loans , and Geithner clearly wants our most troubled banks to participate — otherwise his plan would do nothing more than subsidize the earnings of healthy companies .
But allowing these banks to dispense of their overvalued loans puts him on tenuous legal footing .
In fact , using the government to help faltering banks improve their capital position is precisely what the prompt corrective action laws were enacted to prevent .
When the FDIC takes over a bank — a process called receivership — the bank ’s shareholders are wiped out and its executives are given the boot .
This discourages future investors from putting money into bad institutions and gives regulators a clean slate for disposing of the bank ’s assets .
It ’s exactly what happened in July 2008 when regulators seized exotic - mortgage lender IndyMac .
It ’s also prudent policy :
We do n’t want predatory lenders in charge of our economic recovery .
“ After the savings and loan debacle , we passed a law because regulators had been too unwilling to close insolvent institutions , ” explains William Black , a senior regulator from the 1980s who now teaches law and economics at the University of Missouri - Kansas City .
“ We mandated that well before banks were insolvent , the government would force them to bring in adequate capital or promptly close them down … That statute has been ignored by the current administration and the last one . ”
Indeed , Geithner ’s language in describing his bank - rescue plans often comes across as a delicate dance around the letter of law .
For instance , he ’s conducting “ stress tests ” to determine what a bank might lose in a “ deeper than expected ” recession — taxpayers would then subsidize the bank ’s losses up to that amount .
These stress tests are not much different than the annual audits bank regulators are supposed to conduct to keep banks honest in their accounting .
But Geithner can’t publicly admit that loads of bank loans are worthless without nationalizing the banks in question .
So , using carefully crafted language to imply that the banks might only take such losses under unthinkable circumstances , Geithner can trample on the spirit of the law .
Indeed , his criteria for a deeper - than - expected recession fall suspiciously close to present conditions — they cite an average unemployment rate of 8.9 percent , for instance , at a time when national unemployment stands at 8.5 percent and layoffs are accelerating .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the powerful House Committee on Financial Services , has acted to further expand this world of make believe .
At a March hearing , Frank ’s colleagues browbeat US accounting officials into relaxing the rules that require banks to assess mortgage - backed securities at market rates ; the change gives bankers leeway to value their inscrutable assets in the same mysterious way they currently value loans .
In a subsequent CNBC interview , Frank openly acknowledged that the purpose of letting banks value these securities themselves is to keep regulators at bay .
“ We do think the regulators should not have to automatically say , ‘ Oh , because these assets have dropped , you ’ve gotta cut your lending right away , ' ” he said .
Treasury Department spokespeople did not respond to phone calls seeking comment , but the FDIC , which will help administer the loan - purchasing program , insists the plan is necessary and that loan values are the subject of controversy .
“ There ’s some uncertainty in the pricing and in their value in the marketplace , ” says spokesman Andrew Gray .
Why , though , would bank regulators need hedge funds to help them determine what loans are worth ?
Assessing loan quality , after all , is something they ’ve done for decades .
“ The regulators will come in and say to the bank , ‘ You ’re carrying your loans at values that are not appropriate .
Mark them down , ' ” explains Gerard Cassidy , a bank analyst with RBC Capital Markets .
Granted , this has n’t been happening much lately .
Since the financial crisis took hold in earnest , the very accounting gatekeepers charged with protecting our economy from the aforementioned loan - value voodoo have proved excruciatingly slow to make banks write down their loans .
This shirking of duties may bear some relationship to the fact that regulators are funded by the fees they levy on banks .
When a few banks go under , they can shrug it off , but when banks fail en masse , it ’s a payroll disaster .
One regulatory organ , the Office of Thrift Supervision , has gone so far as to fudge transaction dates on the books of highly leveraged banks to save them from nationalization .
It ’s not as if our government is no longer capable of evaluating a bank ’s financial position :
When IndyMac was taken over last July , its accounting statements claimed the bank was “ well - capitalized ” — the strongest regulatory classification .
But FDIC officials combing through its books have reported loss rates of around 80 percent on IndyMac ’s loans , and understanding those books can help regulators determine the health of other banks .
Bottom line :
The notion that regulators need Wall Street to tell them the value of bank loans would be laughable if it were n’t so reckless .
These hedge - fund people , after all , were very much part of the problem .
“ We are in this crisis because the financial interests of investors caused them to deliberately set asset prices in a way that massively inflated values , ” Black says .
Even if Geithner has discovered the right mix of smoke and mirrors to push his plan through legally , it seems extremely unwise to reject our best safeguards against financial ruin .
The S&L fiasco , after all , taught us that propping up banks and delaying nationalization costs taxpayers far more in the long run .
“ We have a mechanism to liquidate failed banks , and we know that it works , ” Graham says .
“ You should n’t just throw out the things that have worked before . ”
Now take a deep breath and let ’s boil it all down .
Our treasury secretary hopes to circumvent laws enacted to protect the economy by subsidizing a bunch of multimillionaire investors — ostensibly to help regulators fulfill their most basic job description — in a bid to prop up bankers who cooked their books to support a gambling binge and still refuse to admit they lost .
Or maybe they have n’t .
In a game thus rigged , there are only two sure - fire losers : you and me .

Diamond hunter Chuck Fipke spreads out maps of potential new discoveries . *
Photo : Andrew Hetherington * Behind an unmarked door in a faded business park outside Kelowna , British Columbia , in a maze of rooms crowded with desks , computers , and floor - to - ceiling shelves , Chuck Fipke sifts through 20 - pound bags of dirt .
" We take samples , hey , from gravel and streambeds all over the world , " Fipke says .
He sieves the earth , runs it through magnetic drums and centrifuges and electromagnetic separators .
Then his technicians , working with scanning electron microscopes , separate out grains and mount them on postage - stamp - sized squares of epoxy .
It 's painstaking work but worth the trouble .
Fipke has learned to understand those grains of dirt , and that understanding has led him to diamonds .
Eighteen years ago , there was no such thing as a Canadian diamond — as far as anyone knew .
Diamonds came mostly from Australia , Botswana , South Africa , Namibia , and Russia .
De Beers mined 75 percent of the world 's output , much of it tainted by controversial " blood diamonds , " sold to fund African wars .
Stones from the Ekati Mine .
Photo : Andrew HetheringtonToday , Canada is the world 's third - largest producer , by value , of rough stones .
In the Northwest Territories , BHP Billiton 's Ekati mine has been producing since 1998 and Rio Tinto 's Diavik mine since 2003 .
De Beers opened its first Canadian mine , at Snap Lake , in July — a confirmation that Canada is the new center of the world .
The story behind the addition of Canada to the ranks of diamond - producing nations leads back to one man : a short , absentminded Canadian geologist named Chuck Fipke .
When he discovered diamonds in Lac de Gras , Northwest Territories , in 1991 , he started the largest staking rush in North America since George Carmack found gold in the Klondike a century earlier .
And he 's not finished :
He 's prospecting around the world , toting gravel samples back to his lab in British Columbia to figure out where to look for his next big strike .
In 1970 , fresh out of the University of British Columbia with a degree in geology , Chuck Fipke signed on with mining company Kennecott Copper to look for gold and copper in Papua New Guinea .
A helicopter would drop him off alone in the middle of a jungle , and pick him up at the end of the day .
The terrain was so rough that the chopper often could n't land —
Fipke would just leap out as it hovered close to the ground .
One day he turned around to face 20 locals , arrows strung .
He raised his arms , slowly removed his vest , and offered it to " the one who looked like the chief . "
By the time the helo returned for him , Fipke was in his underpants clutching a fine array of tribal shields , bows and arrows , and fetishes .
" I 've got an amazing collection of stuff ! " he says .
Fipke is a small man with a shaved head , a burnished tan , piercing blue eyes , and forearms like Popeye's .
As a kid , his frantic start - stop mind made people think he was stupid .
After getting his high school girlfriend pregnant , he agreed to marry her ... and then failed to show up for the wedding .
( The couple eventually married after the baby was born . )
He stutters and says " hey " in almost every sentence .
He frequently loses his glasses and his keys , shows up late to appointments , and has a history of spending prodigious amounts of money in strip joints .
His nicknames have included Captain Chaos and Stumpy .
After stints in the Amazon , Australia , and South Africa , Fipke opened a mineral separation laboratory in British Columbia in 1977 .
A year later , Superior Oil hired him to go back into the field — to look not for metals but gems .
The wilderness around Snap Lake , in Canada 's Northwest Territories , conceals a trove of diamonds .

The company already had a search method .
A couple of years prior , a geologist named John Gurney , working with Superior 's money at the University of Cape Town , hypothesized that certain common minerals might reliably form alongside diamonds .
He used an electron microprobe to analyze geological structures called kimberlite pipes — the places you occasionally ( but not often ) find diamonds — and discovered that the presence of chromite , ilmenite , and high - chrome , low - calcium garnet did indeed predict a rich strike .
He examined a host of pipes in South Africa that had these so - called indicator minerals and published a paper explaining his results .
The Snap Lake site is one of four diamond mines established in Canada in recent years .
Illustration : Bryan ChristieFipke heard about Gurney 's work on a tour of De Beers ' Finsch Mine in South Africa and quickly turned himself into an expert on indicator minerals — combining what he understood of Gurney 's work with results coming out of Russian labs and his own skills with field sampling .
Superior had worked with Fipke before , back in his gold mining days , so by the time the company wanted someone to go look for kimberlite pipes northwest of Fort Collins , Colorado , Fipke was the best choice .
He found half a dozen , but like 98 percent of the kimberlite formations in the world , they did n't contain diamonds in commercially viable quantities .
But Fipke knew that , 100 miles under those pipes , was a craton , a thick , old chunk of continental plate where diamonds form .
Kimberlite pipes are created when magma bubbles up through a craton , expanding and cooling on its way up .
If the craton has diamonds in it , the result is either a carrot - shaped , diamond - studded pipe reaching up to the surface or a wide , flat underground structure called a dike .
Fipke also knew that the craton underneath the pipes he had found ran all the way up the Rockies .
With Superior 's backing , he teamed up with a geologist and pilot named Stewart Blusson , formed Dia Met Minerals , and headed north .
By 1981 , the two men were sampling the ground in Canada ; they would eventually secure mining concessions on 80,000 square miles .
" It was just me and Sewart and a floatplane , " Fipke says .
" We took all the supplies and all the samples in ourselves . "
De Beers geologists , it turned out , were already there , relying on their own indicator mineral formulas .
But Fipke and Blusson surmised that the indicators De Beers found had in fact been dragged far from the kimberlite pipe eons ago by a passing glacier .
What they needed to do was look " upstream " for the point of origin .
Fipke got a helicopter and flew back and forth over the Arctic Circle , using a magnetometer to track variations in magnetic field that would suggest kimberlite .
After thousands of miles and hundreds of hours in the air , he found a promising site near Lac de Gras , a barren world of lakes and rock and muskeg a few hundred miles outside the Arctic Circle .
He 'd been surveying for eight years .
He had n't found a single diamond .
Superior had abandoned the diamond business .
Dia
Met 's stock was trading at pennies a share .
But based upon a few samples , Fipke estimated a diamond concentration at Lac de Gras of more than 60 carats per 100 tons — with about a quarter of the stones of good quality or better .
( In kimberlite pipes that have gem-quality stones in commercial quantities , a concentration of 1 carat — 0.2 grams — per 100 tons can be profitable . )
After six months of sampling , Fipke went public .
It was 1991 , and he had found a kimberlite pipe ( buried under 30 feet of glaciated sediment ) with a concentration of 68 carats per 100 tons — the first Canadian diamonds ever found .
Shares of Dia Met rocketed to $ 70 .
Fipke had partnered with mining giant Broken Hill Proprietary Company ( now BHP Billiton ) to get the diamonds out ; BHP opened the Ekati mine at Lac de Gras in 1998 .
Soon Dia Met 's 29 percent share of the mine was worth billions .
Fipke would go on to sell his chunk to BHP for $ 687 million , retaining 10 percent ownership in the mine , worth another $ 1 billion .
Today Canada 's diamond business is soaring .
The country 's four working mines produced 17 million carats in 2007 , up 23 percent from 2006 .
Diamonds from Canada now account for 10 percent of all diamonds by carat sold in the world .
And the addition of more diamonds to the global market has n't driven prices down .
Average carat value has actually risen 15 percent , and the gems from the far north are untainted by the bad publicity that comes from an association with African wars .
Shortly before Fipke sold most of his Ekati claim to BHP Billiton , his marriage , faltering for years after so much time in the field , fell apart .
At the time it was the largest divorce settlement in Canadian history .
" Cost me $ 200 million , hey , " Fipke says .
" Best money I ever spent ! "
Fipke now has mining projects in Morocco , Greenland , Canada , Angola , and Brazil .
His laboratory bookshelves are heavy with mineral guides — and the family histories of thoroughbreds .
Besides diamonds , he 's now obsessed with horse racing .
" It 's a huge challenge , hey , and I like challenges even if they 're risky , " he says .
" And I think I 'm really going to do spectacularly well with horses . "
So far , so good :
He has more than 50 brood mares in Ireland and Kentucky and 20 racehorses all over the world .
His horse Tale of Ekati placed fifth in this year 's Kentucky Derby .
" I always go to the Derby with Bo Derek , " he says , unlocking the door to a windowless room piled with maps and electron microscopes and computers .
" She 's a good rider , and she knows horses .
And she 's a lot of fun , hey !
I 'm gonna do for horse racing what I did for diamonds ! "
The De Beers mine at Snap Lake is a labyrinth of crushers and separators .
Photo : Andrew HetheringtonWhether or not Fipke actually turns out to have an eye for horseflesh , his eye for the characteristics of crystals is unparalleled .
He shows me rooms of glass flasks and tubes , the equipment for analyzing all those gravel samples .
I peek through a microscope and see a rainbow treasure of sparkling gems : green chrome diopsides and red garnets — the low - calcium , high - chrome G - 10s that mean diamonds are nearby .
Over many years in the field and the lab , Fipke has refined his understanding of this unique stew of minerals .
" Everyone now knows that G - 10 garnets with low calcium might lead you to diamonds , hey , " Fipke says .
" But how do you distinguish between a Group 1 eclogitic garnet that grew with a diamond and a Group 2 eclogitic garnet that did n't ?
They look the same . "
Custom software compares the grains ' shapes and chemical compositions , analyzes them against 1,000 minerals that are intergrown with diamonds , and compares them against 10 fields of mineral groupings .
If seven to 10 of the fields from one pipe overlap , Fipke says , " there 's no doubt ; it 's full of diamonds .
No one else out there can distinguish between these similar tiny particles of minerals that grow with a diamond and ones that do n't . "
Miners prepare to blow up a rock face .
Photo : Andrew Hetherington " Look , " he says , opening a folder on a table .
He has thousands of photos of mineral grains magnified to the size of golf balls .
Some are all sharp corners and jagged edges , some rounded .
Since erosion and age wear the minerals down , " we can tell when we 're getting closer to the source .
If the edges are sharp , hey , we know they have n't traveled far from the pipe . "
That level of geographic precision has allowed Fipke to stake more claims .
He 's even working in areas of Brazil where De Beers has n't been able to turn a profit .
" And Angola .
Angola has the richest alluvial diamond river in the world , " he says , " and there are thousands of diamond works there .
But we 're looking for the source pipes . "
Five years ago Fipke started making magnetometer survey flights over the Kwango River .
Having identified 100 possible targets , he now has 40 men taking core samples 900 to 1,200 feet under the riverbed .
" I 'm there at the camp at least three times a year , hey , and it 's much harder than in the Arctic .
Your drilling equipment just gets buried in enormous piles at customs in Luanda and you can't get it .
In the Northwest Territories it was cold , hey , and full of snow , but you get a good parka and you 're a bug in a rug .
Angola is the most inefficient place on earth ! "
I start to ask another question , but Fipke has something else in mind .
" I 'm hungry , hey , " he barks , as the door to the map room slams shut behind us .
" Do you like oysters ? "
But we 're not going anywhere :
He has locked his keys in the room and has to call someone to drive in and open up his office .
We finally head into town .
" Hi , Chuck ! " says the hostess , leading us to the back room of a hip Asian fusion place .
Around a long table sit 23 young women , all sporting stilettos and big hair .
" Chuck ! " they shout .
We have , it seems , shown up at the bachelorette party for Fipke 's granddaughter .
The hostess seats us at the next table .
Fipke orders four dozen oysters and a bottle of wine that has to be driven to the restaurant from some special cellar , and a young women shimmies into the booth next to Fipke .
" Chuck , " she says , kissing him on the cheek , " do you think you can pay for us all tonight ? "
" Sure , " Fipke says , beaming .
" Do you remember this ? " says another woman — his daughter , it turns out , who slides in next to him , holding up a purse .
" You bought it for me ! "
With Fipke suddenly bankrolling the night , the girls break loose , and the restaurant staff starts hauling out the bottles of champagne .
Pretty soon a couple of lasses are dancing on the tables , the oysters are slipping down , a second bottle of rare wine is being decanted , and Fipke is remixing the menu like Danny DeVito in * Get Shorty
*.
And the tales spill forth : three week forays into the Peruvian Amazon , travels with the Kalahari Bushmen of Southern Africa , visits to the pygmies of the Ituri forest in the Congo .
" I 'd just leave my family and go , hey , " he says .
" I was really into native culture . "
Somebody asks him about Brazil , and it reminds him of something important .
" Caipirinhas ! " he shouts out of the blue .
" I want 25 caipirinhas ! "
When the bill arrives , it 's 3 feet long and $ 4,000 .
Fipke pays up , and we spill into the night — his daughter and granddaughter and their friends and now boyfriends , who joined us in the restaurant .
On the street , Fipke suddenly leaps into the air and delivers a solid , suede loafer - clad foot to the head of a parking meter .
" I fucking hate parking meters , hey ! " he shouts .
He jumps and kicks another one , and then erupts into a fit of giggles .
We are ushered past the velvet rope at the Cheetah Lounge , Kelowna 's classiest strip joint , and Captain Chaos orders another round of caipirinhas for everyone .
Three generations of Fipkes pound drinks as naked women dangle upside down from poles onstage .
The room is spinning by the time Fipke takes me aside and lays a big warm hand on my arm .
" Hey , " he says , " here 's the thing .
I learned that I did my best .
I mean , I really tried my best .
How many people can say that ?
I worked hard , and I mean really hard .
I worked seven days a week from 8 am until 3 am .
Every day .
We drilled and drilled all winter when it was dark and the windchill was 80 below .
Everyone thought I was crazy .
But most people just never do their best , hey .
And I did . "

PARIS , France ( CNN ) -- Hundreds of French workers , angry about proposed layoffs at a Caterpillar factory , were holding executives of the company hostage Tuesday , a spokesman for the workers said .
Caterpillar 's French staff say they are angry about a lack of negotiations over layoffs .
It is at least the third time this month that French workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations .
Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations .
The latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble .
The workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate , said Nicolas Benoit , a spokesman for the workers ' union .
They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives , Benoit told CNN .
One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building .
The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit , because he has heart problems , union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN .
Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago , Patrick said .
The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik , the head of operations ; two other executives ; and Petit 's personal assistant , he said .
About 500 employees were also outside the building protesting .
A top Caterpillar executive called the hostage - taking unhelpful .
" The actions that are taking place today , led by a small minority of individuals , are not helping as we work for a positive resolution of this situation , " said Chris Schena , Caterpillar vice president with responsibility for manufacturing operations in Europe , Africa and the Middle East , in a statement .
" The best way to resolve this matter is to continue the negotiations through the Works Council to find a solution that 's fair to our employees and allows Caterpillar to remain a leader in a rapidly changing global marketplace , " Schena said , adding that the company was " concerned for the safety of our employees . "
Benoit said all the workers wanted to do was negotiate with Caterpillar and they were upset that the company did not show up to two earlier scheduled negotiating sessions .
The employees being held in their office were being allowed to get food , Benoit added .
Police arrived at the scene two hours after the incident began but it had not been settled .
Employees at a French 3 M factory held a manager hostage for more than 24 hours Wednesday and Thursday of last week over a dispute about terms for laid - off staff .
Luc Rousselet , who was unharmed , was allowed to leave the plant in Pithiviers , central France , early on Thursday morning after talks between unions and officials from 3M France .
Earlier this month , the boss of Sony France was held overnight before workers freed him after he agreed to reopen talks on compensation when the factory closed .
France has been hit by nationwide strikes twice in the past two months .
Editor 's Note : David M. Walker served as comptroller general of the United States and head of the Government Accountability Office from 1998 to 2008 .
He is now president and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation .
David Walker says the federal debt could double , forcing huge increases in your taxes .
( CNN ) --
Even under the best of economic circumstances , tax season is a tense time for American households .
The number of hours we collectively spend working on our returns is probably a lot more than government agencies claim .
The burden in financial terms is even greater : A recent independent survey found that the average American 's total federal , state and local tax bill roughly equals his or her entire earnings from January 1 up until right before tax day .
Now imagine that tax bill doubling over time .
In recent years , the federal government has spent more money than it takes in at an increasing rate .
Total federal debt almost doubled during President George W. Bush 's administration and , as much as we needed some stimulus spending to boost the economy , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now estimates total debt levels could almost double again over the next eight years based on the budget recently outlined by President Obama .
Regardless of what politicians tell you , any additional accumulations of debt are , absent dramatic reductions in the size and role of government , basically deferred tax increases .
Remember the old saw ?
" You can pay me now or you can pay me later , with interest . "
To help put things in perspective , the Peterson Foundation calculated the federal government accumulated $ 56.4 trillion in total liabilities and unfunded promises for Medicare and Social Security as of September 30 , 2008 .
The numbers used to calculate this figure come directly from the audited financial statements of the U.S. government .
If $ 56.4 trillion in financial commitments is too big a number to digest , think of it as $ 483,000 per American household , or $ 184,000 for every man , woman and child in the country .
Even broken down , the numbers can be tough to swallow .
Yes , you 've paid your taxes , but you still bear a significant share of the government 's own financial burden .
To help this news go down with a smile , the Peterson Foundation is supporting a campaign designed to help Americans understand what Washington is doing to us , rather than for us .
Meet Owen & Payne ( www.owenandpayne.com), partners in a fictional accounting firm that specializes in helping Americans fill out the " new " Form 483000 , which spells out how our elected officials are putting our nation into more and more debt and how that bill eventually will have to be paid :
By doubling your taxes .
The campaign is all in fun , but the intent is very serious .
Unless we begin to get our fiscal house in order , there 's simply no other way to handle our ever - mounting debt burdens except by doubling taxes over time .
Otherwise , our growing commitments for Medicare and Social Security benefits will gradually squeeze out spending on other vital programs such as education , research and development , and infrastructure .
Personal savings , while experiencing an uptick lately because of the recession , have been too low for too long .
As a result , when our government has to borrow money , it must increasingly turn to lenders overseas .
Effectively addressing these issues will require tough choices and comprehensive reforms , including budget controls , changes to our entitlement programs , reductions in health care costs , other spending cuts , and yes , tax increases .
But as the old saw goes , paying now , or paying soon , wo n't be as painful as paying later .
So as you file your tax returns this year , bear in mind that no matter how much you 're paying now , you 'll pay much more in the future because of Washington 's failure to get its finances in order .
If you do n't like the idea , then get informed and get involved .
And by listening rather than punishing , help encourage our elected officials to speak the truth about our financial condition , even if it means reforming entitlements , cutting spending , and yes , raising taxes .

Anytime Tracy Morgan as Tracy Jordan has a scene on 30 Rock , my brain shuts off and it ’s difficult to function .
It ’s the combination of delivery and content , and there ’s hardly ever a scene throughout which , I ’m not giggling foolishly .
In celebration , I thought I ’d post everything he said in 30 Rock Season 3 .
If you guys like it , I ’ll do Season 1 and Season 2 , too .
Some of these lines are made funnier by adding context .
For the most part , however , they ’re funnier without , so I did n’t include any .
Yes , this is basically a transcription of his lines without comment and I could have just copied and pasted out of the scripts .
However , they ’re not online , so I watched every episode again , just for you .

And where were you two ?
Your job is to protect me from embarrassment . ”
“ Making up words wo n’t save you , ok ?
We ’re going to get on an elevator with Kenneth and you ’re going to laugh at my jokes . ”
“ Hey , elevator , what ’s this ?
A ghetto mating call . ”
“ Jenna , we ’re the most important people here , right ? ”

I ’m afraid Angie will divorce me if I ever have enough for her to live off of half .
So before she can get it , I have to spend it on useless things like gold shoes and Griz and Dotcom . ”
“ I do n’t gotta pre-nup .
When Angie and I got married , my only assets were a toaster oven and two tickets to a Young MC concert . ”

“ There ’s no link between diabetes and diet .
That ’s a white myth , Ken. Like Larry Bird or Colorado . ”
“ Word . ”
“ And I heard that from Yusef Jackson . ”
“ Diabetes and diet .
Next you ’ll be telling me that leasing a sports car is a bad investment . ”
“ K. What ’s up with this disgusting stuff ? ”
“ N- O - E. No. E . ”
“ I did n’t say anything . ”
“ Through the stone ? ”
“ I ’m fine , Ken .

It ’s terrible !
And this thing they call ‘ box seats at the Ranger ’s game , ’ it ’s so cold .
And what is Rohyphnal ? ”
“ So I should n’t have taken 2 of them for my headache ?
“ Hey , you know it , Bri-man . ”

If I ca n’t keep up with a bunch of Wall St frat boys - uh , oh , here come the Roofies .
You can do whatever you want to me . ”
“ I ’m going to .
I ’m Tracy Jordan .
Why would I be afraid of fire next to my mouth . ”
“ Ken , these interns are wearing me out .
It ’s like I said in my non -hit comedy ‘ Cruise Boat , ’ I ’m getting too old for this ship . ”
“ Yes there is .
Do you know what happens to a comedian when he gets old and loses his audience ?
He starts to get offered serious roles .
And do you really want to see me play Arthur Ashe ? ”
“ Exactly , so if I ’m going to keep my hilarious reputation , these interns gotta go . ”
“ Then I ’ll find something for them to do . ”
“ I ’m doing this so no one will know I ’m getting old . ”
“ This interview is over . ”

I ’m glad I ’m here . ”
“ Larry , I ’m not an expert , but I do have a strong opinion .
New York , as we know it , will no longer exist tomorrow . ”
“ Look .
I grew up here , Larry , in the days before Starbuck .
And if Wall
St crashes , it ’ll be the 1970 ’s all over again .
People will get mean .
The streets wo n’t be safe .
It ’ll be graffiti everywhere .
And the movies will only cost 3 dollars . ”

I was supposed to be in that movie Rush Hour , but two weeks into shooting , I was replaced by Jackie Chan . ”
“ Larry , what everyone needs to do is just take a deep breath , calm down , and start preparing their bodies for the Thunderdome .
That is the new law . ”
“ Devil ’s avocado here , Larry .
I think people should freak the geek out .
Withdraw all your money and hide it . ”
“ It ’s what I ’ve always done .
I hide cash everywhere .
At home , at church , even at work .
In fact , I ’ve hidden so much money , that if some of it was gone , I probably would n’t even notice . ”
“ I do n’t know . ”
“ I ’m saying the Disneyfication of New York is over , everyone .
At the stroke of midnight , your Lexus is going to turn back into a hot pile of rats fighting over a human finger . ”
“ Hang on .
I know Jack Donaghy and that is an imposter .
Hang up .
Hang up on him , Larry . ”
“ Hey , I recognize that voice anywhere , Larry .
That ’s my friend Peter Frampton on the phone . ”
“ Of course , Pete .
I hid my money in the safest place at 30 Rock .
Without giving it away , the place I picked is very dry and warm .
Its top is hard , but its bottom is soft .
And although the location changes all the time , the money stays in the same place . ”
“ I already told you .
It ’s dry and warm .
Its top is hard , but its bottom is soft .

“ Thanks for coming out , thanks for watching .
Love , peace , and hairgrease ! ”
“ That ’s because I do n’t have a birthday , Ken . ”
“ I do n’t have a birth certificate , cuz I was born inside of Yankee Stadium .
I bounced around foster families so much , no one ever bothered to throw me a party . ”
“ I do n’t need a birthday cause I buy myself all the presents I need .
And because of my drinking , they ’re often a surprise . ”
“ But I do n’t have a birthday ! ”
“ I do feel it .
You ’re all so amazing .
And to think I was just calling ya’ll a bunch of racists . ”
“ I did not know that ? ”
“ Suree , Suree , Suree . ”
“ You were right , Ken , birthday ’s are special .
And now mine ’s is over .
And who knows when February 24th will come again .
Now that warm happy feeling is gone , there ’s no cake in my mouth , and that birthday wish is malarkey .
Malarkey ! ”
“ Come on , Daniel . ”
“ My birthday wish came to true ! ”
“ I wished for you to get better .
I was gonna to wish for breakfast in bed with Robocop while an elephant paints us . ”

It ’s a birthday miracle ! ”
“ Ahhhahaaahah .
Ahhhahaha . ”

Can anyone cut this in half . ”
“ OK , great meeting . ”
“ There you are , Liz Lemon .
You wanna buy half a watch ?
I have to pay my fine in cash .
I guess FCC stands for Federal Bunch of Sticklers . ”
“ I sure have .
I learned that if you pay some money afterwards , you can say whatever you want on TV .
I can even say what Earnest Borgnine whispered to me at - ”
“ That ’s always the lesson !
If you have money you can do whatever you want .
Now I ’m off to appear on Martha Steward Live .
Ooh , it ’s gonna be raunchy . ”
“ Hello , Liz Lemon .
Just catching up on some work .
What sounds more shocking ‘ [ Bleeeeeeeep ] ’ or ‘ [ Bleeeeeeeep ] ’ ?

I love the crew .
All we do is joke around together about our stupid boss Liz Lem - ”
“ Great idea , Liz Lemon ! ”
“ The first two thirds !
I do n’t need to stop being myself if I AM the advertiser !
I have the money .
I ’ll just buy up all of the ads and let that hilarious Tracy Jordan character do whatever he wants . ”
“ We ’ll see about that . ”
“ Kenneth , I need you to set up a meeting with you and the folks from ad sales .
What do you mean you ’re not in charge anymore ? ”
“ I do not apologize , America .
I did not even write that apology .
I am advertiser Tracy Jordan and I approve this message .
I am an advertiser .
I am an advertiser .
Is that 30 seconds , yet ? ”
“ Hey , America , check out my fun cooker ! ”
“ Hi. I ’m Tracy Jordan .
My wife is throwing away some of our old towels .
Do you want them cuz they ’re out by the trash cans .
Now that ’s gots to be 30 seconds .

“ And some ? ”
“ You are my Radar O’Reilly , Ken .
Now get in here and rub my feet til you hear a chopper coming . ”
“ This is better than a family .
No one around here asks me for my damn bone marrow . ”
“ OK .
Sorry it took me so long to answer .
I was just thinking about how weird it is that we eat birds . ”
“ How is this not really about money ? ”
“ What ’s that now , Charles ? ”
“ I never thought of it like that .
Thank you .
I quit .
Goodbye . ”
“ Hello ? ”
“ Bill Cosby ?
You gotta a lot of nerve getting on the phone with me after what you did to my Aunt Paulette . ”
“ 1971 , Cincinnatti .
She was the cocktail waitress with the droopy eye . ”
“ Try to tell me what to do ?
Dr Heathcliff
Huxtable with your light - ass kids .
Jack , why would you make me talk to this man ? ”
“ [ Singing ]
‘ My girl has a fat neck . ’
I ’m sharp , let ’s do it again . ”

I miss him .
Cranston ?
Why are you crying ? ”
“ Hey , Ken ?
I ’ve been calling you , has Cranston not been giving you my messages ? ”
“ Yeah , well .
Do n’t worry .
I just came to get a few of my things .
And I wo n’t bother you . ”
“ Alright .
I guess that ’s everything .
But I want you to know .
If I walk out that door , Ken , I ’m not gonna call again .
It ’s over .
You understand ? ”
“ You used Cranston as his gatekeeper ? ”
“ Wait a minute , you want to fire my boy , Ken ? ”
“ Unless ? ”
“ You say Kenneth ca n’t work here because I do n’t work here .
But if I work here , so can Kenneth . ”
“ Of course you do n’t , you idiot .
I ’m coming back to work , Jack .
With Kenneth ! ”

Episode 16
“ I will be brief .
I have decided to fulfill my dream of going into space .
If you have a spaceship and are looking for a hilarious astronaut with an irregular heartbeat and thirty million dollars , I am prepared to leave as soon as tomorrow .
I wrote that yesterday .
I will not be taking questions . ”
“ What is this , Horseville ?
Cuz I am surrounded by naysayers .
Wordplay ! ”
“ Look , when I was a kid growing up in the projects , I would look up at the stars and dream of going into space .
Of escaping the slums .
Of killing the Ewok !
Now the man that kid has become can make those dreams come true .
Do you know what that ’s like ? ”
“ Then you know why I have to do this .
As Robert Browning once wrote , ‘ Ho , but a man ’s reach should exceed his grasp , or what is a heaven for ?
I was prepared for the possibility of this meeting . ”
“ Thank you , Jacky D ! ”
“ At least it ’s a dry heat here in Florida . ”
“ Computer , when do I get some Tang ?
Also , I ’m thirsty .
Hahahahaha .
Wordplay .
Hahaha . ”
“ I ’m scared , but I ’m also excited !
Hahahah .
Ooooh .
I ’m Lizzing .
Hahaha .
Lizzing .
I ’m Lizzing . ”
“ Tracy to Earth .
Come in Earth . ”
“ Great wink , Kenneth .
Space is very cold , but very beautiful .
And sometimes it sounds like Jenna yelling in the distance .
I think I- Oh my God , where did you get that rocket ? ”
“ It ’s awesome . ”
“ Hey , Jacky D . If everyone could see the world the way I see it , it would be a better place to live ! ”
“ I think so .
I wish I was there so I could play with it . ”
Episode 17
“ Dessert . ”
“ Someone put too many farts in this engine , it ’s about to explode . ”
“ I ’m Flava Obama and I ’d like to introduce our Undersecretary of Housing and Crystal Meth , boooooyyyyy . ”
“ It ’s farting .
It ’s farting . ”
“ That ’s our show for tonight , see you next week ! ”
“ This is TGS . ”
“ Woah , K . ”
“ I ’m sorry , but just let me know if there ’s any way I can help . ”
“ No , I was just saying that .
Why ca n’t you read human facial cues ?
Alright , what is it ? ”
“ Yeah , OK .
Birds are like little dinosaurs .
So what I ’ll be doing is actually pretty cool and brave . ”
“ What ? ”
“ Hey , little guy . ”
“ I was n’t going to .
I was n’t going to .
Ahhh . ”
“ Jenna , something weird is going on . ”
“ No , it ’s not that .
Jenna , you ’re the smartest person I know .
Do you think Kenneth could be a murderer ? ”
“ Well , I might be crazy , but neither he , nor his bird would let me into his bedroom .
And why would n’t you want to let Tracy Jordan into your bedroom unless you got a bunch of dead nurses in there . ”
“ He grew up killing pigs . ”
“ No wonder he ’s fascinated when I do that . ”
“ I admonished him for that earlier .
Three for three , he ’s a monster . ”
“ Hey , K. Where ’s Jonathan ? ”
“ Uh , huh . ”
“ Yeah , it ’s about someone else .
I ’m afraid this guy I know in Canada might be a serial killer . ”
“ Kenneth .
I mean , I ’ll tell you his name .
It ’s Kenneth . ”
“ If I had any doubts about this before , and I do n’t think I did , they ’re gone now . ”
“ Yeah , like Julia and Denzel in the Pelican Brief . ”
“ Jenna , I just want you to know , that if we find any human remains in there , I ’m gonna throw up all over your face . ”
“ Oh , no .
Kenneth ’s a murderer and a Riddler is coming . ”
“ Yeah , but on the bright side , you ’ve been downgraded from suspect to person of interest . ”
“ Hahahaha .
Time does heal all wounds . ”
“ Ken , we feel bad that we , but mostly Jenna , gassed your bird . ”
Episode 18
“ No , Passive resistance .
I learned that from Dr. King .
I ’m brave ! ”
“ I do n’t need to read it .
The entire thing is loosely based on an evening I spent with Isaiah Thomas . ”
“ Alright , enough .
This fighting stops now . ”
“ I knew this would happen someday .
A woman would come between us .
Well I ’m not standing by , I ’m taking action . ”
“ Well , Liz Lemon ’s in jail now and somebody has to step up and take charge around here . ”
“ Let the problem solving begin . ”
“ Are you Daphne ?
Yeah , you ’re fired . ”
“ I had to .
Friendship and trust in the entourage is the most important thing .
Like that HBO show , John Adams . ”
“ Hmmm , usually this is the point in my process where Liz Lemon steps in and takes care of everything .
Heavy is the head that eats the crayons .
Gonna take a nap , see you in 10 hours . ”
“ No we do n’t , he ’s not even gonna notice they ’re gone . ”
“ These are the new dancers , Ken. Say hi to Velvet . ”
“ Just think , an hour ago they were broiling in the parking lot , but tonight they ’re gonna be stars .
Oh boy . ”
“ As we celebrate the life of Jenna Maroney . ”
“ That was some of Jenna Maroney ’s earlier work .
It ’s hard to believe that both of those women outlived her , especially the woman on the right .
We ’ll be right back . ”
“ And finally tonight .
What more fitting way to say goodbye to our friend than with the gift she gave all of us , her music .
Ladies and gentlemen , Issac Bimmelmans and the Tracy Jordan Dancers . ”
“ Why are you smiling , you ’re freaking me out . ”
“ You ’re crazy . ”

Episode 19
“ We ’ve narrowed it down , Liz Lemmon . ”
“ This Saturday is the 20th anniversary of the night that me and Angie met .
She was working at the Diker Heights Arthur Treaches and I was residing there .
She slipped me a free shrimp combo and we ’ve been together ever since , so this present has to be special .
It ’s either going to be a denim jacket that says ‘ Hot Bitch ’ in diamonds , or a Slanket . ”
“ You are wise , Liz Lemon , like a genetically manipulated shark .
So as a token of my gratitude , I got something especially for you . ”
“ Liz Lemon , you dummy . ”
“ I asked Angie what she wanted for our anniversary , and she wants me to get a tattoo of her name . ”
“ And above it she wants this picture of her face .
I ca n’t have this on my chest scaring off beautiful women in the clubs . ”
“ You know I like to socialize , Liz Lemon .
And you know my signature move with the ladies . ”
“ It ’s taking off my shirt . ”
“ Now , it ’s a Sophie ’s Choice .
I ca n’t get this tattoo and I ca n’t tell Angie ‘ no ’ . ”
“ That ’s a start , Liz Lemmon , that ’s a start . ”
“ Dotcom , that is a great idea .
If you want everyone to think I own a gay lion .
Tangiers ? ”
“ Look , this is my reputation we ’re talking about here .
Use your heads . ”
“ Continue . ”
“ - Is for me to arrange a test of erotic temptation .
Yes . ”
“ We ’re going out tonight , Jacky D , and we ’re going to be tempted like Jesus in the wilderness .
Jesus is my stereo guy and the Wilderness is a club I took him to once . ”
“ Sure thing , baby .
Give a kid a call , hmm ?
Holla ? ”
“ Tip of the iceberg , Jacky D . You can have all of this whenever you want .
Or , you could marry that nice lady you ’re in love with .
It ’s up to you . ”
“ Of course I do .
Angie ’s the one . ”
“ It ’s a thing I made up after seeing the Matrix . ”
“ OK .
This is something I ’ve never told anyone .
This is my terrible secret .
In 20 years that I ’ve known her , I ’ve never cheated on my wife .
There , I said it .
Do n’t look at me . ”
“ The partying is just for show , and because I ’m a high - functioning alcoholic .
All those phone numbers you see me handing out ?
They ’re not even mine . ”
“ So can you .
Because I ’m a ridiculous unstable human being . ”
“ And if Angie wants me to get a tattoo of her to prove my life , then I ’m getting that tattoo . ”
“ Griz , get the car .
Dotcom get the coats and which one of your ladies wants to pick up the tab . ”
“ No and at large .
I mighta went out and had too a little much to drink last night , but you ’ll be proud of me , Liz Lemon Cool J , because I went out and got that tattoo Angie wanted me to get .
Pow !
How you like me now ? ”
Episode 20
“ What the hell time is it ? ”
“ No , I took my son to his cello recital this morning at what turned out to be midnight yesterday !
White opressors , answer my question .
What time is it really ? ”
“ You ’re a bunch of racists . ”
“ You treat me like a child .
No worse than that .
You treat me like one of those little pageant girls with the clip on teeth . ”
“ Irregardless , you know what ?
Race card ! ”
“ I think I ’ve made my point . ”
“ Do n’t patronize me with your Celtic slang , Liz Lemon , we have a black president now . ”
“ This is post - racial America , and I demand to be treated like everyone else . ”
“ Fine . ”
“ Fine , I ’ll bring my lunch from home . ”
“ You do n’t think I can do that ? ”
“ Fine , but I ’ll have the last laugh .
Hahahaha . ”
“ Professional is my middle name . ”
“ No need , I ’ve got it memorized . ”
“ I ’m going to do a Valentino cross , camera right , then dump the lavs , so stay on your fours , guys . ”
“ 3:15 , time for union break . ”
“ No .
Do not apologize .
In fact , everyone ?
Everyone gather round .
Actor announcement .
I want to publicly thank you , Liz Lemon , for you have shown me , that in today ’s world , everyone should be treated exactly the same .
No one should get preferential treatment . ”
“ Not black comedy superstars , not Hispanics , not Indians , not whatever this guy is .
And not women , Liz Lemon . ”
“ Good .
I feel parched from being so professional , could I trouble you for some water ? ”
“ No . No. Equality .
Everyone should be treated the same , right Liz Lemon ?
You should change it . ”
“ No one help her . ”
“ Hello , Liz Lemon .
I was just telling these fellas how you do n’t want to be treated any differently because you ’re a woman . ”
“ Good .
We ’re learning . ”
“ Hello , Elizabeth . ”
“ I ’m done with my work , I was very professional . ”
“ It was . ”
“ You coming , Liz Lemmon ?
Because a dude boss would be a jerk if he did n’t come to Lutz ’s bachelor party .
Also a dude boss , would pay for it . ”
“ Twist . ”
“ I do n’t want to be here , I do n’t like it here .
Who is this guy ? ”
“ The black one .
I ca n’t take it anymore .
I hate it . ”
“ Everything is upside down . ”
“ Yes , we upset the natural order .
You ’re going to strip clubs , I ’m up writing all night . ”
“ We ’re dressing monkeys up as people and monkeys are playing with people as toys ! ”
“ We do n’t wanna end up like those two ! ”
Episode 21
“ Come on in , Jack , I ’m just practicing sitting . ”
“ Because he ’s dead . ”
“ Because if that man was alive , he ’d be living in my pool house and I ’d be paying him two hundred thousand dollars a year to mow my lawn . ”
“ I feel like you ’re not telling me something , Jack .
Let me guess .
You bought a sidecar for your motorcycle and your dog wo n’t stay in it . ”
“ Why ?
Jack , every man should know his father . ”
“ No it was n’t .
I struggled through that sentence .
But I know what I ’m talking about because not long ago a son I did n’t know about found me . ”
“ My love child tracked me down .
I was shocked , scared , angry .
Like a dog in a sidecar when it comes loose from the motorcycle .
But it turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me . ”
“ Everybody , gather up .
Actor announcement .
No , human announcement . ”
“ There ’s something I want you all to hear directly from me before you read about it in next month ’s issue of Black Entrepreneur and Butts Magazine .
I have an illegitimate son . ”
“ Obviously , my family wanted to keep this private , but somehow , those vultures in the media found out about it . ”
“ Like a dog in a sidecar when it comes loose from the motorcycle .
But it turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me . ”
“ Oh , noooooooo . ”
“ Now , I did n’t know about this boy up until three years ago , but I ’ve been supporting him financially ever since .
And I want you all to meet him . ”
“ I want you bastards to meet my bastard .
My baby boy , Donald Jordan . ”
“ Well , as long as it ’s for something you need . ”
“ I love you , man . ”
“ Why wo n’t this stupid gizmo do what I want .
I ’m going to miss the lotto drawing . ”
“ Of course , why would I lie about my age , I ’m in the entertainment industry . ”
“ Not familiar , but what about this song ?
[ Singing ]
Tea is great after being out late , after walking my baby ba - ”
“ 39 . ”
“ Yes you are , son .
That ’s what that birth certificate you printed out for me said . ”
“ Yes I do , and I left the amount blank , just like you asked . ”
“ Donald ’s opening a dojo . ”
I
“ Hey , remember this song ?
[ Singing ]
If e’r a fair maiden , a knight chance to see . ”
“ OK , that was to put in Dotcom ’s birthday card .
But you ’re right .
The card is enough . ”
“ I know . ”
“ Liz Lemon , I might hug people too hard and get lost in malls .
But I ’m not an idiot . ”
“ When Donald came to me he was a fast talking charmer from the wrong side of the track .
He reminded me of someone , Liz Lemon , Jon Travolta ’s character from Grease .
And me . ”
“ Call it what you want , but in the last three years , Donald has gone from scamming celebrities to being a small business owner . ”
“ And the community center is thriving .
Do you know Kenneth ’s eighty dollars bought a chess set and a crate of condoms ? ”
“ That ’s what ya’ll naming it ?
Thank you , son .
Thank you . ”

“ Not interested . ”
“ Because Frank Lucas High School was a hell hole .
Griz knows , he was there .
A drug dealer named Campbell , he ruled that school .
He wanted me to find a snitch called Baby .
Campbell wanted me to cut him open . ”
“ I would n’t do it .
I dropped out , and I vowed never to go back to that place . ”
“ Yes he was . ”
“ No he was n’t . ”
“ What frog ? ”
“ When have I ever cried ? ”
“ It ’s true , there is no Baby .
I was chicken .
I was chicken . ”
“ You ca n’t understand , Ken .
Where I come from , street cred is everything .
That ’s why , when I left that school in shame , I vowed never to cry again .
And I never have . ”
“ Do n’t die !
I love you , Jack . ”
“ Diet Slice and some pita chips . ”

I have a wolfdog , and I have two bad knees and I have a gun .
That I lost ! ”
“ Damn , K , you know who that was ? ”
“ I grew up with that guy .
He was the baddest gangster in my class .
We called him ‘ Mean Steve ’ , but his real name was Steven Killah . ”
“ Well , if a bad ass OG like that can get stuck delivering food , how did I get out ? ”
“ You ’re right , Ken .
They should .
5 F bombs , right ? ”
“ I almost did n’t make it here this afternoon , but then a very special friend showed me the way .
So I ’d like to take a moment to thank Victor Cardova from the Sunoco station on Lennox Avenue . ”
“ But there ’s another reason why I almost did n’t come today .
Fear .
Fear of letting people know the real me .
I have but one thing to say to all of you .
Be yourself .
And I ’m talking to you clearly , gay kid .
And you , white kid just trying to go unnoticed . ”
“ Just be yourself and I guarantee you every single person in this room will one day be President of the United States . ”
“ OK , but I ’m allergic to horses . ”
“ [ Crying ]
Who wants my autograph . ”
“ There you are , you stupid cracker .
Do you know why I get a hotel room ?
To poop in peace !
No kids banging on the door , no phones ringing .
It ’s my time !
Every Tuesday and Thursday at three PM .
I do n’t know why I only go twice a week .
That ’s what Angie should be worried about . ”
“ Pete , how am I going to live , I only have three hundred million dollars . ”
“ High school graduate , do you know what this means , Griz ?

MySpace is about to lose its position as no .
1 social - networking site for US users , as rival Facebook strides ahead .
MySpace has 70 million monthly US uniques ( Comscore , March 2009 ) .
Meanwhile , Facebook has surged to 61 million US users and is adding a few million more every month .
According to TechCrunch worldwide monthly page views for MySpace have declined from 47.4 billion a year ago to 38 billion today , a 20 percent drop .
In the same period Facebook has grown from 44 billion to 87 billion , a near 100 percent increase .
MySpace has seen a 16 percent year - on - year drop in page views , from 41.6 billion to 34.8 billion ( Comscore , April 2009 ) .
Facebook has grown from 13 billion to 20 billion page views per month .
TechCrunch has declared the war over : " MySpace is a battleship that 's going in the wrong direction at high speed .
It 's hard to turn a battleship .
Perhaps even impossible in this case , " writes TechCrunch 's Michael Arrington .
" In about a year from now MySpace will receive their last welfare payment from Google , and they 'll be on their own .
They 'll have a social network that costs half a billion dollars a year to run .
" With page views decreasing and the Google money gone there is a strong likelihood that the News Corp. subsidiary will be unprofitable a year from now .
Revenue of $ 800 + million last year could easily decrease to well below half a billion dollars , and likely will . "
This story , " Facebook Wins the Social Network War " was originally published by PC Advisor ( UK ) .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
The nation ’s capital is recovering from a week of cops running wild Every year on May 15 , National Peace Officers Memorial Day is celebrated in Washington .
During this week , thousands of police drive their squad cars across the country to participate in around - the - clock conferences and parties .
There ’s a candlelight vigil to honor slain officers and a relay race for charities to benefit families of police killed in the line of duty .
These are commendable activities to honor the thin blue line that helps keep order in our communities .
Unfortunately , the bad judgment of a few rowdy cops can cast a shadow over the week ’s worthwhile events .
For years , local residents have whispered to one another to stay off the roads at night during National Police Week because of all the police cars swerving wildly after the bars close .
This year , the Metropolitan Police took the unusual step of ticketing cruisers because so many were parked illegally .
Roll Call ran two photos last week of out - of - state police cars parked in a handicap spot and a space reserved for Zipcars .
Emergency fire lanes across the city were blocked by police cars .
The dangerous activity is not limited to automobiles .
Drinking while carrying sidearms is an annual part of the celebrations .
A few years back , one inebriated officer tripped out of a bar in Chinatown and unloaded his pistol on the bell tower of nearby St. Mary , Mother of God Catholic Church .
At Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium two years ago , four officers from Signal Hill , Calif. , made a public spectacle of themselves at a Nationals - Braves baseball game .
With little regard for safety and even less concern for their appearance , these law enforcement officers were chugging down beers while in full uniform with their pistols on their hips and spare bullet clips on their utility belts .
One concerned spectator asked them if it was against police regulations to be drinking alcohol while carrying weapons .
In response , one of the officers teetered over , spilled his beer , put his finger to his lips and slurred , “ shhhhh ” - giggling uncontrollably .
A few moments later , a cop jumped out of his seat to celebrate a home run , spilling his beer all over the displeased stranger seated next to him .
A whole section of the stadium was yelling “ Down in front ” as the police blocked spectators ’ view of play on the field so they could take pictures of themselves in front of first base .
At least two concerned citizens called the Signal Hill Police headquarters , were assured that the incident was being looked into , and then received no follow - up despite attempts to discover if any disciplinary action had been taken .
The bad behavior of these police officers exposes a double standard .
As one Nationals fan , who is a lawyer , told us : “ There ’s no way those cops could pass a street sobriety test right now .
Just imagine how we ’d get treated if they pulled us over having consumed half of what they ’ve drunk tonight - and they ’re packing heat . ”
We do n’t begrudge police officers having a little fun , but they need to abide by the same laws they enforce on the rest of us .
When they go out for a few beers , they might want to leave their uniforms and guns at home .

I 've been conducting an experiment .
I 've supplemented woeful headlines with a rich infusion of economics texts .
Macro , micro , behavioural and neo-classical , I 've tried them all .
I 've been to Adam Smith and Milton Friedman , but I 've also scoured the work of lesser - known DWEES ( Dead White European Economists ) .
And I 've tried financial gurus , too , like George Soros .
Of course I reread Keynes .
But it has n't been easy .
The closed - off , deterministic ambience of economics still gets to me .
So does the conspicuous absence of humans , except as producers or consumers .
And the language ( anyone for " quantitative easing " ? ) remains , with rare exceptions , dreadful .
For all its apparent methodological sophistication , a lot of economics is best experienced as a pseudo - science , valuable often for what it does n't purport to tell us – the odd flashes of illumination rather than the extrapolation of often misleading statistics .
Economists like to pad out their credentials with references to the area in which they claim expertise .
So - called behavioural economics is voguish now , but I am not sure whether this means more than a rueful acknowledgment that " the dismal science " is cracking apart under the pressures we place on its practitioners .
The message I 've brought back from the economic front is that we must listen to economists , but they must change the way they speak to us .
And it would be best if the change occurred immediately , before the world is further damaged .

There are 30,000 economists with PhDs , and this smallish tribe appears to be overwhelmingly male , with an inherited over - rational view of life .
Many economists really do believe , mountains of evidence from Darwin or literature to the contrary , that we are a rational species .
A survey conducted among the economics departments of MIT , Harvard and Stanford reveals that most young economists place overwhelming trust in mathematics .
( A " broad knowledge of the economy " seemed important to only 3 per cent of respondents , whereas to 68 per cent it seemed unimportant . )
Is the practice of economics really that different from what we hacks do ?
Giles Keating , head of research at the Credit Suisse Private Bank , tells me that the models used by economists should be regarded as " partial representations " of reality .
" One should guard against certainty , " he says .
" And one should also realise that no model ever applies 100 per cent . "
Economists can seem dogmatic while ceaselessly changing their minds .
No wonder that when they are depicted in popular culture , it is as uber - nerds , stuck in their own backrooms and requiring rescuers .
A clue to how economists might change comes from Richard Layard , who has tried to reconfigure economics by marrying statistics to the utilitarian , pleasure - based philosophy of Jeremy Bentham .
Layard thinks that social sciences can be made to deliver happiness .
Criticising the number of economists who " do n't do useful things , " he tells me that each one should also be " a bit of something else . "
Economics was , by and large , a 19th century invention rooted in a confident sense that information would aid progress , and early practitioners assembled data with the zeal of demented Casaubons .
By the mid-20th century economists acquired the status of secular seers .
They were supposed to supervise developed economies , raising up less developed ones .
Although it was never clear whether what they did should be considered as a science or not , it was accepted that economists had a patent on the future .
Ensconced in foundations , finance ministries , planning departments of corporations , ubiquitous on cable TV shows , Homo Economicus ruled .
Who else would tell us how our complex societies were likely to develop ?
Who else was capable of predicting the future ?
By the 1980s , it became fashionable for financial firms to acquire economists .
Economists lent their skills to anticipating the performance of markets , at the price of becoming salesmen .
The economist Robert Shiller , who did predict the slump , believes that many pre-slump practitioners in the vicinity suffered from " Groupthink " – a polite way of saying that they were so far in on the game and failed to notice anything was amiss .
Dissenters from the prevailing optimism were abused as spoilsports bent on wrecking a good party .
As Keating explains , people cease to listen when you write the same memo predicting catastrophe for the fifth time .
Although economists are not as unpopular as their banker patrons , they , too , have suffered from the backlash since the Crash .
Among others , the Queen has wondered aloud why economists had n't anticipated disaster .
For Robert Skidelsky , author of the biography of John Maynard Keynes , economics consists for the most part of rehashed fads .
" A few geniuses aside , economists frame their assumptions to suit existing states of affairs , " he says .
" They are intellectual butlers , serving the interests of those in power , not vigilant observers of shifting reality .
Their systems trap them in orthodoxy . "
I 'm not sure that Skidelsky is n't exaggerating .
Some of the most important writing in our time comes from the vicinity of economics – not , to be sure , from the now discredited school of so - called " classical " economists , but from outsiders on the periphery of the profession .
There have been shrewd best - sellers like Freakonomics , or the recent Nudge ( recommended by David Cameron ) using economics methodology to render the kinks of human nature .

This year 's cult book in New York is Lords of Finance , a gruesomely topical account of the blindness of central bankers during the 1930s slump by Liaquat Ahamed , formerly an economist at the World Bank .
Economists now come from diverse academic backgrounds , and some of them nowadays are women .
Gillian
Tett , shortly to publish a book on the Crash , says she learnt about economics amid the wreckage of the failed Soviet system , working in a Tajikistan village on a PhD in anthropology .
She tells me that we should redefine Home Economics .
Everyone should be sufficiently numerate to understand how credit card debt is accumulated , and how economies , national or international , do or do n't function .
The best economists are now touchingly ready to admit that they do not really know what is going to happen .
When I approached Martin Wolf four months ago , I asked him how long it would be before we knew if the world financial system could recover fully , he paused .
" I do n't really know the answer to that question , " he said .
" It could be months , but it could be years , too . "
When I asked how we would know , he almost shrugged .
" I 'm not sure , " he said .
It would seem from recent columns that Wolf is uncertain about our prospects .
" I am becoming ever more worried , " he wrote recently .
My first encounter with economics took place in the 1970s when , as a young journalist , I was required to construct for the BBC a device illustrating the effects of inflation .
The machine , which looked like something built by Wallace and Gromit , had glass tubes and valves and coloured liquids .
When operated by an economist , it began to leak ; and it was consigned to the props department without further ado .
But I absorbed the work of Keynes on the Central Line between power cuts during the Three Days ' Week .
A Keynes revival is under way now , but the great man 's memory has been wrongly evoked before .
Keynes was a speculator , patron of the arts , entrepreneur , promiscuous homosexual , unsuccessful philosopher and purveyor of the best cerebral one - liners .
He ripped up the rule book of classical economists .
Keynes saw that slumps did n't disappear of their own accord .
If we wanted to , we should cause them to end .
Keynes gadded about from one conference to another during the 1930s in a not entirely successful effort to persuade governments to take action , borrowing money to create jobs and pumping money into the economy .
This is the Keynes daily celebrated in the editorial pages of posh newspapers .
But Keynes changed his mind a lot .
In the 1930s , he was dealing with governments pathologically averse to debt but it's not clear that he would approve of today 's gigantic debt levels in the US and Britain .
As his Russian ballerina wife said , Keynes was " more than economist " .
He believed that he was set on earth for the purpose of saving liberal civilisation from extinction .
Keynes was the ultimate British sceptic , rudely , gloriously provocative .
He began his career as a philosopher , later pondering the difference between risk and uncertainty .
At best , economists could prepare us for uncertainty .
" We do not know what the future will bring , " he once told a group of bankers , " except that it will be different from any future we could predict . "
Keynes would not have been surprised to see his ideas fall from fashion , as they did in the late 1970s .
I once had the pleasure of eating a chicken salad sandwich for lunch with the free - market guru Milton Friedman , and he seemed to be one of the most happy people I have ever met .
Friedman did truly believe that left to their devices , markets worked , and that governments should be encouraged to do as little as possible , and he chided me gently when I expressed my admiration for Keynes .
( " Brits always love him " , he said tolerantly .
" I 'm not sure why . " )
The Friedman sunshine is to be found distilled in Alan Greenspan 's memoir The Age of Turbulence .
Greenspan advised four Presidents as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank , and he should be seen as the most influential figure in Planet Money of the past two decades .
The Greenspan boom was based on cheap money and minimal regulation .
Last autumn Greenspan appeared before Congress , delivering an astonishing mea culpa .
" The whole intellectual edifice collapsed in the summer of last year , " Greenspan admitted .
He meant that the neoclassical , mainstream economics practiced by him had failed , because of a " fundamental flaw " .
Markets were n't , as he had believed , self - correcting .
They did n't always display rationality – because individuals did n't behave rationally .
Greenspan was saying that at certain times , irrationality would rule .
More important , he was suggesting that the guiding principle of rational selfishness he had espoused , and promoted for so long , was an illusion .
It 's still hard to comprehend the levels of greed and stupidity that characterised the era which ended with last October 's crash .
The excess is best understood in relation to the ridiculous art bubble that accompanied Wall Street 's Glory Years .
One instrument invented in the past years of madness was the Collateralized Debt Obligation , in its latter stages of evolution made not from real debts , but from so - called synthetic materials .
Rather than acquiring securities or bonds or other debt instruments in order to sell them , salesmen invented them – and then sold them .
The idea of fake debt or securities legitimately traded has allure , it 's equivalents today " zombie bank " and " vulture fund " , have rather less .
The worst thing about this slump is that one cannot imaginatively share the experience of financial misery .
Unlike other events – wars , royal weddings , rock concerts – crashes induce nothing but fear experienced strictly in isolation .
Rather than bringing people together , slumps keep them separate .
It would appear that Maoists have reappeared in China , calling for the abolition of capitalism , but we are nonetheless lumbered with the system that failed us – a crucial difference from the 1930s , when millions , not just in the Soviet Union , believed that markets could be superseded .
Much has been shattered in the past months , most of all the illusion that a borderless world , having broken out of the cycles of boom and bust , would run on , held together by little more than the free exchange of goods .
Not just New Labour , but the politics of the West are held together by what has proved to be a fiction .
For the moment , too , the slump has also diminished the appeal of the notion that , left to itself , abetted by the astute manipulation of interest rates capitalism spreads wealth efficiently , if unevenly , pulling the poor out of their misery .
Economists did their best to promote such ideas , but we are guilty of collusion .
Did anyone really , outside the think tanks of the market fundamentalist right , buy into the neo-liberal world vision ?
A vision of our future was wholly absent from many of the texts I read .
But I did find a distinctive hell relevant to our present .
Within the world of economists a cult surrounds the darkly pessimistic views of the Austrian - born economist Joseph Alois Schumpeter , who died in 1950 .
He is remembered for his definition of capitalism as " creative destruction " .
Schumpeter bequeathed two important if controversial insights .
The first was that capitalism could n't function even half effectively without a succession of brutally successful entrepreneurs ready to overthrow the existing order .
The second was that capitalism was n't in the least moral , whatever Adam Smith had intimated .
It was so unappealing that it was always likely to cause revolts on the part of those whom it had destroyed , ultimately ensuring its own destruction .
Schumpeter would have been fully at home in the present , pooh - poohing worries over millions of jobs lost each month .
" I often wonder , " he wrote in his diary , " whether there is anything that ever happened that could not be turned into a business opportunity . "
Now that the momentary euphoria of the G20 summit is past , economists have returned to the dismal daily figures .
Is there anyone who does n't think that a prolonged slump will cause widespread political upheavals ?
Fear and greed are the primary capitalist emotions , but for the slump befuddlement seems more appropriate .
As I read about economics , I learnt to identify an expression on people 's faces .
One could see it not just in the job centres of Middle Britain or Ohio , but among those locked out of Guangzhou toy factories .
It was present among the nouveaux pauvres of Palm Beach or Park Avenue defrauded by Bernie Madoff .
Japanese Finance Ministers succumbed , so on occasions did Gordon Brown , and economists themselves .
And yet knowing a bit more does help , as I discovered .
At least you begin to comprehend what can not be known to any reliable degree .
This is what Liaquat Ahamed told me .
" Economics does n't always tell you about what really happens .
There are too many theorists , and practitioners concoct them to order .
They are a bit like lawyers . "
For real understanding , Ahamed thinks we have to turn to history .
The fascination of his account of the last slump lies in his insistence that so much suffering could have been avoided in the 1930s – if the powerful had been less blind , cleverer , more compassionate .
If not a magician , we 'd like another Keynes , perhaps .
However , in a lifetime of polemical activity , Keynes never uttered a word of false reassurance .
Economics , he once said , could provide " the circumstances of civilisation " .
He meant that it was up to the rest of us to decide what we wanted .
Economists could only help us achieve that goal .
So we do need to tell economists how we want the world to be .
And if economists are to fix our world , they need to know more about it .

Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday angered unions and politicians with plans to cut up to 4,500 staff in Britain as part of a worldwide reduction of 9,000 posts .
The bank , which is 70 % owned by the taxpayer , said the cuts were part of a policy to save about £ 2.5 bn over the next three years .
The Unite union said the cuts were a " devastating blow " for staff at the bank 's Edinburgh headquarters where most of the UK job cuts are expected to fall .
Many Scottish parliament members ( MSPs ) were resigned to the loss of large numbers of staff following the collapse of the bank last year and its £ 20 bn bailout by the government .
But there was anger last night among many politicians after it was pointed out that a bank boss had denied further job cuts at meeting two weeks ago .
The bank 's deputy chief executive , Gordon Pell , the only survivor from the regime of disgraced former boss Sir Fred Goodwin , told a committee of MSPs he was unaware of large scale job cuts in the pipeline .
RBS sought to head off criticism of the cuts with a statement of its determination to minimise compulsory redundancies .
It has begun consulting unions over the job cuts , which will affect up to 9,000 people in 50 countries over the next two years , in back - office operations ranging from IT services to property management .
The bank said the actual number of jobs lost was expected to be " significantly lower " as it would try to redeploy people .
RBS , which is believed to be preparing a further round of cuts later in the year , has already shed 2,700 jobs at its main centres in Edinburgh , London , Manchester and Bristol .
Gordon Brown entered the debate over the future of the industry last night when he told Britain 's leading banks that the plight of RBS showed the need for the reform of the financial sector .
At a meeting of the Lending Panel , the body in which the government and the main banks review lending levels , the prime minister said the financial sector would only prosper if it was reformed .
A Downing Street spokesman said : " We needed to continue to reform financial regulation in Britain .
Britain was a world centre for financial services and , with the right reforms in place , could continue to be a leading centre in the future .
" The financial sector would continue to be integral to Britain 's future prosperity , but it must be reformed to reflect the changing global circumstances we face . "
Stephen Hester , RBS chief executive , echoed Brown 's comments , saying the bank needed to withdraw from riskier areas .
A cost cutting programme was also needed to bring it back into profit .
" Unfortunately that means taking difficult decisions about jobs as well as taking many other cost reduction actions . "
RBS employs 170,000 people , 106,000 of whom are based in the UK .
Its back - office operations employ 45,000 people worldwide , including 27,000 in Britain .
Rob MacGregor , Unite 's national officer , said the union was " appalled that thousands of people , who form the backbone of the RBS operations , are to be made redundant " .
He added : " These employees are totally blameless for the current position which RBS is in , yet they are paying for the mistakes at the top of the bank . "
Shirley - Anne Somerville , SNP MSP for Lothians , which includes the RBS headquarters on the outskirts of Edinburgh , said : " Today 's announcement will be devastating for those working at RBS and will cause great concern across the city as we wait to find out where the job losses will take place .
" After RBS initially said only 2,500 jobs would go , these figures are a dramatic increase .
I have already contacted the Scottish government and I am confident SNP ministers will give every support they can to those who now face redundancy . "
Meanwhile , the corporate governance lobby group Pirc called on BP shareholders to oppose the reappointment of former RBS non-executive Sir Peter Sutherland as the oil group 's chairman .
It drew attention to Sutherland 's role on RBS 's remuneration committee , which approved Goodwin 's £ 703,000 - a- year pension .
" His actions as a non-executive director of Royal Bank of Scotland and as a member of its remuneration committee bring into question his suitability as BP 's chairman , " Pirc said .
A BP spokesman said Pirc 's views were not shared by most BP shareholders .
The Why of Perl Roles explains some of the motivations behind the inclusion of roles in Perl 6 and their implementation in Perl 5 through Moose .
Perl Roles Versus Inheritance compares the design and intent of using roles to " traditional " subclassing inheritance .
Duck Typing
A common object design strategy in dynamic languages is Duck Typing .
The cliché is that if an object walks ( ) like a Duck and quacks ( ) like a Duck , it must be a Duck enough that the rest of the program can treat it like a Duck .
In other words , the presence of a method with a name that you recognize from some context is proof enough that the object responds to that method in a way that makes sense in the context you had in mind .
That often works .
False Cognates
Sometimes it does n't work .
Suppose ( and yes , this is already a cliché in Perl circles ) that your program models a park .
You have a Dog class .
You have a Tree class .
Given an object for which you do n't immediately know its type -- assume you 're using a dynamic language or that your genericity system performs type erasure and you 're effectively using a dynamic language -- do you know which bark ( ) method is appropriate in any given situation ?
This is the false cognate problem ; the name of a method is not always sufficient to determine its intended meaning .
Duck Typing and Type Checking
Defense - minded duck typers soon realize that blindly calling methods on objects of unknown type is a recipe for disaster .
( To be fair , a well - organized program runs into this problem rarely .
Even in the absence of strict typing -- or manifest types -- it 's rare not to know the types of objects you expect within specific scopes in the program .
Then again , I do n't add error checking to my programs because I expect exceptional conditions to occur frequently . )
One approach is to use object introspection to see if the object in question really does support the required method .
In Perl , this is :
croak ' Duck typing failure ' unless $ dog_or_tree -> can ( ' bark ' ) ;
Or in Ruby , something like :
raise ' Duck typing failure ' unless dog_or_tree.respond_to ? ( ' bark ' )
If you want to get stricter , and if your language supports this , you can even check the arity or types of the allowed signatures of the method -- but look at all of the boilerplate code you have to write to make this work .
That 's also code to check only a single method .
Suppose you want to call several methods on the object .
You could check can ( ) or respond_to ?
for each of them ... but at this point , people often check the class inheritance of the object , in Perl with :
croak ' Duck typing failure ' unless $ dog_or_tree ->isa ( ' Dog ' ) ;
Or in Ruby , somethin like :
raise ' Duck typing failure ' unless dog_or_tree.is_a ? ( ' Dog ' ) ;
Of course , this precludes other ways in which your object can perform the correct bark ( ) methods : reimplementing it , mixing it in from elsewhere , delegating to it , or composing it -- unless you explicitly lie to the rest of the system about the identity of your object by overriding isa ( ) in Perl or is_a ? in Ruby .
Liars tend to get caught , and the results can be messy .
Roles , False Cognates , and Identity
In the context of a Dog , it 's obvious what bark ( ) means .
In the context of a Tree , it 's obvious what bark ( ) means .
Without that context , you just do n't know .
Roles add that context back .
If you want to deal with a Dog , check that the provided object performs the Dog role .
Similarly for Tree .
Instead of asking " Do you provide a method with this name ? " , ask " Do you perform this role ? "
The latter question avoids false cognates and ensures that the class representing the provided object fulfills the contract required by that role at compilation time .
As well , you do n't have to check the inheritance structure of a given object .
It does n't matter .
The most important lesson of duck typing is that any object which provides an interface you both understand appropriately should be substitutable for any other object which provides that well - understood interface .
How that object fulfills that interface is its own business .
Roles provide a way for developers to name a collection of behavior and then refer to objects -- generically -- in terms of whether they provide that collection of behavior .
The ad hoc , free - form nature of duck typing is great for providing future extensibility ; it does n't lock your code into a rigid hierarchy that can prove brittle during future maintenance .
However , duck typing sometimes fails to provide enough information about necessary meaning and context , and the workarounds to make a duck typed program more robust can subvert the goals of duck typing .
Next time , I 'll compare roles to ( Java ) interfaces .
Stimulus projects bypass hard - hit states WASHINGTON 
States hit hardest by the recession received only a few of the government 's first stimulus contracts , even though the glut of new federal spending was meant to target places where the economic pain has been particularly severe .
Nationwide , federal agencies have awarded nearly $ 4 billion in contracts to help jump - start the economy since President Obama signed the massive stimulus package in February .
But , with few exceptions , that money has not reached states where the unemployment rate is highest , according to a USA TODAY review of contracts disclosed through the Federal Procurement Data System .
In Michigan , for example — where years of economic tumult and a collapsing domestic auto industry have produced the nation 's worst unemployment rate — federal agencies have spent about $ 2 million on stimulus contracts , or 21 cents per person .
In Oregon , where unemployment is almost as high , they have spent $ 2.12 per capita , far less than the nationwide average of nearly $ 13 .
That money " is needed nowhere more than it is needed in Michigan , " says Leslee Fritz , a spokeswoman for the Michigan Economic Recovery Office , which is coordinating stimulus efforts in that state .
She said officials are generally satisfied with the pace of federal aid , but added , " We certainly feel very intensely the need to move quickly . "
The $ 787 billion recovery package was intended to help turn around the economy using federal money to create jobs , especially in places where the recession has taken the most severe toll .
Most of that money goes directly to states to pay for work such as highway repairs , but federal agencies also will spend billions of dollars to do everything from fixing runways and improving national forests to cleaning up nuclear waste .
The first waves of that money flowed unevenly in large part because some federal agencies have moved more swiftly than others to sign contracts for projects funded by the stimulus .
In many cases , those first contracts went to projects that began years ago or to companies that have long track records of doing government work .
For example , about $ 3 billion of the government 's first contracts were to speed cleanup of some of the nation 's worst nuclear waste sites , scattered over a handful of states .
That has created hundreds of additional jobs at the companies that manage the sites , says Matt Rogers , a senior adviser to Energy Secretary Steven Chu , but the impact has been limited to only a few parts of the country .
Liz Oxhorn , a spokeswoman for the White House stimulus effort , said any examination of federal contracts provides " an incomplete picture " of a law that is " providing unprecedented assistance at a record pace to benefit as many Americans as possible . "
Obama said Wednesday that the stimulus had created or saved 150,000 jobs in its first 100 days .
Overall , however , the economy shed more than 1.2 million jobs in March and April , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .
In addition to the contracts it has awarded , the government has asked companies to bid on thousands of additional projects worth upward of $ 30 billion , according to Onvia , a firm that tracks government purchasing .
Even so , the first contracts have amounted to only about $ 7.42 per person on average in the eight states with unemployment rates higher than 10 % last month .
By comparison , government records show it has awarded about $ 26 worth of contracts per person in North Dakota , whose unemployment rate is the nation 's lowest .

( LifeWire ) -- Rachel
Hunt has encountered it all : automated operators , interminable phone trees , customer service representatives who've " never heard of " widely advertised promotions .
Bad or no customer service can drive consumers crazy .
But the public relations account director from Chevy Chase , Maryland , says her most memorable moment was when a customer service rep informed her that her house was n't there .
" My husband and I were trying to get service from a cable TV provider and were told by a representative that our address did n't exist , " she says .
" They said they could n't help us or sign us up for service , even though our neighbors across the street had cable .
It probably took eight hours to get it all straightened out . "
The downfall of service
Thanks to outsourcing , labyrinthine answering systems and unresponsive corporations , many have come to dread what 's paradoxically known as " customer care . "
" People get lost in that maze of ' press 1 for this and press 2 for that , ' " says Randi Busse , president of Workforce Development Group Inc. , a customer service training center in Long Island , New York .
" Years ago , the customer was the most important thing , but today , businesses large and small are indifferent . "
Real service is such a rarity that some frustrated folks are turning into what BusinessWeek calls " consumer vigilantes . "
The vigilantes blog about battles with customer service departments ; they use the Web to track down high - ranking employees ' e-mails and direct lines .
Surfing for satisfaction
After weeks of bad TV reception ( and repeated requests for help ) following Hurricane Ike , Sarah Shah , an image coach from Houston , found a Comcast executive on Twitter , a social networking site .
" I tweeted him and asked if he could help and he tweeted right back and said , ' Here 's my e-mail , shoot me your account number , ' " says Shah .
" By the end of the day , five trucks , three supervisors and two technicians were at my house and we had the best cable reception we 've ever had .
All it took was finding a person high enough on the food chain to fix the problem . "
Michelle Gotay , a motivational speaker from Watertown , Connecticut , went up the corporate ladder in a creative way after unsuccessful calls to an automaker about her problematic car .
Gotay dressed up as a " nutty character " and vented her frustrations in a YouTube video she forwarded to the executive offices of Nissan North America .
" My friends thought I was nuts and that no one would ever see it or respond .
But 16 hours after I e-mailed them the link , I heard back from the company .
They loved the video and helped me resolve my car issues . "
The new word of mouth
Web - based customer empowerment is rapidly changing customer service , says Amy Muller , co-founder and chief community officer for GetSatisfaction.com , an online clearinghouse for complaints and responses .
" With blogs and social networks and the way information can be posted so freely , word of mouth is incredibly powerful , " says Muller .
" It 's more and more difficult for companies to survive without learning to embrace this new era .
They do n't have a choice but to start to provide better customer service , especially in hard economic times . "
Muller says nearly 300,000 registered users interact on GetSatisfaction.com with nearly 18,500 companies -- from big guns like AT&T , Ford and Verizon to startups like Foxmarks and Widgetbox .
Customers post questions or complaints which company reps ( or other customers ) try to resolve .
" We 've had situations where a customer will come in furious and the company will step in and do a stellar response and then the customer will go away happy , " says Muller .
" And it all happens in a public way .
We believe in the good , the bad and the ugly all being out there . "
The dark side
The ugly stuff is not always on the company 's part , says Vernon Effenberger , 31 , a PR account executive from Austin , Texas .
" I worked for an energy company for 2 ½ years and I once got a call from a woman who did n't have power at her restaurant , " he says .
" The problem was on her end -- she had n't had all the inspections she needed -- but she was livid .
She said , ' If I ever see you , I will kill you . '
I 'd had people yell at me before , but I 'd never had a death threat . "
Robin Taylor , 42 , a Nashville , Tennessee , customer care rep , says customers scream , cuss and even cry .
But the calls that really get on her nerves are the ones from " the freaks . "
" There 's one guy who calls and just says ' You f--ing b--- ch ' in this weird low tone and then hangs up .
He 's called a couple of times , " she says .
" And then there 's another guy who calls in regularly and says he wants to discuss his bill , but then says ' I want you to tell me to write with a pink pen .
And I want you to say , ' Do it now ! ' "
The golden touch
Most people who contact customer service sincerely need help , and companies would do well to listen to them , says Busse , who 's worked in the industry for 15 years .
" Customer service is going to be the new differentiator , " she says .
" Price is n't the deciding factor anymore -- it 's service . "
That 's certainly what worked for Rachel Hunt , who says her most recent customer service experience , in which an L.L .
Bean rep took 10 minutes to help her track a pair of hard - to - find clogs for her husband , was " positively amazing . "
" I 'd normally think someone would just want to take the order and get off the phone , but he was really cooperative and patient and very friendly , " she says .
" I felt like I should send the company a thank - you note .
It definitely left me with a positive feeling . "

ALBANY , N.Y . ( AP ) -- New York legislative officials say Gov. David Paterson is expected to introduce legislation to legalize gay marriage .
Two officials say he will introduce the legislation Thursday .
They spoke on condition of anonymity because there 's been no formal announcement .
The proposal would revive a bill that died in 2007 and still faces strong opposition despite a new Democratic majority in the state Senate .
Paterson , a Democrat , says in radio interviews that he believes it will ultimately become law and that it should be debated publicly .
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Malcolm Smith says he does n't believe there are enough votes in the chamber to pass the bill .

Many medical treatments are not available in Gaza
The number of Palestinians forced to provide information before being let out of Gaza for medical treatment is rising , an Israeli group has reported .
In the first three months of 2009 more than 400 patients were interrogated , Physicians for Human Rights says .
They say Israeli security services are involved in a systematic attempt to recruit Palestinians as collaborators .
Israeli officials say they are carrying out security checks to ensure those entering Israel do not commit attacks .
Spokesman Mark Regev told the AFP news agency that 13,000 Palestinians are treated in Israel each year .
However , Physicians for Human Rights says Israel also interrogated children , detained patients for undisclosed periods of time , and intimidated them during interrogations .
Those who did not co-operate were refused permission to leave Gaza for treatment , the group says .
Complicates process Between January 2008 and March 2009 at least 438 patients were summoned for interrogations at Erez Crossing , the main crossing point for people between Israel and Gaza , the group says .
KEY STORIES
Gaza feud puts patients at risk Israel 's dilemma over sick Gazans
The data collected by the group has been presented to the Geneva - based UN Committee Against Torture .
" The data points to an increase in the ratio of the number of interrogations to the total number of applications submitted to the authorities at Erez Crossing , " the organisation says .
The process of referring Palestinians in Gaza for medical treatment in Israel , or further afield , is a complicated one .
It was administered by the Palestinian Authority even after Fatah , the faction led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , was ousted from Gaza in June 2007 .
Earlier this year the World Health Organisation warned that the feud between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority was putting at risk the lives of critically - ill Gazans .
This followed the takeover by Hamas officials of the office that ran the referrals process in Gaza .
Because Israel refuses to deal with Hamas , which it considers a terrorist group , this effectively closed down the referrals process .
Hamas officials have long maintained that the process is inefficient and corrupt .

There 's a reason that James Franco is squinting in almost every picture you see ( and I see many ) .
Seth Rogen is stoned in every movie that you see , so he's on this list as a representative for Team Apatow ( which is its own particular subset of stoner ) .
2. Paris Hilton Paris has been downgraded enough that these photos make me kind of nostalgic , like a trip back to a sunny time in the mid-2000s when banks had money and Sidekicks were new and everyone listened to the Postal Service .
I imagine Paris still smokes a lot now , though .

As we reported on March 22 when Jay Rockefeller was peddling nonsense about a pimple - faced kid in Latvia taking down the power grid in America with a laptop computer , the current wave of fear - mongering about cyber terrorism is just that — unsubstantiated fear - mongering .
Critical networks are largely protected and “ nightmarish tales of their vulnerability tend to be largely apocryphal , ” according to Gabriel Weimann , author of Terror on the Internet .
“ Psychological , political , and economic forces have combined to promote the fear of cyberterrorism . ”
Senator Rockefeller declares we ’d be better off if the internet was never invented .
Indeed , there are political forces are behind Senate bills No. 773 and 778 , introduced by Sen.
Jay Rockefeller , who declared last month that we would all be better off if the internet was never invented .
Rockefeller meant the government would be better off if the internet was never invented .
If the internet was never invented , the corporate media would dominate news and information and alternative media restricted to print would have a far more difficult time counter balancing government propaganda .
Government and the elite behind it are sincerely worried about the fact increasing numbers of people get their news from alternative media sources on the internet and corporate media newspapers are falling like dominoes .
“ If we fail to take swift action , we , regrettably , risk a cyber - Katrina , ” said fear - monger Sen. Olympia Snowe , R - Maine , who is co-sponsoring the bill .
“ We must protect our critical infrastructure at all costs – from our water to our electricity , to banking , traffic lights and electronic health records – the list goes on , ” added Rockefeller .
Rockefeller ’s bills introduced in the Senate — known as the Cybersecurity Act of 2009 — would create yet another government bureaucracy , the Office of the National Cybersecurity Advisor .
It would report directly to Obama .
Rockefeller ’s legislation would grant “ the Secretary of Commerce access to all privately owned information networks deemed to be critical to the nation ’s infrastructure “ without regard to any provision of law , regulation , rule or policy restricting such access ” ( see a working draft of the legislation here ) .
In other words , Obama would have a Cyber Czar in the Commerce Department and the power to shut down the internet .
[ efoods ]
The cybersecurity fraud now in motion will grant the Department of Commerce oversight of “ critical ” networks , such as banking records , would grant the government access to potentially incriminating information obtained without cause or warrant , a violation of the Constitution ’s prohibition against unlawful search and seizure , Jennifer Granick , civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , told Mother Jones .
“ The whole thing smells bad to me , ” writes Larry Seltzer for eWeek .
“ I do n’t like the chances of the government improving this situation by taking it over generally , and I definitely do n’t like the idea of politicizing this authority by putting it in the direct control of the president . ”
Obama ’s internet agenda is an extension of his effort to impose government control over the private sector .
Republicans call this socialism .
In a way it is socialism , but not the kind you were told about in high school — it is a socialism devised by the Trilateralists and Council on Foreign Relations .
It is a system of control that will be imposed by the bankers and has nothing to do equality for all individuals or a fair or egalitarian method of compensation for workers .
Banker socialism is about serfdom and poverty .
It should be obvious what is going on here .
Not if but when the next false flag attack occurs here in America , the elite will turn off the internet in order to control the flow of information .
They will tell us they were forced to do this in order to deny terrorists in caves or driving around with Ron Paul bumper stickers on their cars the ability to sabotage the power grid and banks .
Senate bills No. 773 and 778 are about controlling information .
The bills have nothing to do with mischievous kids with laptops in Latvia .

Feb. 25 , 2009 -- Scientists may have figured out why hair turns gray , and their finding may open the door to new anti-graying strategies .
New research shows that hair turns gray as a result of a chemical chain reaction that causes hair to bleach itself from the inside out .
The process starts when there is a dip in levels of an enzyme called catalase .
That catalase shortfall means that the hydrogen peroxide that naturally occurs in hair can't be broken down .
So hydrogen peroxide builds up in the hair , and because other enzymes that would repair hydrogen peroxide 's damage are also in short supply , the hair goes gray .
Putting the brakes on that chemical chain reaction " could have great implications in the hair graying scenario in humans , " write the researchers , who included Karin Schallreuter , a professor clinical and experimental dermatology at England 's University of Bradford .
The study appears online in The FASEB Journal ; the FASEB is the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A public furor over big bonuses paid by firms bailed out with U.S. taxpayer money is fueling resistance to President Barack Obama ’s ambitious plans to extend government intervention in the U.S. private sector .

Republican opponents say his commitment of huge sums to try to revive the ailing economy is driven by a philosophical belief in greater government intrusion in many areas , from healthcare to education , dubbing it socialism .
Obama is pursuing these policies just 13 years after President Bill Clinton , a fellow Democrat , disarmed Republican opponents by declaring : “ The era of big government is over . ”
As the enormous cost of the Obama ’s effort to stimulate the economy grows , many are weighing just how far government should be extending its powers .
“ We ’re in the midst of a huge political battle , which is being obscured behind a financial crisis , ” said Bruce Kogut , professor of ethics and corporate governance at Columbia University .
“ If the financial crisis was n’t here we ’d be having this battle anyway . ”
“ The question I think we need to figure out as a country is what is the proper role of government ? ” said David Moss , professor of economic history at Harvard Business School .
Regulation of the financial system to contain risk has not been adequate or effective , he said .
“ So on the financial front we want to try to find a Goldilocks scenario of not too much and not too little . ”
Obama administration officials have had to fend off accusations they were too easy on the financial industry , after the insurance giant AIG paid out millions of dollars in bonuses after accepting billions of dollars in taxpayer funds .
CHARGES OF SOCIALISM
Airing charges of socialism , opponents have sought to turn public opinion against Obama ’s big spending policies , including a record $ 3.55 trillion budget proposed for next year and a $ 787 billion economic stimulus package .
In the United States calling someone a socialist is often an insult , striking at the heart of American individualism and raising the fear of government fingers in everyone ’s business .
The word ’s powerful negative connotation prompted Obama to call The New York Times back after an interview to belatedly respond to a question on whether he was a socialist .
“ It was hard for me to believe that you were entirely serious about that socialist question , ” Obama said , defending his policies as consistent with free - market principles .
“ The fact that we ’ve had to take these extraordinary measures and intervene is not an indication of my ideological preference , but an indication of the degree to which lax regulation and extravagant risk - taking has precipitated a crisis , ” he said .
Kogut said the socialist tag was misleading .
“ I think it ’s a weapon , I do n’t think it ’s honest , ” he said .
But analysts say the United States could learn from experiences in countries like France , Germany , and Sweden where governments have larger roles in business and social policy .
Along the political spectrum there are experts who believe that nationalization of failing U.S. banks -- a prospect that has alarmed some conservatives -- should be seriously considered .
But Obama has so far avoided that step .
NO “ RADICAL ” MOVES
“ President Obama , is he failing to move in this direction fully because he feels himself to be vulnerable on this socialist terminology which is being used ? ”
Kogut said .
Sweden in the 1990s nationalized two banks , put their bad assets aside , and sold them back to the private sector at a small profit , he said .
Both France and Germany provide more government aid for healthcare and the jobless than the United States .
Slinging the socialist term at Obama is more a symptom of the political fight in Washington over how to cope with the financial crisis and where to direct funds .
“ It ’s not part of the American tradition , and yes socialism by and large remains a dirty word here , even the left shies clear of it , ” said Benn Steil , director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations .
Obama came to power on a wave of popular support with a strong record as a social liberal in the U.S. Senate .
One of his goals is to redistribute some of the country ’s wealth , which appeals to those who say they want action to counter a growing gap between the rich and poor .
Moss said Obama had so far not made any “ radical moves ” given the extent of the crisis .
“ I think he ’s trying to reframe the role of government , ” Moss said .
“ There ’s actually quite a general consensus that we veered too far in one direction , that is reluctance to use government authority when needed . ”
I know it is something really hard to tell , but my favourite is the 9th !
Yeah , ladies and gentleman ...

Well , we never forget our first Doctor .
He is sweet , gentle , someone who could really feel everything he touched .

If you have to ask yourself ( or anyone else ) the question “ am I ready to GM a roleplaying game ” the answer is most likely no .
That said , if you want to run a game , do it anyway .
Running a game is the best way to learn how to run a game , and even how to play it .
Of course , you ’ll want to make sure your players will be patient with you while you learn the ropes of running .
In fact , it ’s probably best if you run for beginners and friends , as they ’re less likely to care if you mess something up .
Just keep things interesting and it ’ll be fine .
So now it ’s story time .
The first game I ever ran was straight out of the 3.0 Dungeons and Dragons Player ’s Handbook .
I ’d previously played a couple of short - lived 2nd edition campaigns , and a lot of Baldur ’s Gate II .
I had a Monster Manual , which I did n’t really use , and no Dungeon Master ’s Guide .
In short , it was a train wreck waiting to happen .
And it was a lot of fun .
I called up five friends of mine who I thought would be interested .
One was n’t , but we picked up another friend who decided he ’d give it a go .
We started everyone out at level one .
I added some house rules for spellcasters .
Spellcasters always get houseruled by GMs I ’ve noticed .
My particular brand of house rule was all spellcasters cast spells spontaneously , because it just makes more sense that way .
I came from a video game background after all .
It was many years before I understood game balance .
I began the game with Fizban of Dragonlance fame beating a hasty retreat from Ifrit , as portrayed in Final Fantasy VII .
From there , crazy awesome ensued , including a session of arena party battles in which the PC ’s squared off against a party of Megaman characters , the party from Super Mario RPG , and a few other games as well .
I even worked their powers into the game rules .
Mario could use fly via a feather , or the spell fireball via a fire flower for instance .
When he got hit , powers were gone .
There was also an NPC created by the players , more or less .
One suggested finding a black market dealer for poisons to use in combat .
I allowed this , because it would be amusing .
Another player , cracking jokes , set the mood for this dealer as a jovial , easygoing man .
And he was a rich traveler , with many wares to sell .
In fact , the players were so friendly and such good customers that he traveled with them for awhile , supplying them as needed and becoming one of a few prominent NPCs in the game , despite having no name .
They also did the standard explore ancient ruins deal , the solving of riddles , saving kingdoms , a full scale war , battling dragons and gods .
All the stuff you expect to do in D&D .
I pulled almost everything from some video game I ’d played or book I read , and put it all into a fanfic style loose continuity .
And one of the PCs was a monk who used a magical spade as a thrown weapon with a 100 ft. range and that dealt 1d8+1 damage .
I certainly would n’t call it one of my best games , but for my first , it was pretty good .
It held everyone ’s interest for a year or two , and everyone legitimately made it to level 15 or so .
Remember earlier how I mentioned house rules and train wrecks ?
Well , there was another house rule .
Everyone in the party will have the same amount of experience points .
Always .
No XP penalty for being resurrected or raised , spells with an XP component , or item creation .
Not that anyone used item creation anyway , because no DMG .
And when one person gains XP , everyone gains XP .
Now comes the the train wreck .
There was one person who was willing to take insane risks .
And we had recently gotten our hands on a 3.0 Dungeon Masters Guide .
And , would n’t you know it , the Deck of Many Things looked really cool .
I immediately made it part of the next treasure horde .
I slightly misread how the deck worked , and did n’t make the player state the number of cards he would draw ahead of time .
And when all was said and done , the player had loads of shiny gems and gold , along with about 200,000 more XP .
And , by extension , the rest of the party had 200,000 more XP due to my house rule .
And they jumped from level 15 to level 25 .
It was at this point we chose to do a big concluding session in which the PCs teamed up with the gods to do battle with an evil overgod to save the world .
We all had fun with it , despite it being far from a standard campaign , and more than a little thrown together .
Thinking about it , I ’d kind of like to run another like it … minus the Deck of Many Things .
Of course , I learned a lot from this campaign :
- Never , ever use the Deck of Many Things in a game .
Just do n’t .
- Not providing lots of magical loot may earn you titles such as “ Evil GM . ”
Having a DMG goes a long way towards fixing this , though I still have a hard time sticking with wealth by level .
- Random campaigns can be very fun when you ’re looking for a lighthearted campaign .
And anything goes in random campaigns .
- The rules of D&D . Well , a lot of them anyway .
I read the Players Handbook before we started , but I learned the rules by playing the game .
There were still some I missed too .
- And way too much other stuff to call to mind at the moment .
So , with that story , I leave you with the thought that , without knowing all the rules , or even having access to all the rules , you can still have a game everyone enjoys as long as it ’s run in a way the group will like .
So if you ’re itching to run a game , get some ( patient ) friends together and give it a shot .
And listen to your players ’ input on how to make the game better too .
It may not always be better , but oftentimes they ’ll have some good ideas .
We ’ve all heard the horror stories about gross , nasty things found in the food at some of the most popular fast food joints in the world – fried mice , hair , severed finger in chili , condoms , chemicals , and many more – some are actually myths , but many of them are 100 % true !
I figured I ’d take advantage of these disgusting tales of food filth , and introduce my new “ Grossed Out Food Diet ” !
Ok …So , it ’s not a real diet , but at least it may help to persuade you from eating these unhealthy fast food choices next time you get a craving .
These are a list of food horror stories that have either been verified to be true , or at least had a lawsuit filed against the restaurant by the victim , so prepare to be grossed out !
Next time you get a craving for some McDonalds , KFC , Taco Bell , or Burger King , just remember this post and proceed with caution !
1 . In 1995 a man in Alabama was dining at McDonalds when he found a condom in his burger .
No word on whether it was a used condom or not , but does it really matter ?!?
2 . An Ohio man found skin , apparently from part of a thumb , in his sandwich at Arbys back in 2004 .
3 . In 2003 a man was enjoying a three - piece combo from Popeye ’s Chicken , and as he took a bite out of his chicken , he noticed that a mouse had apparently lodged itself between the skin and the meat of the chicken .
This restaurant had been cited for rodent infestations in the past – why was n’t this place shutdown !
4. Clam chowder gone bad !
A woman eating a bowl of clam chowder in 2002 at a McCormick and Smicks ’s seafood restaurant in Southern California found a condom in her chowder , which she originally mistook for calamari , but soon after noticed that it was something else rubbery .
She sued the restaurant and won an undisclosed settlement amount .
5. Employees at an Oregon Jack in the Box decided to “ amuse themselves ” one day by adding a variety of disgusting things to customers ’ burgers , including acid , soap , phlegm , hair , and staples .
6 . In 2000 a woman purchased a box of chicken wings at a local McDonalds only to find that one of the chicken pieces was actually a chicken ’s head !
FYI : Deep fried chicken head is not on the McDonalds menu .
7 . A firefighter in Virginia Beach found two used bandages in his quarter pounder from McDonalds .
I imagine that this happens more often than most people think .
8 . A man in Tennessee allegedly bit down on a hypodermic needle while eating a Big Mac from McDonalds ( this one is not confirmed to be true , but it ’s scary to think about nonetheless ) .
9 . A 50 - year - old man in Houston contracted a disease called cysticercosis caused by employees using poor hygiene , such as not washing their hands after going to the bathroom , at a local restaurant .
His food was contaminated with tapeworm eggs which nearly killed him .
The tapeworm larvae spread to his brain and caused him to pass out and not wake up for eight days .
Apparently , he was the fourth patient treated for the disease in that area within the past few months back in 2007 .
10 . Check out this disgusting Burger King in Florida that just leaves their hamburger buns outside for the pigeons to eat !
11 . A study on fast food restaurant cleanliness conducted in Durban , South Africa ( a popular tourist town ) concluded that 20,000 food outlets , including popular fast food joints , in the area inspected by the City Health Department failed to meet minimum health requirements .
Health officials found hair , insects , cigarettes , weevils and fingernails in the food at these places .
Senior official at the City Health Department , Umar Singh , said “ We have found foreign objects coming into contact with food , including insects , weevils and cockroaches .
We have also found unsanitary conditions , the smoking of tobacco products , defective fume - extraction units and a lack of protective clothing for the staff . ”
12 . A 2009 video shows an employee at Dominos doing some very disgusting things to a couple of sub sandwiches .
Needless to say , the employee was immediately fired after the big-wigs at Domino ’s saw the video on the Internet .

It seems like every year there is a new diet craze sweeping the nation , with unquestioned stories of weight loss and lives changed .
The medical professionals behind these amazing diets are always trained , and sometimes in different , and unorthodox medicines .
Studying holistic medicine , or traditional medicine like with an online MPH , gives people the knowledge and wisdom needed to properly identify dieting opportunities
God , it 's been years since this concept surfaced .
BumpTop , the 3D , physics - enabled , extremely literal take on a desktop manager is finally available for download .
It looks ... well , it looks as interesting as it ever did .

A free version is available for us to play around with , while the Pro version is $ 30 .
But both are lush , and the 3D desktop environments are eye - popping .
One thing that the early demos may not have gotten across , though , is that BumpTop does n't actually change that much about your computing experience .
It 's not an OS by any means , nor is it even a full shell conversion .
No , it 's really just a new desktop with some widget - like functionality .
You can throw around your icons , which is fun , but beyond that you 're limited to whatever extensions BumpTop supports :
For example , flicking photos into a Facebook icon will upload them to the site , but this kind of behavior is n't systemwide — it 's just the function of a specific widget .

CNET says the app is well suited to touchscreens , but I suspect it 'll really come into its own when a multitouch version is released later this year to coincide with Windows 7 .
For now , though , it 's a fun toy .

Margaret , I am here to tell you that Dick Cheney is a bitch – a big one too .
I mean I thought that Sarah Palin was a bitch , but even she can’t hold a candle to this guy .
Have you been listening to him recently ?
I would say that it takes some pretty big balls to go on national television again and again to justify torture , but Dick was too much of a wimp to serve his country in the military so I ’m pretty sure there ain’t much hanging between his legs .
But being a bitch myself , I can assure you that you do n’t need balls to be a bitch .
You just need to not give a damn what other people think of you … and Dick does n’t even care what his family and friends think about him much less the rest of us .
I have to admit that I am more than a little perplexed by Dick ’s rise to power .
He flunked out of Yale – something even George W. Bush did n’t do – and has at least two DWI ’s on his record – one more than Georgie Boy .
So basically from 2001 to 2009 we had two dry - drunk idiots running the country .
But only one of them has had the good sense to shut the hell up since leaving office .
Cheney came into politics as part of the Nixon administration and ended his politcal career with George W. Bush .
Along the way he managed to skip the Reagan years opting instead to represent the least populous state in the Union .
In fact , of the past five Republican presidents since Cheney got into politics , the only one that Dick did n’t work for was Ronald Reagan .
Talk about a guy who ca n’t pick a winning horse .
He works for Nixon , Ford , skips Reagan , and then comes back for the two Bushes .
Four failed Presidencies and this guy still thinks his shit does n’t stink .
Of course this is the guy who headed up the vice presidential search for George W. Bush only to decide to pick himself as the candidate .
I ’d say he ’s mastered the art of not smelling his own shit .
During his tenure as Secretary of Defense he actively worked to reduce the size of our military .
And when asked about the FIVE deferments that kept him from serving in the military he responded by saying , “ I had other priorities in the sixties than military service . ”
And yet today he wants us to listen to him pontificate on how best to protect our nation ?
He shot his friend in the face for goodness sakes .
Too bad for his hunting buddies that he got those deferments because the military might have helped him with his aim .
And let ’s not forget about his co-workers and family members .
When someone manges to pull Scooter Libby out from under the bus , be sure to ask him what he thinks about his former boss .
And then there ’s his daughter , the lesbian .
His own daughter is in a same sex relationship but Dick wo n’t stand up against his party ’s stance on gay marriage .
So in addition to shooting his friends in the face and pushing employees under the bus , he also eats his young .
Now that , my friend , is one hell of a big bitch .
Hey Dick .
Stick a cork in it you good for nothing jackass .
You and George were elected with the narrowest of margins and you never looked back .
Eight years later an overwhelming majority put Obama in office and as far as I am concerned , he has the green - light to put this country back on track .
If you do n’t like it , you can kiss my ass , because if I had to choose between liberating Iraq from Saddam or liberating us from you , there would be one more Hussein in the world and one less Cheney .
Given the opportunity , I would have stuffed you down that hole in the ground with Saddam and sealed the door shut .
I mean it .
Really .
Mercury was once seen as a cold , dead little world , spinning around the sun unchanged for the past 4 billion years .
No longer : Observations from the Messenger spacecraft say it ’s anything but .
NASA 's orbiter is sending back evidence of massive volcanism , strange impact craters and magnetic tornadoes that funnel plasma directly from the sun to the planet 's surface .
“ It ’s definitely not this picture of an ancient world where everything that happened to it happened billions of years ago and nothing happened since then , ” said Tom Watters of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , DC .
“ We ’re seeing a very dynamic planet that has a lot going on today . ”
A slew of papers in Science report what Messenger ( MErcury Surface , Space ENvironment , GEochemistry and Ranging ) saw on its Oct. 6 flyby of the small rocky planet .
The spacecraft ( whose admittedly contrived name was chosen because Mercury was the messenger to the gods in Roman mythology ) launched in 2004 , and will fly by Mercury a total of three times before settling into orbit in 2011 .
Combined with mapping by Mariner 10in the ' 70s , we now know what 90 percent of the surface looks like .
And it looks weird .
Superficially , Mercury looks a lot like the moon : small , grayish - brown and pockmarked with craters .
Some scientists assumed that Mercury ’s surface formed the same way the moon ’s did , with lighter rocks rising to the surface of a magma ocean and congealing into a brittle crust early on .
But the new observations reveal that 40 percent of the surface was formed by volcanoes .
“ Up until before Messenger ’s arrival , we were n’t even sure that volcanism existed on Mercury , ” said Brett Denevi of Arizona State University , lead author on a paper describing the evolution of Mercury ’s crust .
“ Now we ’re seeing it ’s very widespread across the surface . ”
Most were probably effusive volcanoes , in which molten muck bubbles up from cracks in the surface and spreads , filling in crater basins and smoothing the landscape .
But a few were explosive volcanoes , what Denevi described as “ big fire fountains of magma ” whose ejected material turned to glass before hitting the ground .
Messenger also spotted an impact basin that is “ unlike anything I have ever seen anywhere in the solar system , ” said Watters , the lead author on a paper focusing on this funny feature .
The basin , dubbed Rembrandt , is one of the biggest and youngest craters on Mercury .
If it were on Earth , its edges would extend from Boston to Washington , D.C. But for Rembrandt , size does n’t matter .
It ’s what ’s inside that counts .
Most impact basins — craters more than 186 miles in diameter — are formed by impacts so forceful that they crack the planet 's crust all the way to a liquid or molten layer underneath .
The molten rock oozes into the basin and fills it up .
The basin sags under the weight of all this extra material , and deforms the ground around it .
The interior of the basin crinkles up into ridges , and the edges stretch into troughs .
Rembrandt is only partially filled with volcanic material .
Even stranger is its pattern of ridges and troughs , which lie side by side in a radial pattern from the center , rather than being confined to either the rim or the middle .
" That pattern is like nothing we ’ve ever seen before , " Watters said .
" We ’re going to have to go back and rethink the way that we generate these stresses in these basins . "
Observations from Messenger might help solve a few mysteries , in addition to creating new ones .
Scientists wondered if Mercury had a stable magnetic fieldfueled by a liquid core like Earth , or a ghostly magnetic field left over from a once - liquid core that ’s since frozen , like Mars .
The Messenger flyby clinched it in favor of an active magnetic field — and though it 's weak , it ’s really active .
Earth has an atmosphere and a strong magnetic field to protect it from the constant stream of ions ejected from the sun at supersonic speeds known as the solar wind .
Mercury is not so lucky .
Its magnetic field is just 1 percent the strength of Earth's , and it has no atmosphere to speak of .
What atmosphere it has is tenuous and extremely variable , made up mostly of sodium one day and mostly calcium the next .
This leaves its surface vulnerable to being ravaged by the solar wind at the best of times .
Messenger flew by at a particularly bad moment , and ran right through a magnetic tornado .
Magnetic tornadoes form when the magnetic field in the solar wind links up to the field generated by a planet , a process called magnetic reconnection .
Bundles of magnetic field lines connect the surface of the planet directly to the surface of the sun , and as the solar wind pushes them away from the sun , they twist and whirl like cyclones .
On Earth , these cyclones ( technically called " flux transfer events " ) dance on the ionosphere , creating the Northern Lights and messing up GPS systems .
On Mercury , though , the twisters were 10 times as strong as any magnetic cyclones observed on Earth .
With so little atmosphere to interfere , Mercury 's magnetic tornadoes are great spinning chutes that ionized gas can slide down .
" They act as magnetic channels or open windows that allow solar wind plasma from the sun , very fast and very hot , to come right down those field lines and impacts the surface , " said Jim Slavin of NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center .
When the gas hits the surface , it knocks off neutrally - charged atoms and sends them on a loop high into the sky .
Slavin thinks that could explain Mercury 's inconsistent atmosphere .
" People had hypothesized that it was because of day - to - day changes in the solar wind , and how much is able to reach the surface and sputter off neutral atoms , " he said .
" We may have discovered the answer to that longstanding question , why is the atmosphere so variable : Because reconnection , when it occurs , is just so intense . "

Cellulosic Scale - Up
DOE - backed ethanol producers encounter difficulties converting waste streams to commercially viable fuel
Interactive Cellulosic Ethanol Six DOE - backed projects show mixed results Interactive Map by Monica Gilbert and Tchad Blair / C&EN Launch Interactive Map * Macromedia Flash Player 8 is required to view video .
IN FEBRUARY 2007 , the Department of Energy selected six cellulosic ethanol projects to receive up to $ 385 million in grants .
Authorized by the Energy Policy
Act of 2005 , the funding was part of an effort by the Bush Administration to end the U.S.'s " addiction to oil " and enhance the nation 's energy security .
The money was intended to further two of President George W. Bush 's goals : to make ethanol out of nonfood biomass , including billions of pounds of agricultural waste , at a cost competitive with gasoline by 2012 and to increase the use of renewable and alternative fuels to 35 billion gal per year by 2017 .
In all , more than $ 1.2 billion was to be invested in the six biorefineries .
Two years later , none of the projects has been built , although one is under construction .
Two were canceled right out of the gate .
Hitches in the plans have turned up in numerous places .
From securing feedstock to financing construction to finding a ready market , the experiences of the awardees illustrate that the nascent cellulosic ethanol industry faces several daunting hurdles .
The chosen projects represent technologies including enzyme hydrolysis , acid hydrolysis , and gasification .
They were to be located in the Midwest , Southeast , and West and were planning to use feedstocks ranging from corncobs to wood chips .
The companies advancing the projects had little in common other than having a plan to turn cellulosic waste into ethanol .
The designers of the DOE program envisioned that the grant money would be invested over four years , with the companies contributing 60 % of the plant costs .
When fully operational , the six facilities were expected to produce more than 130 million gal of cellulosic ethanol per year .
Poet WASTE NOT Ethanol maker
Poet wants local corn growers to gather their cobs to use as feedstock for the company 's new plant .
DOE managers say it is too early to judge whether any of the plants will make cost - competitive ethanol from cellulose .
But it is not too early to start learning from the first attempts , they say .
And challenges relating to scaling up the ethanol processes , rather than the particulars of any one technology , are keeping costs higher than the market will now accommodate .
In the long run , the agency would like to see cellulosic ethanol projects become attractive to private investors .
" We 're finding nuances to our integrated approach and scale - up issues that add a bit to the cost and make it more challenging , " acknowledges Larry Russo , technology manager of DOE 's integrated biorefinery program .
Project leaders at the companies give DOE high marks for being involved partners in getting their facilities ready to produce commercial quantities of ethanol .
But they have serious concerns about other aspects of federal policy that influence the demand for their product .
For example , the gasoline sold in filling stations can contain no more than 10 % ethanol .
The so - called blend wall will be in place until the Environmental Protection Agency has determined that higher blends will not increase tailpipe emissions .
" If there is not a blend - wall increase , we are not quite sure where the path will be for cellulosic ethanol , " observes Jim Sturdevant , project officer at Poet , one of the six companies .
One of the canceled projects was to be built by Alico , a publicly traded land management firm .
That project called for a facility in LaBelle , Fla. , that would convert yard , wood , and vegetative waste to ethanol .
But in a June 2008 press release , the company wrote that the " risks associated outweigh any reasonably anticipated benefits for Alico . "
Canadian enzyme producer Iogen had planned to build a plant in Shelley , Idaho , that would process agricultural waste such as wheat straw and corn stover .
Iogen operates the world 's only large - scale demonstration facility in which cellulosic ethanol is made from agricultural residues .
The plant , located in Ottawa , uses up to 33 tons of feedstock per day .
But according to Mandy Chepeka , director of communications , " Iogen suspended its operations in Idaho to focus our development efforts on our most advanced project , which is in Saskatchewan . "
Chepeka says the firm has not yet made a final decision to build at the Saskatchewan site .
One of the projects that is still active has hit a snag .
BlueFire Ethanol , in Irvine , Calif. , sold DOE on the idea of using a concentrated acid hydrolysis process to turn municipal cellulosic waste such as lawn clippings and tree prunings into ethanol .
But it has yet to secure a site for its facility .
BlueFire 's first planned site , the El Sobrante Landfill in Corona , Calif. , fell through when the current occupant , a waste treatment plant , did not vacate the location .
The three remaining projects appear to be moving forward .
The first large - scale production plant will be operated by Range Fuels in Soperton , Ga .
The project is the only one of the six that uses gasification technology .
The feedstock , mainly wood chips , is heated under pressure to create a synthesis gas ( mainly carbon monoxide and hydrogen ) that is then passed over a catalyst to make ethanol .
Venture - capital - backed Range has begun construction on the plant and says it will start producing ethanol in 2010 .
Privately held Poet plans to have a cellulosic ethanol facility operating by 2011 in Emmetsburg , Iowa .
Built adjacent to a larger corn ethanol plant , Poet 's plant will use enzymes to break the cellulose in corncobs into sugars and then ferment those sugars into ethanol .
If all goes according to plan , the third DOE - backed facility to come on - line will be run by Abengoa Bioenergy , a Spanish ethanol firm .
It will use enzymes to break down the cellulose in the inedible parts of the corn plant and other agricultural residues .
The company says it will start construction in Hugoton , Kan. , in 2010 and be in production at the end of 2011 .
Abengoa is also investigating thermochemical production methods .
POTHOLES ABOUND on the road to commercializing cellulosic ethanol .
Iogen 's Chepeka says her company recognizes six discrete steps .
The first task is to show successful operation of a demonstration - scale plant .
Then the company must select a commercial plant site and sign contracts for feedstocks .
The firm needs to be able to purchase the land and get government support to help share the financial risk .
Finally , the company needs to attract enough government and private investment to finance construction of the actual ethanol - producing plant .
To get the DOE grants , the six projects had to demonstrate that their technology was the strongest of the applicants , according to independent merit reviewers .
To that end , all six companies were able to show that they had operated successful pilot facilities .
It is not yet clear if any of the contenders have found a workable formula for the next stages : selecting a commercial plant site and ensuring ready supplies of feedstock at a reasonable cost .
According to Gene Petersen , project manager at DOE's Golden , Colo. , field office , even seemingly free feedstock , such as agricultural waste , is n't really free .
" The feedstock budget has gone up by a factor of 10 , " he says , because companies ' plans did not account for the full cost of the supply chain , including getting feedstock to the plant site .
Particularly problematic , Petersen says , is transporting lightweight corn stover in a cost - effective manner .
Although corn stover surrounds
Poet 's facility in Iowa , Sturdevant says it is too lightweight to be cost - effective in the firm 's process .
" Cobs are denser than the rest of the corn crop residue , " he says .
" When you have to haul biomass , it 's more economical to haul a load of cobs than a load of leaves , husks , and stalks . "
General Motors HAPPY HOUR Patrons at a Chevron station in Tucson , Ariz. , fill their E85 vehicles ' tanks with fuel that is 85 % ethanol .
Sandia National Laboratories FUTURE FUEL Sandia Labs ' researchers have studied how innovations in converting cellulose to ethanol could bring down costs .
Sturdevant is optimistic that Poet can find a way for farmers to easily gather cobs when they harvest corn .
The company is working with 12 farm machinery manufacturers , including John Deere , to make cob harvest equipment .
The farmers would pile the cobs on the edge of their fields for collection by Poet or a third party .
" No cob left behind is our motto , " Sturdevant says .
Some projects are designed to take advantage of centrally located sources of cellulosic waste , such as timber operations or landfills , by locating their operations nearby .
Range Fuels ' chief executive officer , David Aldous , points to his company 's acquisition of land near Soperton as a strategic choice .
Soperton is near two major interstates and is surrounded by timber forest .
" The key thing for us is there is an abundance of feedstock .
Our simplified wood feedstock chain is a big advantage , although ultimately , we see ourselves using other feedstocks in addition to wood chips , " Aldous says .
In an effort to gain a similar advantage , BlueFire is busy negotiating the right to build on land about halfway between Palm Springs and the Salton Sea , in Southern California , its third attempt to find a site for a plant .
John E. Cuzens , chief technology officer , explains that location is important to his firm 's plan to use municipal waste as its feedstock .
" We need to be adjacent to communities or their landfills , where this waste is generated , " he says .
" There is no room in Southern California for expanding landfills .
We have to look for land that is close to the urban center .
Then we also benefit because we do n't have to transport the ethanol far to consumers . "
Cuzens says BlueFire is anxious to settle on the site because the next step , getting the environmental permits required by the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ) , is time - consuming .
Federal law requires that all construction projects funded by the federal government comply with NEPA 's environmental impact review and permitting rules .
The NEPA process has also had a hand in slowing progress on the Abengoa plant in Kansas .
Gerson Santos , the firm 's director of R&D , estimates that it takes about 18 months to complete a NEPA review .
For most of the projects , DOE supplied 10 to 20 % of the grant up front to help the companies get through the permit and design phase .
Santos says his company will complete the process in January .
" We 've been diligently working with the Department of Energy , and they 're being very supportive through the whole process .
You have to generate quite a bit of information on the emissions and on the design .
But so far , so good , " Santos says .
According to DOE , Range Fuels did not request an advance on its grant during the NEPA process .
Moreover , the agency says the company was able to expedite the permits and receive them in about six months .
Range Fuels has also come out ahead of the other companies in obtaining financing for its facility .
Aldous says the plant will cost less than $ 200 million to build .
In addition to $ 76 million from the DOE cost - sharing grant , Range has more than $ 100 million that it raised in early 2008 from venture capital investors .
In January 2009 , Range announced that it was offered an $ 80 million loan guarantee from the Department of Agriculture .
For most of the projects , though , getting the financing needed for construction has been difficult .
Poet will receive up to $ 80 million from DOE , and it expects to get an additional $ 20 million in grants , tax credits , and tax refunds from the State of Iowa .
But the company still needs to bring in private capital for the $ 200 million plant .
" We absolutely need a federal loan guarantee , " Sturdevant says .
Poet and the three other companies with active projects have all applied for DOE loan guarantees .
Private investors will require the loan guarantees because they are in no mood to invest in a " first of its kind " facility , given the overall weakness in the economy , says Laurence Alexander , a stock analyst at Jefferies & Co. , where he covers the cellulosic ethanol industry .
Because there has never been commercial production of cellulosic ethanol , investors can't determine what approach , if any , would be successful .
" You need comparable projects up and running , and then you can debate which one is the better business model , " Alexander explains .
By depending on the loan guarantees , cellulosic ethanol companies will have to do more than promise to make competitively priced ethanol .
DOE 's Petersen points out that the renewable energy loan guarantee program places a high priority on projects that significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases compared with nonrenewable sources .
This differs from the 2007 DOE grant program , which stressed commercial production of domestic fuels to enhance energy security .
THE GREENHOUSE GAS savings to be realized from cellulosic ethanol are uncertain but are likely to be high compared with other sources of biofuels , according to a report by the U.K. 's Renewable Fuels Agency .
The so - called Gallagher Report estimates that cellulosic ethanol from agriculture or forestry residues would save 80 to 90 % of greenhouse gas emissions compared with fossil fuels .
Ethanol from corn has a more mixed impact , generating between 30 % more and 35 % less emissions than fossil fuels , depending on how it is grown .
Even if a cellulosic ethanol project qualifies for loan guarantees , Alexander is skeptical that loan offers will be announced before late this year or even early next year .
" In the quest for financing , you end up pushing plant construction back , which makes quite a bit of impact " on the overall value of the project , he points out .
To attract financing , Alexander says , all the major cellulosic players , regardless of technology , are aiming to produce ethanol for a price of $ 2.00 per gal .
At that price , he says , cellulosic ethanol can compete with ethanol derived from corn .
But perhaps more important to cellulosic ethanol 's near - term viability is the likely price that fuel blenders — companies that mix ethanol and gasoline for service stations — will be forced to pay for ethanol under the federal renewable fuel standard starting in 2010 .
The renewable fuel standard is part of the Energy Independence & Security Act of 2007 .
It mandates increasing the amounts of renewable transportation fuels , starting in 2008 with 9 billion gal of conventional corn ethanol .
The first year that cellulosic ethanol will be included in the standard is 2010 , when fuel blenders will be required to take in 100 million gal of cellulosic biofuels .
By 2022 , the requirement grows to 36 billion gal of renewable fuels , of which 16 billion gal must be derived from cellulose .
David Woodburn , a green technology analyst at ThinkEquity , an investment adviser , has added up all the cellulosic biofuel production planned in 2010 , including small - scale demonstration plants .
He came up with the paltry sum of 28.5 million gal , well short of the mandated 100 million gal .
The largest share , 10 million gal , will come from Range Fuels .
For 2011 , Woodburn 's most optimistic measure jumps to 246.7 million gal , just shy of the renewable fuel standard requirement of 250 million gal .
Fuel blenders will be caught in the middle of this shortfall .
To make up the gap in 2010 and 2011 , blenders that cannot get enough cellulosic biofuel will have to purchase a biofuels credit from EPA that values ethanol at around $ 2.00 per gal .
This scenario gives early movers like Range a two - year window of guaranteed price and demand , Alexander says .
THIS YEAR , low demand for fuel combined with the 11 billion - gal renewable fuels mandate means blenders need corn ethanol or credits for more than 10 % of their gasoline production .
But today 's gasoline contains a maximum of 10 % ethanol .
Woodburn points out that the renewable fuel standard and the ethanol / gasoline blend wall are two policies that have come into conflict .
Starting next year , the fuel blenders will have to take on even more ethanol .
" In 2010 and beyond , the credits will become much more valuable .
That could help push up the price of ethanol per gallon , even if we are stuck at a 10 % blend , " Woodburn says .
Ethanol makers are hoping for a near - term resolution of the blend - wall conundrum .
DOE is studying the impact of higher proportions of ethanol on emissions and wear and tear on engines .
It has published preliminary results suggesting that increasing ethanol content to 15 to 20 % would not have significant negative effects .
" When you have to haul biomass , it 's more economical to haul a load of cobs than a load of leaves , husks , and stalks . "
Another route to absorbing more ethanol in the fuel supply is to increase the number of vehicles that can run on E85 , a fuel containing 85 % ethanol .
In 2007 , according to DOE , only 1 % of automobiles in the U.S. had this flex - fuel capability .
Given the recent drop in sales of all vehicles , Woodburn observes , that small market share is not likely to change soon .
Meanwhile , the slow development timeline of cellulosic ethanol projects means that corn-derived ethanol will remain dominant for the foreseeable future .
Meaningful amounts of cellulosic ethanol — say , 2 to 3 % of gasoline consumption — wo n't be produced before 2013 , Woodburn says .
Reaching the levels of cellulosic ethanol production envisioned by the Energy Independence & Security Act will require dramatic , but not impossible , advances in both technology and policy , say researchers at Sandia National Laboratories .
They designed a computer model to study all of the components of production from the field to the fuel station .
One important guideline of the study was an assumption that cellulosic ethanol would eventually have to compete in price with regular gasoline .
The study , which was funded by General Motors , examined the full cost of producing ethanol .
It assumed an ethanol yield of 95 gal per dry ton of biomass .
Current estimates of large - scale yield are around 65 gal per dry ton , according to Sandia .
The study concluded that ethanol would be undercut by gasoline whenever gasoline is sold at the pump for $ 2.65 per gal or less .
" The basic issue is that it 's difficult for cellulosic ethanol to compete with gasoline if oil is less than $ 90 per barrel , " Sandia 's lead researcher , Todd West , says .
" The question is , ' How do you deal with times when the price of oil is less than that ? ' "
More daunting yet , the summary report says that even with efficient ethanol production , the industry will be dependent on government policies for significant scale - up through at least 2022 .
It suggests implementing a " multidecade energy policy that values stable fuel prices that are high enough to enable energy diversity in light of oil price volatility and periodic economic dislocations . "
The report also says the U.S. could pursue additional market incentives and carbon pricing to minimize investment risks .
Despite the obstacles aligned against cellulosic ethanol , ThinkEquity 's Woodburn says companies will be able to get investors for their projects .
" They are still getting funding from venture capitalists and strategic investors , although not at the high valuations of last year . "
Overall , Woodburn anticipates growth among the players in the industry .
" They are employing a lot of chemists , biologists , and engineers as they scale up the technology , " he says .
" And state legislatures are mesmerized by clean energy projects , " he notes , adding that savvy players ought to be able to attract tax and other incentives .
Range Fuels '
Aldous expects to be part of that growth , although he would like a little more clarity on policies supporting cellulosic ethanol after the next three years .
" If mandates and renewable biofuel credits end in 2012 when more plants will come on - line , I will need a strong risk - return profile or a vision that something like carbon cap - and - trade or a carbon credit will add value to our products , " he says .
Aldous points out that scaling up cellulosic ethanol has parallels to other industrial processes .
" As you look at any new technology , like industrial - scale refining or corn ethanol , the plants cost more at the inexperience part of the learning curve . "
The experience that industry will gain during the next few years will help close the price gap with fossil fuels , Aldous says .
But , he warns , " if the incentives are n't there , it will take much longer to make the advancements that will drive down costs . "

The missile strikes have been criticised by Pakistan 's political parties
At least 18 people are reported dead in a suspected US drone attack near the Afghan border in north - west Pakistan .
Two missiles fired by the drone struck the home of a local tribesman in the Kurram tribal region , officials say .
The building was being used as a Taleban recruitment office , officials told the BBC .
The US has launched many similar attacks in recent months , mostly targeting Taleban and al - Qaeda militants in Pakistan 's tribal regions .
Local administration officials told the BBC the home was being used by the organisation of Taleban leader Baitullah Mehsud .
The Pakistani government has not yet commented on the incident .
The attack took place in the Sarpul area of Kurram , about 15 km ( nine miles ) from the border with Afghanistan 's Khost province .
Serious differences " Smoke can be seen over the area where the missiles struck , " a security official told Reuters news agency .
The official said that the " Afghan Taleban were holding an important meeting there when the missiles were fired " .
The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Islamabad says the strike is the first to target the Taleban in the Kurram tribal region .
The area has been the scene of an ongoing sectarian war between Sunni Taleban militants and local Shia militias .
The strike is also the second to target Baitullah Mehsud 's organisation in as many days .
On Saturday , two missiles destroyed a house near the Afghan border reportedly being used as a meeting place by his men .
At least 28 militants , including foreign fighters , were killed in that attack .
Kurram , which is less than 100 km from the Afghan capital , Kabul , served as the most important launching pad for the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s .
Last month , suspected US missile strikes killed at least 25 militants close to the Afghan border .
More than 20 attacks have been carried out from drones on targets in north - western Pakistan in recent months .
The US and Pakistan have had serious disagreements over the Afghan border zone , with Washington unhappy at Pakistani efforts to tackle militants and Islamabad condemning the US drone attacks .
Pakistani leaders had expressed hope that the new US administration would halt the controversial air strikes , saying they fuelled public anger and complicated Pakistan 's own counter - insurgency efforts .
But the drone attacks have continued since Barack Obama was inaugurated as US president last month .

Joe gets up at 6:00 am to prepare his morning coffee .
He makes it with a machine he could not possibly have made himself .
He does not know where it was made , or how it works , and may not care .
He does not know the people that planted , cultivated , harvested , dried , roasted , packaged , freighted , warehoused , distributed , marketed , or retailed his coffee , and may not care .
The company that insures the manufacturer of the coffee machine required that it meet certain safety guidelines , as established by the private insurance - company - funded Underwriters Laboratory .
Joe has seen the UL mark , but is not really sure what it 's for or how it protects him .
He does n't clearly understand why greedy businessmen might be interested in a safe product .
All of this was made possible by libertarians who fought for and won the legal right to free trade .
He fills his pot full of good clean drinking water which he bought from Ozarka , because the local government monopoly of water supply bears the comforting designation of " accepted " and also tastes funny .
He thinks back to going to church on Sunday .
He is happy to have a community where he can participate with other like - minded people in ceremony .
This was made possible by the long struggle to disentangle church and state , and his church enjoys the absence of taxation .
He wishes other aspects of his life could be so free .
He takes his daily medication with his first swallow of coffee , and then he takes a long drag on a cigarette .
He bought his medication while on a trip to Mexico , where , thanks to less regulation and looser enforcement of IP laws , they were much cheaper .
His medications are safe to take because he bought them from a reputable dealer .
He can still afford cigarettes and can still legally purchase them , because of those who continue to fight for his rights , even if his exercise of those rights might harm him or his family .
Joe takes his morning shower reaching for his shampoo ; it is fragranced with some sort of exotic flower and there are strange chemicals in it — god knows what — and he bought it , well , because he liked the picture of the kangaroo on the bottle .
He luxuriates in his bourgeois moment in the shower , a luxury unavailable to even the most wealthy of only 200 years ago .
He is able to have many of such seemingly simple luxuries because some greedy businessmen sought enormous profits in the only way they could : satisfying consumer demand .
Joe begins his work day ; he has a good job with excellent pay , medicals benefits , retirement , paid holidays and vacation because the accumulation of capital over centuries has now brought the discounted marginal value product of a schmuck like Joe to unimaginable heights .
Joe does n't know anything about economics because he does n't have to .
He is no smarter than his forbears , and he works less .
Nonetheless , because he participates in a world - embracing division of labor where his specialized work on a growing capital base is greatly valued , he is richer .
Joe ’s employer pays these standards because if they do n't , his employer 's competitors will .
It 's noon time .
Joe does n't need to make a Bank Deposit so he can pay some bills — he uses online banking and direct deposit .
He has no idea how these systems work , or what a banking clearinghouse is , but he is able to use these services at the lowest cost practicable because banks compete for his business .
Notwithstanding the massive interventions to the business of banking , such as the creation of central banking and the Federal Reserve system and the repudiation of the gold standard , he is able to weather the government - induced business cycles and inflation by investing in mutual funds , annuities , stocks , bonds , REITs , real estate , precious metals , and other investment vehicles .
He is able to do this because of greedy entrepreneurs and libertarians who fought against usury laws .
The online banking leaves him free to take a moment to browse amazon.com for his favorite books , movies , and music .
Joe is home from work .
He plans to visit his father this evening at his farm home in the country .
He gets in his car for the drive to dad's ; his car is not among the safest in the world because he chose not to buy a Volvo .
His brother has a Volvo , but he has a gas - guzzling muscle car .
He has this choice because nationalization of the auto industry was prevented .
He arrives at his rural boyhood home .
The house did n’t have any good programming choices until DirecTV offered an array of programming and high - speed Internet , too .
His dad uses a VCR , which only became affordable to him after lots of rich people bought the early , expensive versions and the manufacturers improved the designs and cut costs .
In fact , his dad has a cell phone , TiVo , refrigerator , microwave oven , and a CD player — all of which became affordable to him because they were first the toys of the super - rich , and the crackpot schemes financed by the wealthy entrepreneurs willing and able to risk their money in such endeavors .
He is happy to see his dad who is now retired .
His dad lives on a reverse mortgage — a recent market innovation .
After his visit with dad he gets back in his car for the ride home .
He turns on a radio talk show .
The host keeps saying that libertarians are kooks and anarchists and thank God for continual market intervention and government protection .
Government intervention and taxation improves and will continue to improve the standards of living of Americans .
( He does n’t tell Joe that his beloved Democrats / Republicans have fought to destroy every protection and benefit Joe enjoys throughout his day . )
Joe agrees , and puts his support behind protectionism , taxation , monopolies , interventionism , and war : these are obviously the things upon which civilization is built .
Notes
On the title , libertarians oppose both Republican and Democratic ideologies , whom they group as " statists . "
On the term , see Mises ( here called étatism ) .

Researchers say such treatment pathologises homosexuality Therapists are still offering treatments for homosexuality despite there being no evidence that such methods work , research suggests .
A significant minority of mental health professionals had agreed to help at least one patient " reduce " their gay or lesbian feelings when asked to do so .
The survey , published in the journal BMC Psychiatry and conducted by London researchers , involved 1,400 therapists .
Many were acting with the " best of intentions " , said the lead author .
Only 4 % said they would attempt to change a client 's sexual orientation , but when asked if they would help curb homosexual feelings some 17 % - or one in six - said they had done so .
The incidence appeared to be as prevalent in recent years as decades earlier .
The conclusions of this research are a welcome reminder that what lesbian and gay people need is equal treatment by society , not misguided treatment by a minority of health professionals
Derek Munn
Stonewall " Of course it 's incumbent on a professional to assist a client who wants help , but this should be done using evidence - based therapies - exploring their distress and helping them to adjust to their situation , " said Professor Michael King of University College London .
" We know now that efforts to change people 's sexual orientation result in very little change and can cause immense harm .
" We found it very worrying that there was a significant minority who appeared to ignore this - even if they had all the right intentions . "
' Right to treatment '
The Royal College of Psychiatrists says all homosexuals have " a right to protection from therapies that are potentially damaging , particularly those that purport to change sexual orientation " .

In the US , where there has been heated debate on the issue of " curing " homosexuality , The American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) has urged all " ethical practitioners to refrain from attempts to change individuals ' sexual orientation " .
However there are organisations which campaign both for an individual 's right to seek treatment and a professional 's right to offer it .
They point to work by Robert Spitzer , a psychiatrist who lobbied for the removal of homosexuality from APA 's list of mental illnesses but went on to suggest in a controversial 2001 study that therapy could bring about change in sexual orientation .
Researchers in the UK are launching a website to collect stories from around the world about such therapies .
They hope in this way to uncover stories from India , South America and China where little is known about the prevalence of such practices .
Derek Munn , of the gay rights campaign group Stonewall , said : " The conclusions of this research are a welcome reminder that what lesbian and gay people need is equal treatment by society , not misguided treatment by a minority of health professionals . "

It ’s an annual tradition on Busted Coverage to run our tribute to the Kentucky Derby via HST .
We believe 2008 was the first year we combined Hunter ’s brilliant work from The Kentucky Derby is Decadent and Depraved and appropriate photos from the infield at Churchill Downs .
Age is starting to show on some of these pics , but the message remains .
It ’s not about the race at all for those weirdos and drunks that show up for the party .
“ Thousands of raving , stumbling drunks , getting angrier and angrier as they lose more and more money .
By midafternoon they ’ll be guzzling mint juleps with both hands and vomitting on each other between races .
The whole place will be jammed with bodies , shoulder to shoulder .
It ’s hard to move around .
The aisles will be slick with vomit ; people falling down and grabbing at your legs to keep from being stomped .
Drunks pissing on themselves in the betting lines .
Dropping handfuls of money and fighting to stoop over and pick it up . ”
Out to the track in a cab , avoid that terrible parking in people ’s front yards , $ 25 each , toothless old men on the street with big signs : PARK HERE , flagging cars in the yard .
“ That ’s fine , boy , never mind the tulips . ”
Wild hair on his head , straight up like a clump of reeds .
Steadman wanted to see some Kentucky Colonels , but he was n’t sure what they looked like .
I told him to go back to the clubhouse men ’s rooms and look for men in white linen suits vomitting in the urinals .
No booze sold out here , too dangerous … no bathrooms either .
Muscle Beach … Woodstock …many cops with riot sticks , but no sign of a riot .
Far across the track the clubhouse looks like a postcard from the Kentucky Derby .
Steadman is now worried about fire .
Somebody told him about the clubhouse catching on fire two years ago .
Could it happen again ?
Horrible .
Trapped in the press box .
Holocaust .
A hundred thousand people fighting to get out .
Drunks screaming in the flames and the mud , crazed horses running wild .
Emerging from the tunnel was such a culture shock that it took us a while to adjust .
“ God almighty ! ” Steadman muttered .
“ This is a … Jesus ! ”
He plunged ahead with his tiny camera , stepping over bodies , and I followed , trying to take notes .
We hung around the press box long enough to watch a mass interview with the winning owner , a dapper little man named Lehmann who said he had just flown into Louisville that morning from Nepal , where he ’d “ bagged a record tiger . ”
The sportswriters murmured their admiration and a waiter filled Lehmann ’s glass with Chivas Regal .
He had just won $ 127,000 with a horse that cost him $ 6,500 two years ago .

Frank Gaffney the director of the conservative think tank the Center for Security Policy was on MSNBC ’s Hardball today where he accused President Barack Obama of speaking in code , and telling the Middle East that America will submit to them .
Gaffney says using the word respect is code in the Muslim word for submission .
In the video , the fun starts around the 9:30 mark :

Gaffney said , “ When he uses the word respect in the context of a waist bow to the King of Saudi Arabia , for example , and talks about respectful language which is code for those that adhere to Sha’aria that we will submit to Sha’aria . ”
Gaffney said that the code is received in the Taliban ’s headquarters and Al - Qaeda ’s caves , but when asked by guest host David Shuster to provide examples of the code , Gaffney did n’t but he said that extremists in Saudi Arabia , al - Qaeda , and the Taliban understood it .
He also accused Obama of making America less safe .
The neo-cons are so paranoid that they are now accusing Obama of speaking in a code of defeat and failure to the rest of the world .
A code by the way , which they do n’t fully understand themselves , but they are certain , is there .
Gaffney is one of the founding fathers of the neo-con movement .
He was one of the original 25 signatories of the 1997 statement of principles from the Project for a New American Century .
There is no “ Obama code . ”
Gaffney was trying to paint Obama as weak because as a neo - con he believes that diplomacy is weakness .
Gaffney wants to attack N. Korea and Iran .
In his view , anything that is n’t military action is destined to make America less safe .
This is an ideology that destroyed decades of American foreign policy and started an unnecessary war which killed thousands of Americans .
It is a dangerous form of extremism that hopefully will never return to power again .
In just over a day , a powerful computer program accomplished a feat that took physicists centuries to complete : extrapolating the laws of motion from a pendulum 's swings .
Developed by Cornell researchers , the program deduced the natural laws without a shred of knowledge about physics or geometry .
The research is being heralded as a potential breakthrough for science in the Petabyte Age , where computers try to find regularities in massive datasets that are too big and complex for the human mind and its standard computational tools .
" One of the biggest problems in science today is moving forward and finding the underlying principles in areas where there is lots and lots of data , but there 's a theoretical gap .
We do n't know how things work , " said Hod Lipson , the Cornell University computational researcher who co-wrote the program .
" I think this is going to be an important tool . "
Condensing rules from raw data has long been considered the province of human intuition , not machine intelligence .
It could foreshadow an age in which scientists and programs work as equals to decipher datasets too complex for human analysis .
Lipson 's program , co-designed with Cornell computational biologist Michael Schmidt and described in a paper published Thursday in Science , may represent a breakthrough in the old , unfulfilled quest to use artificial intelligence to discover mathematical theorems and scientific laws :
Half a century ago , IBM 's Herbert Gelernter authored a program that purportedly rediscovered Euclid 's geometry theorems , but critics said it relied too much on programmer - supplied rules .
In the 1970s , Douglas Lenat 's Automated Mathematician automatically generated mathematical theorems , but they proved largely useless .
Stanford University 's Dendral project , was started in 1965 and used for two decades to extrapolate possible structures for organic molecules from chemical measurements gathered by NASA spacecraft .
But it was ultimately unable to assess the likelihood of the various answers that it generated .
The $ 100,000 Leibniz Prize , established in the 1980s , was promised to the first program to discover a theorem that " profoundly affects " math .
It was never claimed .
But now artificial intelligence experts say Lipson and Schmidt may have fulfilled the field 's elusive promise .
Unlike the Automated Mathematician and its heirs , their program is primed only with a set of simple , basic mathematical functions and the data it 's asked to analyze .
Unlike Dendral and its counterparts , it can winnow possible explanations into a likely few .
And it comes at an opportune moment — scientists have vastly more data than theories to describe it .
Lipson and Schmidt designed their program to identify linked factors within a dataset fed to the program , then generate equations to describe their relationship .
The dataset described the movements of simple mechanical systems like spring - loaded oscillators , single pendulums and double pendulums — mechanisms used by professors to illustrate physical laws .
The program started with near - random combinations of basic mathematical processes — addition , subtraction , multiplication , division and a few algebraic operators .
Initially , the equations generated by the program failed to explain the data , but some failures were slightly less wrong than others .
Using a genetic algorithm , the program modified the most promising failures , tested them again , chose the best , and repeated the process until a set of equations evolved to describe the systems .
Turns out , some of these equations were very familiar : the law of conservation of momentum , and Newton 's second law of motion .
" It 's a powerful approach , " said University of Michigan computer scientist Martha Pollack , with " the potential to apply to any type of dynamical system . "
As possible fields of application , Pollack named environmental systems , weather patterns , population genetics , cosmology and oceanography .
" Just about any natural science has the type of structure that would be amenable , " she said .
Compared to laws likely to govern the brain or genome , the laws of motion discovered by the program are extremely simple .
But the principles of Lipson and Schmidt 's program should work at higher scales .
The researchers have already applied the program to recordings of individuals ' physiological states and their levels of metabolites , the cellular proteins that collectively run our bodies but remain , molecule by molecule , largely uncharacterized — a perfect example of data lacking a theory .
Their results are still unpublished , but " we 've found some interesting laws already , some laws that are not known , " said Lipson .
" What we 're working on now is the next step — ways in which we can try to explain these equations , correlate them with existing knowledge , try to break these things down into components for which we have clues . "
Lipson likened the quest to a " detective story " — a hint of the changing role of researchers in hybridized computer - human science .
Programs produce sets of equations — describing the role of rainfall on a desert plateau , or air pollution in triggering asthma , or multitasking on cognitive function .
Researchers test the equations , determine whether they 're still incomplete or based on flawed data , use them to identify new questions , and apply them to messy reality .
The Human Genome Project , for example , produced a dataset largely impervious to traditional analysis .
The function of nearly every gene depends on the function of other genes , which depend on still more genes , which change with time and place .
The same level of complexity confronts researchers studying the body 's myriad proteins , the human brain and even ecosystems .
" The rules are mathematical formulae that capture regularities in the system , " said Pollack , " but the scientist needs to interpret those regularities .
They need , for example , to explain " why an animal population is affected by changes in rainfall , and what might be done to protect it .
Michael Atherton , a cognitive scientist who recently predicted that computer intelligence would not soon supplant human artistic and scientific insight , said that the program " could be a great tool , in the same way visualization software is :
It helps to generate perspectives that might not be intuitive . "
However , said Atherton , " the creativity , expertise , and the recognition of importance is still dependent on human judgment .
The main problem remains the same : how to codify a complex frame of reference . "
" In the end , we still need a scientist to look at this and say , this is interesting , " said Lipson .
Humans are , in other words , still important .

100 Civilians Killed in Afghanistan , Where is the Outrage ?
Afghanistan officials are claiming that United States air strikes have killed between 100 and 200 civilians including scores of women and children .
General David McKiernan is asking for American citizens and officials not to jump to conclusions because the Taliban may actually be responsible for the deaths .
The strange thing is that nobody is jumping to conclusions .
The reason I find this strange is because many of our legislators have made a career of jumping to conclusions about the United States military over the last six years .
But that is not the case now that Afghanistan and the troop surge there belongs to the current president and not President Bush .
John Murtha did not have a problem jumping to a conclusion when the Haditha marines were accused of murder ; he called them cold blooded killers before any one of them ever had a chance in court .
The marines have been cleared of any wrongdoing while John Murtha has never apologized .
During the 2004 presidential campaign John Kerry accused US troops of TERRORIZING Iraqi families in the dead of night .
When rumors of abuses at GITMO first came to light Dick Durbin jumped to conclusions and compared United States soldiers and their treatment of detainees to Pol Pot , Nazis , and gulags .
Those are just three of the most despicable examples of people who jumped to conclusions for political reasons .
These people were perfectly willing to throw American troops under the bus , they were perfectly willing to slander American troops to discredit the Bush administration and undermine the war effort .
But now these same people are strangely silent .
There is nobody jumping to conclusions , and there should n’t be , but there can only be one explanation why these people , who were so adamant and vocal about the abuses and horrors that they claimed American troops were perpetrating just a few years ago , are so silent now when there is a claim that American air strikes killed women and children .
It all has to do with who is in the White House .
These same people would n’t dare to slander our troops now that a Democrat is calling the shots .
These people have shown us their true character , and it is n’t pretty .
To put politics above our troops was disgraceful , now that they are saying nothing they have been exposed for the hypocrites and political whores that they are .
Their silence is deafening .

In this article I would explain some tips for securing Cisco administrative access .
When creating passwords , keep these rules in mind :
Make passwords lengthy
Passwords should combine letters , numbers , and symbols .
Passwords should not use dictionary words
Change passwords as often as possible
Strong passwords are the primary defense against unauthorized access to your router .
The best way to manage passwords is to maintain them on an AAA server , but not all people can have / manage a AAA server .
Cisco provides a number of enhanced features that allow you to increase the security of your passwords .
For the basic configuration read this article .
Protecting Line Access
Resctrict the AUX , VTY and console access with a password or with a username / password .
The simplest configuration to protect is :
Enables password checking at login
login
Sets the password
password my_password
Note : Administrators sometimes use auxiliary ports to remotely configure and monitor the router using a dial - up modem connection .
If you want to turn off the EXEC process for the aux port , use the no exec command within the auxiliary line configuration mode .
service password - encryption
All Cisco router passwords are , by default , stored in plaintext form within the router configuration ( see the running - config or startup - config … ) .
Cisco permits to “ hide ” these password with a proprietary Cisco algorithm based on a Vigenere cipher .
To encrypt system password use :
service password - encryption
For instance , if you set an “ enable password ciscozine ” without this feature the password in your running - config is in plaintext :
enable password ciscozine
but if you enable service password - encryption command , the password is hidden :
enable password 7 02050D4808091528424B
Remember :
When you remove the service password - encryption command with the no form , the command does not decrypt the passwords .
Remember : Vigenere cipher is not a SECURE crypto algorithm ; in fact you can find many software to decrypt this type of password .
This method is not as safe as MD5 , which is used with the enable secret command , but prevents casual discovery of the router line - level passwords .
Use MD5
Use MD5 hash function where it is possible ; for instance :
enable secret command is more secure than enable passwordcommand , because it use MD5 algorithm for hash the passsword .
username my_user secret my_passwordis more secure than username my_user password my_password , because it use MD5 algorithm for hash the passsword .
Timeout
By default , an administrative interface ( TTY , AUX , …. ) stays active ( and logged on ) for ten minutes after the last session activity .
A better choise is to limit the time to three minutes .
To adjust this timer to 2 minutes and 30 seconds :
- Advertisement -
exec - timeout 2 30
Remember : Setting the exec - timeout value to zero means that there will be no timeout and the session will stay active for an unlimited time .
Do not set the value to zero .
Protecting against dictionary attack
Cisco has implemented many features to procted router / swtich against dictionary attack ; there are many ways to protect :
security password min-length
From Cisco IOS Release 12.3 ( 1 ) and later it is possible to define a minimum password length ( default is Six characters ) .
This command affects user passwords , enable passwords and secrets , and line passwords that users create after the command is executed .
Existing router passwords remain unaffected .
For instance , if you would set a minimum password length of 8 characters :
security password min-length 8
If you insert a password that not respect the lenght an error message is displayed :
Password too short - must be at least 8 characters .
Password not configured .
security authentication failure rate
From Cisco IOS Release 12.3 ( 1 ) and later , it it possible to configure the number of allowable unsuccessful login attempts .
The security authentication failure - rate command provides enhanced security access to the router by generating syslog messages after the number of unsuccessful login attempts exceeds the configured threshold rate .
This command ensures that there are not any continuous failures to access the router .
After the 15 - second delay has passed , the user can continue to attempt to log in to the router .
The following example shows how to configure your router to generate a syslog message after five failed login attempts ( a 15 - second delay timer starts after the number of login failed is reached ) :
security authentication failure rate 5 log
login block for
Another helpful command to block dictionary attack is the login block forcommand .
This command permits to block for ‘ x ’ seconds after ‘y ’ login are tried within ‘ z ’ seconds .
See below to understand how the command works .
The following example shows how block login access for 120 seconds after 5 failed login attempts within 30 seconds :
login block - for 120 attempts 5 within 30
Remember : All login attempts made via Telnet , SSH , and HTTP are denied during the quiet period ; that is , no ACLs are exempt from the login period until the login quiet - mode access - class command is issued .
login quiet - mode access-class
It is possible to define an ACL to permit login attempts when the login access is blocked by the login block - for or by the security authentication failure rate command .
It can be useful in emergency situation .
login quiet - mode access-class 101
access - list 101 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
The following logging message is generated after the router switches to quiet - mode :
00:04:07 : %SEC_LOGIN-1-QUIET_MODE_ON:
Still timeleft for watching failures is 158 seconds , [ user : ciscozine ] [ Source : 192.168.10.10 ] [ localport : 23 ] [ Reason : Invalid login ] , [ ACL:22 ] at 16:17:23 UTC
Wed Apr 15 2009
The following logging message is generated after the router switches from quiet mode back to normal mode :
00:09:07 : %SEC_LOGIN-5-QUIET_MODE_OFF : Quiet Mode is OFF , because block period timed out at 16:22:23 UTC Wed Apr 15 2009
login delay
From Cisco IOS Release 12.3 ( 4 ) T and later , it is possbile to define the time between successive login attempts .
If this command is not enabled , a login delay of one second is automatically enforced after the login block - for command is applied to the router configuration .
For instance , if I would define a delay of 10 seconds , use this command :
login delay 10
Logging login requests
It is possible logging failure / success login requests :
login on - success
Generates logging messages for successful login attempts .
For example : 00:04:32 : %SEC_LOGIN-5-LOGIN_SUCCESS:Login Success [ user : ciscozine ] [ Source : 192.168.10.10 ] [ localport : 23 ] at 16:30:40 UTC
Wed Apr 15 2009
Generates logging messages for successful login attempts .
For example : login on - failure
Generates logging messages for failed login attempts .
For example : 00:03:34 : %SEC_LOGIN-4-LOGIN_FAILED:Login failed [ user : ciscozine ] [ Source : 192.168.10.10 ] [ localport : 23 ] [ Reason : Invalid login ] at 16:32:12 UTC
Wed Apr 15 2009
To check login enforcement settings use the “ show login ” command .
Disable password recovery
Cisco permits to recover password during the reload system .
This scenario presents a potential security breach because anyone who gains physical access to the router console port can enter ROMMON , reset the enable secret password , and discover the router configuration .
For this reason , it is possible disable password recovery procedure .
To do it use the “ hidden ” command “ no service password - recovery ” .
When you configure the router , disabling password recovery feature , you see this message :
ciscozine ( config ) # no service password - recovery WARNING : Executing this command will disable password recovery mechanism .
Do not execute this command without another plan for password recovery .
Are you sure you want to continue ?
[ yes / no ] : yes ciscozine ( config ) #
When the no service password - recovery command is configured , you see this message during boot up :
System Bootstrap , Version 11.1 ( 19 ) AA , EARLY DEPLOYMENT RELEASE SOFTWARE ( fc1 ) Copyright ( c ) 1998 by Cisco Systems , Inc. C3600 processor with 65536 Kbytes of main memory Main memory is configured to 64 bit mode with parity enabled PASSWORD RECOVERY FUNCTIONALITY IS DISABLED program load complete , entry point : 0x80008000 , size : 0x10ce394
Self decompressing the image : #########################################################
########################################################################################
####################################################################### [ OK ]
- Advertisement -
Remember :
If a router is configured with the no service password - recovery command , this disables all access to the ROMMON .
If there is no valid Cisco IOS software image in the Flash memory of the router , the user is not able to use the ROMMON XMODEM command in order to load a new Flash image .
In order to fix the router , you must get a new Cisco IOS software image on a Flash SIMM , or on a PCMCIA card , for example on the 3600 Series Routers .

In the face of rising unemployment and businesses declaring bankruptcy , a new study has found that losing your job can make you sick .
Even when people find a new job quickly , there is an increased risk of developing a new health problem , such as hypertension , heart disease , heart attack , stroke or diabetes as a result of the job loss .
The study will be published in the May 8 issue of Demography .
" In today 's economy , job loss can happen to anybody , " said Kate Strully , who conducted the research as a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Society scholar at the Harvard School of Public Health .
" We need to be aware of the health consequences of losing our jobs and do what we can to alleviate the negative effects . "
Workers who are in poor health have a 40 percent increase in the odds of being laid off or fired , but Strully 's findings go beyond sicker people being more likely to lose their jobs .
She finds that " job churning , " defined as high rates of job loss but low unemployment , has negative health consequences for workers who were not already sick .
For those who lost their job — white or blue collar — through no fault of their own , such as an establishment closure , the odds of reporting fair or poor health increased by 54 percent , and among respondents with no pre-existing health conditions , it increased the odds of a new health condition by 83 percent .
Even when workers became re-employed , those workers had an increased risk of new stress - related health conditions .
Unlike the results of job loss due to an establishment closure , when health effects were analyzed based on workers who were fired or laid off , significant differences were found based on the workers ' occupations .
While being fired or laid off or leaving a job voluntarily more than doubles the odds of a fair or poor health report among blue - collar workers , such job displacements have no significant association with the health reports of white - collar workers .
The reasons for this disparity are unclear based on the study results .
" As we consider ways to improve health in America during a time of economic recession and rising unemployment , it is critical that we look beyond health care reform to understand the tremendous impact that factors like job loss have on our health , " says David R. Williams , Norman Professor of Public Health at the Harvard School of Public Health , Professor of African and African American Studies and of Sociology at Harvard University and staff director of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Commission to Build a Healthier America .
" Where and how we live , work , learn and play have a greater impact on how healthy we are than the health care we receive . "
The study was conducted based on data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics , a nationally representative survey from 1999 , 2001 and 2003 .
The study looked at establishment closures that included a range of occupations , including managerial or professional positions ( 30 percent displacement ) , sales , clerical , and craft jobs , ( 33 percent displacement ) , a machine operator jobs ( 20 percent displacement ) , and service positions ( 13 percent displacement ) .

Ha ! Science .
What has science ever given us ?
I ’ll tell you what it ’s given us : Nazi’s , Puma footwear and apparel , intrusive anal - based exams , medicine , and other forms of wizardry .
Frankly , me and the rest of the unenlightened Judeo - Christian world do n’t need it ’s hog wash anymore .
When I get prostate cancer , I want them to bathe me in holy water so I can let Jesus ’ magic remove the embodiment of sin ( or as the Practitioners of Atheism , aka Doctors , would have me believe , the uncontrolled division of cells ) .
These sins include but are not limited to looking at my sister ’s breasts at age 14 and briefly glancing at a homosexual couple .
Outlandish stereotypes are things that all foreigners have to deal with , and as a group , expats are n’t immune .
We certainly do n’t want to fuel any wild prejudices here .
But in the event that you ’re an expat interested in the best places in the world to occasionally indulge in beverages of the alcoholic variety , the World Health Organization has conveniently published a list of the drunkest nations in the world per capita .
And in a surprising twist , everyone ’s favorite contender– Ireland– did n’t top the list .
Though undoubtedly , they certainly came close .
Ireland only managed # 4 in the world in alcoholic consumption , as an unexpected Uganda topped the world with a startling 19.47 litres consumed per capita .
Luxembourg and the Czech Republic rounded out the top three .
Germany , another odds on favorite , ranked # 10 .
Not surprisingly , Europe is easily the drunkest continent .
It ’s also the origin of most of the world ’s expats .
Hmm .

Exploiting Structure for Scalable Software Verification
[ PDF ] [ PS ] [ PS. BZ2 ] [ VIEW ]
@phdthesis{babic08 , author = { Domagoj Babi\'c} , title = { {Exploiting Structure for Scalable Software Verification}} , school = { University of British Columbia , Vancouver , Canada} , year = { 2008} , }
Abstract : Software bugs are expensive .
Recent estimates by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology claim that the cost of software bugs to the US economy alone is approximately 60 billion USD annually .
As society becomes increasingly software - dependent , bugs also reduce our productivity and threaten our safety and security .
Decreasing these direct and indirect costs represents a significant research challenge as well as an opportunity for businesses .
Automatic software bug - finding and verification tools have a potential to completely revolutionize the software engineering industry by improving reliability and decreasing development costs .
Since software analysis is in general undecidable , automatic tools have to use various abstractions to make the analysis computationally tractable .
Abstraction is a double - edged sword : coarse abstractions , in general , yield easier verification , but also less precise results .
This thesis focuses on exploiting the structure of software for abstracting away irrelevant behavior .
Programmers tend to organize code into objects and functions , which effectively represent natural abstraction boundaries .
Humans use such structural abstractions to simplify their mental models of software and for constructing informal explanations of why a piece of code should work .
A natural question to ask is :
How can automatic bug - finding tools exploit the same natural abstractions ?
This thesis offers possible answers .
More specifically , I present three novel ways to exploit structure at three different steps of the software analysis process .
First , I show how symbolic execution can preserve the data - flow dependencies of the original code while constructing compact symbolic representations of programs .
Second , I propose structural abstraction , which exploits the structure preserved by the symbolic execution .
Structural abstraction solves a long - standing open problem --- scalable interprocedural path - and context - sensitive program analysis .
Finally , I present an automatic tuning approach that exploits the fine - grained structural properties of software ( namely , data - and control - dependency ) for faster property checking .
This novel approach resulted in a 500 - fold speedup over the best previous techniques .
Automatic tuning not only redefined the limits of automatic software analysis tools , but also has already found its way into other domains ( like model checking ) , demonstrating the generality and applicability of this idea .
Check out this incredible mushi ( bug ) mecha that was profiled on the Japanese TV show " Nanikore Chin Hakkei " last night .

Designed and built by an Ibaraki man in his garage over the course of eleven years , the " Kabutom RX - 03 " looks like a prop from a Power Rangers spin - off but is an actual working vehicle .
Why build it ?
Because owning an eleven meter long , fifteen ton robot beetle makes you a mack daddy -- in Japan or anywhere else .
Shaped like a kabuto - mushi ( rhinocerous beetle , a favorite design of Japanese toymakers and , uh , candymakers ) , it can be remote controlled or piloted from the cockpit ( visible on the left side ) , and is capable of carrying passengers inside its shell .
Alas it more " shuffles " than walks -- the legs pull it along the ground , while the weight is supported by wheels .
But hey -- not bad for something created for the love of it in a garage .
Passion like this represents the best part of Japanese otaku culture .

by Gwen Filosa , The Times - PicayuneTuesday May 05 , 2009 , 9:00 AMJeremy Don Kerr enjoys wearing a skirt in public .
And he wants a federal court to ensure that a man can do so in peace .
Kerr has sued the New Orleans Police Department in U.S. District Court over a May 2008 incident in which he says a uniformed officer threatened to arrest him for wearing a black pinstriped skirt , hemmed two inches above the knee , instead of pants to Municipal Court .
" He followed me out of the courtroom yelling at me , he grabs me by the shoulder and pulls me around , " Kerr said Monday .
" He had no right to ask me that question .
You could n't ask a woman , ' Why are you wearing pants ? '
" In a civil - rights lawsuit filed last month , Kerr describes himself as " a heterosexual male of Scottish ancestry " who was made a victim of discrimination by his choice of attire .
He seeks a declaratory judgment saying that NOPD violated his rights and $ 1 in damages , along with court fees .
In addition , Kerr wants U.S. District Court Judge Helen Berrigan to bar the NOPD from prohibiting anyone in the city " unfettered access to public facilities because of sex discrimination that is based on gender stereotyping .
" Officer Glen
Tate demanded that Kerr explain why he was in a skirt , Kerr says , asking at one point if he was a woman .
" He said , ' Are you going to make me arrest you and find out ? ' " Kerr recalled .
" He threatened to take me out of the courthouse and put me in Orleans Parish Prison over a simple choice of attire .
" The NOPD has n't been served with the lawsuit and has n't answered the claim in court .
Kerr , 37 , a native of Lake Charles , left a college teaching career in the Midwest to return to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005 .
He earned a doctorate in sociology , with a focus on criminology , at the University of Kentucky .
Kerr began wearing skirts in 2003 after a friend suggested he'd look as if he were in a kilt .
He prefers a skirt when dancing at clubs along Frenchmen Street or strolling New Orleans neighborhoods .
He finds skirts more comfortable than pants , and wears them with button - down oxfords or T - shirts .
Kerr wore a skirt to the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival .
" The comments are overwhelmingly positive , " he said .
" Women love it , people of all ages and all races love it across the board .
" He wears pants for his job selling scooters and motorbikes , he said .
He has been kicked out of restaurants and barred from bars over his clothing choice , which he points out is a practice that began thousands of years ago .
The New York and Paris runways in January featured men in skirts , dressed by designers Jean Paul Gaultier and Marc Jacobs .
" I'm a straight man , " Kerr said .
" A lot of people seem to believe if I 'm in a skirt it must mean that I 'm gay .
It 's a choice in clothing style .
One hundred years ago women could only wear dresses and skirts , and men could only wear pants .
" Kerr 's alleged clash with the officer took place at Municipal Court on May 5 , 2008 , the suit says , when Kerr was appearing on a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace .
The case was later dropped but required a second trip to the courthouse , Kerr said .
This time , Kerr wore pants in case he ran into Tate .
" I was scared , " Kerr said .
" He was there . " . . . . . . . Gwen Filosa can be reached at gfilosa@timespicayune.com or 504.826.3304 .

Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter on the Future of C++ : Part 1 ( video transcription )
Welcome to OnSoftware — conversations with thought leaders in software development .
In this session , Ted Neward , Bjarne Stroustrup , and Herb Sutter discuss the forthcoming features in C++0 x .
Learn about Bjarne and Herb 's favorite new features .
Ted Neward :
So , gentleman , a year [ after our first set of conversations ] , we 're doing this again .
Bjarne Stroustrup : Yeah , hello .
Herb Sutter :
Here we are .
Ted :
For those who are tuning in fresh , why do n't you give us a little bit of background — who you are and what you do ?
Bjarne :
Well , I guess I 'll do myself , as opposed to Herb .
Bjarne Stroustrup , I 'm here because I designed and implemented C++.
Ted : Wrote a book with that same title , too , as I recall .
Bjarne : Wrote a book or three with the same title , yes .
I 'm now a professor in Texas , and still work with C++—uses of it , teaching of it , programming it .
Looking into a lot of industrial applications , things like that , just having a lot of interesting stuff going on .
Ted :
You 're still a part of the C++ committee , right ?
Bjarne : Oh , yes .
I mean , we 're here together [ gestures at Sutter and himself ] , I think , because we came from the standards committee meeting last week .
And , well , standards work is not exactly fun —
[ All laugh . ]
Bjarne :
But it 's important , and this is one of the ways you can get useful things out to people numbering millions and lasting for decades .
So it 's important work , and it reflects interesting work .
Ted :
We 'll get to that , I 'm sure .
Bjarne : Yes .
Ted : Herb .
Herb : Who am I ?
And what am I doing here ?
Ted : Yeah .
Herb : I run that standards committee , somehow they managed to let me do that , which mostly means saying when we 're going to meet .
We were just there [ gestures at Stroustrup ] and had a nice meeting in Washington State .
And voted in Lambda functions ( well , that 's one of the things we did ) into the C++0 x working draft .
We 'll talk more about those things later .
Ted :
We 'll get to that later , too , yeah .
Herb : Yeah , so that 's kind of nice , we 're making progress .
So here at SD , we 're talking about C++.
I 've been doing lot of concurrency work lately with multicore and everything happening , " free lunch " being over — well , yes , except we just need to line up at a new free lunch , but where is that trough and how do we find it ?
That 's where most of my work is these days , both at Microsoft and also at my independent work , as my professional life is sort of in both of those areas .
Ted : Okay , alright .
So , since you guys talked about the standards that you 're working on — C++ working draft , V.next , do we have an estimate on when it 's going to be not a working draft , but a public final or final draft ?
Bjarne : Current schedule is , I think , October this year .
And we have one more meeting ; we 're all going to sunny France , have a wonderful time in a windowless room , for a week on the Riviera .
Ted :
You know , that sounded good until you said " windowless room . "
Bjarne : Yes .
Herb :
It 's always a windowless room .
Bjarne :
We had a whole week , 12 - hour days , Hawaii , on the beach — in a windowless room .
I mean , some people are just gluttons for punishment .
Ted : Wow .
Well , how many of the members brought their wives with them , just to try to , like , earn some marriage points ?
Because I could see that .
Bjarne : Hawaii ?
Only a handful , because they knew it was — I mean , these are the late meetings , they 're difficult .
A couple of years ago , it was almost half , but now the work is harder and the free time is less free .
Ted : Okay , alright .
Herb : Especially since we want , at our next meeting in France , to vote the last major features into the working draft and then give it one meeting to sit .
Then , in September , when we meet , hopefully ( if we meet the schedule ) vote out a complete draft for public review and then just do edits and minor fixes for the next year before we finally ship it .
We 'll see if we make it .
It 's looking good , we hope that we will , but we 're getting close to knowing the good shape of C++0 x and what exactly to expect .
Bjarne :
So , feature complete , June ; draft for public review , October ; all kinds of official steps sometime next year .
So , we hope in C++0 x that " x " will still be decimal —
[ All laugh . ]
Bjarne :
But we will get the work done by then .
Whether the ISO process can grind its way with official nation votes and such ....
Ted :
But it 'll be at a point where , presumably , compilers would be able to support C++0 x by 2009 ?
Herb :
Well , that depends .
If you 're talking about a complete implementation , that always takes a little longer , because some compilers implement some features , and others in the next release .
But several compilers have already implemented parts of C++0 x — even though the standard has not sailed yet .
But those parts are considered fairly stable , so some vendors have done that already .
So , there are several parts that you can get already in implementations .
Ted :
So , since we 're sort of dancing around the subject , C++0 x contains — you mentioned Lambdas ; what else is there ?
Because that , you said , just voted in .
So what bits are in C++0 x that have been there for a while now ?
Bjarne :
This is really new — that was Saturday , Lambdas .
Herb :
And today is Tuesday .
[ All laugh . ]
Ted :
This is hot news !
We 're gonna to have to rush to press with this one .
Bjarne :
And we 've done a lot of work on the foundations for concurrency : machine model , a little bit of language primitives necessary , atomics , and the thread — standard threads , on which you can build different higher - level concurrency models .
Ted :
So we 're getting a standard thread model in the language ?
Herb :
In the library .
Ted :
In the library .
Herb : Memory - model –defining language semantics ; but the rest , it turned out , could largely be built as libraries , using the other C++ power features .
Bjarne :
If you have the right primitives , you can build just about anything as libraries .
If you do n't have the right primitives , it 's well known to be impossible .
Herb :
So the primitives here , I mentioned memory model , the other one is atomic operations .
Java - style volatile — the same kind of thing , something you can use atomically for lock - free programming , or to implement locks and threads on top .
Ted : Since you brought up Java , how much —
Herb :
You just clued in on the J - word !
Ted : Well , you know — you gotta jump on these !
[ Laughs . ]
You offer me these , you know , holes — ever so tiny .
Bjarne : Holes ?
Ted :
Well , obviously , there was a lot of work that went on in Java 5 with the java.util.
concurrent package ; Doug Lea was a part of that , and William Pugh , who originally pointed out the flaws in the Java memory model .
So will we see library support in the same sense that we see java.util.concurrent ?
We have atomic Boolean and atomic long classes , we have reader - writer lock classes , we have executor thread pool service , and stuff like that ?
Or do we get atomic as a template ?
Give me an idea of how it looks .
Herb :
There are great similarities with what Java did in 5 and 6 , and of course Java 7 is working now and adding the fork / join and other models .
This is an evolutionary process that all of us are evolving on .
We 'll get largely what Java has ( think of it in terms of the facilities ) .
Memory model is state - of - the - art memory model , on par with anything , and that all the hardware vendors are able to support — and operating system and compiler vendors .
Ted : I suppose that would be important , that the hardware vendors could actually support it .
[ All laugh . ]
Herb :
Yes , I have more appreciation for Henry Kissinger of ages past , doing shuttle diplomacy among five major hardware vendors ( that I wo n't name ) for about six months , to make sure things worked .
Ted :
We could probably figure out who two or three of them are .
[ Laughs . ]
Bjarne :
We need a sort of a contract between the hardware architects and the compiler writers , because C++ is still very close to the hardware .
And it took them some time to figure out what that contract was going to be , and what could be delivered .
Ted :
But that 's all done now .
Bjarne :
It 's done .
Ted : Good .
So I do n't have to worry about it — even better .
So , what else is there ?
Herb :
Threads , mutexes , same kinds of things .
Now , some of the concurrency libraries are in C++0x , the next standard itself ; and others will be coming shortly thereafter , as sort of an add - on pack , a second batch of standard library extensions .
We already delivered one of those several years ago , which is now in the standard .
Ted : That was the TR1 [ C++ Technical Report 1 ] , right ?
Herb : TR1 , which is now largely in the standard .
And now TR2 includes things like thread pools and reader - writer locks , probably , and that 's the intent for what we have planned to add shortly after C++0x .
Ted : Okay .
Any core language changes ?
Bjarne : Yeah , most of them are focused on better support for generic programming because it 's such a runaway success with C++ 98 , but it 's creaking in places .
So we get concepts , which is a very flexible mechanism for type - checking of template documents , and things like that .
We 're going to get automatics , which is basically a way of declaring variables so that they get the type of their initializer , saving a lot of writing .
We 're going to get some aliasing mechanisms for types ( would be template typedefs in the old term ) .
Lambdas fit in there .
We 're going to get a new FOR loop that will allow easier traversal of containers .
All loaded based on concepts .
There 's a whole package of features designed to work together to make it easier to write good generic code , have it perform as well as we 're used to , get better error messages if you mess up , and overall write much less to get the results .
Ted : Hmm . Okay .
Herb :
Have you ever compiled templates and seen template error messages ?
Ted : [ Groans . ]
Oh yes .
Bjarne : Spectacularly bad .
Herb : Templates work great , but the error messages are , shall we say , sometimes inscrutable .
Ted : I can remember , literally , watching , scrolling through it .
[ Gestures to indicate a long screen . ]
I can't remember if it was a Borland or Visual error window — it was really War and Peace .
Bjarne :
It 's horrible .
Herb :
However , the most important thing to know about concepts is that you can say what you mean , so those template error messages should be a thing of the past .
Ted : I 'll hold you to that !
We 'll check in next year and see .
Herb :
We 're showing live examples this week .
Bjarne :
You can check it now .
It works .
Ted : Check it now using ...?
Herb : ConceptGCC is a prototype implementation that some of the standards committee people have done , that shows how it works — and you can Google for that .
Ted : Concept - dash - GCC ?
Herb : ConceptGCC , all one word .
Ted : ConceptGCC , okay .
I 'll hold you to that .

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales ' open source , human - powered Google killer died a quiet death Tuesday , making Wikia.com the latest object lesson in the futility of trying to unseat Google as the king of search engines .
Even though the site lasted barely a year , Wales should not feel badly about pulling the plug on his ambitious attempt to harness the power of the crowds to take down Google and force search algorithms to become more transparent .
In fact , Wikia even managed to force Google to adopt a Wikia - like feature in November that solicits user opinions on whether search results are relevant .
But , the reality is that no one can kill Google , and its search box is going to rule for many more years .
It employs 20,000 of the world 's most intelligent people and rakes in billions yearly .
It has a squadron of other products from YouTube to Gmail that insinuate the company 's technology deep into its users ' lives .
It runs the net 's best data centers , something that any true competitor would need hundreds of millions to come close to matching .
While it may be little comfort , Wikia has well - esteemed neighbors in the search engine graveyard .
Amazon 's attempt to build a successful search engine called A9 failed , and its former head Udi Manber is now a vice president at
Google .
Yahoo , Microsoft and Ask.com all continue to struggle to maintain what 's left of the search pie after Google grabs its 60 - something percent .
Technorati , the blog search engine , has been all but abandoned by web users .
Simply put , Google knows history .
Google came marching from
Stanford armed with the PageRank algorithm to conquer the search engines of the late 1990s .
And after it won , it made sure to become powerful enough that no young upstarts would do to it what it did to
Yahoo , AltaVista , HotBot and Ask Jeeves .
Google , which the feds sometimes suspect has grown into a monopoly , says search is very competitive and that its users will head to Yahoo at the first sign of trouble .
It also points to its experiments to show that the company remains innovative and has no lock on users .
In 2006 , Idealab 's Snap.com was hailed as a Google - killer , but it all but ditched its search engine in favor of pop - up - ad bubble technology .
Last year 's hyped entrant Cuil may have figured out a smart way to build a deep index of the web without needing millions to build sprawling data centers , but it differs little from any other post - Google search engine — it haslittle to draw users from Google 's comfortable embrace .
There 's been plenty of attempts to make search smarter — figuring out what a user means is one route .
That 's the point of 2009's hyped entrant Wolfram Alpha , which has n't even launched yet but is said to know how to answer questions as if it were a sentient computer .
Powerset managed to convince Microsoft that its grouping technology was worth
$ 100 million , even though its public search engine only let users explore Wikipedia .
Others try to make search deeper , by looking into the net 's unplumbed databases — sometimes called the Dark Web .
Try DeepDyve .
Some are trying to tap into the instant zeitgeist — by searching Twitter microblog posts , but Google will surely take over this category as thoroughly as it did blog search .
And still others try to make search results look different .
The latest visualizer — SearchMe — mimics iTunes ' Cover Flow , while older attempts such as Kartoo and Ujiko bravely tried more futuristic layouts .
Perhaps the best approach these days is to disavow competition with Google entirely .
The best new entries on the web are Kosmix , ChaCha and DuckDuckGo .
DuckDuckGo feels like a search engine for 5th graders doing their homework .
That may sound mean , but it 's a compliment .
ChaCha answers questions you ask by text message , and sends the answer and an ad or two back to your phone .
Kosmix 's founders scream as loudly as they can that they are not a Google competitor — instead calling what they do exploration , rather than search .
The company 's technology works by creating on - the - fly pages about a topic from sources such as Wikipedia , Flickr , AllRecipes , YouTube and yes , Google and Google News .
For general queries , Kosmix is a refreshing change from the straight list of search results we 've all grown so accustomed to .
And hopefully , its founders are feeling lucky .
Interested in alternative search engines ?
Here 's a selection of new and old challengers .
DuckDuckGo , Wikia , Kosmix , OneRiot , ChaCha , DeepDyve , Powerset , Technorati , Yauba , Hakia , Ixquick , Clusty , Grokker , Kartoo , Ujiko

Updated The European Commission has revealed plans to sue the UK government over its failure to take any action against BT and Phorm for their secret broadband interception and profiling trials .
Last year
The Register revealed the pair had run covert wiretaps on tens of thousands of broadband lines in two trials in 2006 and 2007 , to profile web use on behalf of advertisers .
In a statement released today , EU telecoms Commissioner Viviane Reding said the Phorm case showed UK laws needed to be tightened to protect consumers and comply with the ePrivacy Directive .
New Labour signed the UK up to the ePrivacy Directive in 2002 and it came into force in October 2003 .
" I call on the UK authorities to change their national laws and ensure that national authorities are duly empowered and have proper sanctions at their disposal to enforce EU legislation on the confidentiality of communications , " Reding said .
" This should allow the UK to respond more vigorously to new challenges to ePrivacy and personal data protection such as those that have arisen in the Phorm case . "
Under UK legislation , responsibility for enforcing the ePrivacy Directive lies with the Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) .
It had discussions with BT and Phorm about the secret trials but declined to take any action .
The ICO accepted BT 's argument that it would have been hard to explain Phorm 's interception and profiling system to internet users whose communications it was being tested on .
The ICO did not immediately respond to a request for comment today ; we 'll update this story when it does .
Announcing the infringement action , the Commission also said it was concerned that the UK does not have an authority to regulate interception of communications by private companies .
The ICO does not have responsibility for enforcing the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) , which governs interception , and the Office of the Surveillance Commissioners is mandated only to investigate interceptions by public authorities .
The police meanwhile declined to act over BT and Phorm 's trials , saying there was " implied consent " and a lack of criminal intent .
The Commission said : " Under UK law , which is enforced by the UK police , it is an offence to unlawfully intercept communications .
However , the scope of this offence is limited to ' intentional ' interception only .
" Moreover , according to this law , interception is also considered to be lawful when the interceptor has ' reasonable grounds for believing ' that consent to interception has been given .
The Commission is also concerned that the UK does not have an independent national supervisory authority dealing with such interceptions . "
After it had carried out the two trials , Phorm sought advice from the Home Office on whether its technology complied with RIPA .
An official replied that he believed it could be if consent was sought from each broadband customer .
Outside legal experts have since disputed that advice , arguing consent would also be needed from every website whose data was intercepted .
The Commission 's action follows several months of letter - writing back and forth between Brussels and Whitehall .
It has sent the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform ( BERR ) , which handles UK government communications with the Commission , two months ' notice of formal action .
If it receives no reply or an unsatisfactory reply , it may decide to issue " a reasoned opinion " , which is the next stage of the infringement process .
If following that the government does not bring UK law into line with European obligations , the Commission could sue in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg .
It has powers to heavily fine member states who infringe EU law .
A BERR spokeswoman confirmed officials had received the Commission 's notice .
" We will be considering the issues raised and will respond within the required timeframe .
It would be inappropriate to comment further at this time , " she said .
At time of publication spokespeople for BT and Phorm had not returned our calls .
Again , we 'll update this story when they do .
Previously both have claimed they took legal advice prior to the trials , but refused to reveal what it said .
We 've reproduced the Commission statement in full on the next page . ®
Update
Phorm returned our call via email just after 4 pm .
It sought to soothe investors , saying it does not expect the Commission 's action to have any impact on its plans .
It did not address the legal status of its previous secret trials .
Here 's the statement in full :
The EU Commission has announced today that it is starting infringement proceedings against the UK Government concerning the alleged failure of UK legislation to conform in certain respects with EU e-privacy and personal data protection rules .
This is obviously a matter for the Commission and the UK Government .
However , in so far as the Commission 's announcement references Phorm 's technology , we should like to make the following points clear .
Phorm 's technology is fully compliant with UK legislation and relevant EU directives .
This has been confirmed by BERR and by the UK regulatory authorities and we note that there is no suggestion to the contrary in the Commission 's statement today .
We do not envisage the Commission ’s proceedings will have any impact on the company 's plans going forwards .
Furthermore , Phorm 's system stands out from other online advertising systems in that it does not store personal data , or browsing histories .
Finally , consistent with UK and EU legislation , and in anticipation of any changes that may be made to the law in the future , our system offers un-missable notice and clear and persistent choice to consumers .
This release clarifies any misunderstandings that may have arisen following the Commission 's announcement .
Update 2
The ICO returned our call via email at about 4.30 pm .
It argued that the Commission was referring to intercept law and so implied it was not directly involved .
In assessing the ICO 's argument , note that PECR is the set of regulations implementing the ePrivacy Directive ( as referred to by the European Commission ) in the UK .
Here 's the statement in full :
The ICO regulates and enforces the Data Protection Act , Freedom of Information Act and Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations .
These infringement proceedings from the EU appear to relate to the interception of communications , which is not part of the ICO 's remit .
Interception of communications is covered by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act , which is separate to the Data Protection Act and not regulated by the ICO .
The ICO has been involved in discussions with Phorm regarding the technology 's compliance with the DPA and PECR only .
A system such as Phorm can operate in a way which is in compliance with both these acts but must be sensitive to the concerns of users .
Information must be provided to individuals that enables them to make a meaningful choice about whether or not to be involved in the use of the technology .
The ICO will keep this technology under review as it develops .
I talk a lot about Win Shares , because they do something I think is really valuable — they estimate the contribution each player has made to his team ’s wins .
This is an entirely different way of thinking about players , stats and value — because it measures every baseball event within the context of the ultimate goal : winning games .
But Win Shares are not the only way to skin this cat .
There is another process that goes by many names and has been “ introduced ” to the public many times .
In fact , a 2003 Business Week article claimed that “ a novel way to evaluate baseball players ” had been invented by people who wanted to bottle , patent and sell it .
Too late .
It was first introduced by the Mills brothers in the early 1970 ’s , and it ’s been done many times since .
As I said , it goes by many names : “ Player Win Averages ” ( Mills brothers ) , “ Player Game Percentage ” ( Bennett ) , “ Win Probability Added ” ( Drinen ) , “ Win Expectancy ” ( Tangotiger ) , “ Game State Wins ” ( Rhoids website ) , “ Player ’s Win Value ” ( Ed Oswalt ) and WRAP ( Lonergan and Polak ) .
I ’m sure there are other people who have done the same thing and given it a name that I ’ve not acknowledged here .
I apologize if you ’re one of those people .
For purposes of this article , I ’m going to use the Drinen name , “ Win Probability , ” because I think it ’s the most descriptive .
Here ’s the basic idea .
An average team , at any point in a game , has a certain likelihood of winning the game .
For instance , if you ’re leading by two runs in the ninth inning , your chances of winning the game are much greater than if you ’re leading by three runs in the first inning .
With each change in the score , inning , number of outs , base situation or even pitch , there is a change in the average team ’s probability of winning the game .
Christopher Shea has invented a “ Win Expectancy Finder ” to look up the actual Win Probability of every base / out , inning and score combination of all Major League games from 1979 to 1990 .
Chris used Retrosheet data that had been compiled by Phil Birnbaum , and his WE Finder simply looks up the percent of times a team in a given situation went on to win the game during those years .
Next time you watch a ballgame , use it to track the ups and downs of the game .
It will change the way you watch baseball .
Here ’s an example : Bottom of the ninth , score tied , runner on first , no one out .
The home team has a 71 % chance of winning according to the Win Expectancy Finder ( in this situation , the home team won 1,878 of 2,631 games between 1979 and 1990 ) .
Let ’s say the batter bunts the runner to second .
Good idea , right ?
Well , after a successful bunt , with a runner on second and one out , the Win Probability actually decreases slightly to 70 % ( home team won 1300 of 1,848 games ) , according to the WE Finder .
The bunter has n’t really helped or hurt his team ; his bunt was a neutral event .
If you ’re managing a team , or even following the game , you might want to know this sort of thing .
Of course , the application of actual strategy ( should he bunt or not ? ) depends on a lot of other factors , such as the skills of the batter , the pitcher and the baserunner , the following batters in the order , the game conditions and probably a number of other things .
But Win Probability sets the baseline for evaluating each event on the field .
To really have fun with this system , you can take it one step further and track something Drinen calls “ Win Probability Added ” ( WPA ) .
Once again , the concept is simple .
Let ’s say our batter in the bottom of the ninth hits a single to put runners on first and third with no outs .
This increases the Win Probability from 71 % to 87 % , for a gain of 16 % .
So , in a WPA system you credit the batter +.16 and debit the pitcher / fielder -.16 .
If you add up every positive and negative event from the beginning to the end of a game , you wind up with a total for the winning team of .5 , and a total for the losing team of -.5 .
And the player with the most points will have contributed the most to his team ’s win .
By the way , that 87 % with runners on first and third in the bottom of the ninth is on the low side for reasons I ’ll discuss in a minute .
If you were to track an entire season in this manner , you would have a Win Contribution metric that is more accurate than Win Shares , because it is based on how much each event actually contributed to the team ’s wins .
In a way , WPA is the ultimate baseball statistic .
And in a way , it is not .
Like Win Shares , WPA is not a good predictive statistic because it ’s not necessarily a good representation of a player ’s true talent .
If a player hits a home run in the ninth inning of a 1 - 0 game , he is credited with more WPA points than if he hits a home run in the first inning of a 1 - 0 game .
The talent is the ability to hit the home run ; when it happens in a game is something that is pretty random .
When you are thinking of acquiring a player for your fantasy team , you should rely more on the traditional sabermetric stats , like Linear Weights , Runs Created , DIPS , etc. etc .
Also , WPA measures the impact of an event while the game is in progress , not after the game is over .
After the game is over , the score is 1 - 0 , and it does n’t matter when the batter hit the home run .
But during the game , it matters a lot .
Good managerial strategies , for instance , are based on an implicit understanding of Win Probabilities .
And if there is such a thing as clutch performance , WPA might unearth it .
The most interesting and useful application of Win Probability Added — the one that Drinen , Tangotiger and others have spent a lot of time on — is the evaluation of relief pitchers and the managers who call on them .
We all know that closers are important , even though they pitch less than 100 innings a year , right ?
Why ?
Because they pitch the most important innings .
Using the WE Finder again , if a pitcher gives up a bases - empty home run in the first inning of a tie game , his team ’s Win Probability decreases about 10 % .
If he does the same thing in the eighth inning , it decreases about 25 % , because his team has less time to come back .
In this context , the eighth inning is about 2.5 times more important than the first inning .
And if you apply this sort of analysis to every appearance made by a relief pitcher , you can quantify the importance of all of his innings pitched .
A Hardball Times Update by Rachael McDaniel Goodbye for now .
Tangotiger developed a system called “ Leveraged Index ” that measures and sums the potential “ Win Probability Added ” for each pitcher ’s appearance .
Doug Drinen tracked a similar measure , called “ P , ” in the Big , Bad Baseball Annual .
Though the math behind each system differs , they are both constructed to measure the importance of relief innings .
You might particularly enjoy Tango ’s Crucial Situations article and chart .
Win Shares , by the way , includes an approximation of WPA for relief pitchers , based on each pitcher ’s saves and holds .
I ’ve been playing with a similar system myself , and I hope to roll out some analysis in the next few weeks .
There are a couple of reasons the Win Expectancy Finder is n’t the best source of Win Probabilities .
First , it ’s based on the years 1979 through 1990 , when there were fewer runs scored per game than in the past few years .
A one - run lead was safer back then .
Also , there are sample size issues with some of the situations .
For instance , there were only 220 games with runners on first and third for the home team in the bottom of the ninth with the score tied .
That ’s not a large enough sample size .
So you should n’t take the numbers in the WE Finder as “ gospel . ”
The better way to develop your Win Probability table is to develop something called “ Markov Chains . ”
I wo n’t go into all the math here ( because I doubt I can really explain it well ) , but suffice to say that a proper Win Probability table is something a good mathematician can concoct , based on the probability of scoring a certain number of runs for each base / out situation .
And there are still a lot of Win Probability issues to be resolved .
For instance , Win Probability tables really should be altered based on the home park .
To track WPA on a regular basis , you need play - by - play data , so you ca n’t create it for most of baseball history .
And Win Probability does n’t solve the sticky issue of splitting credit between pitching and fielding ( something Lonergan and Park admit ) .
Win Probability is a complicated subject , and there ’s so much more I could say .
But I hope this article serves as a good introduction to a topic I plan to return to in the future .

I 've been due for a drug test now for a while , so it 's been about a month for me .
While I 'm doing just fine without , the best way to describe the feeling is that I 'm just a little bored .
I like to smoke , I did it about 4 - 5 times a week on nights and weekends .
The thing that upsets me most is n't the illegality , but the ignorance and consequent societal stigma .
People who do not and have not ever smoked or know anyone who does somehow feel entitled to an opinion they know nothing about .
Every time I tell someone I know that I smoke and see them come to an understanding that pot smokers can be intelligent , motivated , responsible people , I can't help but think of the Old - South racist or small town midwesterner who meets his / her first black or gay friend and suddenly realize they had no idea what they were so upset about .
I hate the stereotype , and every time I disassociate someone from it , it 's my own little political victory .
Another :
I 'm a 30 year old government attorney ( on the civil side ) .
I went to a top 5 law school , and i'm quite well regarded within my agency , but I know I would be fired immediately if my marijuana use became known to my agency ( or if I was arrested - even if the charges were ultimately dismissed ) .
Prohibition has also halted my career path , as numerous government jobs are foreclosed to me because of my marijuana use .
While I could always go into private practice and makes lots of money , I 've never had much interest in that , and always wanted to work for " the good guys " ( at least the people I consider " the good guys " ) .
Many attorneys from my division go to the U.S. Attorney 's Office , and while I 'm fairly confident that they would offer me a job , I also know that I could never take it , because I would be required to undergo a background check where I will be asked about marijuana use .
While I probably could lie and not get caught , if there 's one thing the Martha Stewart prosecution taught me , it 's never lie to a federal agent in the course of an official investigation .
I mean , no job is worth going to jail for - not to mention being a serious violation of my ethical obligations .
It 's actually gotten quite hard responding to questions from colleagues as to why I do n't leave to go to the U.S. Attorney 's Office .
I often think of lame excuses , but wish I could tell them the truth .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
You know what ’s funny about Andy Rooney , the 800 - year - old curmudgeon on CBS ’ 60 Minutes ?
Me neither .
Last week , Rooney brought his cantankerous disposition and lame attempts at humor to the world of travel in a column for Albany ’s Times Union .
In the article , Rooney states that he ’d like to “ mount a campaign once again to encourage people not to go anywhere . ”
Because travel is still “ so expensive , ” Rooney writes , “ people ought to stay home . ”
Actually ,
Andy , travel is probably cheaper than it ’s ever been .
But why clutter your incoherent , off - the - top - of - your - head ramblings with facts ?
“ Is everything done around your house ? ” Rooney asks , wondering why people ca n’t substitute housework for their vacations .
“ If you do n’t like it , sell it , otherwise stick around on vacation and take your pleasure doing the things that need to be done . ”
I could n’t agree more .
Improving your home is basically the most important thing you can do ( anywhere , ever ) , and cleaning your gutters and painting your house is just as satisfying as lazing on some beautiful white - sand beach .
Life is not to be enjoyed !
Check out the rest of Rooney ’s unintentionally hilarious article here .
( HT : World Hum , which calls Rooney ’s article “ the most mailed - in column about travel ever published . ” )
Via Andrew , Lawrence Wilkerson ( Colin Powell 's old chief of staff ) puts Dick Cheney on blast :
Recently , in an attempt to mask some of these failings and to exacerbate and make even more difficult the challenge to the new Obama administration , former Vice President Cheney gave an interview from his home in McLean , Virginia .
The interview was almost mystifying in its twisted logic and terrifying in its fear - mongering ...
But far worse is the unmistakable stoking of the 20 million listeners of Rush Limbaugh , half of whom we could label , judiciously , as half - baked nuts .
Such remarks as those of the former vice president 's are like waving a red flag in front of an incensed bull .
And Cheney of course knows that .
Cheney went on to say in his McLean interview that " Protecting the country 's security is a tough , mean , dirty , nasty business .
These are evil people and we are not going to win this fight by turning the other cheek . "
I have to agree but the other way around .
Cheney and his like are the evil people and we certainly are not going to prevail in the struggle with radical religion if we listen to people such as he .
When -- and if -- the truths about the detainees at Guantanamo Bay will be revealed in the way they should be , or Congress will step up and shoulder some of the blame , or the new Obama administration will have the courage to follow through substantially on its campaign promises with respect to GITMO , torture and the like , remains indeed to be seen .
Three things occurred to me reading this piece .
The first is just how much of piss - poor job journalist have done in interviewing Cheney now that he 's out of office .
I do n't think Jon Stewart is the right model .
I 'm more thinking Terry Gross .
But Dick Cheney would never be interviewed by Terry Gross .
If you want to know why , listen to Gross take on his wife .
The second thing is this -- I 've not written much about investigating the Bush era , mostly because I 've been conflicted .
I do think it 's a political loser , and I 'm also not sure if it would accomplish much .
But watching Cheney , a man who in a country with no democracy , would be Mobutu , demagouging people who are trying to do the hard work of patriotism -- not the sloganeering part , the how do we engage evil without becoming evil part -- is stomach - turing .
Congress if you 're listening -- Air this motherfucker out , please .
Not just to shut him up , but to send a simple message to to all the other swamp gnolls , hoods , hobgoblins and latent Mobutus among us -- Do n't fuck with the Constitution .
The mantra of Gen -Y , is that social media and web 2.0 are synonymous with efficiency .
Anytime an article comes out blaming Gen - Y of wasting time at work on Twitter or Facebook , another article pops up from a Millennial praising the efficiencies of using social media to communicate .
I whole heartedly agree that web 2.0 has provided numerous ways for us streamline our lives – to an extent .
Do n’t hate me .
It was n’t until recently , as more and more people recommended that I join more and more social media sites , and I began working more and more hours at work , that I realized I straight up do n’t have time to balance all of it .
Where ’s all that damned efficiency that everyone ’s been raving about ?
With a handful of social media websites , I can be efficient .
With hoards of them , each offering me unique ways to simplify my life , I find myself bogged down .
I ’m being bludgeoned with promises of efficiency .
This reminds me of a Robin Williams quote from his infamous Live On Broadway performance where he talks about a similar problems with pharmaceutical drugs .
There a drug for this and that , but why ca n’t there just be one wonder drug ?
( CNN ) -- Father Alberto Cutie , an internationally known Catholic priest who admitted having a romantic affair and breaking his vow of celibacy , is joining the Episcopal Church to be with the woman he loves , he said Thursday .
Father Alberto Cutie will deliver a sermon Sunday at a Florida Episcopal Church .
" I will always love the Catholic Church and all its members , " he said at a news conference .
" But I want to start today by going into a new family .
" Here before this community where I have chosen to serve and where I live , I am going to continue to proclaim the word of God and my love for God , " Cutie said .
Cutie ( pronounced koo - tee - AY ) was received into the Episcopal Church earlier Thursday at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Miami , Florida .
He will pursue the priesthood in the Episcopalian faith , the Episcopal Diocese of Southeast Florida said in a written statement .
It was not immediately clear how long the process would take .
John C. Favalora , archbishop of the Catholic Church 's Miami archdiocese , where Cutie served , said he was " deeply disappointed " by the news .
" Father Cutie 's actions have caused grave scandal within the Catholic Church , harmed the Archdiocese of Miami -- especially our priests -- and led to division within the ecumenical community and the community at large , " Favalora said in a written statement .
" Today 's announcement only deepens those wounds . "
Cutie -- sometimes called " Father Oprah " because of the advice he 's given in Spanish - language media -- shocked the Catholic community when photographs of him embracing a bathing - suit - clad woman emerged this month in the pages of TV Notas magazine .
The Cuban - American priest admitted having a two - year relationship with the woman , a long - time friend .
She has not been publicly identified .
" This is something I 've struggled with , " he said this month .
" I do n't support the breaking of the celibacy promise . "
Of his relationship with the woman , he said , " Through the photos , it looked like a frivolous thing on the beach , you know , and that 's not what it is .
It 's something deeper than that . "
After the photographs surfaced , Cutie was removed from his duties at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace Networks .
In Thursday 's statement , Favalora said that , in the eyes of the Catholic church , Cutie now has the worst of both worlds :
He may no longer perform a priest 's sacraments and any mass he might perform would be " invalid , " but he must abide by his vow of celibacy .
" Father Cutie is still bound by his promise to live a celibate life , which he freely embraced at ordination , " Favalora said .
" Only the Holy Father can release him from that obligation . "
He had been president and general director of Pax Catholic Communications , home of Radio Paz and Radio Peace .
In addition to his television and radio appearances , Cutie has written newspaper advice columns and a self - help book , " Real Life , Real Love . "
The Episcopal Diocese of Southeast Florida said Cutie will deliver a sermon Sunday at a church that diocese leaders are looking to restore : the Church of the Resurrection in Biscayne Park .
Cutie will be a part of this effort to revitalize this church and others , the diocese said .
Cutie was the first Catholic priest to host a daily talk show on a major secular television network , according to his information on the Linked In online professional network .
Favalora also had harsh words for the Episcopal church 's decision to accept Cutie .
" This truly is a serious setback for ecumenical relations and cooperation between us , " he said .

University of Washington in Seattle operating a network of lightning location sensors at VLF ( 3 - 30 kHz ) .
Most ground - based observations in the VLF band are dominated by impulsive signals from lightning discharges called “ sferics ” .
Significant radiated electromagnetic power exists from a few hertz to several hundred megahertz , with the bulk of the energy radiated at VLF .
With our network of sferic sensors we are producing regular maps of lightning activity over the entire Earth .
Our map showing the entire world uses coloured spots to indicate lightning strokes ( red stars inside an open circle are active WWLLN lightning sensor locations ) .
Click on the map for explanation .
The WWLLN Management Team , lead by Prof Robert Holzworth of the University of Washington produced these data and images with the cooperation of the universities and institutes which host the stations as listed below .
Wideband VLF spectrograms from all WWLLN stations are available this link or by clicking on the station name below .
We currently have over 70 sensors around the globe to detect sferic activity in the VLF band , listed below in the order of their establishment :
How it works
We welcome offers of hosting a new WWLLN sensor to add to the list above .
All hosts receive all the world - wide data for their own research on monthly CDs .
In return , each host provides the computer and meets any local expenses like power , Internet , and maintenance .
However , do not think that a sensor on your own campus is going to give you lightning location data on its own .
Only the whole network does that .
Each lightning stroke location requires the time of group arrival ( TOGA ) from a least 5 WWLLN sensors .
These sensors may be several thousand km distant from the stroke .
The geographical arrangement of the sensors is important : a lightning stroke which is enclosed by sensors is much more accurately located than one which is not so enclosed .
Clearly a uniform spacing of sensors around the Earth is the ideal .
Since the Earth is round , there are no edges : every lightning stroke is surrounded by sensors , but not necessarily by the sensors which sense it .
Typically only about 15 to 30 % of strokes detected by one sensor are detected by 5 or more .
These strokes are usually the stronger ones .
Recent research indicates our detection efficiency for strokes about 30 kA is approximately 30 % globally .
To cover the whole world by sensors spaced uniformly about 1000 km apart would require roughly 500 sensors .
If spaced 3000 km apart , we would need “ only ” around 50 to 60 sensors .
Presently we have 40 WWLLN sensors , and we are in the process of expanding to 60 sensors within the next year or two .

At last it can be told .
The news has finally been made public , so I 'm finally free to whoop and holler and share the great news -- the HBO pilot of A GAME OF THRONES will start filming in October , in Northern Ireland .
The announcement was made in Belfast .
Here you go :
Yes , I 'm thrilled .
Ireland should be a great place to film .
And the facility we 'll be using , the Paint Hall , is amazing as well : Before it was a film studio , the Paint Hall was part of Belfast 's famous Harland & Wolff Shipyards , where the TITANIC and many other ships were constructed .
The facility is pretty titanic as well .
Of course , all of us connected with A GAME OF THRONES are hoping we 'll fare somewhat better on our own maiden voyage .
Yes , Parris and I will be going over to Ireland this fall to see at least part of the filming .
Not for the whole shoot , alas , I do n't have time for that ... but we have to be there for at least part of it .
Maybe we 'll see some of you in a Belfast pub .
There 's lots of other exciting news on the pilot as well , but nothing I can share .
Sorry , lips are sealed .
You 'll have to wait for Mr. Benioff and Mr. Weiss ... and HBO .

I was riding the escalator from the Chuo line platform down into the main concourse of Tokyo station .
The escalators criss cross in the typical way that allows you to see people on the opposite escalator .
Right as I passed it I saw another foreigner — a gaijin .
As we passed he smiled and nodded at me in recognition .
I could n’t help but to involuntarily smirk before I realized the absurdity of doing so .
I ’m not antisocial or mean but I do n’t see why strange gaijin are so eager to be so familiar with me .
It seems that something strange happens when a small group of foreigners is put in a place where they are very easily apparent to one another ( Japan being populated with black - haired Asian people , brown haired whities tend to stick out ) .
On more than one occasion I was walking through a busy train station — let it be Shinjuku or Tokyo , whatever — and I spotted another gaijin , always white , and unwittingly made brief eye contact .
If this ever happens back home or any place where there is an abundance of white people , there is no effect .
But in Japan this brief recognition of a fellow foreigner gets me a nod or a smile or even a –sup .
This is so fucking weird .
I do n’t know these people and where do they get the notion that we are in some elite club of honkies carousing around Tokyo giving each other secret handshakes ?
Clearly I ’m offended .
But that brings me to another interesting phenomenon among some gaijin in Japan : hatred of other gaijin .
For some reason I relish in the fact that I ’m here , and I want nothing more than to be one of a select few foreigners in Tokyo so that I may be a wonderful and unique snowflake to which everyone Japanese can desperately flock .
Why is this ?
Because I was a loser back home and I have a fleeting chance to be the cool center of attention .
It ’s pathetic , I know .
The thing is I ’ve spoken with many foreigners who share this odd sentiment .
I hope we ’re not all pathological narcissists but rather this is some psychological effect of being an obvious expatriate in a foreign country , particularly a nation which tends to glorify western ( especially American ) culture .
Though I sound like a complete asshole , I ’m actually very cordial when I meet other foreigners and usually return their acknowledgements rather warmly .
As for desiring to be the only foreigner in all of Japan and enviously resenting other foreigners — in truth most of my friends are not Japanese ( though I really want to befriend more locals to practice speaking but all I do is work and work is populated with English speaking gaijin ) .
Maybe that ’s the source of my frustrations .
I came here to be friends with Nihonjin and to speak Nipponese with them , but instead I ’m friends with a bunch of fucking Americans .
At least the mainland Europeans I ’m friends with are a step in the right direction .
The fortunate thing is , despite not achieving the cultural exchange I ’d like , I do really like the expatriates I ’ve met .
They ’re an eccentric and charming bunch of rejects and fuck - ups .
I love ‘em .
Would you be interested in seeing some twenty thousand pages of Kurosawa ’s screenplays , photos , storyboards , drawings , notes , newspaper clippings , personal scribblings and other materials ?
If yes , head to the Akira Kurosawa Digital Archive , just opened by Kyoto ’s Ryukoku University in collaboration with Kurosawa Production .
I do n’t think that I am exaggerating if I say that this is probably the most important release of Kurosawa archive material ever .
There just is so much of it !
Want to read some production notes on The Idiot ?
Here you go , 16 pages , hand - written .
The script for The Quiet Duel ?
Sure , take a look .
Want to know what the Film Daily thought about Yojimbo in 1962 ?
Well , apparently it has satire and sophistication .
More of a visual type ?
No worries , may I interest you in some drawings for Rhapsody in August or posters for Dodesukaden ?
Production stills from Seven Samurai ?
Or are you more into Kurosawa as a person ?
Take a look at his travel photos from , say , Rome , New York (? ) or London .
Or how about some golf ?
Or , if you are a more hard - core researcher , take a look for instance at the almost 100 pages of notes for The Sea is Watching , or Kurosawa ’s notes for his autobiography .
I feel that I could go on forever .
The website and most of the material is in Japanese , so those with no command of the language may find it slightly difficult to navigate around , but I ’m sure that you ’ll get the hang of it .
The material is arranged into folders and subfolders , accessible from the left - hand menu .
It helps if you are at least able to recognize the film names in Japanese .
Note also that it may take a while for the images to load , as they are really good scans , some taking hundreds of megabytes as they are presented with incredible detail .
( Thanks to the zoom system , you do n’t actually need to load the whole image in one go , though . )
Even if the scans are not dated or tagged ( edit : they actually are — each picture has this information in the “ metadata ” section ) , the search does n’t seem to function perfectly , and some fairly obvious material is missing ( probably due to copyright restrictions ) , this is an absolute treasure trove .
Jump in , take a look , and post your findings in the comments !
Happy hunting !
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President Obama on Monday spelled out his proposals to close corporate tax loopholes on U.S. multinational corporations and crack down on overseas tax havens .
The goal is to help create new jobs in the United States and make the tax code fairer .
All told , the administration said the changes would raise $ 210 billion in tax revenue over 10 years .
" I want to see our companies remain the most competitive in the world .
But the way to make sure that happens is not to reward our companies for moving jobs off our shores or transferring profits to overseas tax havens , " Obama said in a White House announcement .
But tax policy experts and corporate lobbyists say such measures , unless accompanied by a reduction in the corporate tax rate , will push more companies to move their operations -- and jobs -- overseas to more tax friendly countries .
The White House and Treasury Department laid out three proposals , some of which would require congressional approval to take effect , that they say will eliminate the current tax advantages U.S. - based multinationals get for investing and creating jobs abroad .
Tax deferral rules :
Among the legislative proposals is a plan to reform the " deferral " rule , which lets U.S. - based multinationals deduct expenses for overseas operations , but defer paying income tax on the profits from those operations .
That gets paid only if and when companies bring that money back to the United States .
The administration proposed that the companies must also defer taking their deductions until their overseas profits are brought back to the country .
It estimates the change would raise $ 60.1 billion in revenue over 10 years .
R&D credit : Obama also proposed a tax cut for companies that do their research and development in the United States .
This would be accomplished through making permanent a " research and experimentation " credit that already exists and would be cost $ 74.5 billion in tax revenue over 10 years .
Companies will welcome the prospect of the credit being made permanent , said Clint Stretch , managing principal for tax policy at Deloitte Tax , whose clients use the tax breaks at issue .
But no one expected it would ever disappear .
The current R&D credit is set to expire at the end of 2009 , but lawmakers temporarily extend the credit every year .
As a result , the net effect of the deferral and R&D proposals is a $ 60 billion tax increase on U.S. - based business , Stretch said .
" That 's like saying I 'm going to cut off your right arm but I 'm going to let you keep your driver 's license .
No one expected the R&D credit to go away , " he said .
Foreign tax credit :
The administration also wants to make it harder for companies to " abuse the foreign tax credit .
Currently companies may claim a credit against their U.S. income taxes for taxes they paid to another country .
Amending that rule would raise an estimated $ 43 billion over 10 years , according to the administration .
' Disappearing ' offshore subsidiaries :
One change the administration proposed on Monday that can be made without congressional approval is a regulatory change in the way the IRS handles so - called " check the box " rules .
Those rules currently let companies shift income from one foreign subsidiary to another in a tax haven , thereby escaping taxation .
Obama would require some foreign subsidiaries to be treated as separate corporations for U.S. tax purposes .
The administration estimates the change could raise $ 86.5 billion over 10 years .
Now on to Capitol Hill
The proposed changes to the deferral and foreign tax credit rules will make for a tough sell to the business community .
" These are n't loopholes .
These were put into the code with full knowledge and full discussion , " said U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief economist Martin Regalia .
" This is only about raising more money -- it 's not about making the tax code simpler or more efficient or easier or anything else . "
On Capitol Hill , Republicans are all but certain to reject the proposal , but Democratic support is far from a lock , Stretch said .
One key player in that fight will be Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D - Mont .
In a statement Monday , he said his committee is already working on similar proposals , such as clamping down on offshore tax havens .
But , Baucus added , " further study is needed to assess the impact of this plan on U.S. businesses . "
Another pivotal player will be House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel , D - N.Y. , who put forth a number of similar international tax reform proposals in 2007 .
" I applaud President Obama 's commitment to simplifying our tax code and look forward to working with the administration to close these loopholes , " Rangel said in a statement .
Proponents of these kinds of corporate tax changes had also been expecting that the top U.S. corporate tax rate would be reduced .
Most other countries have lower corporate tax rates .
The deferral and foreign tax credit changes alone are more likely to discourage companies from investing in the United States , Stretch said .
But a simultaneous reduction in the corporate rate , he added , would have a better shot at creating jobs here because there would n't be such a stark advantage to moving operations to more tax - friendly countries .

フルスクラッチっていうのは、既存のOSの上に書くとかでは無くて、言ってしまえばOSから作った様なものです。
結果から言うと 、Webブラウザでアクセスすると苺ましまろのリンクが出るとかっていう程度のものは作れました。
3-wayhandshake出来ますし、FINも裁けます。まぁ" 何とか動く "
程度にして満足したので止めましたけど...
今度の自分の為のメモとして。もしかしたら他の人の参考に成るかも。
何故そんな事をしたのか ?
まず、先日のエントリにも書いた通りだが圧倒的にやる事が無かったから。虚しい毎日。これはWebサーバを書く事で解消されるに違いないとかっていう事では無くてですね。
こうカーネルとのオーバーヘッドがどうこうで、どの処理をするのにどのシステムコールを使って云々。
スレッドとイベントはどうこうで、たくさん過ぎるetcetc
皆さん大変だなーと。でもまぁ用途が決まってるんだったらKernelの上でWebサーバ書くんじゃなくて、Kernelと結合した様なのを作れば良いんじゃないでしょうか、と思ったのでやってみたまで、です。
本当は既存 のWebサーバをけちょんけちょんにするような性能が出せると良かったのですが色々としんどく成って来たので、今回はここでおしまい。
何をどうしたの ?
OS ごと作ったと述べましたが、その前に開発を行った環境を述べたり。
私は現 在Leopardを使っているのですが、こいつの上であんまり良く無い事をすると大変良く無いというのと、どうもTAPを作るのは良いもののbridgeの仕方が分からんので、とか色々あってVirtualBoxにUbuntuを入れて開発していました。
作った物を動かすの はBochsとQEMUで。前半本当にOSっぽい事をやる(割り込みをどうたらとか)あたりはbochsをdebuggerとして活用しました。
本当にBochsは良いものです。でBochsでなんか上手く行かない所が出て来たので途中からQEMUにシフトしました。
さて、今回は直 にNICを叩く必要があったのですが、これからの事も考えるとISAなNICをやる価値も見いだせなかったので、PCIなNICを叩きました。BochsとQEMUでは運良くも...というかNE2000系のPCIなNICであるRTL8029ASをサポートしているので、思いっきりこいつを使いました。
紆余曲折を経て、イーサフレームを吐き出せる様になって、パケットキャプチャツールで自作OSというかWebServerから吐かれたARPを見たのが書き始めて1週間経った時点でした。
まぁWebServerを書きたいので、それだけを狙うならば本来IPv4とTCPを実装すれば良かっただけなのですが、折角なのでICMPとUDPも実装してみました、という話です。
まぁプロトコルスタックを大体書いたとかそれぐらいですか。
ちなみに生まれて初めてプロトコルスタックを書きました。しかもその下で動いてるのが自作のNICドライバってんだから中々面白いものですね。
苦労した点 まず、何も無 いCを使ったので、ただでさえC++に比べるとライブラリ的な意味でアレなCが更にアレでした。
データ構造と言えばあるものは配列とstructのみ、今回はprocessを作ったりするのも面倒臭かったので、Single Process Event - Driven OS + Web Serverという事にしました。
Single Processというのは文字通り、1つのプロセスがCPUを独占します。Event-Drivenなのはどこかというと、NICの割り込みです。
NIC 実装の戦略としては割り込みとポーリングがあります。ですが今回は１つのプロセス( Webサーバ ) しか無い訳なのでポーリングするのはあまりに賢く無いのと、やりづらい。
主な戦略としては、TaskQueueというのを勝手に考えて使いました。
NICの割り込みハンドラ がTaskQueueに受信したフレームを処理する様な関数をぶち込みます。でメインループはひたすらTaskQueueからpopしてその関数を実行するわけです。まぁ妥当なモデルかなと。
ここで問題なのが 、IPv4を使って送る時に、宛先IPアドレスが同一サブネット内(ちなみにDHCPは実装していないのでこれはハードコーディングですwww)にあるがARPCacheには無い...!!という状況でARPを打った後にこのIPv4を送り出す関数" 自身"
をTaskQueueに入れたいというシーンが出ました。
もともと 、TaskQueueはvoid ( * func ) ( ) というまぁこれで良いだろうという関数ホルダだったわけですが、このIPv4を送り出す関数の引数がvoidではないとかで、コレは困ったなぁという状況になったり。
その時思いついたのが、自分自身をTaskQueueに入れるこいつは、適切な引数を知っている(当然の話です)のだから、それを使ってカリー化してvoid ( * func ) ( ) にしちまえば良いんじゃないかとか思ったのですが、gccのスタックの扱いが可変なのでそれはまぁ無理だなーとかいう事で、void ( * func ) ( void*) を使い、自分で疑似スタックを(void*)として引数にぶち込んでそれを後で復元させるという手法を使いました。
詳しく書くと void wrap_transIP ( void * pointer ) { transIP ( tbi , dstip , tos , flag ) ; } int transIP ( struct TRANS_BUF_INFO tbi , uint32_t dstip , uint8 _t tos , int flag ) {
宛先IPアドレスがARPCacheに無い場合、ARPを打った後に 自分自身をTaskQueueに入れる。 もしARPをこの関数の中で打って、 forループ でCacheに入るのをポーリングする場合 そもそもSingle-ProcessなのでNICがTaskQueueにpushする イベントハンドラが " 実行 " されない => ARPCacheが更新されない よって無限ループ } とまぁこういう訳です 。
Stackともっと親和性が高いようなCはあばばという話はまた別で。
ちなみにC言語でカリー化しようと固執していたのはこの記事のおかげです。http://nicosia.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pub/essay/hagiya/h/curry
後もう１つ。それはエンディアンのお話です。
今回x86系をBochs/QEMUで使ったので、ネットワークエンディアンにし忘れるというミスを何度もしてしまいました。
こうこういうのでは幽霊型とか...別に幽霊型とかじゃなくてエンディアンを型(とかメタ情報)として押し込む事が出来ればなーとか思ったんですが、C言語は型はあってもなくても...という感じなのでしょうがないですね。
C言語について思った事 Cが素晴らしいのは、メモリをこねくり回すのが非常に得意という事です。得意というか、静的型付けではやりにくい事を動的型付けで出来る時と同じような感触があります。ありますというか再認識しました。いや、もしかしたら初認識かも。
void *( じゃなくても良いですが)に押し込んで、復元するのはカリー化よりもあんま良さげでは無いので悔しかったのですが、まぁ満足は出来ました。
まぁ結局はメモリだろう ...と。
後はやっぱりまぁこいつはスタックがついて回るのに、某アセンブリ言語さんとかと比べるとスタックとの親和性は良く無いよなーという。アセンブリではスタックはfirst class object ( ? ) なのにうん。
それとまぁ 、Functional Oriented なCを作るとかいう事に成ってくると、C++とかCmm(C--)とかCωとかC#は取られてるので、Cx(Cダブルシャープ)とかに成るんでしょうかねぇ・・・という。

後苺ましまろ6巻は2/27に発売するらしいので、生きてて良かったです。
Now I do n't know why I watch The View , I think I just enjoy a good dose of anger around 11 AM on weekdays , but Elisabeth never disappoints .
She really is just like her SNL character , it seems like she prints off her " facts " from RW sites and then presents whatever is on those sheets as the truth , when they are n't .
There is no evidence that Pelosi is lying about anything .
Indeed , more people are inclined to believe she is telling the truth than the CIA .
Gotta love Elisabeth's " concern " about Pelosi who could n't have stopped the Bush / Cheney torture train back then even if she DID know what they were doing .
BTW , my favorite part was when he shut her down for trying to use " enhanced interrogation " instead of " torture " and called it " Dick Cheney changing a word " and that " he made it up to cover his ass " ~lol ~
I do agree that Democrats AND Republicans were involved in the methods that were used , but I do n't really think that 's why Obama is washing his hands of it right now .
Here 's a description of the exchange from the Huffington Post ( Sorry , I ca n't find an actual transcript ) :
The exchange was good - natured and lively , with Ventura asking some leading rhetorical questions before making a few rather provocative political points .
" If waterboarding is OK , why do n't we let our police do it to suspects so they can learn what they know ? " he asked .
" If waterboarding is OK , why did n't we waterboard [ Timothy ] McVeigh and Nichols , the Oklahoma City bombers , to find out if there were more people involved ? ...
We only seem to waterboard Muslims ...
Have we waterboarded anyone else ?
Name me someone else who has been waterboarded . "
Hasselbeck , for her part , tried to pin the debate on Nancy Pelosi , whom she accused of lying about what and when she knew of the use of enhanced interrogation techniques .
" What do you think about Nancy Pelosi in terms of what she 's claiming with the CIA lying ? " she asked , to begin the segment .
" I think what 's worse is the fact that it happened , " replied Ventura .
" If we had n't waterboarded to begin with , none of this would be a controversy , would it ?
Torture is torture .
If you 're going to be a country that follows the rule of law , which we are , torture is illegal . "
This is just plain pathetic :
" The View 's " Elizabeth Hasselbeck joked that Nancy Pelosi should undergo enhanced interrogation on Fox News ' " Huckabee " this past Saturday .
It 's certainly disappointing , I think to try to diminish or intelligence agencies ...
And you know whether she 's lying or not - I do n't know .
Maybe she needs to a little enhanced interrogation to figure it out ...
I 'm just throwing it out there !
The former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee got a kick out of Hasselbeck 's suggestion .
Video at the link .
I bet she thought that was a witty comment .
Stay Classy " GOP "
( h/t to msmacgyver and Blue Sue )
Since the late 19th Century , the very rich have been paying people to demand less government .
The work of Herbert Spencer , for example , was sponsored by Andrew Carnegie , John D Rockefeller and Thomas Edison ( 1 ) .
Spencer believed that society changed according to evolutionary laws .
Humans were evolving towards perfection , but this process was inhibited by interference from the state .
By protecting people from the consequences of their own actions ( or their own bad luck ) , it stopped the winnowing process which would otherwise result in the survival of the fittest .
Social security , publicly - funded education , compulsory vaccination , laws enforcing safety at work all interrupted social evolution .
But a self - regulated free market would swiftly ensure that those who were best - adapted would survive and triumph .
It ’s not hard to see why the millionaires loved him .
They saw themselves as winners of the evolutionary race , taking their rightful place at the pinnacle of the social order .
Any attempt to limit their freedoms would prevent society from achieving perfection .
Today , sponsorship by millionaires and corporations explains why free market thinktanks outnumber and outspend the thinktanks arguing for public services and the distribution of wealth .
Or so I guess .
But their absence of accountability means that guesswork is all we ’ve got .
As I showed last month , only one of the rightwing thinktanks I contacted was prepared to reveal who funded it ( 2 ) .
All the others refused on the grounds that they had to respect the privacy of their donors .
These organisations exert great influence in public life .
But we have no means of discovering on whose behalf they do it .
Revelations about this secret funding network have now brought down a cabinet minister .
Liam
Fox was enmeshed in a web of corporate influence about which we still know little .
The organisation he founded , Atlantic Bridge , was registered with the Charity Commission as a thinktank * ( 3 ) .
Like many others , it looked more like a lobbying outfit , demanding privatisation , deregulation and tax cuts .
The key question remains unanswered : who funded it ?
As a result of better transparency laws in the US , we know more about Atlantic Bridge ’s partner organisation , the American Legislative Exchange Council .
It claims , like most thinktanks , to stand for limited government and free markets .
What this means in practice is lobbying against government action such as regulating tobacco and greenhouse gases ( 4 ) .
By an astonishing coincidence , it turns out to have been funded by the tobacco companies Altria and Reynolds American , by the oil giant Exxon and by the billionaire Koch brothers , who run a fossil fuel and chemicals empire they call “ the biggest company you ’ve never heard of . ” *( 5,6 )
Freedom is what all these groups claim to stand for .
But the freedom they promote is of a particular kind .
They are not campaigning for freedom from hunger or poverty .
They are not demanding free access to health and education .
They are not lobbying for freedom from industrial injuries , exploitation , pollution or unscrupulous banking .
When these libertarians say freedom , they mean freedom from the rules which prevent their sponsors behaving as they wish : mistreating their workers , threatening public health and using the planet as their dustbin .
Like everything else about these lobbyists , the true , unacceptable meaning of the freedom they espouse is hidden behind an acceptable front .
Thinktanks and lobby groups are the bane of democratic politics .
They are the means by which corporations and the ultra- rich influence public life without having to reveal their hand .
Their refusal to reveal who funds them , and the British state ’s failure to demand it , are deeply undemocratic .
Last week in the Guardian , Michael White wondered why Liam Fox did not make his friend Adam Werrity an officially - sanctioned special adviser ( 7 ) .
Had he done so , Werrity ’s presence in his department would not have broken civil service rules , and Fox might still be in his post .
But it would also have meant that Werrity ’s activities would have been subject to Freedom of Information requests , and that could have been fatal to what he was doing .
What this case highlights is the asymmetry of information in public life .
The public sector is now so transparent that we have a right to read the private emails of climate scientists working for a state - sponsored university .
The private sector is so opaque that we have no idea on whose behalf the people who appear every day on the BBC , using arguments that look suspiciously like corporate propaganda , are speaking .
The Labour government weakened the rules on lobbying transparency .
The ministerial code published in 2007 dropped the requirement that meetings between ministers and lobbyists should be recorded ( 8 ) .
It also rebuffed MPs ’ demands for a register of lobbyists .
You ’ll be surprised to hear who the villain was : Tom Watson , then a Cabinet Office minister , now a heroic campaigner for corporate accountability .
He brushed aside the call for a register with the claim that “ we have a pretty good system in the UK . ” ( 9 ) In fact we have no system at all : the Commons Public Administration Committee has pointed out that “ lobbying activity in the United Kingdom is subject to no specific external regulation . ” ( 10 )
Thanks to the Fox scandal , the coalition government will now be forced , at last , to do something .
But unless new legislation also applies to the thinktanks , their funders will keep using them to promote their interests without disclosure .
The law should insist that all organisations which seek to influence public opinion should reveal sources of funding greater than £ 1000 .
The government might also take a look at charity law .
It seems remarkable to me that groups like Policy Exchange , the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Global Warming Policy Foundation have charitable status .
The Charity Commission disqualified Atlantic Bridge on the grounds that “ it is not permissible for a charity to promote a particular pre-determined point of view . ” ( 11 ) Should this not disqualify all of them ?
Can you imagine the IEA deciding that private companies should get their noses out of the NHS ?
Can you picture Lord Lawson ’s Global Warming Policy Foundation announcing that climate change is an urgent threat and fossil fuel companies need stricter regulation ?
Is it credible that these organisations do not have “ a particular pre-determined point of view ” ?
And should n’t it be a basic requirement of charity law that we know who , as taxpayers , we are subsidising ?
How can an organisation qualify as a charity if we do n’t even know whose interests it is promoting ?
I strongly suspect that we are granting tax breaks to multi-millionaires and corporations to help them change public opinion .
I invite the thinktanks to prove me wrong .
Let ’s also demand that the BBC reform its editorial guidelines , so that no one working for a group whose purpose is public advocacy can take part in a programme unless it has published a registry of interests .
Otherwise the BBC is granting free airtime to corporations without disclosing who they are or what their interest in the question might be .
So come on you free - market libertarians , let ’s hear your arguments against transparency and accountability .
And let ’s hear how you reconcile them with your professed love of freedom .

TMZ has learned that a paparazzo was arrested in Malibu Thursday after allegedly jumping the fence at a daycare center that Maddox was attending .
Sources tell us that Clint Brewer jumped the fence just before 10:30 a.m. , shortly after Pitt dropped the child off .
We 're told staff from the daycare center made a citizen 's arrest for trespassing .
The Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department dispatched deputies and took Brewer , 25 , to the Lost Hills station , where he is being held on $ 1,000 bail .
The famous family returned to Malibu two weeks ago from Namibia after the birth of the couple 's daughter , Shiloh .
Since then , the paparazzi has overtaken the area .
When Angelina took the baby to a home in Beverly Hills recently , paparazzi were hanging in trees , trying to get a shot .
We 're told 4 - year - old Maddox Jolie - Pitt was never in danger .
Pitt 's security chief , Rich Malchar , issued this statement : " School officials and myself feel that some of these paparazzi are like predators who will recklessly take and sell photos of innocent children for money . "
