File this one under " best minute of viral marketing ever . "
A video surfaced on YouTube today called Naked Girls Get Interrupted .
It stars four attractive ladies -- and a funny but unfortunate " interruption " from actor - model " Music Steve " -- stripping off their clothes and strutting down a street in Los Angeles County .
Censor bars obscure their private parts and display popular song titles .
Surely this is n't what Kurt Cobain had in mind when he wrote " Smells Like Teen Spirit . "
It 's hard to look past the action in foreground , but after repeated viewings ( all in the name of reporting ) , we believe they 're walking down the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica .
The editors of the professional - looking video are n't saying who 's behind it .
The minute - long clip was posted to a new YouTube channel called Windsieve .
All signs point to a viral marketing campaign for the upcoming " Guitar Hero 5 " video game .
The song titles shown in the video are all performed by bands that are listed on the game 's featured artists page , and game publisher Activision is no stranger to viral ads .
Dear Activision , we look forward to learning more about songs in the game by staring at partially naked women .
Although perhaps it should have been given a different name : " Things people who play countless hours of Guitar Hero will never witness . "
A track listing with songs from the video , courtesy of GameDaily , is listed after the jump .
Drugs raids could be making street drugs cheaper ( Image : Tim Sloan / AFP / Getty Images )
TOUGH policing of the illegal drugs market may have the perverse effect of making drugs more affordable and thereby encouraging people to use them , according to a new model of the dynamics of this market .
Its creators , a team of economists led by Manolis Galenianos of Pennsylvania State University in University Park , stop short of calling for police to soften their approach because this would also have adverse consequences .
But for law enforcers whose aim is to discourage drug use , the findings hint that tough policing alone …
However , one man in Switzerland had to beg police to help him find his automobile when he got too drunk to remember where he ’d parked it .
All that Ali Richard Ganzer could remember after his booze binge was that he parked it somewhere in Rapperswil , Switzerland reported the Austrian Times .
Unfortunately for him , the police told him they could only look for his car if it was reported stolen .
The most violent country in Europe : Britain is also worse than South Africa and U.S .
Britain 's violent crime record is worse than any other country in the European union , it has been revealed .
Official crime figures show the UK also has a worse rate for all types of violence than the U.S. and even South Africa - widely considered one of the world 's most dangerous countries .
The figures comes on the day new Home Secretary Alan Johnson makes his first major speech on crime , promising to be tough on loutish behaviour .
Britain has an even worse violence rate than South Africa ( file picture )
The Tories said Labour had presided over a decade of spiralling violence .
In the decade following the party 's election in 1997 , the number of recorded violent attacks soared by 77 per cent to 1.158 million - or more than two every minute .
The figures , compiled from reports released by the European Commission and United Nations , also show :
The UK has the second highest overall crime rate in the EU .
It has a higher homicide rate than most of our western European neighbours , including France , Germany , Italy and Spain .
The UK has the fifth highest robbery rate in the EU .
It has the fourth highest burglary rate and the highest absolute number of burglaries in the EU , with double the number of offences than recorded in Germany and France .
But it is the naming of Britain as the most violent country in the EU that is most shocking .
The analysis is based on the number of crimes per 100,000 residents .
In the UK , there are 2,034 offences per 100,000 people , way ahead of second - placed Austria with a rate of 1,677 .
The U.S. has a violence rate of 466 crimes per 100,000 residents , Canada 935 , Australia 92 and South Africa 1,609 .
Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling said : ' This is a damning indictment of this government 's comprehensive failure over more than a decade to tackle the deep rooted social problems in our society , and the knock on effect on crime and anti-social behaviour .
' We 're now on our fourth Home Secretary this parliament , and all we are getting is a rehash of old initiatives that did n't work the first time round .
More than ever Britain needs a change of direction . '
The figures , compiled by the Tories , are considered the most accurate and up - to - date available .
But criminologists say crime figures can be affected by many factors , including different criminal justice systems and differences in how crime is reported and measured .
New Home Secretary Alan Johnson is to make his first major speech on crime today
In Britain , an affray is considered a violent crime , while in other countries it will only be logged if a person is physically injured .
There are also degrees of violence .
While the UK ranks above South Africa for all violent crime , South Africans suffer more than 20,000 murders each year - compared with Britain 's 921 in 2007 .
Experts say there are a number of reasons why violence is soaring in the UK .
These include Labour 's decision to relax the licensing laws to allow round - the - clock opening , which has led to a rise in the number of serious assaults taking place in the early hours of the morning .
But Police Minister David Hanson said : ' These figures are misleading .
Levels of police recorded crime statistics from different countries are simply not comparable since they are affected by many factors , for example the recording of violent crime in other countries may not include behaviour that we would categorise as violent crime .
' Violent crime in England and Wales has fallen by almost a half a peak in 1995 but we are not complacent and know there is still work to do .
That is why last year we published ' Saving lives .
Reducing harm .
Protecting the public .
An Action Plan for Tackling Violence 2008 - 11 ' . '
The timing of the Europe - wide violence figures is a blow for Mr Johnson , who will today seek to reassert Labour 's law and order credentials .
In his first major speech on crime since becoming Home Secretary , Mr Johnson is expected to promise a concerted crack down on antisocial behaviour .
He wants to set up a website to allow the public to see what is taking place in their neighbourhood , such as the number of louts who have been served with Asbos .
Mr Johnson is also known to support early intervention to stop children going off the rails .

Tomatoes are a rich source of lycopene Scientists say a natural supplement made from tomatoes , taken daily , can stave off heart disease and strokes .
The tomato pill contains an active ingredient from the Mediterranean diet - lycopene - that blocks " bad " LDL cholesterol that can clog the arteries .
Ateronon , made by a biotechnology spin- out company of Cambridge University , is being launched as a dietary supplement and will be sold on the high street .
Experts said more trials were needed to see how effective the treatment is .
Preliminary trials involving around 150 people with heart disease indicate that Ateronon can reduce the oxidation of harmful fats in the blood to almost zero within eight weeks , a meeting of the British Cardiovascular Society will be told at Ateronon 's launch on Monday .
Our advice to heart disease patients or those at high risk is to rely on proven medications prescribed by their doctor , and aim to get the benefits of a Mediterranean diet by eating plenty of fresh fruit and veg
Professor Peter Weissberg of the British Heart Foundation Neuroscientist Peter Kirkpatrick , who will lead a further research project at Addenbrooke 's Hospital in Cambridge on behalf of Cambridge Theranostics Ltd , said the supplement could be much more effective than statin drugs that are currently used by doctors to treat high cholesterol .
But Professor Peter Weissberg of the British Heart Foundation said : " As always , we caution people to wait for any new drug or modified ' natural ' product to be clinically proven to offer benefits before taking it .
" It will take some time , and several clinical trials , to provide such evidence for Ateronon .
" In the meantime , our advice to heart disease patients or those at high risk is to rely on proven medications prescribed by their doctor , and aim to get the benefits of a Mediterranean diet by eating plenty of fresh fruit and veg . "
He said the British Heart Foundation had supported some of the basic science at Cambridge University underpinning the development of the product .
Professor Anthony Leeds , trustee of the cholesterol charity Heart UK , said : " The new lycopene product Ateronon represents an entirely new approach to the treatment of high blood cholesterol and opens up the exciting possibility . "
He said the preliminary findings were " very promising " .
Lycopene is an antioxidant contained in the skin of tomatoes which gives them their red colour .
But lycopene ingested in its natural form is poorly absorbed .
Ateronon contains a refined , more readily absorbed version of lycopene that was originally developed by Nestle .
Dr Peter Coleman of The Stroke Association said : " We know that diets rich in antioxidants are beneficial in reducing the plaque build up and welcome the findings of this research . "

The way the market was trading JPY yesterday , first smelt like someone was in trouble , a hedge fund , a bank perhaps .
The massive swing to own JPY was not entirely due to exiting carry trades .
Verbal intervention was swift to end the stop loss hunting patters .
Japans Chief Cabinet minister said that Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœexcessive moves in market rates have a bad impact on the stability of the economy and financial conditions and therefore are undesirableÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
Is actual intervention far behind ?
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ O/N session .
They might as well be having the G8 meeting at MJÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœNeverlandÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
There seems to be a huge chasm in ideas on what the members need to do next .
The biggest borrowing and spending spree in half a century is currently having little effect on global unemployment and leaving investors massively unwinding riskier trades as they question the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœgreen shoot strengthÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ of this global recovery .
The mass migration into both JPY and USD and a heightened appetite for FI product is powerful evidence that Governments and Cbanks are been questioned about their actions .
They cannot afford to take the foot off any peddle and currently have little room to maneuver .
The idea of exiting any strategies too soon before the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœgreenÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ shoots root will only plummet economies into deeper recession .
Despite the IMF raising their optimism levels , they maintain that the upturn will be Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœsluggishÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and continue to urge governments to stay the economic - stimulus course .
InvestorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s actions tell you that they are weary and wary of false promises !
The USD $ currently is lower against the EUR +0.59 % , GBP +0.62 % , CHF +0.54 % and higher against JPY - 0.75 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.70 % and AUD +0.84 % .
The loonie has faltered , but not at the same pace as other G8 currencies trading vs. the USD .
The weakness is playing catch up .
The commodity based currency continues to feel pressurized as commodity prices tumble , especially oil , which has lost close to - 16 % since last week .
Expect investorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s to continue to trim bets on riskier assets and carry trades on signs that a global economic recovery may take much longer than originally anticipated .
Despite some stronger fundamental data appearing this week , similar to a whitewash rather than a paint job , all eyes are focused on the employment data out tomorrow .
Even the IMF upwardly revised growth predictions for the Canadian economy for this and next year ( - 2.3 % and +1.6 % ) has done very little to aid the currency , like all currencies itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s caught surfing on the wave of negativity fueled by lower earnings .
Technically , with the currency printing a 7 - week low it has opened up for it to test back towards the 1.1800 handle .
Expect the currency to be sold on a USD pull back in the short term as global sentiment seeks that Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœsafer heavenÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ currency .
The AUD has rebounded from its 3.5 % loss yesterday , which was also a 7 - week low , after government reports showed that the countries jobless rate rose less than expected last month ( +5.8 vs. +5.7 % ) .
With global equities retreating , it has dampened the demand for higher yielding assets as investors become risk averse in their trading , if this is sustainable then the currency will once again be in trouble ( 0.7848 ) .
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 61.14 up +100c ) .
Crude has managed to solidify its longest losing streak since Dec. on the back of equities continuing to plummet and weekly industry reports showing an increase in US fuel inventories .
Gas inventories rose + 1.9 m barrels to +213.1 m , w/w , vs. expectations of an increase of +900 k Distillates ( which include heating oil and diesel ) , jumped +3.74 m barrels to +158.7 m barrels .
Crude on the other hand came in very close to expectations , falling - 2.9 m to +347.3 m .
The market had expected a - 2.8 m decline .
Yesterday was the 7th - consecutive day of declines as the greenback remained firm vs. the EUR ( longest losing streak in 9 - months ) and limiting investorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s appetite for commodities as a hedge against inflation .
Recent fundamental data have led to concerns that the US stimulus program may not be working .
The commodity has retreated more than 16 % from its recent highs last week .
Prices had got ahead of fundamentals in a big way over the past few months , and recent movements seem to be filling in that gap .
With Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdemand destructionÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ come higher inventories and itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s speculated that this weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s inventory reports will further pressurize prices .
OPEC also released a report yesterday cutting its 2013 forecast for global oil demand by - 5.7 m barrels to +87.9 m barrels a day and expects developing countries consumption to drop - 1 % next year to +45.5 m barrels a day and remain at that level through 2013 .
This technical retreat and demand destruction has opened the way for oil to maybe trade down to $ 55 !
Similar to other commodities , the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ has faltered of late but with the greenback paring losses in the O/N session the commodity has managed to find a little traction ( $ 914 ) .
The Nikkei closed 9,291 down - 129 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,634 up +62 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,166 up + 26 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 19 bp yesterday ( 3.32 % ) and is little changed in the O/N session .
Despite the FI market setting it - self up for the last of this weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s auctions ( 30 - years today ) investors continue to speculate that the worst recession in 50 - years has Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœlegs to runÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
With advisors telling Obama that the economy is Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœworse than they had forecastedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and to consider a 2nd stimulus package , investors and Cbanks continue to seek the sanctuary of the FI market .
With equities in trouble finding traction this is making bonds more attractive .
The market is expecting Cbanks to be around to soak up the record supply .
Their appetite for product can only last for so long !

The American economy ’s long decline leveled off significantly from April through June , the government reported on Friday , crystallizing expectations of a turnaround in the second half of the year .
The nation ’s output shrank at an annual pace of 1 percent in the second quarter , after contracting at a rate of 6.4 percent earlier this year .
Government spending , helped by the first payments from the administration ’s $ 787 billion stimulus package , propped up activity in the latest quarter and accounted for 20 percent of the country ’s output .
But consumer spending , which makes up about 70 percent of overall economic activity , has continued to fall as fearful Americans save more .
Many economists express concern about what will happen once government spending lets up if consumers remain worried about losing their jobs and their weakened household finances .
“ The most severe part of the decline is behind us , ” said Joshua Shapiro , chief United States economist at MFR , an economic consulting firm .
“ But it ’s hard to say how sustainable whatever bounce we might see will be .
It depends largely on whether the consumer has the genuine ability to spend , or if it ’s all just government cheese being handed out . ”
Christian schools are within their rights to refuse to employ gay teachers if homosexuality breaks school principles , the Nederlands Dagblad reports on Tuesday , quoting the government ’s Council of State advisory body .
The paper says that confidential recommendations from council state that while anti-discrimination measures remain paramount , religious and other belief - based institutions ‘ can impose specific demands under strict conditions ’ .
These conditions have to be ‘ desirable , legitimate and just ’ and show ‘ good faith and loyalty ’ to the religious principles , the council says .
The Netherlands has dozens of fundamentalist Christian schools which oppose homosexuality on Biblical principles .
While funded by the government , they are run independently .
Such schools may not discriminate but are free under European rules to determine their own ‘ professional demands ’ for teachers , the paper says .
Last month a strict Protestant primary school in Gelderland suspended a teacher because he was gay and lived with another man .
That case is being taken to the equal opportunities commission .
Should schools be able to sack gay teachers ?

A FATHER has been sentenced for religious harassment after a row in a job centre .
Jobless John Sullivan , 46 , made the remark to a worker at Southend ’s job centre , in Tylers Avenue .
Southend Magistrates ’ Court heard how Sullivan had been in the branch in January to sign on .
Sullivan , of The Grove , Southend , has been using the centre on and off for 20 years , the court heard .
He became cross after he was interrupted when speaking to another worker about an incident at the centre the day before .
Prosecuting , Bob Rowlingson said staff heard raised voices , and Sullivan was heard saying to Muslim worker Majid Khan , “ people of your culture ” and “ you should bow down to me ” .
Giving evidence , dad - of - three Sullivan denied being racist .
He said : “ I was angry .
I was cross .
“ I said to him , ‘ why are n’t you bowing down to me ? ’
He said , ‘ What do you mean by that ? ’
I said , ‘ you do n’t want to talk to me , you are always avoiding eye contact , you are always looking down ’ .
“ It was a dig at him , but not through his religion . ”
Chairman of the bench Peter Hobbs said the comments were “ not very nice ” , and Sullivan should pay £ 200 towards costs .
He was given a conditional discharge for 18 months after being found guilty of a religiously - aggravated public order offence .
The Obama administration is considering seeking a change in the special U.S. military trials for terrorism suspects being held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , to allow those who face the death penalty to plead guilty without getting a full trial , the New York Times reported Friday .
The military commissions effectively have been frozen since January while the administration weighed its options .
Human rights groups have said the commissions , created by President George W. Bush , were fundamentally unfair to defendants .
The Times said the changes being explored would aim to resolve an ambiguity in the 2006 law governing the military commissions .
The newspaper said the proposal to allow a guilty plea in a death penalty case was contained in a draft of legislation that would be submitted to Congress for consideration .
Current law does not make clear whether guilty pleas are permitted in death penalty cases in military commissions .
The only death penalty case currently before a military commission is the one involving five detainees charged as the planners of the Sept. 11 attacks , including the self - proclaimed mastermind , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed .

The newspaper said the proposal would simplify the government ’s task of prosecuting men who have confessed to acts of terrorism but whose legal cases present challenges .
For example , evidence may include confessions given following interrogation methods that some critics consider torture .
“ It is always more difficult to fight with Jorge , ” says Sachsenring racewinner .
Valentino Rossi had to contend with all three of his main rivals for the 2009 world title en route to victory at the Alice Motorrad Grand Prix Deutschland on Sunday , facing particular resistance from first Casey Stoner and then Jorge Lorenzo in the fight for the win .
It was his duel with the latter that was to prove decisive for the victory , as Rossi once again bested his young Fiat Yamaha teammate on the final laps of the race .
Lorenzo had tried to repay the Italian for his last corner move in Barcelona one month previous , but Rossi resisted and took victory number four of the season .
“ It was fun , but very tough , ” admitted the reigning World Champion after the race .
“ The top riders made different tyre choices , all the bikes were behaving differently . ”
Starting from pole position from the first time at Sachsenring , Rossi was unable to take the holeshot and spent the early stages exchanging blows with Stoner .
Passing the gutsy Australian was only the beginning of his problems , however , as he explained .
“ Halfway through the race I was able to overtake Casey , but then I saw that Jorge passed him straight away and I thought ‘ oh no , another time ! ’
It ’s always more difficult to fight with Jorge .
I tried to push a lot , but he was able to overtake .
I made my attack and knew that here it is very difficult to overtake , so I tried to stay in front .
On the last lap I was fastest in the crucial points . ”
Rossi ’s victory gives him a fourteen point advantage over Lorenzo in the standings , and also draws him level on career podiums with record holder Giacomo Agostini .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution Friday that says it supports " all Iranians who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties and the rule of law . "
Throngs in Tehran cheer Thursday for defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi , center .
The resolution was approved by 405 lawmakers , while one -- Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas -- voted against it .
Two others , Reps. Brad Ellsworth , D - Indiana , and Dave Loebsack , D - Iowa , voted " present . "
In a statement on his Web site , Paul said he voted against the measure because he is " always very cautious about ' condemning ' the actions of governments overseas . "
" I have always hesitated when my colleagues rush to pronounce final judgment on events thousands of miles away about which we know very little , " said Paul , who attracted attention last year during his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination .
" And we know very little beyond limited press reports about what is happening in Iran . "
The resolution , which also " condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators , " was sponsored by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman , D - California , and two Republicans , Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana and House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia .
Speaking shortly after the resolution passed , Pence called it a message from Americans to the Iranian people .
" As Americans have done throughout our history , this Congress today , on behalf of the American people , has spoken a word of heartfelt support to all Iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties and the rule of law , " he said .
He urged U.S. senators to support the identical resolution that Sen. John McCain , R - Arizona , introduced Friday .
Both Pence and McCain have been outspoken in their criticism of President Obama 's response to massive rallies in Iran against the results of last week 's presidential election .
Watch as Obama walks a fine line »
Supporters of Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi have taken to the streets this week calling for a new election after the results of the June 12 vote showed an overwhelming victory for hard - line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The rallies also have denounced the Iranian government 's crackdown on the protests in which at least eight people have died .
Obama has said he is " deeply troubled " by the violence , but he has avoided siding with Ahmadinejad 's opponents , telling reporters , " It is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran 's leaders will be . "
" It 's not productive , given the history of U.S. - Iranian relations , to be seen as meddling , the U.S. president meddling in Iranian elections , " Obama said this week .
But several Republicans , particularly McCain -- Obama 's opponent in last year 's presidential race -- have criticized the administration 's position .
McCain introduced a resolution on the Senate floor Friday morning that he said would be " an expression of support by the government and the people of the United States of America " for those protesting the election results .
" It is unfortunate in a way that this resolution is required since the administration does not want to ' meddle ' and has refused , the president has refused to speak out in support of these brave Iranian citizens , most of them young , who are risking their very lives to protest what was clearly an unfair and corrupt election , " McCain told his fellow senators .
Watch what else McCain said about Obama »
The resolution passed Friday states that the House :
" ( 1 ) expresses its support for all Iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties , and rule of law ;
" ( 2 ) condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators by the government of Iran and pro-government militias , as well as the ongoing government suppression of independent electronic communication through interference with the Internet and cell phones ; and
" ( 3 ) affirms the universality of individual rights and the importance of democratic and fair elections . "
On Thursday , Cantor joined the critics of the White House , saying the United States has a " moral responsibility " to condemn attacks on protesters .
" The administration 's position that what 's going on in Iran is a ' vigorous debate ' is absurd , " he said .
" People are being brutalized and murdered by the regime in Tehran .
We have no idea exactly how many have died or have been seriously injured since the regime has restricted journalists .
In no way do these actions constitute a ' vigorous debate . ' "
Cantor , the No. 2 Republican in the House , added , " America has a moral responsibility to stand up for these brave people , to defend human rights and to condemn the violence and abuses by the regime in Tehran . "
Watch amateur video of protesters under attack »
Pence has called on the United States " to take a half - step back from this administration 's olive branch and the apology approach to enemies and countries that have been hostile to the United States of America and our allies , particularly with the road to Iran . "
But Sen. John Kerry , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said Washington would be making an " enormous mistake " by taking sides in the Iranian protests .
" There is no need for the United States of America to step into the middle of it and make this about America , " Kerry told CNN's " The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer . "
" It is an Iranian moment , spurred on by Iranians , thoroughly supported by Iranians to the degree that the supreme ayatollah has now backed off his own support for the elections [ and ] called for an investigation , " he said .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs defended the administration 's approach this week , saying that Obama " believes that he 's struck the right tone . "
" I know some people agree with what Sen. McCain said .
Some people agree with what other Republicans have said that 's very much like the president 's position , " Gibbs said Thursday .
" The president strongly believes that we should -- and have -- spoken out to ensure the demonstrators have the universal right and principle to demonstrate without fear of harm .
But at the same time , we have to respect their sovereignty . "
Moorhead Kennedy , a former diplomat who was among those taken hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 , said he supports the Obama administration 's position .
" I think if I had any conclusion to draw , we would have been much better off not interfering in Iran now , " Kennedy told CNN's " American Morning . "
Because the United States backed a 1953 coup that put Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in charge , and supported him until the 1979 revolution that created today 's Islamic republic , Kennedy said , " There are a great many resentments there . "
CNN 's Paul Steinhauser , Deirdre Walsh , Peter Hamby and Dan Lothian contributed to this report .

A 40,000 - year - old figurine of a voluptuous woman carved from mammoth ivory and excavated from a cave in southwestern Germany is the oldest known example of three - dimensional or figurative representation of humans and sheds new light on the origins of art , researchers reported Wednesday .
The intricately carved headless figure is at least 5,000 years older than previous examples and dates from shortly after the arrival of modern humans in Europe .
It exhibits many of the characteristics of fertility , or Venus , figurines carved millenniums later .
The figurine “ radically changes our views of the context and meaning of the earliest Paleolithic art , ” its discoverer , archaeologist Nicholas J. Conard of the University of Tubingen in Germany , wrote in the journal Nature .
Experts are excited about the find because of what it tells us about early humans -- and about ourselves .

“ The origin and evolution of figurative art , portable art , appear on most lists of what constitutes modern human behavior , ” said archaeologist Daniel Adler of the University of Connecticut , who was not involved in the research .
“ Any time you can push the clock back on some of these behaviors , we get a better understanding of why these were important and were developed , where they were developed . . . and the roles they played in the social glue that holds groups together , ” he said .
“ For European archaeologists , it marks the appearance of behaviors they find familiar , modern human behavior , ” said archaeologist John J. Shea of Stony Brook University in New York , who was also not involved .
“ It suggests the same values and ways of seeing the world existed among the earliest humans that migrated to Europe ” as among humans today .
The figurine was excavated at Hohle Fels , a large cave in the Swabian Jura region about 14 miles southwest of the city of Ulm .
The cave shows evidence of a long period of prehistoric occupation and is probably best known for three ivory carvings previously discovered by Conard : a horse ’s or bear ’s head ; a water bird that may be in flight ; and a half - human , half - lion figurine , all dating from about 30,000 to 31,000 years ago .

The new figurine was found in September in six pieces about 9 feet below the cave floor .
Nearby were flint - knapping debris , worked bone and ivory , and remains of horses , reindeer , cave bears , mammoths and ibexes .
Radiocarbon data indicate that the layer originated 35,000 to 40,000 years ago .
The figure , about 2.4 inches tall , was carved from a mammoth tusk .
It has broad shoulders , prominent breasts and intricately detailed buttocks and genitalia , all grossly exaggerated .
Those features “ are clearly more exaggerated than on others that come later , ” Adler said , “ but many of the basic features that are seen later are already there .
. . .
It ’s a prototype for what you see later ” from the Gravettian culture , which existed in France 28,000 to 22,000 years ago .

“ The stylistic attributes are being carried on for many , many generations . ”
The figurine has two short arms with carefully carved hands resting on the upper part of the stomach ; part of the left arm and shoulder are missing .
One hand has five fingers , the other four .
The legs are short , pointed and asymmetrical , with the left noticeably shorter , typical of later Venus figurines .
Also typical , the figure has no head .
Instead , it has a carefully carved ring above the left shoulder .
The polished surface of the ring suggests that the figurine was worn as an ornament around the neck .
The intricate detailing achieved with primitive stone tools indicates “ the amount of energy these guys were willing to invest in these little objects -- tens if not hundreds of hours , ” Shea said .
That suggests the objects were very important to them .

Many researchers believe that they were fertility totems , but their ultimate meaning may remain a mystery .

Have we ?
Meet fifteen sexist vintage ads .
Women are idiots , ninnies , nincompoops .
Women are drooling , giggling buffoons whose minds are empty except for a few wafting fibres and whose bodies are revolting sacs of malfunctioning fluids and duff organs .
If TV adverts are anything to go by , I 'm hardly exaggerating .
In " adworld " , when they are not fingering piles of white and coloured laundry with robotic smiles , washing up desultorily , luxuriating in lemony fresh bubbles , and vacuuming , scraping , tidying , cooking and wiping with looks of extraordinary interest as their marvellously boisterous sons – because in adworld , boys will be boys , wo n't they ?
– track mud across the carpet , women are depicted attempting various ways in which to control their unruly bodies .
Just what is up with up ladies ' panty parts these days ?
In adland , the female knicker zone is an endless terrain of trouble – and stubble .
A new razor has been put on the market for that delicate bikini area , just to make sure we 're all tidied up and as unnaturally hairless , everywhere , as femininity ( you know , that big fantasy fraud that both sexes use to beat real women with ) requires us to be .
But that is just the beginning .
Delve further and the average consumer uncovers a host of female troubles .
The other night , I was disconcerted to see the following adverts , all in a row .
First , something to treat the scourge of female incontinence , in which one cured sufferer was laughing so hard with idiotic relief that she fell off her bed .
Next , a pastel bottle of vadge - rinsing agent – sorry , a feminine hygiene product – to help with a woman 's " confidence " while subtly reinforcing all those fishy medieval fears .
Then there was a proposed remedy for constipation , in which a group of gal pals sat around a cafe table talking candidly about how very hard it was to get anything out during such a trying time .
Next , an about - turn : the focus was not on too little poo , but too much .
And again , oddly , it seems that only women suffer .
This time , the happily cured lady was so pleased to be free of the runs that she danced clownishly down the street in her pants and vest .
Then , yet more poopy business : a pow - wow of bovine housewives talking about their " digestive transits " and recommending each other a probiotic yoghurt to help grease nature 's channels .
Finally , the jewel in the crown : a wafting wheat field in which stood , for no particular reason , a totally naked bare - bottomed young woman .
The camera glided up the curve of her shoulder , she smiled alluringly and revealed … a missing tooth .
The advert was for a brand of medicated mouthwash that tackles gingivitis .
What with our diseased gums , leaky , stinking and hairy vaginas , and unreasonably capricious bowels , women in adland are truly the second sex when it comes to personal hygiene .
The fight for justice has been derailed by a range of personal ailments which , when cured , induce cringeworthily excessive infantile glee .
I 'd laugh , but I 'm afraid I might soil myself .
A reader writes :
I 've appreciated your police state posts lately , especially the one today related to immigration .
I 'm an immigration lawyer , so I see this kind of stuff happening all the time .
One small point on that - immigrants facing charges from ICE do have the right to an attorney ( though that right was put in jeopardy by Mukasey and mostly rescued by Holder ) , but , unlike criminal defendants , do not have the right to have the government provide an attorney if the immigrant can't afford one .
That means it is perfectly possible to go to jail ( immigration detainees are almost always housed with criminals in the same jails used to punish criminal offenders ) without having access to an attorney .
I hope you 'll continue to blog about the many ways Americans have allowed their country to begin evolving into a police state .
I fear it may already too late to rouse the outrage of the masses at the tremendous power grab we 've seen starting with Bush and continuing under Obama , but I believe those of us who still value our civil liberties should at least try .
I backed Obama because I believed he wanted to roll some of this back .
It increasingly appears that I was wrong .
The 9/11 police state is with us .
Obama is slowly legitimizing it , despite being elected to unwind it .
This country is no longer as free as many others in the world - and unrecognizable compared with the free country I found in 1984 .
And it 's getting less free every day .
I expected this if Giuliani or McCain got elected .
But Obama ?
Watching him continue their policies in so many ways is somehow even more painful .

Believe or not , there is a firm that specializes in helping bankers and stock analysts do time :
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Soaring U.S. unemployment and a shrinking economy drove delinquencies on credit card debt and home equity loans to all - time highs in the first quarter as a record number of cash - strapped consumers fell behind on their bills .

Delinquencies on the value of all card debt soared to a record 6.60 percent from 5.52 percent in the fourth quarter as more cardholders relied on plastic to meet day - to - day expenses , the American Bankers Association said .
Late payments on home equity loans rose to 3.52 percent from 3.03 percent , and on home equity lines of credit climbed to 1.89 percent from 1.46 percent .
A broader gauge showing late payments on eight categories of loans rose for a fourth straight quarter to a new record , edging up to 3.23 percent from 3.22 percent .
That rate actually understates consumer pain because it excludes credit cards .
The ABA tracks loan payments that are at least 30 days late .
“ The biggest driver is job losses , ” ABA Chief Economist James Chessen said in an interview .
“ When people lose their jobs or work fewer hours , it makes it that much harder to meet their obligations .
Unfortunately , we ’re going to see higher job losses in the next year , and I expect elevated delinquencies . ”
The ABA represents most large U.S. banks and credit card companies .
Tuesday ’s data are a bad sign for them as they prepare to report second - quarter results starting next week .
While improved capital markets may boost the bottom lines of some , analysts expect lenders such as Bank of America Corp , JPMorgan Chase & Co , Citigroup Inc , Capital One Financial Corp and American Express
Co to suffer higher credit losses , especially in cards .
BRIDGE TO EMPLOYMENT
Borrowers are struggling as the nation ’s jobless rate sits at a 26 - year high of 9.5 percent , with 6.5 million jobs having disappeared since the recession began in December 2007 .
The Obama administration expects the unemployment rate to hit double digits before declining .
U.S. consumers ended March with $ 939.6 billion of revolving credit outstanding , a rough approximation of credit card debt , according to Federal Reserve data .
“ Consumers tend to rely on credit cards as a bridge to cover their daily needs until they find new jobs , ” Chessen said .
“ It ’s taking longer to find those jobs . ”
Meanwhile , home prices are down 32.6 percent from their peak in 2006 , according to the Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller Home Price Indices of 20 large metropolitan areas .
The ABA in June said it expects the recession to end this quarter , despite rising unemployment .
The overall ABA delinquency rate includes direct auto , indirect auto , closed - end home equity , home improvement , marine , mobile home , personal , and recreational vehicle loans .
Delinquencies rose to 3.01 percent from 2.03 percent on direct auto loans , to 3.70 percent from 2.96 percent on mobile home loans , to 3.47 percent from 2.88 percent on personal loans , and to 1.52 percent from 1.38 percent on recreational vehicle loans .
They fell to 3.42 percent from 3.53 percent on auto loans made through dealers , to 2.04 percent from 2.35 percent on marine loans , and to 1.46 percent from 1.75 percent on property improvement loans .
We do n't expect them to stick with every boring fact , but time and time again we find out that the entire point of the story has been totally fabricated .
So what 's the point of basing it on a true story at all ?
As we pointed out in the previous installment , it seems the least we can ask of a movie that 's based on a true story is that it , you know , be based on a true story .

The Hollywood Version :
John Forbes Nash was really smart .
He was also really , really crazy .
When he was n't working on the concept of governing dynamics , he was having hallucinations of Paul Bettany , seeing hidden messages in newspapers and getting recruited by Ed Harris to break codes for the government , all while running from Russian spies .
Which is even weirder when you find out all of that shit happened in his head .
" On your mark .
Get set .
Crazy ! "
The hallucinations became more frequent and , as hallucinations are prone to do , they drove him batshit insane .
Fortunately , his loving wife stood by him , Nash committed to a medication regiment and , over time , learned to ignore his hallucinations just in time to win the Nobel Prize in Economics and Crazy in 1994 .

In Reality ...
There 's no denying Nash was both brilliant and afflicted with a bad case of the crazies .
But filmmaker Ron Howard was widely criticized for glossing over the life of Nash as well as making up the whole " seeing people who were n't really there " thing .
Nash did hear voices , but that 's it -- his hallucinations were entirely auditory .
" Mr. Howard , ' auditory ' does n't mean he put shoes on his hands , it - OK , you do n't care . "
The movie completely ignores the fact that John and his wife divorced in 1963 , just six years after being married , and never got remarried until 2001 ( in addition to the whole insanity thing , the fact that the real Nash dabbled in boning dudes probably did n't help their marriage either ) .
The film also manages to not mention his anti-Semitism , which the real Nash says must have been a side effect of his illness .

At the end of the film , Nash mentions to a friend that he is taking new medication , and he makes a heartfelt speech dedicated to his wife when he accepts his Nobel Prize .
The truth , however , is that both of those things were complete fabrications .
Nash stopped taking any medication in 1970 , and his continued instability -- probably in large part due to that refusal to take medication - - led to his not being allowed to make an acceptance speech for fear that he might whip out his dick and start screaming racial slurs at imaginary Jews .
So while the real Nash probably would n't have made the best protagonist of a Ron Howard film , we 're definitely adding him to our list of " Celebrities Who Need to Get on Twitter . "

Reviews for Sacha Baron
Cohen 's new film have been favourable
American Idol judge Paula Abdul has admitted she was fooled by Sacha Baron Cohen 's comedy character Bruno , as part of his forthcoming movie .
Appearing on US radio's Johnjay and Rich Show , the star said she was told she had won an award in Germany and was interviewed by Baron Cohen 's alter ego .
Abdul said she had no idea it had been a set up until weeks later .
" At two in the morning , I woke up in a sweat and I went : ' Oh my God ' And I 'm dying , because you do n't expect it . "
' Abusive stuff '
Recalling the incident , she said : " I 'm greeted by this futuristic dude with a mohawk - and he 's flaming .
" I walk in and there was no furniture except a chair .
And this guy Bruno introduces himself .
He snaps his fingers and says , ' Gardeners ' .
" And these two Mexican guys come in , and they drop down to all fours .
I see him paying them like 10 bucks . "
The singer said things turned " uncomfortable " when Baron Cohen kicked one of the Mexicans .
" I said , ' Get me out of here .
This is crazy .
This is not funny , this is discrimination .
This is abusive stuff going on here ' . "
Early reviews of the film , based on Baron Cohen 's gay fashion TV reporter character , have been largely positive .
Like Baron Cohen's hit film Borat , Bruno takes the style of a faux documentary , with the comedian putting unsuspecting interviewees through a string of awkward situations .
Those caught out this time are rumoured to include Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ben Affleck .
For 35 years scientists have known that naturally occurring compounds in the cannabis plant possess potent and selective anti-cancer properties , a fact that I have documented extensively in previous writings here , here , and here .
Yet for more than three decades the scientific study of these anti-cancer effects has remained almost exclusively limited to preclinical in vitro ( in a petri dish ) and in vivo ( in lab animals ) analysis , rather than clinical ( human ) study .
Why ?
A just published review in the Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology provides an answer .
Cannabinoid receptor ligands as potential anticancer agents – high hopes for new therapies ?
abstract excerpt via PubMed
In recent years , CB receptor ligands , including Delta( 9 ) - tetrahydrocannabinol , have been proposed as potential anticancer agents .
This review critically discusses the pharmacology of CB receptor activation as a novel therapeutic anticancer strategy in terms of ligand selectivity , tissue specificity and potency .
Intriguingly , antitumour effects mediated by cannabinoids are not confined to inhibition of cancer cell proliferation ; cannabinoids also reduce angiogenesis , cell migration and metastasis , inhibit carcinogenesis and attenuate inflammatory processes .
Sounds promising , huh ?
Well it is — that is , until you get to this :
The development of CB ( 2 ) - selective anticancer agents could be advantageous in light of the unwanted central effects exerted by CB ( 1 ) receptor ligands .
And just what are these terrible “ unwanted effects ” — effects so “ problematic ” that we must continue to forbid scientists from clinically studying the drug ’s effects in cancer patients ?
I ’ll let the authors explain .
“ In terms of a potential therapeutic application the unwanted psychotropic effects mediated via CB1 could be a problem . ”
You read that right .
The ‘ problem ’ with cannabinoids anti-cancer abilities is that patients might temporarily feel better after they take them !
Now contrast mainstream science ’s feigned concern with the so - called ‘ unwanted effects ’ of the natural cannabis ‘ high ’ with the actual side - effects of the pharmaceutical cannabinoid antagonist drug rimonabant ( aka Acomplia ) , which was recently withdrawn from the European market because of the the drug ’s link to depression and suicide .
The psychiatric side - effects of rimonabant
Experimental evidence has suggested that drugs that enhance cannabinoid type - 1 ( CB1 ) receptor activity may induce anxiolytic and antidepressant effects , whilst the opposite has been reported with antagonists .
Thus , the objective of the present review is to discuss the potential psychiatric side - effects of CB1 receptor antagonists , such as rimonabant , which has been recently marketed in several countries for the treatment of smoking cessation , obesity and associated metabolic disorders .
… Patients taking CB1 receptor antagonists should be carefully investigated for psychiatric side - effects .
These drugs should not be prescribed for those already suffering from mental disorders .
Nevertheless , the development of new compounds targeting the endocannabinoid system for the treatment of several conditions would be necessary and opportune .
Let ’s review shall we ?
Natural plant selectively kills cancer , but it may also get you high = “ problematic . ”
Synthetic pharmaceutical drug short circuits the body ’s natural endocannabinoid system and will likely make you depressed and suicidal = “ opportune . ”
Any questions ?

Kiribati will be devastated by rising sea levels .
July 29 , 2009 -- For Pacific islanders , climate change is not a threat looming somewhere in the future .
Rising sea levels and unpredictable weather are having devastating effects right now .
Climate change has already forced some communities to leave their traditional homes .
Simon Butler spoke to two climate change activists from the Pacific about their campaign for immediate cuts to global greenhouse emissions .
Pelenise Alofa Pilitati is the chairperson of the Church Education Directors ' Association in Kiribati .
Reverend Tafue Lusama is the chairperson of the Tuvalu Climate Action Network .
They are on an Australian speaking tour through July and August , which is co-sponsored by Greenpeace and Oxfam .
For details of the tour go to http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/news-and-events/events/pacificvoicestour-300609.
* * *
Simon Butler :
What are you hoping to achieve with your speaking tour ?
Pelenise Alofa Pilitati ( PP ) : I ’m trying to get Australians to support the Pacific islands peoples and get the governments of Australia and New Zealand to sign an emissions - reduction agreement in Copenhagen that would protect the Pacific islands .
We ’re gearing up for the Copenhagen climate conference at the end of this year .
The Association of Small Island States released a statement earlier this month criticising the target of 2 °C warming above pre-industrial levels that the richest countries set at a recent meeting in Italy .
The small island states called for a 1.5 °C target to save their countries , which would mean stopping emissions very , very quickly .
What do you think is the problem with the policy of the world ’s richest governments ?
Why are they not listening to the science ?
Reverend Tafue Lusama ( TL ) : I believe that they have the political method which is economics based .
For example when the US and Australia refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol their main reason was that millions in the US would lose their jobs if they tried to comply with the demands .
So it was a very economics - based argument .
But studies [ on green job creation ] state otherwise .
So the rich governments are not agreeing to the demands of the poor countries because they look at [ climate change ] as an economics issue , not a moral issue .
What are some of the impacts of climate change in Kiribati and Tulavu that are already taking place ?
TL : Climate change impacts on life in our countries from every aspect .
It challenges our livelihoods .
It challenges our sustenance .
It challenges our future .
Take sea level rises for example .
Our islands are very low and when the sea level rises it does not just come above the land .
It also comes on top of the land — right in the middle of the island .
That means our traditional way of planting food , where we dig down to the underground water table , can no longer be done because the underground water has been salinated by the sea water .
Not only that , but the same water we used to rely on during long droughts is not drinkable .
Is this on all islands ?
TL : Yes , on all islands .
Not only that , because of the warming of the globe , the corals are dying .
They are bleached .
And if corals die it does affects our supply of fish — because fish either die out without coral or they move further away in the ocean — which means going after the fish has become an expensive exercise .
Not every individual in Tulavu has the financial capacity to buy boats and go after the fish .
So it is cheaper to buy tinned fish , for example , which is not as fresh and not what people are used too .
And when we come together as a community to have a feast you are supposed to have a fish on the plate .
So climate change is also challenging our culture .
Also , the patterns of the weather have changed a lot .
We have two seasons — a rainy season and a hot season .
The rainy season runs from September to April and the rest is the hot season .
Right in the middle of the hot season we are suddenly visited by storms and strong winds .
In the middle of the rainy season there will be a long drought .
Our people depend on their traditional knowledge of the weather to plant and to fish .
Now if the weather patterns are unpredictable so too will be the livelihoods of the people .
Right now our view of the future of our countries is very , very limited .
There is no assurance that coming generations will remain in our countries .
Climate change impacts on the land through sea level rise and coastal erosion .
Islands have been disappearing .
Our people depend on our land , so if an island disappears then there goes the land and the basis of your survival .
The coast has been eroded so land is being lost and people are being forced inland and to other areas .
So overcrowding has become a problem .
From the health perspective , it is also a challenge .
For example , dengue fever has been under control for many years .
Recently in Tulavu , dengue fever has revived , stronger than before .
There is also a prediction that malaria is coming our way .
So every aspect of life in our island countries has been affected .
In Kiribati and Tulavu have many people been forced to leave their islands already ?
PP : It 's very hard to relocate people .
The government keeps telling them they have to move out of here and we ’ll take you to another island .
But it is [ people ’s ] culture , it is [ people ’s ] land .
You ’re taking me to somewhere that is not my land — this is my ancestral land given by our forebears .
Many people stay on the islands and all the islands are still inhabited .
They keep moving to a better , safer place within the island .
So it 's internal relocation at the moment .
The land in Kiribati is given to you , you have a title to it .
No land belongs to the government .
It ’s owned by families , by people , and they know their own land .
They can not move to some place else .
So when they are told to move it is very hard .
TL : Even in Tulavu it is impossible for the government to come and relocate people because the government does n’t have any land — people have land .
The place is small , so moving people from one place to another place in the country is just not possible .
Whose land are you going to put me on ?
PP : And when you leave your place is it hard because we have close ties to our land .
It gives us our security and our identity .
To move to somebody else ’s land means everyone looks at you like “ where do you come from ? ”
TL : All the lands on my island are owned by the people .
The land is not owned by individuals they are owned by clans .
I am part of the clan and an owner of the land .
If you wanted to stay on my land it is impossible for me to say yes .
I have to get the consent of the rest of the clan .
And that is very , very difficult because even if 99.9 % of the clan agrees it has to be unanimous .
PP : It 's different in Kiribati .
People have their own land title .
It 's not communal , it 's family .
If you do n’t have any land , people ask “ What has happened to them ? ” .
But land is very important to us and you cannot just say leave it and move away to another island .
How quickly have the changes happened ?
TL : It started way back , at least 30 years ago .
But then it was more recently that we could link what was happening with the science of climate change .
When I was young , my family had a small island and we would spend weekends there .
That was when I was about 10 to 15 years old .
It is no longer there .
Two more islands , which were bigger , are also gone .
The changes happened gradually but is it gaining pace .
If Tulavu goes down today , then you will go down tomorrow .
Simply meaning , the reason is that if Tuvalu is the beginning of the problem , then it should be the beginning of the solution .
If we ignore it by the time we wake up and realise we should do something it will be too late .
Because we have emitted so much carbon dioxide and poisonous gas and the pace of climate change will be so fast that it will be impossible to stop it and achieve stability .
Recently , the Tulavu government announced it is going to move to 100 % renewable energy by 2020 .
This is also what the climate movement here is saying Australia should do .
Should Australia match that kind of target ?
TL : Australia should take up that challenge to show good leadership .
Tuvalu is just a small country .
It does n’t mean anything for the problem when it makes a commitment like that .
Australia , as big and wealthy as it is , should commit to show the world that Australia is showing leadership in the Pacific and in the world in relation to the issue .
PP : Is it such a problem for Australia ?
Is anyone going to die if they commit themselves to the agreement ?
So I think that the Australian government is not thinking of the long term .
It is just thinking of just now .
For me , when I look at the Pacific , if it 's all destroyed and people are displaced , then where else will people go ?
I think they will end up here in Australia .
And maybe Australia is happy with that .
If Australia wants to inherit a lot of unhappy people , that is .
So it ’s better that they can stay on their own land , strong in their own identity and happy where they are .
I think in the long term it ’s going to be harsh .
Unless the planning of moving people is done properly .
If it ’s not done properly we will end up with more problems .
What do you want out of the Copenhagen conference ?
PP : I want the reduction of carbon emissions to be equal to what the scientists say is required .
If they say 40 % or 50 % then yes — not more and not less .
Second , to have a good adaptation program and the funding to organise it properly .
Third , a proper plan for those who are relocated .
If people have to move somewhere , they cannot just move people , no .
We have to think of their culture , think of their identity , think of their language , think of everything that makes them a people , a community .
They have to have a proper plan .
A couple of years ago the Tulavu government asked the Australian and New Zealand governments for help with relocation .
The Australian government said no , we wo n’t help you .
TL : The Australian government has refused our plea three times .
You see , from our own point of view , the whole of Tulavu ’s stand is summarised by what our prime minister presented at the Posnan climate talks in December year when he simply stated that Tulavu will not accept defeat .
We do n’t look at relocation as an option right now .
We ’d rather fight to save our country because it involves a lot of risks .
Simply put , you cannot create a country in another country .
You cannot create a Tuvalu in Australia .
If we were relocated to Australia we would become Australian citizens .
But then , it would be as Australian second - class citizens .
PP : For example , we are migrants and we were resettled in Fiji .
Banaba is in Kiribati and we were resettled in Fiji .
We have a beautiful island in Fiji , but we do not come from Fiji and we are not Fijians .
We bought the land but we always feel that Fiji is for Fijians .
It is the Pacific way and we can not change our mentality .
We love the Fijians , they care for us .
But we always say that this is their country and they look after us while we are there , and they have done that very well .
But when people ask `` Where do you come from ?'' , we say , ``We come from Banaba .
That is our home .
Banaba is in Kiribati . ''
We can never say that we are Fijians .
But because of climate change , if we are displaced and we have to move it will be a different kind of displacement .
Because this time there is not home left .
I live in Fiji but my home is there in Banaba .
This time if I move , my island is gone forever .
I could never say my island is still there .
TL : Which means that if we are displaced and relocated somewhere else — and our people are spread around the world — then our children and grandchildren will be roaming the face of the globe as homeless people .
There is a saying I always love to use : `` There ’s no place like home . ''
Wherever you go , no matter how beautiful a place is , even if it is paradise , you always have that urge to go back to where you belong .
But as soon as you travel back and step on your land , you feel at home .
Now if our people are removed and displaced , they will be roaming the face of the Earth as homeless people with nowhere to call home .
And to make it worse , there is not an international convention to protect the rights of those called climate refugees .
It should be recognised .
But right now that is how our future looks .
If we are displaced we cannot legally come and stay in Australia , because there is no law to protect our rights .
PP : My people were displaced twice [ from Banaba ] .
The first time was during the Second World War — they removed my people .
After the Second World War they removed them to Fiji .
But the way we moved to Fiji there was some protection given to us .
We bought an island but the British government actually created in the constitution some protection for us .
TL : But that ’s different because during at that time Fiji was a colonial possession of the British .
Kiribati , Tulavu and Banaba were all under the British empire .
So the British empire had the power to dictate to its colony .
PP : So we were in the constitution in Fiji .
And when Kiribati got its independence we were also in the constitution .
That is our protection .
If they can come up with some protection like that then maybe [ relocation ] would be different .
I live in Fiji and am protected in Fiji .
But we have nothing like that at the moment .
TL : So we would be running from place to place .
If we came to Australia , then Australia has the right to kick us out anytime .
Then if we run to New Zealand then New Zealand can kick us out .
So we will just be roaming from place to place .
PP : That is what I said about the relocation plan .
If there is going to be people displaced and they have to move , then they must have a proper plan — a strong plan to protect them as a group of people .
So they will be able to continue their own community wherever they are .
Like I have in Fiji .
I have my own language and my own culture .
If something like that [ is established ] then maybe .
But we will not accept a plan where they say some people go here and some people go there .
No , we can not do that .
It ’s not an option right now because we want to think about the first plan [ to cut emissions ] .
We do n’t want to move away from our islands .
But if it happens is has to be a proper strong plan .
If you got the chance to talk to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , who claims that Australia is taking the lead in combatting global warming , what would you tell him ?
TL : I would say to him you are fooling the people of Australia .
You are pretending to do something but you are not doing anything .
PP : The thing I would say is , `` Show us .
Show us that you are supporting us by taking a strong stand at Copenhagen . ''

Chicken feathers may help cars use hydrogen fuel in the future .
The feathers would not be the fuel , but they could help store it , new research reveals .
Hydrogen , the most common element in the universe , has long been touted as a clean and ample energy alternative to fossil fuels .
When hydrogen reacts with oxygen , instead of yielding pollutants as fossil fuels do , it simply generates water .
Unfortunately , hydrogen is hard to store and transport .
Hydrogen vehicles currently keep it in tanks in either liquid or pressurized gas form .
As a pressurized gas , it takes up roughly 40 times as much space as gasoline , and as a liquid it needs to be kept at extremely low temperatures .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
" Using currently available technology , if you had a 20 - gallon tank and filled it with hydrogen at typical room temperature and pressure , you could drive about a mile , " said researcher Richard Wool , director of the Affordable Composites from Renewable Resources program at the University of Delaware in Newark .

Ghostbusters Game Cost $ 15 - 20 Million to Produce
The Star - Telegram in Texas got to sit down with the development house for the new Ghostbusters game , Terminal Reality .
The game , which released about a month ago to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the first movie , has apparently sold over a million copies .
That ’s pretty impressive for a non-franchise launch ( games like Halo blow through the million mark ) .
Perhaps more surprising , the game cost between $ 15 M and $ 20 M to make according to Terminal Reality .
No , that ’s not huge for a blockbuster title , but is Ghostbusters a blockbuster ?
I remember when I first heard about the game I immediately dismissed it as another cheesy movie knock - off product .
Apparently it ’s a bit more than that , though there are a whole load of complaints about the PC and PS3 versions of the game .
i
The most interesting part of this whole thing , though , is something Terminal Reality co-founder Mark Randel has heard .
Apparently someone told him the success of the game has sparked interest in a third movie , one that would pick up where the second film left off .
Yes , you read that correctly .
A movie that picks up where this very game picks up .
A new movie set off by a game that was made to commemorate the 25th anniversary of a movie that was made and a franchise that got revived by a game made to stand in as the third movie .
It ’s all very convoluted you see .
Could this possibly be true ?
I ’ll say yes , though I ’d be surprised if it was the game that really made the franchise interesting .
Would a movie version of the game turn into another Hitman or Silent Hill film ?
Or is there more meat to Ghostbusters because it was a movie first and a game second ?
e Bay 's plan to spin off Skype with an initial public offering in 2010 is being threatened by a dispute with the VoIP service 's co-founders , who still own a key part of the software .
Bloomberg reports
Skype 's founders Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis have accused eBay of breaching a licensing deal and are threatening to yank the technology , which would disable the popular voice over internet service .
In return , eBay is suing Joltid , the company operated by Skype 's founders , in a London court to prevent the shutdown .
The Skype founders apparently retained the service 's peer - to - peer sharing technology when they sold to eBay for $ 2.6bn in 2005 .
( Which , of course , begs the question why eBay would pay all that money without ensuring they own the entire platform ) .
The ruckus has some financial experts predicting it could delay the IPO and lower the amount raised .
ebay chief John Donahoe reckons
Skype is worth more than $ 2bn — but the prospect of the service being broken when its on the block has investors worried .
IP lawsuits may be commonplace in the tech world , but it could scare folks away from the public offering .
If Joltid win the lawsuit , the effect would be " devastating , " Skype 's attorney Charles Hollander told the court .
The service would " exit the market whilst we embark on a lengthy and costly process of developing an alternative form of software code , " he said .
Bloomberg speculates that with a potentially damaging lawsuit looming overhead , there 's an increased chance eBay could sell to a private investor that 's willing to settle rather than hold an IPO .
Or eBay could settle with Joltid itself .
Either way , it appears the Skype founders have eBay right where they want 'em . ®
" People used to compare him to Jesus , " says a backstage manager as David Bazan walks offstage , guitar in hand .
" But not so much anymore . "
It 's Thursday , July 2 , and Bazan has just finished his set at Cornerstone , the annual Christian music festival held on a farm near Bushnell , Illinois .
He has n't betrayed his crowd the way Dylan did when he went electric — this is something very different .
The kids filling the 1,500 - capacity tent know their Jesus from their Judas .
There was a time when Bazan 's fans believed he was speaking , or rather singing , the Word .
Not so much anymore .
As front man for Pedro the Lion , the band he led from 1995 till 2005 , Bazan was Christian indie rock 's first big crossover star , predating Sufjan by nearly a decade and paving the way for the music 's success outside the praise circuit .
But as he straddled the secular and spiritual worlds , Bazan began to struggle with his faith .
Unable to banish from his mind the possibility that the God he'd loved and prayed to his whole life did n't exist , he started drinking heavily .
In '05 , the last time he played Cornerstone , he was booted off the grounds for being shitfaced , a milk jug full of vodka in his hand .
( The festival is officially dry . )
I worked as Bazan 's publicist from 2000 till 2004 .
When I ran into him in April — we were on a panel together at the Calvin College Festival of Faith & Music in Grand Rapids — I had n't seen him or talked to him in five and a half years .
The first thing he said to me was " I 'm not sure if you know this , but my relationship with Christ has changed pretty dramatically in the last few years . "
He went on to explain that since 2004 he 's been flitting between atheist , skeptic , and agnostic , and that lately he 's hovering around agnostic — he can't flat - out deny the presence of God in the world , but he does n't exactly believe in him either .
Pedro the Lion won a lot of secular fans in part because Bazan 's lyrics — keen examinations of faith , set to fuzzed - out guitar hooks — have a through - a - glass - darkly quality , acknowledging the imperfection of human understanding rather than insisting on the obviousness of an absolute truth .
As the post - 9/11 culture wars began to heat up , Pedro the Lion albums took a turn toward the parabolic : an outraged Bazan churned out artful songs about what befalls the righteous and the folly of those who believe God is on their side .
Bazan 's relationship with the divine started out pretty uncomplicated , though .
Raised outside Seattle in the Pentecostal church where his father was the music director , he hewed closely to Christian orthodoxy , attended Bible college , and married at 23 .
Now 33 , he did n't do a lot of thinking about politics until the 1999 WTO protests .
" Growing up , Christianity did n't feel oppressive for the most part , because it was filtered through my parents .
They were and are so sincere , and I saw in them a really pure expression of unconditional love and service , " he says .
" Once I stepped away , I could see the oppression of it . "
Bazan 's Curse Your Branches , due September 1 on Barsuk , is a visceral accounting of what happened after that .
It 's a harrowing breakup record — except he 's dumping God , Jesus , and the evangelical life .
It 's his first full - length solo album and also his most autobiographical effort : its drunken narratives , spasms of spiritual dissonance , and family tensions are all scenes from the recent past .
Bazan says he tried to Band - Aid his loss of faith and the painful end of Pedro the Lion with about 18 months of " intense " drinking .
" If I did n't have responsibilities , if I was n't watching [ my daughter ]
Ellanor , I had a deep drive to get blacked out , " he says .
But as he made peace with where he found himself , the compulsion to get obliterated began to wane .
On Curse Your Branches Bazan sometimes directs the blame and indignation at himself , other times at Jesus and the faith .
He 's mourning what he 's lost , and he knows there 's no going back .
" All fallen leaves should curse their branches / For not letting them decide where they should fall /
And not letting them refuse to fall at all , " he sings on the title track , with more than a touch of fuck - you in his voice .
On " When We Fell , " backed by a galloping beat and Wilson - boys harmonies , he calls faith a curse put on him by God : " If my mother cries when I tell her what I discovered / Then I hope she remembers she told me to follow my heart /
And if you bully her like you 've done me with fear of damnation /
Then I hope she can see you for what you are . "
The album closer , " In Stitches , " may be the best song Bazan 's ever written .
It 's the most emotionally bare piece on the album and as close as he comes to a complete thesis :
This brown liquor wets my tongue
My fingers find the stitches
Firmly back and forth they run
I need no other memory
Of the bits of me I left
When all this lethal drinking
Is hopefully to forget
About you
He follows it with an even more devastating verse , confessing that his efforts to erase God have failed :
I might as well admit it
Like I 've even got a choice
The crew have killed the captain
But they still can hear his voice
A shadow on the water
A whisper in the wind
On long walks my with daughter
Who is lately full of questions
About you
About you
The second " about you " comes in late , in a keening falsetto , and those two words carry his entire tangle of feelings — anger , desire , confusion , grief .
Since the jug - of - vodka incident , Bazan has kept a pretty low profile , doing a couple modest solo tours and releasing an EP of raw - sounding songs on Barsuk .
Pedro the Lion was a reliable paycheck — most of its albums sold in the neighborhood of 50,000 copies , and the group toured regularly , drawing 400 to 600 people a night .
His most recent tour could n't have been more different : Bazan does n't have a road band put together yet for his solo stuff , but he could n't afford to wait for Curse Your Branches to come out .
So he found another way to keep in touch with his most devoted fans , booking 60 solo shows in houses and other noncommercial spaces .
He played intimate acoustic sets to maybe 40 people each night , at $ 20 a ticket , and took questions between songs — some of them , unsurprisingly , about the tough spiritual questions his new material raises .
Despite his outspokenness on those questions , he was invited back to Cornerstone for the first time this year .
" I know David has a long history of being a seeker and trying to navigate through his faith .
Cornerstone is open to that , " says John Herrin , the festival 's director .
" We welcome plenty of musicians who may not identify themselves as Christians but are artists with an ongoing connection to faith .
. . .
We 're glad to have him back .
We do n't give up on people ; we do n't give up on the kids here who are seeking , trying to figure out what they do n't believe and what they do .
This festival was built on patience . "
At Cornerstone , where I catch up with him behind the fair - food midway , Bazan laughs when I suggest that he 's there trying to save the Christians .
" I am .
I am really invested , because I came up in it and I love a lot of evangelical Christians — I care what happens with the movement , " he says .
" The last 30 years of it have been hijacked ; the boomer evangelicals , they were seduced in the most embarrassing and scandalous way into a social , political , and economical posture that is the antithesis of Jesus 's teaching . "
With Curse Your Branches and in his recent shows , he 's inverting the usual call to witness : " You might be the only Christian they ever meet . "
He 's the doubter 's witness , and he might be the only agnostic some of these Christian kids ever really listen to .
When I talk to some of those kids in the merch tent the day after Bazan 's set , many of them seem to be trying to spin the new songs , straining to categorize them as Christian so they can justify continuing to listen to them .
One fan says it 's good that Bazan is singing about the perils of sin , " particularly sexual sin . "
Another interprets the songs as a witness of addiction , the testimony of the stumbling man .
Cultural critic and progressive Christian author David Dark , who since 2003 has become one of Bazan 's closest friends , claims that Bazan 's skepticism and anger are in line with biblical tradition .
" I doubt this is what your average Cornerstone attendee means , but when David is addressing his idea of his God , the one that he fears exists but refuses to believe in , when he is telling him , ' If this is the situation with us and you , then fuck you — the people who love you , I hope they see you for who you are , ' when he 's doing that , he is at his most biblical .
If we are referring to the deep strains of complaint and prayers and tirades against conceptions of God in the Bible — yes , then in that way he's in your Christian tradition .
But I disagree that he's an advocate for the biblical . "
When I tell Bazan that there are kids at Cornerstone resisting the clear message of his songs , he 's surprised .
" That someone could listen to what I was saying and think that I was saying it apologetically — like , in a way that characterizes [ doubt ] as the wrong posture — bums me out , but that 's pretty high - concept given how I 'm presenting this stuff .
So I have to hand it to someone who can keep on spinning what is so clearly something else . "
He pauses for a long moment , then adds , " I do n't want to be that misunderstood . "
During the two days I follow Bazan and his fans around the Cornerstone campus , though , it becomes clear that he is n't really misunderstood at all .
Everyone knows what he 's singing about — what 's happening is that his listeners are taking great pains to sidestep the obvious .
" Well , his songs have always been controversial , " one says , but when asked to pinpoint the source of the controversy suggests it 's because he swears — nothing about not believing in hell or not taking the Bible as God 's word .
Bazan 's agnosticism is the elephant in the merch tent .
Fans rhapsodize about Bazan 's work : they love his honesty , they love how they can relate to him , how he 's not proselytizing , how he 's speaking truth — but they do n't tend to delve into what exactly that truth might be .
Brice Evans , a 24 - year - old from Harrisburg , Illinois , who came to Cornerstone specifically to see Bazan 's set , dances artfully around it .
" He 's showing a side of Christianity that no other band shows , " Evans says .
" He 's trying to get a message across that 's more than that . "
It 's hard to say if anybody is conscious of the irony : the " side of Christianity " Bazan sings about is disenfranchisement from it .
" I think with Curse Your Branches David expands the space of the talk - about - able , " says Dark .
" It 's not confessional in the sense that he 's down on himself and trying to confess something to God in hopes of being forgiven .
I think that 's what crowds are trying to make of him , but they 're going to have a tougher time when they get the record . "
Bazan is known for his dialogues with fans , and during his set he 's affable , taking questions from the crowd .
Tonight 's audience , openly anxious and awed , keeps it light at first : " Would you rather be a werewolf or a vampire ? "
Then he opens with the new album 's lead track , " Hard to Be , " a sobering song with an especially hard - hitting second verse :
Wait just a minute
You expect me to believe
That all this misbehaving
Grew from one enchanted tree ?
And helpless to fight it
We should all be satisfied
With this magical explanation
For why the living die
And why it 's hard to be
Hard to be , hard to be
A decent human being ?
By the time he finishes those lines I can see half a dozen people crying ; a woman near me is trembling and sobbing .
Others have their heads in their hands .
Many look stunned , but no one leaves .
When the song ends , the applause is thunderous .
After Bazan plays a cover of Leonard Cohen 's " Hallelujah , " reinstating the sacrilegious verses left out of the best - known versions , someone shouts , " How 's your soul ? "
Bazan looks up from tuning his guitar and says , " My soul ?
Oh , it 's fine . "
This elicits an " Amen , brother ! " from the back of the tent .
Following Bazan 's set a throng of fans — kids , young women with babies on their hips , a handful of youth pastors — queues up around the side of the stage to talk to him .
Some kids want hugs and ask geeked - out questions , but just as many attempt to feel him out in a sly way .
" I really wished you had played ' Lullaby , ' " says one kid , naming a very early Pedro the Lion song that 's probably the most worshipful in Bazan 's catalog .
A few gently bait him , referring to scripture the way gang members throw signs , eager for a response that will reveal where Bazan is really at .
During discussions like this Bazan does n't usually get into the subtle barometric fluctuations in his relationship with Jesus , but that still leaves room for plenty of postshow theological talk .
" This process feels necessary and natural for these people , " he says .
" They 're in a precarious situation — maybe I am too .
To maintain their particular posture , they have to figure out :
Do they need to get distance from me , or is it just safe enough to listen to ?
I empathize as people are trying to gauge , ' Is this guy an atheist ?
Because I heard he was . ' "
Bazan has chosen sides , but old ideas linger .
" Some time ago , we were discussing [ the Pedro the Lion song ] ' Foregone Conclusions , ' " Dark says .
" I told him I was impressed with the lines ' You were too busy steering conversation toward the Lord / To hear the voice of the Spirit / Begging you to shut the fuck up /
You thought it must be the devil / Trying to make you go astray / Besides it could not have been the Lord / Because you do n't believe
He talks that way . '
I thought , what a liberating word for people who 've been shoved around by all manner of brainwash .
But also Dave 's doing something even more subtle , as many interpret the unforgivable sin to be blasphemy against the Holy Spirit — confusing the voice of God for the voice of the devil — so there 's a whole ' nother level of theological devastation going on in the song .
" When I brought it up , he laughed and told me he still worries about going to hell for that one .
He knows that it 's horribly funny that he feels that way , but he wo n't lie by saying he 's entirely over it .
He 's both 100 percent sincere and 100 percent ironically detached .
He 's haunted even as he pushes forward , saying what he feels even though he half fears doing so will be cosmically costly for him . "
After a long few years in the wilderness , Bazan seems happy — though he 's still parsing out his beliefs , he 's visibly relieved to be out and open about where he 's not at .
" It 's more comfortable for me to be agnostic , " he says .
" There 's less internal tension by far — that 's even with me duking it out with my perception of who God is on a pretty regular basis , and having a lot of uncertainty on that level .
For now , just being is enough .
Whether things happen naturally , completely outside an author , or whether the dynamics of earth and people are that way because God created them — or however you want to credit it — if you look around and pay attention and observe , there is enough right here to know how to act , to know how to live , to be at peace with one another .
" Because I grew up believing in hell and reckoning , there is a voice in me that says , ' That might not cut it with the man upstairs , ' but I think that that has to be enough .
For me it is enough . "

Chris Parry actually advocated attacking " negros " and blaming the republicans for it .

Freepers , get the word out loud and wide .
The Vancouver Sun " jounalist " Chris Parry that defamed Jim Robinson and FreeRepublic is none other than radical left blogger " Hollywoodoz " at the Daily Kos .
In addition to writting for the Vancouver Sun , Chris is a frustrated and failed internet entrepernuer having launched many websites and blogs , all of which have virtually no traffic , following , or success .
Chris also writes movie reviews , though these are pretty lame .
Chris Parry actually advocated attacking " negros " and blaming the republicans for it .
See this post at the Daily Kos by " hollywoodoz " , who is in reallity , as proven below Chris Parry of the Vancouver Sun .
See it here : http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/9/9/10324/92702
This spells BUSH , CHENEY , BROWN .
Now if this is not grounds for losing your job at the Vancouver Sun , I do n't know what is .
Bloody Useless Sack of Hatred Can He Eat Negro Eyes Yet Blaming Republicans Only Works Now Chris
Parry to state it again , has advocated attacking blacks and blaming republicans .
This explains his article attacking FreeRepublic about post about the Obama girls .
Amazing .
Looks like Chris has done what he advocated back in his Daily Kos post .
Additional FACTS ( links and back up below )
A review of Chris Parry 's posts on Daily Kos and other places on the net reveals that far from being an unbiased reported printing the facts , Chris Parry has called for or stated , among other things : - Violence against those that disagree with him and his left wing beliefs .
( 1 ) - Chris has written in the Daily Kos that people should be " google bombing " Bill O'reilly as a " terrorist sympathizer . "
Is that what we should expect from unbiased media writters at the Vancouver Sun ?
( 2 ) - Bashed Carrie - Prejean in his Sun articles to support his personal biases as exposed in the Daily Kos ( 3 ) - Bashed " tea parties " in his articles which were then held up by the left as proof that tea parties failed .
Afterall , this news came from a real " reporter " unbiased in his coverage right ?
( 4 ) - Supports Michael Moore as he bashes President Bush with the usual left crap while at the same time calling himself " an objective writer " ( yes , he is that wacked out ) ( 5 ) - Says it is " understandable " why Saddam tried to kill Bush Senior .
Yikes , that is scary .
( 6 ) - Apparently has a preference for " girl on girl action " ( moderator , see the link below ) .
Guess this disproves those that thought he went the other way .
With a blogging name like " hollywoodoz " one might have thought he was searching over the " rainbow " for other types in Hollywood .
( 7 ) -
There is evidence of his being in contact with Markos Moulitsas of the Kos .
No conspiracy here , just facts .
( 8 ) - Apparently Chris Parry is a loan shark of sorts taking money and interest from small international companies desperate for cash .
He has even funded palestinean construction .
Interesting .
( 9 ) - What motivated Chris Parry to attack FreeRepublic and Jim Robinson ?
The evidence is clear that Chris Parry has his own left agenda , one proven by his posts in the Daily Kos. - Chris is Canadian .
Does n't he have enough problems in his own country to write about .
All the political articles he has written are about the US and left leaning .
All his other articles deal with Canada .
Odd .
Note this hit on Condi Rice .
The guy is a nut .
( 10 ) MY OPINONTake the time to follow the facts below and then get this out to his boss at the Vancouver Sun and to the MSM , and in particular David Shuster who will be reporting on Chris Parry 's Vancouver Sun article on Monday .
If Shuster is to quote Chris Parry , he ought to state that he also a left wing blogger for Daily Kos who advocates punching " you in the fucking head " if you disagree with him and that Chris Parry also has manipulated information to destroy others before and advocated attacking blacks and blaming it on republicans .
All of Chris Parry 's posts on the Daily Kos where he uses the name " hollywoodoz " use this phrase each time , " Fool me once , I 'll punch you in the fucking head . "
Chris , violence is not the answer man .
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/9/11/2022/05238 is the Daily Kos page where Chris Parry exposes himself as Hollywoodoz the Kos blogger .
His company Unreel Media is listed here .

This is what took so long to post .
Will post when found in ten minutes .

Apparently Chris Parry likes to see " girl on girl action "
See this from his about page : " From video games to cars , home theater systems to food , girl - on - girl DVD action and how to turn your coffee table into a pinball machine , if its something a dude named Chuck might enjoy , well collect the info from the best resources and bring it all together for you , right here . "
The domain is registered in this name when you look up the who is .
( 8 ) http://efilmcritic.com/feature.php?feature=1143 tells people to go to Daily Kos and support Markos Moulitsas 's website .
The article clearly states he is in contact with Markos .

Google has plenty of work to do on its forthcoming Chrome OS before rivals like Microsoft or Apple need to worry too much .
But Microsoft can't just point and laugh , either .
Its Windows ( " Client " ) business -- the one Google is attacking -- represents more than $ 10 billion of annual operating income , more than half of the company 's total .

And as Weber pointed out , the most successful F1 driver of all time , a man with 91 grand prix wins to his name , is not one to settle for second best .
" When Michael was racing he would get as close to perfection as possible , " Weber said on Tuesday .
" In this case , it would not be perfection ; it would be a gamble - and that 's not Michael 's style . "
The automotive industry is a large one , encompassing obvious businesses such as car manufacturers , as well as a host of other related ones that design , market and sell cars , other motor vehicles ( like mopeds and motorcycles ) and trailers .
Indeed , by 2030 it is estimated that the “ automotive industry will grow to just under nine trillion U.S. dollars ” worldwide .
If you add in other companies that revolve around the maintenance of vehicles following their sale , then it ’s easy to understand just how comprehensive and diverse the auto industry really is and just how much it contributes to the global economy .
For car enthusiasts , this is especially good news , as it means there are a slew of opportunities for working with and on and around cars and trucks .
Here are five jobs with a range of requisite skills for car lovers to consider :
Valet
Valets are the people who park your car when you visit many upscale restaurants , clubs and hotels .
Often a valid driver ’s license , clean driving record and good customer service skills are the only requirements necessary to land a valet position , allowing almost anyone with responsible driving experience to get behind the wheel of all manner of vehicles , from Pintos to Maseratis .
Car Detailer
Similarly , no degree or experience is required to be a car detailer .
If you are physically fit and able to move freely , you can often find a job washing and detailing cars , allowing you to see and work with a variety of cars without having to have any specialized skills .
Car Restorer
For people with experience as an auto mechanic , however , a job as a car restorer can lead to a lucrative career .
The number of dedicated car restoration shops in the U.S. is dwindling , creating great demand for skilled car restorers .
A car restorer is more than a mechanic and , as such , needs to have a lot of experience with classic car parts , as well as extensive knowledge of welding , paint , interior trim accessories and more .
Further expertise , either regarding country of origin or model , also enhances job opportunities as British and American and other European or Asian cars are all different , requiring different skill sets with various degrees of complexity .
For people with the right background and practical training , a job as a car restorer can permit daily interaction with a prized type of car and the satisfaction of knowing you are restoring a piece of history .
Automotive Instructor
If you like people , a job teaching others about cars can be a wonderful way to help the community while simultaneously indulging your love of cars .
A college degree is necessary for teaching most secondary and college - level courses , and some public schools will require their instructors to have a teaching certificate , as well .
Automotive instructors are responsible for teaching students about engine and transmissionperformance and repair , as well as other related vehicle systems ( i.e. , climate control , electrical , brake , suspension and more ) .
Car Salesman
Of course , some car aficionados might like to sell cars for a living .
As an automotive salesman , you could work around cars but not necessarily have to get your hands dirty working on them !
Depending on the type of dealership and the location , you may or may not need a college degree to begin working as a car salesman , making it a good choice for people with varying levels of education .
Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have recently demonstrated a breakthrough in the quantum control of photons , the energy quanta of light .
This is a significant result in quantum computation , and could eventually have implications in banking , drug design , and other applications .
In a paper published in the journal Nature , UCSB physics researchers Max Hofheinz , John Martinis , and Andrew Cleland document how they used a superconducting electronic circuit known as a Josephson phase qubit to prepare highly unusual quantum states using microwave - frequency photons .
The breakthrough is the result of four years of work in the laboratories of Cleland and Martinis .
The project is funded by the federal agency called the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity , or IARPA .
The government is particularly interested in quantum computing because of the way banking and other important communications are currently encrypted .
Using large numbers , with hundreds of digits , encryption codes are changed daily and would take years of traditional computing to break .
Quantum computing could potentially break those codes quickly , destroying current encryption schemes .
In the experiments , the photons were stored in a microwave cavity , a " light trap " in which the light bounces back and forth as if between two mirrors .
In earlier work , these researchers showed they could create and store photons , one at a time , with up to 15 photons stored at one time in the light trap .
The research shows that they can create states in which the light trap simultaneously has different numbers of photons stored in it .
For example , it can simultaneously have zero , three , and six photons at the same time .
Measuring the quantum state by counting how many photons are stored forces the trap to " decide " how many there are ; but prior to counting , the light trap exists in a quantum superposition , with all three outcomes possible .
Explaining the paradoxical simultaneity of quantum states , Cleland said that it 's like having your cake and eating it –– at the same time .
" These superposition states are a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics , but this is the first time they have been controllably created with light , " Cleland said .
Martinis added , " This experiment can be thought of as a quantum digital - to - analog converter . "
As digital - to - analog converters are key components in classical communication devices ( for example , producing the sound waveforms in cell phones ) , this experiment might enable more advanced communication protocols for the transmission of quantum information .
First author Hofheinz designed and performed the measurements .
He is a postdoctoral researcher from Germany who has been working at UCSB for the last two years on this project .
The devices used to perform the experiment were made by Haohua Wang , a postdoctoral researcher from China , who is second author on the Nature publication .
The scientists said their research is leading to the construction of a quantum computer , which will have applications in information encryption and in solving or simulating problems that are not amenable to solution using standard computers .
Then Harvey started Help ! magazine .
I just discovered it one day , and said , hello , what ’s this ?
For me , the best thing about Help !
were the fumetti , the funny photo - stories that Harvey was doing .
I ’d never seen anything like that before .
So we started doing those .
That was the next step for me towards film - making : suddenly we were going out and doing photo - shoots , dressing people up and finding locations and telling stories .
I started sending the magazines to Harvey , because I just wanted him to see who was out there copying him , the monster he ’d helped create .
He sent back a really nice letter which was the beginning of the end , or the beginning of the beginning .
Once he was over the fence , Peter just could n't resist taking a parting shot at Mr. McGregor .

We ’re in love with stuff — with shopping , with acquiring , with owning , with collecting .
Let ’s lust after life instead .
Our obsession with stuff has become unhealthy .
When we have a void in our lives , we buy things .
When we have problems , we buy things .
And these things are becoming more and more expensive , bigger , shinier … more wasteful .
This obsession with stuff leads to owning a lot , having a lot of clutter … and yet this stuff does n’t fill our lives with meaning .
It leads to deep debt , from buying so much , and needing bigger houses and storage spaces to contain everything .
Financially , we ’re worse off than ever , because of this obsession with stuff .
We buy things when we ’re depressed , we buy things for others to show how much we love them … and in this way , stuff has separated us from actually dealing with our emotions , blocked us from truly connecting with others .
Let ’s replace that lust for stuff with a lust for life .
Some ideas :
After the relatively free ( if sporadic ) flow of news , tweets , video and photographs from Iran the past several days , today saw a tighter clampdown , with the government officially banning foreign media from covering rallies and taking further efforts to block online communications .
Though photographs from inside Iran are now more rare , there are still a few available .
Collected here are three mini-collections : images of reactions from Iranians abroad and the international community , images of pro-Ahmadinejad rallies from Iran ( allowed under current restrictions ) , and several photos from continued rallies held today in support of reformist Mir Hossein Mousavi .

Want to start a startup ?
Get funded by Y Combinator .
July 2009
Now that the term " ramen profitable " has become widespread , I ought to explain precisely what the idea entails .
Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders ' living expenses .
This is a different form of profitability than startups have traditionally aimed for .
Traditional profitability means a big bet is finally paying off , whereas the main importance of ramen profitability is that it buys you time . [ 1 ]
In the past , a startup would usually become profitable only after raising and spending quite a lot of money .
A company making computer hardware might not become profitable for 5 years , during which they spent $ 50 million .
But when they did they might have revenues of $ 50 million a year .
This kind of profitability means the startup has succeeded .
Ramen profitability is the other extreme : a startup that becomes profitable after 2 months , even though its revenues are only $ 3000 a month , because the only employees are a couple 25 year old founders who can live on practically nothing .
Revenues of $ 3000 a month do not mean the company has succeeded .
But it does share something with the one that 's profitable in the traditional way : they do n't need to raise money to survive .
Ramen profitability is an unfamiliar idea to most people because it only recently became feasible .
It 's still not feasible for a lot of startups ; it would not be for most biotech startups , for example ; but it is for many software startups because they 're now so cheap .
For many , the only real cost is the founders ' living expenses .
The main significance of this type of profitability is that you 're no longer at the mercy of investors .
If you 're still losing money , then eventually you 'll either have to raise more or shut down .
Once you 're ramen profitable this painful choice goes away .
You can still raise money , but you do n't have to do it now .
* * *
The most obvious advantage of not needing money is that you can get better terms .
If investors know you need money , they 'll sometimes take advantage of you .
Some may even deliberately stall , because they know that as you run out of money you 'll become increasingly pliable .
But there are also three less obvious advantages of ramen profitability .
One is that it makes you more attractive to investors .
If you 're already profitable , on however small a scale , it shows that ( a ) you can get at least someone to pay you , ( b ) you 're serious about building things people want , and ( c ) you 're disciplined enough to keep expenses low .
This is reassuring to investors , because you 've addressed three of their biggest worries .
It 's common for them to fund companies that have smart founders and a big market , and yet still fail .
When these companies fail , it 's usually because ( a ) people would n't pay for what they made , e.g. because it was too hard to sell to them , or the market was n't ready yet , ( b ) the founders solved the wrong problem , instead of paying attention to what users needed , or ( c ) the company spent too much and burned through their funding before they started to make money .
If you 're ramen profitable , you 're already avoiding these mistakes .
Another advantage of ramen profitability is that it 's good for morale .
A company tends to feel rather theoretical when you first start it .
It 's legally a company , but you feel like you 're lying when you call it one .
When people start to pay you significant amounts , the company starts to feel real .
And your own living expenses are the milestone you feel most , because at that point the future flips state .
Now survival is the default , instead of dying .
A morale boost on that scale is very valuable in a startup , because the moral weight of running a startup is what makes it hard .
Startups are still very rare .
Why do n't more people do it ?
The financial risk ?
Plenty of 25 year olds save nothing anyway .
The long hours ?
Plenty of people work just as long hours in regular jobs .
What keeps people from starting startups is the fear of having so much responsibility .
And this is not an irrational fear : it really is hard to bear .
Anything that takes some of that weight off you will greatly increase your chances of surviving .
A startup that reaches ramen profitability may be more likely to succeed than not .
Which is pretty exciting , considering the bimodal distribution of outcomes in startups : you either fail or make a lot of money .
The fourth advantage of ramen profitability is the least obvious but may be the most important .
If you do n't need to raise money , you do n't have to interrupt working on the company to do it .
Raising money is terribly distracting .
You 're lucky if your productivity is a third of what it was before .
And it can last for months .
I did n't understand ( or rather , remember ) precisely why raising money was so distracting till earlier this year .
I 'd noticed that startups we funded would usually grind to a halt when they switched to raising money , but I did n't remember exactly why till YC raised money itself .
We had a comparatively easy time of it ; the first people I asked said yes ; but it took months to work out the details , and during that time I got hardly any real work done .
Why ?
Because I thought about it all the time .
At any given time there tends to be one problem that 's the most urgent for a startup .
This is what you think about as you fall asleep at night and when you take a shower in the morning .
And when you start raising money , that becomes the problem you think about .
You only take one shower in the morning , and if you 're thinking about investors during it , then you 're not thinking about the product .
Whereas if you can choose when you raise money , you can pick a time when you 're not in the middle of something else , and you can probably also insist that the round close fast .
You may even be able to avoid having the round occupy your thoughts , if you do n't care whether it closes .
* * *
Ramen profitable means no more than the definition implies .
It does not , for example , imply that you 're " bootstrapping " the startup — that you 're never going to take money from investors .
Empirically that does n't seem to work very well .
Few startups succeed without taking investment .
Maybe as startups get cheaper it will become more common .
On the other hand , the money is there , waiting to be invested .
If startups need it less , they 'll be able to get it on better terms , which will make them more inclined to take it .
That will tend to produce an equilibrium . [ 2 ]
Another thing ramen profitability does n't imply is Joe Kraus 's idea that you should put your business model in beta when you put your product in beta .
He believes you should get people to pay you from the beginning .
I think that 's too constraining .
Facebook did n't , and they 've done better than most startups .
Making money right away was not only unnecessary for them , but probably would have been harmful .
I do think Joe 's rule could be useful for many startups , though .
When founders seem unfocused , I sometimes suggest they try to get customers to pay them for something , in the hope that this constraint will prod them into action .
The difference between Joe 's idea and ramen profitability is that a ramen profitable company does n't have to be making money the way it ultimately will .
It just has to be making money .
The most famous example is Google , which initially made money by licensing search to sites like Yahoo .
Is there a downside to ramen profitability ?
Probably the biggest danger is that it might turn you into a consulting firm .
Startups have to be product companies , in the sense of making a single thing that everyone uses .
The defining quality of startups is that they grow fast , and consulting just can't scale the way a product can . [ 3 ]
But it 's pretty easy to make $ 3000 a month consulting ; in fact , that would be a low rate for contract programming .
So there could be a temptation to slide into consulting , and telling yourselves you 're a ramen profitable startup , when in fact you 're not a startup at all .
It 's ok to do a little consulting - type work at first .
Startups usually have to do something weird at first .
But remember that ramen profitability is not the destination .
A startup 's destination is to grow really big ; ramen profitability is a trick for not dying en route .
Notes
[ 1 ] The " ramen " in " ramen profitable " refers to instant ramen , which is just about the cheapest food available .
Please do not take the term literally .
Living on instant ramen would be very unhealthy .
Rice and beans are a better source of food .
Start by investing in a rice cooker , if you do n't have one .
Rice and Beans for 2n olive oil or butter n yellow onions other fresh vegetables ; experiment 3n cloves garlic n 12 - oz cans white , kidney , or black beans n cubes Knorr beef or vegetable bouillon n teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 3n teaspoons ground cumin n cups dry rice , preferably brown
Put rice in rice cooker .
Add water as specified on rice package .
( Default : 2 cups water per cup of rice . )
Turn on rice cooker and forget about it .
Chop onions and other vegetables and fry in oil , over fairly low heat , till onions are glassy .
Put in chopped garlic , pepper , cumin , and a little more fat , and stir .
Keep heat low .
Cook another 2 or 3 minutes , then add beans ( do n't drain the beans ) , and stir .
Throw in the bouillon cube(s ) , cover , and cook on lowish heat for at least 10 minutes more .
Stir vigilantly to avoid sticking .
If you want to save money , buy beans in giant cans from discount stores .
Spices are also much cheaper when bought in bulk .
If there 's an Indian grocery store near you , they 'll have big bags of cumin for the same price as the little jars in supermarkets .
[ 2 ] There 's a good chance that a shift in power from investors to founders would actually increase the size of the venture business .
I think investors currently err too far on the side of being harsh to founders .
If they were forced to stop , the whole venture business would work better , and you might see something like the increase in trade you always see when restrictive laws are removed .
Investors are one of the biggest sources of pain for founders ; if they stopped causing so much pain , it would be better to be a founder ; and if it were better to be a founder , more people would do it .
[ 3 ]
It 's conceivable that a startup could grow big by transforming consulting into a form that would scale .
But if they did that they 'd really be a product company .

Introduction
In this feat , someone gives you a date , and you state the day of the week on which it fell .
This is done with a little memory work , and a very simple formula .
It 's easier than it may sound , and the reaction this feat gets is far out of proportion to the work required .
Simple Calendar Systems
If you 're only concerned with figuring out the day of the week for recent dates ( in the current year or within a few years ) , you may only need a simpler system .
Current Year System
In this system , you 'll use the MajorSystem or the DominicSystem to help you remember on which day the first of the month falls , and use that as a reference point to find the date .
First , you must find out the starting days for each month in the current year .
2005 , for example , looks like this :
January - Saturday
February - Tuesday
March - Tuesday
April - Friday
May - Sunday
June - Wednesday
July - Friday
August - Monday
September - Thursday
October - Saturday
November - Tuesday
December - Thursday
Each weekday is then converted into a number from 0 to 6 , where 0 equals a Sunday , and 6 equals a Saturday ( See section 3.3 for help in remembering which number represents which day ) .
In our 2005 example , this would result in the number :
622503514624
This number is then broken up into units of 3 digits , in order to make things easier to remember .
Continuing with our 2005 example , the number would now look like this :
622 503 514 624
Each of these years is then converted into an image using your preferred system for memorizing 3 - digit numbers ( MajorSystem or DominicSystem ) , and then linking each image together , to form a chain that will quickly tell you on what weekday the 1st of each month occurs .
To figure out any particular date in the year that you have memorized , you first need to recall on which day the 1st falls .
As an example , we 'll use September 12 , 2005 .
Since September is the 9th month , we use our mnemonic system to recall which is the 9th key number , which in this case is 4 , which means that September 2005 begins on a Thursday .
Once the weekday of the 1st of the month is determined , we need to adjust for the date .
September 12 , 2005 is 11 days after the 1st , so we add 11 to 4 ( our key number for the 1st of September ) , and we get 15 .
Casting out all multiples of 7 ( the nearest of which is 14 ) , we are left with a total of 1 . 1 , in our system represents Monday , so have determined that September 12 , 2005 , is on a Monday .
Recent Years System
In this system , only one weekday is needed to define a single year .
Since this method one needs one reference day , it 's often referred to as the " doomsday " method .
This is based on the fact that , in any given year , the dates 4/4 , 6/6 , 8/8 , 10/10 and 12/12 will always fall on the same day of the week .
This is also true of the easily remembered dates 5/9 , 9/5 , 7/11 , 11/7 , as well as the last day of February ( regardless of whether it's a leap year or not ) .
Once you 've figured out which day of the week this is , it 's a simple matter to adjust to the particular date you need .
As an example , let 's figure out on which weekday Halloween 2005 falls , given that the key weekday ( by the above standard ) for 2005 is Monday .
Since we 're looking for October , the 10th month , we know that October 10th falls on a Monday .
The 31st is exactly 3 weeks after that , so we know that Halloween is a Monday !
Moving on to a tougher example , we 'll try March 12th , 2005 .
There 's no easy key date for March ( the third month ) , but we do know that the last day of February is a Monday .
That means March 1st is a Tuesday .
The 12th is 1 week and 4 days later ( 11 days total ) , so all we have to do is jump ahead 4 days from Tuesday , giving us Saturday , as the day of the week for March 12 , 2005 .
Adjusting the Key Day for Different Years
As long as you know the wey weekday for a given year , you can quickly adjust for other nearby years .
The general rule is that , as you jump ahead one year , you move the key day ahead one day .
Conversely , if you wish to move back a year , you move back one key day .
2005 's key day is Monday , so 2006 's key day would be Tuesday .
The exceptions to this , of course , are leap years .
When moving from a non -leap year to a leap year , you have to move the key day ahead two days , instead of one .
Similarly , when moving backward from a leap - year to a non -leap year , you have to move the key day two days back .
Knowing that the key day for 2005 is Monday , how can we figure out on what weekday will July 4th , 2007 fall ?
First , we move the key day ahead two days , for the intervening two years ( with no leap years to worry about ) , giving us Wednesday as 2007 's key day .
July is the 7th month , so we know that 7/11/2007 will fall on a Wednesday .
Since the 4th is one week before that , we know that 7/4/2007 will fall on a Wednesday , as well .
So that you can understand how to work with leap years , we 'll use December 31st , 2002 as our next date .
First , we step back one key day from 2005 to 2004 ( Monday to Sunday ) .
Moving from 2004 to 2003 , we have to move back two key days from there ( Sunday to Friday ) , and finally move back one more key day ( Friday to Thursday ) for the move from 2003 to 2002 .
Since we have our key day as Thursday for 2002 , we know that 12/12/2002 is on a Thursday .
The 31st is 2 weeks and 5 days after that , so we simply move 5 days ahead from a Thursday , giving Tuesday .
Now we know that 12/31/2002 falls on a Tuesday .
Calendar Systems for Any Year
The previous systems work great for recent years .
However , if you wish to be able to quickly give the correct weekday for any given date ( back to 1582 , when the current calendar system was adopted ) , then you 'll want to use the following , more complex system .
The Month Mnemonics
You do need to associate a key number , 0 through 6 , with each month of the year .
Here are the months and their key numbers :
January - 0
February - 3
March - 3
April - 6
May - 1
June - 4
July - 6
August - 2
September - 5
October - 0
November - 3
December - 5
You 'll remember each of the numbers via a simple mnemonic , one for each month .
We 'll combine the first few letters of the month with a letter from the Major System that stands for the associated number .
Here 's the full list :
JANuS ?
( Two - faced Roman god after whom January is named )
FeMMe ?
Ma'aM
APiSH ?
MAiD ?
JUNioR ?
JUDGE
AUGUSTi``Ne
SELL
OCTOpuS ?
( Ignore P - which would be 9 )
NOVuM ?
( Think of the birth control pill - Ortho Novum )
DECiMaL ?
It should be a simple matter to associate each word with the corresponding month .
Methods for Year Key Numbers
Once you have the key numbers for the months down , you can start applying the formula .
First you need a key number for the year .
To keep initial instruction simple , we 'll just start by covering 1900 to 1999 .
There are several ways to get the key number for the year , and they will be described below .
The Classic Formula
Here 's the formula for the key number of the year : ( Y+ ( Y / 4 ) ) mod 7 .
Y is the last two digits of the year , ( Y / 4 ) is the year divided by 4 with NO remainder .
If you 're unsure what " mod " means , I 'll refer to it shortly .
It 's nothing complicated .
Our first example will be June 27 , 1959 .
Start by looking at the year .
Take the last two digits only and divide them by 4 .
The technically accurate answer would be 14.75 .
You do n't need to worry about any decimal places or remainders here , as 14 is good enough .
To make dividing by 4 easier , just round down to the nearest even number , and divide by 2 .
If you get an odd number as a result , round down to the nearest even number , and divide by 2 again .
For 1959 , you round down to 58 , divide by 2 , which gives you 29 .
29 is an odd number , so round down to 28 , and divide by 2 to give you 14 .
Take the result , and add it back to the year .
So now , we have 59 + 14 .
Mentally simplify this by changing it into 59 + 10 + 4 . 59 + 10 + 4 = 69 + 4 = 73 . 73 will be your key number for the year .
The " mod " in the earlier formula refers to a number to be " cast out " .
Since the number 70 is an easily recognized multiple of 7 , we can get rid of 70 , and just remember 3 .
So if our key number wound up being , say , 81 , we could subtract 77 ( the nearest multiple of 7 ) we 'd get 4 as the number to remember .
The " 12 - Year " Shortcut
Year Key 1900 0 1912 1 1924 2 1936 3 1948 4 1960 5 1972 6 1984 0 1996 1
One simpler method if quickly determining the year key number involves years ending in multiples of 12 :
Notice that that the last two digits of these years ( all leap years , except for 1900 ) , when divided by 12 ( with casting out 7s ) , give the year key number .
If you 're given any of these years , and you know your multiples of 12 , the key number is instantaneous .
If you 're given any other year , there are two simple adjustments to make .
As an example , we 'll say you 're given a date in 1982 .
First , you need to find the highest " 12 - year " below that date , which in our example , would be 1972 .
With 1972 , we instantly know that the key year is 6 .
To this , we add number of years since that " 12 - year " ( +10 in our example , giving us a running total of 16 ) .
The last adjustment is to compensate for all the leap years that have happened since the " 12 - year " .
The adjustment is made as follows :
1 ) If the given year is 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 years past the " 12 - year " , then add 0 .
2 ) If the given year is 4 , 5 , 6 or 7 years past the " 12 - year " , then add 1 .
3 ) If the given year is 8 , 9 , 10 or 11 years past the " 12 - year " , then add 2 .
In our 1982 example , it is 10 years since 1972 , so we would add a 2 to our running total , giving us 18 .
Casting out 7s , we get 4 as the key year for 1982 .
The " 11 - Year " Shortcut
Year Key 1900 0 1911 6 1922 6 1933 6 1944 6 1955 5 1966 5 1977 5 1988 5 1999 4
This is similar to the " 12 - year " shortcut , but can be a little trickier to apply .
First , notice that the years ending in multiples of 11 from 1911 to 1944 all have the key number of 6 , and the " 11 years " from 1955 to 1999 all have a key number of 5 ( with 1900 and 1999 being the exception ) :
Once you 're given a year to work with , you simply need to find the highest " 11 year " that is below it , and count forward from that year , adding one for each regular year and two for each leap year , to get the key number .
For example , if you 're given the year 1969 , you start counting from 1966 ( with a key number of 5 ) , 1967 gives you 6 , 1968 ( a leap year ) gives you 8 and 1969 gives gives you 9 .
Casting out 7s , this gives a key number of 2 for 1969 .
The Leap Year Shortcut
1900 0 1904 5 1908 3 1912 1 1916 6 1920 4 1924 2
In this shortcut , you only need to remember 7 different leap years .
With the exception the 00 years ( as described later ) , the pattern of years repeats itself every 28 years .
First , you need to memorize the first 7 leap years ( yes , I know 1900 is n't a leap year ) :
It 's a pretty simple pattern .
The lower 3 leap years are descending odd numbers , and the higher 3 are descending even numbers .
Once you 've learned this , each of these key numbers will also give the key number for years that are multiples of 28 years away :
1900 0 1928 1956 1984 1904 5 1932 1960 1988 1908 3 1936 1964 1992 1912 1 1940 1968 1996 1916 6 1944 1972 1920 4 1948 1976 1924 2 1952 1980
This will give you the key number for any key year quickly .
To get the key number for any other year , you simply find the nearest leap year before it , take that leap year 's key number , and add the difference in years .
For example , to get the key year for 1975 , you simply recall the key for 1972 ( which is the same as 1916 , 6 ) , and add 3 for the 3 - year difference , giving 9 .
Casting out the 7's gives us 2 as the key number for 1975 .
Another way to get the key number for a given leap year is to take twice the ten 's digit and subtract half the one 's digit , casting out 7's .
Using 1972 as an example , twice the ten's digit ( 7 ) is 14 and half the one 's digit ( 2 ) is 1 .
14 - 1 = 13 ; 13 - 7 = 6 .

To make this feat even faster , you can memorize the key numbers for each year .
For the year links , simply use the last two digits of the year as you 've defined in your Major System 100 , and link them to your images of 0 through 6 from the Number Shape System or the Number Rhyme System .
The key numbers for each year are listed below :
Figuring the Day of the Week
The method for getting the key number for the day of week is relatively simple .
You add the key number for the month and year together , and then add the date itself .
Once you cast out 7s , as described earlier , you 'll get a number from 0 through 6 , and that number will represent a day of the week as follows :
Sunday -- 0 ( Nothing to do on Sunday ! )
Monday -- 1 ( 1st day of the traditional work week )
Tuesday -- 2 ( TUESday = TWOSday )
Wednesday -- 3
( Halfway through the work week , halfway to 6 )
Thursday -- 4 ( Think " Foursday " )
Friday -- 5 ( " Friday " and " Five " both begin with F )
Saturday -- 6 ( " Saturday " and " Six " both begin with S )
You 'll note that more informal mnemonics are used here to associate the days with their corresponding key numbers .
As an example , let 's say we want to know on what day of the week June 27th , 1959 fell .
We 'll add as follows :
+3 ( Key number for 1959 )
+ 4 ( Key number for June )
+ 27 ( Date in month )
This totals 34 .
If we cast out all the 7s , we get 6 .
6 is the key number for Saturday , so June 27th , 1959 , fell on a Saturday ( which can be verified with a perpetual calendar ) .
Exceptions
The above basic method works for most dates , but there are a few exceptions which must be accounted for by further minor adjustments .
Leap Years
If you are given a date in January or February of a leap year , you must subtract 1 from your total to compensate .
If the given date is January 15 , 1968 , for example , we first make the calculations as taught :
+ 1 ( Key number for 1968 )
+0 ( Key number for January )
+15 ( Date in month )
This gives us 16 , and we cast out 7s , leaving us with 2 .
To compensate for being in the January of a leap year , we subtract 1 , giving us a final total of 1 .
This tells us that January 15 , 1968 fell on a Monday .
It 's important to know which years are leap years and which years are not .
Most years that are evenly divisible by 4 are leap years .
The exception to this rule is that years ending in " 00 " are only leap years if they are divisible by 400 ( 1600 , 2000 and 2400 are leap years , while 1800 , 1900 , and 2100 are not ) .
Other Centuries
The calendar repeats exactly every 400 years .
To figure years in other centuries , here 's the appropriate modifications :
1700s : add 4
1800s : add 2
1900s : add 0
2000s : add 6
2100s : add 4
2200s : add 2
2300s : add 0
... and so on , repeating regularly .
If you wanted to check on what day of the week on which July 4 , 1776 fell , you would calculate it as follows :
+ 4 ( key number for 1976 )
+ 4 ( compensate for the 1700s )
+ 6 ( key number for July )
+ 4 ( date )
This totals 18 , which is 4 , once the 7s are cast out .
This gives us Thursday .
Among the trickiest dates are leap years in other centuries .
On what day of the week did February 14th , 1852 fall ?
+ 2 ( key number for 1952 )
+ 2 ( compensate for 1800s )
+ 3 ( key number for February )
+ 14 ( date )
This gives us 21 , but it 's a leap year , so we need to subtract 1 , giving us 20 .
Casting out 7s gives us 6 , which indicates it was a Saturday .
day of the week at your fingertop
Some people want to reduce the calculation as much as possible and make it even easy for children to calculate a day of the week .
The following shortcut can be used to quickly get this within the current year .
On your left hand assign the month to each nuckle as follows
thumb index middle ring pink april , july february , march , november january , october juni may september , december augustus
To get a date on your fingers , go with your thumb to the proper month .
You are now on the 1st , 7th , 14th , 21st , 28th day of that week .
Going top down first from ring , middle , and index finger you get the proper day of the week .
For this year the top of the ring finger is sunday .
This will change after a year .
So to calculate the 20th of March , your thumb goes to the top of the middle finger ( which means that in this year the first day of March is on a wednesday ) .
After subtracting 14 , you get 6th day in march as the same day .
You are currently at the fifth so continue with 5 days , resulting in the middle of the ring finger .
This is the day after sunday , so monday .
Related Feats
Since the method for figuring out dates is a formula with several variables , you can use it to find more than just which day of the week a given date fell on .
You can rearrange the variables to give and amazing array of information about the years , dates and months , as well .
The following feats no longer focus on the day of the week itself .
Instead , the formulas in the following feats usually start with the key number for the day of the week as a known variable , and simply subtract other known information to compute a key for the month , year or date .
To avoid working with negative numbers , you 'll need to increase the key number for the day of the week .
Since multiples of 7 do n't affect the formula , and may need to subtract as much as 31 for the date and 6 for the month or year key ( but never the year and the month ) , it 's best to start by adding 42 to the day of the week key .
Similar Dates in the Same Year
You can make the calendar feat seem even more amazing by being able to tell how many occurences of a given date fall on a given weekday in a given year .
Being able to tell how many Saturday the 28ths or Friday the 13ths in a given year is very impressive , but not difficult .
You can perform this feat as an apparent afterthought after giving the weekday , or as a stand - alone feat .
After Giving the weekday
Let 's say you 're given the date November 12 , 1986 , not only can you tell them that it fell on a Wednesday .
Without any further calculations , you can also tell them that , in 1986 , the 12th also falls on a Wednesday in February and March , too .
This feat seems much more difficult than it really is .
To figure out when other days fall on the same day of the week , all you need to do is find other months ( if any ) that have the same key number .
First , remember that there will never be 4 or more occurrences of the same date on the same day of the week in any given year .
Here are a list of years , in order of their key dates :
0 ) January ( non-leap year ) and October
1 ) May ( If May 12th in a given year is on , say , a Tuesday , you can say definitively that there are no other months with Tuesday the 12th in that year )
2) February ( leap year ) and August
3 ) February ( non-leap year ) , March and November .
4 ) June ( Similar to May )
5 ) September and December
6 ) January ( leap year ) , April and July
These relationships may seem complex , but they can be mastered .
You can connect them using the MajorSystem :
0 ) JANuS ? being eaten by an OCTOpuS ?
1 ) MAiD? , all alone in a big empty room
2 ) FiBBiN ? ' August-iNe
3 ) FeMMe ? MA'aM taking ortho NOVuM ?
4 ) JUNioR ? , all alone in a big empty room
5 ) You 're trying to SELL to a giant DECiMaL ?
point
6 ) CHaNGe ? ( " Chanuary " ) from an APiSH ?
creature into a Judge
Even without mnemonics , these relationships can also be learned easily through sheer repetition .
Stand - Alone Version
Before you try and perform the stand - alone version , you should be comfortable with the month relationships by having performed the previous version .
As a stand - alone feat , there are calculations required , but they 're not any more difficult than the regular calendar feat , as states earlier .
Let 's say you 're asked how many Friday the 13ths occur in the year 1997 .
To answer this , we start with the key for the day of the week .
In our example , Friday is a 5 .
Start by adding 42 to it , giving 47 .
From this number , we 're going to subtract the year key and the date key .
Since we 're asked about 1997 , which has a key of 2 , we subtract 2 giving 45 .
Next , we subtract 13 for the day , giving us 32 .
Finally , we cast out the 7s , and we 're left with 4 .
The remaining number gives us the a month key .
In this case , the only 4 month is June ( remember " JUNioR ? , alone in a big empty room " ? ) , so we can reply that the only Friday the 13th in 1997 happens in June .
5 Weekdays
In this feat , someone gives you a year and a day of the week , and you are able to tell which months in that year have 5 of that weekday .
For example , if someone asks which months in 1995 have 5 Saturdays , you can tell them that July , April , September and December are the only months in 1995 that have 5 Saturdays .
Before performing this feat , you want to be familiar with which months have the same key numbers , as in " Similar Dates in the Same Year " .
We start by taking the requested day of the week , and adding 42 to its key .
As an example , we 'll say you 're asked which months in 1963 had 5 Tuesdays .
Since tuesday has a key number of 2 , we add 42 for a starting total of 44 .
Next , we subtract the key for the year .
Since 1963 's key is 1 , we subtract 1 from 44 , giving us 43 .
Now we subtract 1 for the date number .
At this step , 1 is always subtracted because the 1st of the month will always have 5 weeks for any month , except a non-leap year February .
Applying this final step , we get 42 , which becomes 0 after casting out 7's .
The remaining number gives us the month key for months in that year , with at least 29 days ( every month but a non -leap year February ) in which 5 of the given weekday can be found .
This number will also be further adjusted for months with 30 and 31 days .
In our example , we came up with a total of 0 , which tells us that , in 1963 , the months with a key of 0 and at least 29 days will have 5 Tuesdays in them .
These months are January and October .
Next , we subtract 1 to compensate for months consisting of at least 30 days .
All the months with this key ( except February ) will also have 5 of the given day .
0 minus 1 ( plus 7 , of course ) is 6 , so the " 6 " months , April and July , will also have 5 Tuesdays in 1963 .
Finally , 1 is subtracted again to compensate for 31 days months .
Be careful to not include February , September , April , June and November at this step , even if they have the right keys , because they all have less than 31 days .
In our example , 6 minus 1 is 5 , so the " 5 " months with 31 days will also have 5 Tuesdays in 1963 .
December and September are both " 5 " months , but September only has 30 days .
So , the answers to which months in 1963 had 5 Tuesdays are January , October , April , July and December .
Telling a Person's Age
Once you have the calendar feat down , you can learn an even more impressive feat by guessing a person 's age .
This is matter of reversing the above formula , as well as sharpening your age - approximation skills .
To do this , you need to have learned the version of this feat where you have memorized the key numbers for the years ( section 1.2.2 ) .
Hand a willing participant a perpetual calendar , and ask them to give their birthday , without the year , and the day of the week on which it fell .
While they 're looking up the day of the week for their birthday , estimate how old they are .
For this to work correctly , your guess needs to be within +/- 3 to 4 years of their actual age .
If you need practice estimating people 's ages , check out :
The Age Project

Google Search : Guessing a Person's Age
For an example , let 's say the person says " June 15th , Tuesday " , and you estimate that the person looks to be around 30 , and you 're performing this in 2004 ( yes , the current year is important ) .
Earlier , you learned that the date plus the month key number plus the year key number equals the day of week key number ( casting out 7s as you go ) .
In this feat , we 're going to solve for the year key number .
To start , take the weekday key number and add 42 to it .
From this , subtract the date and the key number for the month .
After casting out 7s , this will give you the year key number for which you will be searching .
In our example , the key for Tuesday is 2 .
Adding 42 to this gives 44 . 44 minus 15 ( the date ) is 29 .
The key number for 4 is June , so we subtract 4 from 29 , giving us 25 .
Casting out 7s , this gives us 4 .
We now know we 're searching for a year with a key number of 4 .
Using your estimate of the person's age , you need to recall which years around that time have the appropriate key number .
Since the person in our example looks to be 30 , and this is being performed in 2004 , we 're looking for a year around 1974 with a key number of 4 .
A quick mental run from 4 years before to 4 years after 1974 show that both 1971 and 1976 will fit the bill .
From here , you have to determine which age looks more appropriate for the person .
We know the person is probably either 33 or 28 , so how does the person carry themselves ?
If the person 's birthday is in January or February of a leap year , the key number you get from the equation will be incorrect .
But their are ways to figure this out and adjust .
If someone who looks to be in their mid- to late - 30s ( giving us an estimate of , say , 26 ) in 2004 says , " February 14th , Saturday " , you would calculate the key year as above .
Saturday is 6 , to which we add 42 , giving us 48 . 48 minus 14 ( the date ) is 34 . 34 minus 3 ( for February ) is 31 .
Casting out 7s , this leaves us with a key year of 3 .
Looking for years with a key number of 3 around 1978 , you 'll get either 1981 or 1970 .
Neither of these would seem to make sense in this case .
1981 would make him 23 , and this guy seemed to be older than 23 .
1970 would make him 34 , and this guy seems younger than 34 .
When you 're given a January or February date that results in two answers that are way off ( assuming your age - estimation skills are good ) , then you may be dealing with a leap year .
To adjust , add 1 to your year key number ( again , casting out 7s if necessary ) , and look through just nearby leap years .
Near 1978 would be 1980 and 1976 .
1980 has a key number of 2 , so that does n't work .
1976 , however , does have a key number of 4 , which would make this person 28 - right about where you estimated his age !
Fortunately , you only need to worry about the possibility of leap years if you 're given a January or February .
Some tips :
If given the date " February 29th " with a day of the week , always add 1 to the target year key number , and search only leap years !
If you estimate the person was born after 1999 , adjust the target key year by subtracting 6 ( or adding 1 ) .
When being tested by a woman , always give the lower of the two possible ages you 've determined .
You may be wrong , but you 'll be forgiven .
Why All the Calculations and Adjustments ?
Let 's imagine that the Earth takes exactly 336 days to go around the sun .
This 336 - day year would have 12 28 - day months without exception .
This would be very easy to work with , as not only would January 1st always fall on , say , a Sunday , but so would the first of every month !
On what day of the week does the 16th of any month in any year fall ?
Simple , it 's a Monday !
The phrase " leap year " would n't be in our vocabulary .
Unfortunately , this 336 - day year is only imaginary .
What if we had a 364 - day year ?
This is still pretty good , because there would be exactly 52 weeks in the years .
Unfortunately , 364 is n't evenly divisible by 12 , so some months would have more days , and others would have fewer ( or , we could simplify everything and have thirteen 28 - day months ! ) .
January 1st would always fall on the same day each year , but we 'd need to remember key numbers for each month , in order to adjust for the fact that not all months begin on that same day .
Having a 365 - day year makes things even trickier .
365 is n't evenly divisible by 7 or 12 !
If one year were to begin on a Sunday , the next year would begin on a Monday , and so on .
This means that , in addition to the month adjustments , we also have to have adjustments for each year .
Notice that , so far , leap years still have n't come into question .
Now , even a 365.25 - day year would n't be too bad .
We 'd simply have a leap year every 4 years to compensate for the missing day that accumulates in that time .
This is effectively the original Julian calendar .
What we actually have , however , is a 365.24237404 - day year ( the time from one vernal equinox to the next ) .
Our current Gregorian calendar approximates this by removing 3 leap years every 400 years by eliminating " 00 " years that are n't divisible by 400 , giving an average year of 365.2425 days .

Discussion
Worried you ’ll blink and miss a crucial piece of the action ?
Then you can relax .
While watching a film , we subconsciously control the timing of blinks to make sure we do n’t miss anything important .
And because we tend to watch films in a similar way , moviegoers often blink in unison , researchers find .
The flow of visual information to the brain is halted by up to 450 milliseconds with every blink , and we lose up to 6 seconds of information every minute , says Tamani Nakano at the University of Tokyo in Japan .
This means moviegoers who sit through a 150 - minute film have their eyes shut for up to 15 minutes .
Nakano and colleagues worked out how we cope with such extreme information loss .
They monitored the eye blinks of volunteers as they watched a clip of a silent comedy with a strong narrative , or a movie of an aquarium with no narrative , or listened to an audio book with a narrative , but not a visual one .
Hidden pattern
Using the timing of those blinks as a reference , the researchers then played the volunteers the same clip again and measured whether the eye blinks occurred at the same time as the reference blinks .
Advertisement
For all three kinds of clip , there was a strong correlation between the timing of blinks in the repeat viewing and the reference blinks .
That is because we blink so often that the chances of a repeat blink matching a reference one are high , says Nakano .
But after statistically filtering out that strong signal , the researchers found that between 23 and 31 per cent of blinks were synchronised when watching the silent movie , while the aquarium movie and the audio book had no such synchronisation .
So for at least some of the time , individuals will blink in unison while watching the same film .
“ This is the first study to demonstrate that blinks are excellently coordinated during video playback , ” says Nakano .
Window on the mind
The synchronised blinks occurred at “ non-critical ” points during the silent movie – at the conclusion of an action sequence or when the main character had disappeared from view .
“ We all commonly find implicit breaks for blinking while viewing a video story , ” Nakano says .
Geraint Rees at University College London thinks it is an interesting study .
This synchronisation between individuals “ implies that there ’s something common to everyone that is triggering the blinks , ” he says .
He points out that other studies have shown that brain activity across individuals can become synchronised when watching a movie .
“ The blinks may form one external manifestation of that , which may provide a window into understanding what people are thinking when they watch a movie . ”

Just as I ’ve come to believe that in the heart of every great chef is a Chinese cook , I also believe that all great cuisines emanate from conditions of poverty , scarcity and difficulty .
The best cooks , whether in Brazil or Thailand or France , for that matter , seem to come from those countries ’ poorest regions , where cooks free of “ the crippling handicap of affluence ” ( as A.J. Liebling put it ) are compelled to make the most of things .
Seetoh , unsurprisingly , shares this worldview .
The next day , he took me out to a hawker center near the airport for a Chinese - based comfort - food classic : char kway teow ( fried flat rice noodles ) .
Originally a poor - man ’s lunch thrown together by fishermen , the dish has become a guilty pleasure for Singaporeans unafraid of its high - cholesterol charms .
Hill Street Fried Kway Teow , Seetoh insisted , offered the best char kway teow in Singapore .
A superior frying technique was of paramount importance — one must not burn the noodles .
“ Watch the master ! ” Seetoh urged , as an old gentleman tossed Chinese sausage , cockles , flat noodles and crispy pork cracklings into a sizzling wok and then poured in some dark soy .
A minute or so before being unceremoniously dumped onto plates , a beaten egg was added , and it was still cooking when the steaming orders hit our table .
It was an unlovely - looking brown heap , but I felt myself slowly seduced as I spooned on some chili sauce , my hangover from the previous evening ’s festivities fading quickly .
As with so much of the best of Asian cooking , this gooey mess was in fact a complex combination of distinct flavors and textures : sweet and savory , spicy and rich , gluey and crunchy .
I needed a nap immediately after , but I went for tofu instead .
“ Every time Michelle Yeoh comes to Singapore , she makes me take her here , ” my friend the photographer Russel Wong said over a bowl of tofu fa , a hot bean - curd custard with sugar syrup that is chased with a glass of soy milk .
It was late at night , and we were sitting at Rochor Original Bean Curd , a busy storefront .
Frankly , I did n’t get it .
Soy milk and tofu ( unless it ’s fried in animal fat ) just do n’t do it for me .
But Wong , like a typical Singaporean , knows everything about food , and though I was not loving my tofu , I trusted that he could serve as my culinary Sherpa for tomorrow ’s breakfast .
The next morning we went to Thasevi , an Indian spot featuring halal food located in a row of colonial - era “ shop houses . ”
I sampled roti prata kosong ( plain Indian flatbread ) and roti prata telur ( stuffed with egg ) .
Wong also insisted that I try some chicken and mutton curries , which we washed down with teh tarik , or “ pulled ” tea , since alcohol is forbidden here .
This Indian tea is brewed from leaves , dosed with condensed milk and then pulled , meaning poured back and forth between pitchers from increasing heights until it is frothy .
After ,
Wong suggested that we meet the next day for the single dish most beloved in Singapore .
Ask any group of strangers here where to get the best chicken rice , and you will surely start an argument .
If there is a national dish , it is this .
An adaptation of a Chinese version from the island of Hainan , it ’s deceptively simple looking , but locals passionately discuss the virtues and deficiencies of a particular rendition .
Wong says the best version is at Tian Tian , in the Maxwell Road Food Centre .
“ It has to be a good chicken , ” he explained as we sit down .
“ These come from Malaysia , ” he continued , digging into a platter of plain - looking boiled chicken atop a heap of white rice .
“ The chicken must never be served hot . ”
It is boiled whole , on the bone , then ( this is very important ) dunked into ice water to separate the skin slightly from the meat .
The chicken is then hacked into pieces and served on boiled rice .
Chicken broth , chili sauce , pounded ginger purée and dark soy sauce are served in separate bowls on the side .
You eat the dish with a fork and a spoon .
To an aficionado , chicken rice is a dish with infinite possibilities .
Drizzle the soy in a thin stream over it , or not .
Dip each bite in broth , then brush lightly with chili sauce or soy , or dip in garlic , or all of the above .
Or simply add all the condiments at once and mash the whole business together .
As we were eating from the same platter , Wong and I dipped in sequence .
It is a light and beautiful thing , chicken rice .
Part comfort food , part Zen ritual , yet finally just a darned good lunch .
And as I sat there , gazing at stalls with signs promising Big Scissors Curry Rice , Foo Zhou Oyster Cakes , Kway Chap Seafood Soup , Zhen Zhen Porridge , Fresh Prawn Won Ton and Fish Ball Noodle , I felt as if I were inside an edible pinball machine , one in which I could happily career forever .
But not today .
I had one more meal in Singapore .
Chicken rice may serve as the national dish , but bak kut teh , literally pork - rib tea , was a dish about which I was constantly nagged .
That I had yet to try it had long since become an embarrassment to my friends , who were well aware of my predilection for all things porcine .
This time , I was not leaving without putting this important notch on my gastronomic belt .
I consulted Seetoh ’s guide and headed out to Rong Chen .
The stand is made up of a few tables on a concrete porch on the Sin Ming Road .
I had just sat down when a group of businessmen invited me to join them at a nearby table .
I had intended to eat my last meal in Singapore alone , but the sight of a lone ang moh , struggling to understand the handwritten signs , and the possibility that I might fail to fully appreciate what I was about to eat , was apparently too much for them .
Bak kut teh is essentially a heap of pork , usually ribs , cooked in broth .
Said to have been created as food for Chinese laborers in early - 20th - century Malaysia , it has become a beloved ritual for Chinese businessmen , a weekly or even daily combination of working lunch , social gathering and lengthy discussion of its many versions .
“ I do n’t play golf , ” one man announced proudly .
“ I eat bak kut teh .
Every day .
Sometimes twice a day . ”
He and his friends meet at a revolving number of places serving the dish and spend hours doing pretty much what they were doing at that moment : eating , drinking tea , talking business , welcoming friends and pausing now and then to chatter into cellphones .
After introductions , my new friend explained that Rong Chen serves a “ white version ” of bak kut — basic pork ribs and broth , flavored with pepper ( as opposed to herbs ) and whole cloves of garlic , the pork free of the darkening effects of soy .
The herbal ( darker , usually soy- infused ) dish tends to be more tender , he said .
After a few cups of tea , some salted vegetables and fried bread came the main event : huge , steaming bowls of meaty pork ribs in a translucent broth .
Chili dipping sauce was served on the side .
As we gnawed on bones , tearing off peppery strips and drinking spoonfuls of the cooking liquid , our waiter continued to replenish our broth .

Just another hint .. as you probably already know , the Pre has the same screen resolution as the iPhone ( boo .. ) but anyway ..
Option " A " would be a quick Google search for " iphone wallpapers " , which will get you plenty of sites with plenty of results already sized and ready to go for your Pre.
Option " B " would be to use Google 's newly - renovated " Advanced Image Search " to specify the " exact image resolution " to be 320x480 of course and then you can use the " match any of the following " for something like " abstract , 3d , nature , etc " .. whatever you want .

Of course not .
Should Ben Bernanke be reappointed as Chairman of the Federal Reserve for his stewardship of the banking and credit systems ?
Of course not .
Certainly , the Fed under Mr. Bernanke is not solely responsible for the environment that produced the biggest credit bubble and credit deflation of our lifetimes , but Jimmy Carter was n’t solely responsible for the late - 1980s inflationary spiral .
Mr. Carter was not re-elected , and similarly Mr. Bernanke should not be reappointed .
Simply put , how can Washington even consider keeping Mr. Bernanke as Fed Chairman when the US banking system effectively failed on his watch ?
I have the highest respect for Mr. Bernanke as an academic and economic historian .
Nonetheless , there are several reasons , in my opinion , why someone else needs to be the Fed Chairman .
Need for Volker - like Leadership
If one thing positive can be said about Carter ’s economic policies , it is that he appointed Paul Volker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1979 .
The US economy was in the midst of a vicious inflation spiral , but Mr. Volker initiated dramatic changes to monetary policy .
Those policies were extremely painful in the short - term , but they stymied inflation and significantly strengthened the US economy ’s long - term growth path .
Mr. Bernanke did nothing so dramatic during the obviously enormous global credit bubble .
Rather , his policies both before and after the banking and credit crises have attempted to maintain financial market status quo .
Despite the crying need for changes to monetary policy at least as monumental as those of Mr. Volker , Mr. Bernanke did nothing to alter the US banking system ’s disastrous course .
Mr. Bernanke ’s comments regarding his inability to proactively control financial bubbles , and the ease with which the Fed could manage a bubble ’s deflation , were astonishing for their naïveté .
The fact that the credit bubble ’s deflation caused the worst recession of the post - war period seems to demonstrate that Mr. Bernanke has failed even according to his previously expressed expectations .
Wall Street has supported both Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke .
Much like a raw material producer thrives on real asset inflation , Wall Street thrives on financial asset inflation ’s cheaper and more abundant credit .
Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke made sure that the Street was not disappointed regardless of the longer - term detrimental effect on the US economy .
The next Fed Chairman should be more concerned with the stability of the financial sector , rather than with the growth of the financial sector .
The next Fed Chairman must be ready , willing , and able to take swift and significant action to protect the security of the US financial system regardless of whether Wall Street deems it appropriate or not .
Mr. Bernanke has demonstrated no such aptitude .
A New Paradigm of Monetary Policy
The next Fed Chairman must appreciate that a new paradigm of monetary policy is slowly emerging .
Central bankers have longed feared inflation ( real asset appreciation ) , and have made fighting inflation the cornerstone of global monetary policies .
The last 10 years ’ history shows that this may be an antiquated approach .
The future of monetary policy , in my opinion , will focus on the delicate balance between real and financial asset inflation .
The US economy does not function well when there is excessive real asset inflation .
The 1970s have proven that .
However , the US economy also does not function well when there is excessive financial asset inflation .
The last decade has proven that .
Assets are grossly misallocated when there are extremes in either real or financial asset inflation , and the financial system and the overall economy suffer as a result .
Yet most central bankers , like Mr. Bernanke , do not yet appreciate this delicate balance .
They continue to operate under the assumption that real asset inflation is bad and financial asset inflation is good .
In this respect , Mr. Bernanke ’s term as Fed Chairman seems to mimic those of Arthur Burns and William Miller during the 1970s .
Burns and Miller promoted policies that fueled real asset inflation because it was too economically painful ( or politically painful ? ) to do otherwise .
Mr. Bernanke has followed the same path with respect to financial asset inflation .
His policies , and those of his predecessor , have fueled excessive financial asset inflation ( or bubbles ) because it might be too painful to do otherwise .
The economy has suffered as a result .
The next central banker must understand the important similarities between the 1970s ’ tandem of Burns and Miller and this decade ’s pairing of Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke .
The next Fed Chairman must lead a new paradigm of monetary policy to ensure that neither real nor financial asset inflation becomes extreme .
The Next Fed Chairman
The next Fed Chairman should probably come from one of the Federal Reserve ’s district banks .
The person should not primarily focus on Wall Street , but rather should fully understand how the optimal cost of capital in the financial markets drives efficient real investment and maintains a stable banking system .
The next Fed Chairman should have a thorough understanding of small businesses lending ( imagine if TARP money had gone to the Small Business Administration instead of to bank trading desks ? ) and how the future of the US economy depends on efficient real investment and not on financial engineering .
That person undoubtedly exists somewhere within the Federal Reserve Board but , unfortunately , it is not Mr. Bernanke .
Mediaite has obtained a transcript from former Sec. of State Colin Powell ‘s interview on CNN ’s Larry King Live tonight , in which Powell comments on the Professor Gates story , as well as Sarah Palin and more .
He seems to take Sergeant Crowley ’s side in the Gates situation .
Says Powell :
I would say , the first teaching point is when you ’re faced with an officer trying to do his job and get to the bottom of something .
This is not the time to get in an argument with him .
I was taught that as a child .
You do n’t argue with a police officer .
In fact , in our schools today , in order to make sure that we do n’t have things escalate out of control and lead to very unfortunate situations , we tell our kids , when you ’re being asked something by a police officer , being detained by a police officer , cooperate .
If you do n’t like what happened , or if you think that you have been exposed to something that ’s racist or prejudicial or something that ’s wrong , then you make a complaint afterwards and you sue him .
Later in the interview , Powell continues :
I think he should have reflected on whether or not this was the time to make that big a deal .
But , he ’s just home from China , just home from New York .
All he wanted to do was get to bed …
But I still think that it might well have been resolved in a different manner if we did n’t have this verbal altercation between the two of them …
So , my first teaching point for young people , especially , not for Dr. Gates , that the young people , especially , is , when the police are looking into something , and if you ’re involved in it in one way or another , cooperate .
Do n’t make the situation more difficult .
And I think in this case , the situation was made more difficult .
The interview , which airs in full tonight , is sure to get a lot of attention and replay on the cable and broadcast networks .
Powell ’s comments about being racially profiled himself , Palin ( who he calls a “ fascinating figure ” ) and Rush Limbaugh ( check out some of those here ) will resonate .
Here ’s a clip of his comments :

Written by Plot Summary
The search is on for the new Man of Steel now that Brandon Routh 's contract has expired .
Who better to don the cape than the man who named his own son Kal - El ?
The hunt is on for a new Superman .
As of this week , Superman Returns ' Brandon Routh is officially out of contract to play the Man of Steel .
So , should the long - fabled Superman reboot ever happen , who should be chosen to don the iconic cape ?
Well , I 've looked at this from every possible angle , and there appears to be only one true candidate .
Nicolas Cage .
No , wait , I 'm being serious .
Nicolas Cage should play Superman .
Stop it .
Where are you going ?
Come back !
Listen to the internet and you 'll be told that Brandon Routh should be replaced in the next Superman movie by Smallville 's Tom Welling .
This is poppycock for two reasons .
First , if you listen to the internet you 'll also be told that 9/11 was an inside job masterminded by a shadowy cabal of 12ft tall lizard men .
And second , a Tom Welling Superman movie would be a terrible idea .
The Smallville universe is all over the place .
In it , Lex Luthor and Clark Kent are old school buddies , Lois Lane starts showing up when Clark is about four years old and Kelly Brook is a credible villain .
Any Superman film starring Tom Welling would have to reflect all of this , leaving everyone other than the six people who still regularly watch Smallville utterly perplexed .
No – when Superman gets rebooted , the people should get what the people want .
And since it 's perfectly clear that the people did n't want handsome , bland Brandon Routh turning Superman into a soppy Jesus figure , they should get the exact opposite – a twitchy , balding , mad-eyed , 45 - year - old Superman who can barely go more than a couple of minutes without indiscriminately bellowing his lines at the sky like a biblical maniac .
In short , Nicolas Cage should be the new Superman .
He definitely should .
It 's not such a weird thought – back before the days of Routh and Singer , Nicolas Cage was all lined up to play Superman in a Tim Burton movie written by Kevin Smith .
Surely he'd jump at the chance to take another pop at the character .
He does love Superman enough to name his own son Kal - El , remember .
What 's more , Nicolas Cage has precisely the right skill - set to play Superman at this moment in time .
We do n't want to see a show - off who can defeat baddies by throwing the Eiffel tower at the moon anymore .
We want a hero who , when confronted with danger , will dress up as a bear , run up a hill and punch that danger square in the face .
Similarly , we do n't want a Superman who disguises himself as a boring old newspaper journalist – we want Superman to be disguised as a shrieking , boggle - eyed lunatic with a British accent so terrible that it borders on the offensive .
Nicolas Cage can do anguish .
Nicolas Cage can do Kryptonite - addled hysteria .
Nicolas Cage can do anything .
In fact , no .
I 've changed my mind .
I no longer want Nicolas Cage to be the new Superman .
I want Nicolas Cage to be my dad .
i'm rewritin ' it The other day I bought lunch at McDonald's .
My receipt was attached to the bag with a small sticker proudly proclaiming their latest slogan : " i'm lovin ' it . "
As I gnawed on a so - so fry , I wondered exactly who was lovin ' what .
Apparently I was lovin ' McDonald 's , I guess .
I do n't remember being consulted , but there it was in sticker - form .
It was even trademarked , so I guess my lovin ' must be heartfelt and true .
Granted , McDonald 's and I have a history , but is n't this all a little presumptuous ?
And do they really need to be dragging the L word into it ?
They did n't even have the courtesy to say they were lovin ' me back !
( I wo n't lie .
It stings . )
I thought I 'd help Ronald out and whip up my own set of McStickers that cover a slightly larger emotional spectrum ...

At least 39 people have died in clashes between security forces and a radical Islamist group in the north - eastern Nigerian city of Bauchi , officials say .
The clashes occurred after dozens of men armed with guns and explosives attacked a police station .
They were repelled and security forces responded by attacking a settlement on the edge of the city , reports said .
Authorities said the militants belonged to Boko Haram , a group that wants Sharia law imposed across Nigeria .
Islamic law has been in effect in the state of Bauchi since 2001 .
The city of Bauchi has been placed under curfew following Sunday 's clashes and the Nigerian military are controlling roads leading into the area , the BBC Caroline Duffield reports from Nigeria .
After the attack on the police station early on Sunday locals counted five dead bodies at the scene .
When police retaliated with an attack on the settlement many more were killed in an exchange of gunfire , with dozens reported to have been injured .
Reuters , citing hospital sources and witnesses , put the death toll as high as 50 .
Weapons displayed
The police spokesman , Mohammed Barau , said the situation had been brought under control and that more than 150 people had been arrested .
One gang member , who gave his name as Abdullah , told Reuters the group had retaliated because authorities had been arresting its leaders .
The man was also quoted as saying that the group wanted to " clean the [ Nigerian ] system which is polluted by Western education and uphold Sharia all over the country " .
In the local Hausa language Boko Haram means " Western education prohibited " .
People in Bauchi say it is a Muslim sect that has been operating for months and recruiting young men , our correspondent says .
They describe the followers as conservative and strict , refusing to mix with local people , and opposed to Western education , Western culture , and science .
Police say they had arrested members of the group because they were investigating reports that the group was arming itself , our correspondent adds .
Authorities have displayed weapons they say were seized from the group , including locally made hunting guns , crossbows , machetes and army uniforms .
In February , Bauchi was the scene of clashes between Muslim and Christian communities , which left four people dead .
Nigeria 's 140 million people are split almost equally between Muslims and Christians and the two groups generally live peacefully side by side .

Design : Suppose Design Office , Japan
Lead Architect : Makoto Tanijiri
Site area : 246 m2
Building area : 50.41 m2
Total floor area : 115.51m2
“ When I always create , I think that I want to find the charm of the plan , ” claims 35 year old talented architect Makoto Tanijiri , chief architect of Suppose Design Office .
In the nine year existence of Suppose Design Office they have built more than 50 works of architecture , almost all single - family homes , among other projects .
The impressive number of works completed topped up in 2007 with the modern pit dwelling in Saijo , Hiroshima .
In Saijo , a town known for it sake , a jet black pyramid unexpectedly stands out ; when first seen it seems as if it ’s a house from the future .
On the contrast , it ’s actually inspired by the earliest house in Japanese architecture ; the pit dwelling or the “ tateana jukyo ” .
Constructed during the Yayoi era ( 200 B.C. – 250 A.D. ) , pit dwellings were built by digging a circular pit ( or rectangular one with rounded edges ) fifty or sixty centimeters deep and five to seven meters in diameter , then covering it with a steep thatched roof .
Not very different from talented young architects Makoto Tanijiri ’s modern day pit dwelling !
living - dining room /// photo © Toshiyuki Yano ( Nacasa & Partners Inc. )
According to Tanjiri , the clients , a young couple and their three children wanted a unique house , in which the open public part would preserve privacy .
The site which was formerly an open field was excavated and the house was sunk a meter into the ground .
The soil from the excavations was used to create a protective barrier around the perimeter of the site , and acted as the organic base of the house .
The barrier formed is both visual and physical and was planted to create a lush landscape .
entrance /// photo © Toshiyuki Yano ( Nacasa & Partners Inc. )
The sunken level of the house is communal ; the perimeter is constructed by exposed glossy concrete .
The sunken level is open plan and consists of the living , kitchen and dining areas .
Although it is a meter below ground level it has a lot of natural light as Tanjiri placed ribbon windows running on all four sides .
Four inclined black steel V plates were placed at each corner of the ground floor , to support the construction and the other two levels of the pit dwelling .
A timber staircase without handrails leads to the first floor where the master bedroom and bath is found ; however , it also neatly conceals a washroom located on the ground floor .
The master bedroom enjoys a terrace , which is cut into the surface of the pyramid - like construction thus allowing natural light into the master bedroom .
A transitional sentiment of calmness and anticipation reveals the perplexed entry into the cone shaped construction through the connection of a minimal steel staircase , artistic and creative , as is usually the case in Japanese houses , where the disorientation in design that the handrail creates is omitted .

Nevertheless , the most revealing and striking space of the house , unfolds before our eyes on the second floor where the children ’s bedroom is located .
The walls ascend and converge at the same time to meet at the skylight .
Light vigorously pours through the skylight and into the rest of the house through the central opening where the staircase is located .
Not a conventional children ’s bedroom , but who is to say that this house according to today ’s standards and not the Yayoi ’s era is conventional ?

space 2 // main bedroom /// photo © Toshiyuki Yano ( Nacasa & Partners Inc. )
Makoto Tanijiri demonstrates that only a mind free of restraints and rules can create a non conventional way of living .
Where spatial arrangements and the concept of interpenetrating exterior and interior space is long achieved by Japanese architecture and living .
Japanese modern architecture has accomplished designs where austerity thrives ; what the westerners call minimal .
Japan teaches the western world how to take risks when designing , and break the rules !
After all , rules are made to be broken !

______________________________________________
The CONSTRUCTION process
“ We are always thinking about the border line .
Between ambient surrounding and the site , exterior and interior ,
Architecture and furniture .
The room and another room .
Various relations necessarily include the border line .
Modern ages tried to clarify their border lines as much as possible
However , we think that we have the possibility ,
becomes vague by the architecture in the future .
The exterior like the interior architecture like the furniture
We imagine architecture that exceeds the area of it being achieved .
It will become a place were it is more similar to nature . ”

Oxfam says thousands of Palestinians are stopped from leading normal lives International aid and advocacy group Oxfam is demanding the " triumph of the rule of law " over Israel 's barrier inside the West Bank .
The campaign marks five years since an International Court of Justice advisory opinion found its construction was illegal and it should be dismantled .
Since then , Oxfam says , the view of the " most distinguished international legal body has been met by inaction " .
Israel says the barrier for security ; Palestinians view it as a land grab .
In the report , entitled Five Years of Illegality , Oxfam details the situations of 13 Palestinian communities affected by the barrier and its associated security system of gates , buffer zones and passes .
It says displacement and exclusion caused by the barrier entails family break - up , the loss of livelihood and removal of social welfare , and " wide - ranging physical and psychological impacts , including trauma and anxiety for children " .
' Dangerous ' Jeremy Hobbs , Executive Director of Oxfam International , says the testimonies are just a small insight into the " labyrinth of bans and restrictions " faced by Palestinians because of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank .

The barrier was started in 2002 and when completed will be up to 790 km ( 490 miles ) in length , with only 14 % of it will running along the Green Line between Israel and the territory it has occupied since 1967 .
About 57 % has already been completed , with 9 % under construction , Oxfam says , but when completed it will divide the West Bank into three sections and completely cut off East Jerusalem , which Palestinians want as a future capital .
" No one feels safe here , especially the families living close to the Wall , " says Salah Ajarma , of Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem , enclosed by a nine - metre - high concrete section of the barrier , complete with watchtowers and sniper positions .
" Our children do n't have their playground any more , as it is now on the other side of the Wall .
So the children play in the streets of the camp , which creates noise and prevents the older ones from studying .
" And playing in the streets is dangerous because the soldiers can fire at any moment . "
Temporary
The ICJ advisory opinion of 9 July 2004 calling the barrier illegal where built on occupied land was considered a landmark by Israel 's critics and received the overwhelming support in the UN General Assembly .
Guide : West Bank barrier Israel , however , dismissed the ICJ judgement and General Assembly vote as " non-binding " and looked to its own High Court ruling that the ICJ view was flawed as it did not consider Israel 's security needs .
It argues the barrier , which it calls the " security fence " is a just and necessary answer to the threat of militant attacks on its territory , such as suicide bombings .
And it says it has contributed to the virtual eradication of that threat , which took more than 200 Israeli lives in 2002 .
" Since the completion of the security fence in the northern and central regions of the country , the number of successful terror attacks inside Israel has dropped almost to zero , " an Israeli military spokesman said .
Oxfam , and other critics , have given little credence to Israel 's assertion that the barrier is a temporary measure .
They argue that too much has already been invested in it by the government , and the pattern of settlements Israel wants to keep permanently over the Green Line reveals the barrier 's purpose , they say .
It incorporates about 90 % of the Israeli settler population in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem as well as " valuable agricultural and substantial water resources " , according to Oxfam .

The Back Story
While the deaths have been previously reported , the back story of the frustrated efforts to investigate them has not been fully told .
The killings occurred in late November 2001 , just days after the American - led invasion forced the ouster of the Taliban government in Kabul .
Thousands of Taliban fighters surrendered to General Dostum ’s forces , which were part of the American - backed Northern Alliance , in the city of Kunduz .
They were then transported to a prison run by the general ’s forces near the town of Shibarghan .

Survivors and witnesses told The New York Times and Newsweek in 2002 that over a three - day period , Taliban prisoners were stuffed into closed metal shipping containers and given no food or water ; many suffocated while being trucked to the prison .
Other prisoners were killed when guards shot into the containers .
The bodies were said to have been buried in a mass grave in Dasht - i - Leili , a stretch of desert just outside Shibarghan .
A recently declassified 2002 State Department intelligence report states that one source , whose identity is redacted , concluded that about 1,500 Taliban prisoners died .
Estimates from other witnesses or human rights groups range from several hundred to several thousand .
The report also says that several Afghan witnesses were later tortured or killed .
In Afghanistan , rival warlords have had a history of eliminating enemy troops by suffocating them in sealed containers .
General Dostum , however , has said previously that any such deaths of the Taliban prisoners were unintentional .
He has said that only 200 prisoners died and blamed combat wounds and disease for most of the fatalities .
The general could not be reached for comment , and a spokesman declined to comment for this article .
While a dozen or so bodies were examined and several were autopsied , a full exhumation was never performed , and human rights groups are concerned that evidence has been destroyed .
In 2008 , a medical forensics team working with the United Nations discovered excavations that suggested the mass grave had been moved .
Satellite photos obtained by The Times show that the site was disturbed even earlier , in 2006 .
“ Our repeated efforts to protect witnesses , secure evidence and get a full investigation have been met by the U.S. and its allies with buck - passing , delays and obstruction , ” said Nathaniel Raymond , a researcher for Physicians for Human Rights , a group based in Boston that discovered the mass grave site in 2002 .
Seeking an Investigation
The first calls for an investigation came from his group and the International Committee of the Red Cross .
A military commander in the United States - led coalition rejected a request by a Red Cross official for an inquiry in late 2001 , according to the official , who , in keeping with his organization ’s policy , would speak only on condition of anonymity and declined to identify the commander .
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
The woman whose death has come to symbolize Iranian resistance to the government 's official election results did not die the way the opposition claims , government - backed Press TV said Sunday .
A boy lights a candle beside a photo of Neda during a protest against Iranian elections in Frankfurt , Germany .

Two people told Press TV there were no security forces in the area when Neda Agha - Soltan , 26 , was killed on June 20 .
Neda 's death was captured on amateur video -- most likely by a cell phone -- and posted online .
Within hours , she had become the iconic victim of the Iranian government crackdown .
Eyewitnesses say Neda was shot by pro-government Basij militiamen perched on a rooftop .
But Press TV said the type of bullet that killed her is not used by Iranian security forces .
A man who told the state - funded network he had helped take her to a hospital said , " There were no security forces or any member of the Basij " government - backed paramilitary present when she was killed .
Press TV did not name the man , who spoke Farsi and was subtitled in English on the broadcast .
CNN has not identified him and cannot confirm his account .
Watch more about Neda 's death »
" I did n't see who shot who , " he said .
" The whole scene looked suspicious to me . "
A second man , whom Press TV identified as Neda 's music teacher who was with her when she died , told the station there was " no security forces in this street " when she was shot .
Press TV did not name the man , who had a gray mustache and ponytail .
He spoke Farsi and was subtitled in English as he walked and pointed at what Press TV said was the scene of the shooting .
She was with a family friend who is a music teacher when she was killed .
He appears to be the man who spoke to the Iranian broadcaster .
" There was no sign of a protest , " he said .
" We crossed the street to the other side to get a cab ...
When we reached this spot , a gunshot was heard .
There was no shooting here ...
There were no security forces in this street .
There were around 20 , 30 people in this street .
One shot was heard and that bullet hit Neda . "
" The bullet was apparently fired from a small caliber pistol that 's not used by Iranian security forces , " the Press TV anchor said .
Iran has strict gun-control laws that bar private citizens from carrying firearms .
U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday he had seen the video of Neda 's death and called it " heartbreaking .
" And I think anyone who sees it knows there 's something fundamentally unjust about it , " he said .
The shaky video of her death shows her walking with a man , a teacher of music and philosophy , near an anti-government demonstration .
After being stuck in traffic for more than an hour inside a Peugeot 206 -- a subcompact with a poorly working air conditioner -- Neda and the friend decided to get out of the car for some fresh air , a friend of Neda 's told CNN after her death .
The two were near where protesters were chanting in opposition to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , whose calls for an end to anti-government demonstrations have sparked defiance across the nation .
Neda , wearing a baseball cap over a black scarf , a black shirt , blue jeans and tennis shoes , does not appear to be chanting and seems to be observing the demonstration .
Suddenly , Neda is on the ground -- felled by a single gunshot wound to the chest .
Several men kneel at her side and place pressure on her chest in an attempt to stop the bleeding .
" She has been shot !
Someone , come and take her ! " shouts one man .
By now , Neda 's eyes have rolled to her right ; her body is limp .
Blood streams from her mouth , then from her nose .
For a second , her face is hidden from view as the camera goes behind one of the men .
When Neda 's face comes back into view , it is covered with blood .
Iran 's ambassador to Mexico -- one of few Iranian officials who has spoken to CNN since the disputed June 12 presidential election -- suggested American intelligence services could be responsible for her death .
" This death of Neda is very suspicious , " Ambassador Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri said .
" My question is , how is it that this Miss Neda is shot from behind , got shot in front of several cameras , and is shot in an area where no significant demonstration was behind held ?
" Well , if the CIA wants to kill some people and attribute that to the government elements , then choosing women is an appropriate choice , because the death of a woman draws more sympathy , " Ghadiri said .
CIA spokesman George Little responded , " Any suggestion that the CIA was responsible for the death of this young woman is wrong , absurd and offensive . "

Minnesota Supreme Court Rules for Franken ; Coleman Concedes Permalink
In a ruling yesterday , the Minnesota state Supreme Court decided 5 - 0 that Al Franken ( D ) won the Nov. 2008 senatorial election and is entitled to an election certificate .
He beat his opponent by 312 votes .
The court rejected the claim by Norm Coleman ( R ) that the lower court made major mistakes and should be reversed .
The court said : " Al Franken received the highest number of votes legally and is entitled under Minnesota Statute 204C.40 ( 2008 ) to receive the certificate of election . "
At 3 P.M. Minnesota time , Norm Coleman ( R ) held a press conference and conceded defeat .
Furthermore , Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( R - MN ) , said he would sign the election certificate .
Thus Al Franken will be sworn into the Senate when that body returns from recess next week .
However , Franken could take the oath of office from a local judge if he wishes .
It has been done before .
Franken would then be allowed to start hiring staff so he can hit the ground running Monday .
Seats on key committees have been reserved for Franken , including the Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions committee and the Judiciary committee .
These seats will instantly put him in the middle of the health reform discussion and Supreme Court appointments .
He would likely also get seats on two less important commmittes , such as Indian Affairs and Aging .
The seating of Franken means the Democrats will have 58 seats as well as the support of two independent senators who caucus with them , Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) .
In theory , they will then have the necessary 60 votes to invoke cloture and end filibusters .
The last time they had 60 seats was in the 94th Congress , from 1975 to 1977 .
But as Yogi Berra once put it : " In theory , theory and practice are the same .
In practice , they are not . "
Whereas minority leader Mitch McConnell has a more - or - less iron grip on his caucus , majority leader Harry Reid does not .
And McConnell has no weapons at his disposal to enforce discipline whereas Reid has many , but he does n't use them .
Hot bills coming up in the next few months including the Senate version of the Waxman - Markey bill about global warming and health insurance reform .
Democrats such as Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) and Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) , among others , are not sure votes for cloture and definitely not sure votes for the bills themselves .
So Reid may still have to try to peel off the two senators from Maine , Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins , but the addition of Franken , who is certain to vote with the caucus on almost everything , does make his life a bit easier .
But to get senators like Nelson or Snowe to vote for cloture , the bills may have to be watered down somewhat .
Global warming is probably the easier of the two since the senators from Maine have never dug their heels in against the environment and Maine has no coal mining and few , if any , coal plants that would suffer from the cap - and - trade system required to make any progress in reducing global warming .
Health care reform is a different story .
Probably all Republicans and a handful of Democrats -- including some surprising characters like Sen. Kay Hagan ( D - NC ) -- are dead set against any bill with a public insurance option in it -- Medicare for all .
It will be very hard for Reid to get 60 votes with a public option .
On the other hand , Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that a bill without a public option does not have the votes to pass the House because the 77 - member progressive caucus wo n't go for it .
If the Senate wo n't pass a bill with a public option and the House wo n't pass one without a public option , what is going to happen ?
One possibility is no bill at all .
But President Obama would consider that a colossal failure and it would probably mean he would be a one - term President .
One possibility would be for him to give his notorius chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , a meat cleaver -- and the collected works of Lorena Bobbit -- and tell him to go over to Capitol Hill and not come back until he has the votes .
Another option is to use the reconcilation process to ram the bill through , something that would enrage the Republicans ( although George Bush used it to pass his tax cuts ) .
As long as Joe Biden is alive and well , it would take only 50 Democratic votes to pass a health care bill via the reconciliation process as reconciliation bills cannot be filibustered under Senate rules .
This is clearly not Obama or Reid 's first choice , but it is a threat that can be held over the head of recalcitrant Democrats and Republicans .
There is one final consideration that should n't be forgotten .
Two Democrats , Ted Kennedy and Robert Byrd , are extremely ill .
In fact , it is conceivable either one might be in the hospital at the time of a cloture vote , although Byrd was just discharged yesterday .
In both cases having them be wheeled into the Senate on stretchers in order to vote on a cloture motion is well within the realm of possibility .
Bedridden senators have been wheeled in to vote in the past ; it could happen again .
According to Senate rules , however , wheeling in a senator only counts if the senator is alive .
If Kennedy should die , Gov. Deval Patrick ( D - MA ) would call a special election to fill it .
If Byrd should die , Gov. Joe Manchin ( D - WV ) would replace him with another Democrat , conceivably himself .
Thus while Franken 's victory does n't solve all the Democrats ' problems ( because they are internal to the caucus ) , it does make things a bit easier for them .

A Baylor University researcher has found a set of genes that modulates stress responses that could cause some people to take drugs , specifically alcohol consumption .
The study by Dr. Doug Matthews , * professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor , appeared in the journal Behavior Genetics .
Matthews found a small section on chromosome one that is responsive to a particular type of stress in animal models .
The researchers then identified the genes in this region that could be responsible for the behavioral response to stress , like alcohol consumption .
The study is the first to pinpoint a region on the chromosomes that could be responsible for modulating stress responses involved in complex behaviors like drug abuse .
“ This study gives us insight into a common genetic pathway for stress that might be critical in modulating drug taking behavior , especially alcohol consumption since many people report drinking alcohol to reduce stress , ” Matthews said .
“ It also gave us some ideas on where to look in the brain for drug taking behavior and it provided a method to do so . ”
Matthews said the researchers used a unique method to do the project by selecting chromosomes from one particular strain of mice and embed them inside the background of a host strain .
He pointed out this sophisticated genetic manipulation allowed them to target specific chromosomes so they could get a much more powerful genetic answer .
Researchers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory , University of Memphis , University of Tennessee and University of British Columbia also contributed to the study .
* Matthews research paper was awarded the Fulker Award from the Behavior Genetics Association for the best paper published in the journal in 2008 .
Doctors develop a ' cure ' for peanut allergy
Doctors have developed a potential cure for peanut allergies in a breakthrough that could help tens of thousands of children .
The pioneering therapy uses carefully controlled doses of peanut flour to ' retrain ' a child 's faulty immune system and bring it back to normal .
In early trials , doctors successfully treated 20 children suffering from severe peanut allergies .
' Cured ' : Michael Frost , aged 9 , is now able to eat peanuts after his allergy was ' de - sensitised '
By the end of the six - month experiment , some of the youngsters could eat up to 12 nuts every day without suffering a life - threatening allergic reaction .
Researchers at Cambridge now want to see whether the same technique can be used to tackle the increase in other types of food allergies such as milk , kiwi fruit and gluten .
Around one child in 50 is thought to suffer from peanut allergy in Britain .
In total around 450,000 adults and children have the condition .
Reactions to peanuts can range from mild itching and rashes to potentially dangerous swelling of the airways , breathing problems and severe asthma .
It is the most common serious allergic reaction and appears to be on the rise .
On average , seven children are thought to die from peanut allergies each year .
Dr Pamela Ewan , a consultant allergist at Addenbrooke 's hospital and lead researcher in the study , stressed that the treatment was not yet a ' cure ' .
' We are essentially retraining the immune system by presenting it with a very low dose to begin with and gradually increasing it , ' she said .
' For some , they were getting reactions when they had just one 400th of a peanut .
We give them less than that to start with and build up from there .
' It is still early days , and we still need to work out how long term the desensitisation is .'
She added : ' The patients have told us that it has been a massive , life - changing experience .
' The mothers and the children say it has taken away a huge fear that had been looming over them . '
She warned parents not to attempt the technique at home .
Giving children with a nut allergy doses of peanut flour could be extremely dangerous .
' We have to increase their dose in hospital in case they take an adverse reaction , ' she said .
The researchers gave 20 children with severe peanut allergy small daily doses of peanut flour over six months .
The doses were initially lower than the amount needed to trigger an allergic reaction and were increased every two weeks until the youngsters could eat the equivalent of six peanuts a day .
After 16 weeks , the children were eating peanuts every day to keep their immune system desensitised .
According to the doctors , 20 patients aged between five and 17 years old can now eat up to 12 peanuts a day .
Results from the first part of the trial were published in the journal Allergy earlier this year .
The children will be followed for the next three or four years to monitor their tolerance levels .
Other studies will see if the peanut flour can be given as a tablet .
Allergy UK welcomed the study .
' This gives tremendous hope for food allergy sufferers , ' said chief executive Jules Payne .
' Food allergies can make life so miserable .
But we would n't want people to try this treatment themselves as they need to be in a clinically controlled environment . '
Doctors are baffled by the rise in peanut allergies .
Some experts believe the obsession with cleanliness in homes - and the fact that children spend little time outside exposed to dirt and germs - means young immune systems are not being properly developed , leaving them vulnerable to allergic reactions .
For the second study , Ms. Sands sent identical scripts to artistic directors and literary managers around the country .
The only difference was that half named a man as the writer ( for example , Michael Walker ) , while half named a woman ( i.e. , Mary Walker ) .
It turned out that Mary ’s scripts received significantly worse ratings in terms of quality , economic prospects and audience response than Michael’s .
The biggest surprise ?
“ These results are driven exclusively by the responses of female artistic directors and literary managers , ” Ms. Sands said .
Amid the gasps from the audience , an incredulous voice called out , “ Say that again ? ”
Ms. Sands put it another way : “ Men rate men and women playwrights exactly the same . ”

Ms. Sands was reluctant to explain the responses in terms of discrimination , suggesting instead that artistic directors who are women perhaps possess a greater awareness of the barriers female playwrights face .
For the third piece , Ms. Sands looked specifically at Broadway , where women write fewer than one in eight shows .
She modeled her research on work done in the 1960s and ’ 70s to determine whether discrimination existed in baseball .
Those studies concluded that black players had to deliver higher performing statistics  for example , better batting averages  than white players simply to make it to the major leagues .
Ms. Sands examined the 329 new plays and musicals produced on Broadway in the past 10 years to determine whether the bar was set higher .
Did scripts by women have to be better than those by men ?
Of course , there are many ways to define “ better , ” but on Broadway , with the exception of three nonprofit theaters , everyone can agree that one overriding goal is to make a profit .
So did shows written by women during that period make more money than shows written by men ?
About The Canadian War Posters Collection
The modern , mass - produced poster was made possible by the invention of the lithographic process in 1798 .
These large , boldly lettered , and eventually colourful , advertisements and announcements , presented to the viewer on vertical surfaces and at eye - level , would have a far more immediate and powerful effect on a public accustomed to handbills and advertisements in newspapers and magazines .
By 1890 , in Canada , broadside posters were widely circulated and used for a variety of purposes , including government announcements .
The recruiting and financing needs of the First World War demanded that governments produce more posters than ever before .
Canadian posters for the First World War ( as well as for the Second World War ) were printed in the major printing centres of Hamilton , Montreal , and Toronto .
According to Marc Choko's authoritative book , Canadian War Posters ( Meridien 1994 ) , print runs of Canadian war posters ranged anywhere from a few hundred to 50,000 copies .
These images created a powerful impact in a variety of public places , from store windows and billboards to the interiors of ferries and factories .
During the First World War , the imagery of Canada 's posters was , both thematically and graphically , similar to that of British war posters .
This visual affinity was partly due to the imperial and constitutional ties between Canada and Britain .
In addition , Canada targeted posters at specific ethnic groups .
There were specially designed posters for French Canadians , Irish - Canadians and Canadians of Scottish descent .
The bulk of the posters encouraged men to enlist and the public to buy Victory Bonds .
In the Second World War , Canadian posters reflected the fact that Canada was not under attack by an aggressor on its own turf .
Whereas some countries ' war posters portrayed violence in graphic detail , Canada 's posters generally avoided such direct images .
While war posters again encouraged enlistment and financial support of the war effort , advancements in communication made appeals for discretion and secrecy staple messages of many Second World War posters .
Another frequent theme was the encouragement of workers to increase productivity .
There was no central government agency in charge of all war poster production during the First World War .
In 1916 , the federal government did establish the War Poster Service which produced some posters in both English and French .
The French posters were often translated versions of the English original designs .
Some well - to - do civilians and private companies produced their own posters in aid of the war effort and individual regiments often issued their own recruiting posters .
The Canada Food Board published posters toward the end of the war urging citizens to produced and conserve food .
Second World
War poster production was centralized under the Bureau of Public Information , which was subsumed by the Wartime Information Board in 1942 .
As was the case earlier , some private companies , the House of Seagram for example , and individual citizens continued to publish posters in the interest of the Second World War effort .
War posters aimed to impart a clear message to the viewer .
Whether a poster encouraged the purchase of Victory Bonds or discouraged talk of Allied troop movements , its mission was to convey a specific message that could be interpreted only one way .
The methods by which posters imparted their messages were different in each of the World Wars .
In the First World War , posters were beset with text , while Second World War posters more effectively used emphatic slogans and intense graphics .
Overseas Battalion 148 Now Recruiting , a First World War poster designed by the architect and artist , Percy Erskine Nobbs ( 1875 - 1964 ) , offers an image of an officer slaying a German eagle .
Compared to Allons-y Canadiens , a Second World War recruiting poster by Henri Eveleigh ( 1909 - present ) , the Nobbs poster has less colour , more text , and less emotional impact .
The officer is without expression as he slays the symbolic eagle .
In contrast , the soldier in the Eveleigh poster charges toward the viewer , brandishing his weapon , an expression of intense emotion on his face .
The simple text , Allons-y Canadiens , is splashed in bold letters across the lower quarter of the poster .
This is not merely an invitation to join the army , as was the case with many First World War posters , but a passionate command .
During the Second World War , more effective appeals were made through posters , partly because the world had already experienced the horrors of one world war , and also because advertising experience and contemporary studies had shown that dramatic and emotional appeals were more effective methods of reaching the Canadian public .
A study by the Young and Rubicam agency of Toronto in 1942 found that the most effective posters were purely emotional , " appealing to sentiment through realistic images with photographic details , accessible to millions of middle - class citizens " ( Choko 1994 ) .
The study found that symbolism and humour were considered ineffective by the public .
The artists who designed war posters ranged from anonymous graphic artists to well - known Canadian painters and for this reason Canadian war posters present a wide variety of styles .
Sometimes the artists were winners of war poster design competitions which were held during both wars .
The need to find effective imagery for posters gave many artists and graphic designers a new opportunity to hone and expose their talents .
Montreal - born and - trained architect and painter , Harry Mayerovitch , was one such poster designer .
He worked in Ottawa from 1942 to 1944 and created a number of posters for various war - time campaigns under the pseudonym " Mayo " .
He won the first and third prizes for Canadian war posters in 1944 .
Canadian war posters were produced for a specific audience and for specific purposes .
They were not meant to be archival or historical documents , but because of their time and place specificity they have become an important resource through which today 's researchers and interested public can explore aspects of wartime life .
Canadian war posters present the modern viewer with seemingly dated and distant images , yet they convey both the intensity and the immediacy of a by - gone era .
The contents of the Sufi graves have been left in the open
By Mohamed Mohamed
BBC Somali Service
Since they began to capture large swathes of southern Somalia , radical Islamists have been undertaking a programme of destroying mosques and the graves of revered religious leaders from the Sufi branch of Islam .
The destruction of non-approved religious sites started last year when they began to knock down an old colonial era church in the town of Kismayo .
Most Somalis are Sufi Muslims , who do not share the strict Saudi Arabian - inspired Wahhabi interpretation of Islam with the hardline al - Shabab group .
The living person can at least defend himself , but the dead cannot ... destroying graves is despicable
Mohamed Sheikh
They embrace music , dancing and meditation and are appalled at the desecration of the graves .
But al - Shabab sees things differently .
The group 's spokesman in the town of Kismayo , Sheikh Hassan Yaquub , told the BBC Somali Service that his movement considered that the memorials were being worshipped and that this was idolatry - banned by Islam .
" The destruction of graves is not something new : we target graves that are overdecorated and ones used for misleading people .
" We are not aiming at the sheikhs [ religious leaders ] and their standing in the society , but it is forbidden to make graves into shrines , " Mr Yaquub said .
Mosques closed Grave are being desecrated wherever al - Shabab is in control .
The town of Brave is home to a number of minority groups .
Among them are the Sufi Bravenese , a Bantu group who speak a language unique to their town called Chimbalazi , similar to Swahili .
Many of the graves of their religious leaders have been attacked .
Graveyard caretakers have been arrested and told not to go back to work .
The disappointment and sadness of this community has reached beyond Somalia .
" The people of Brave feel the desecrations of graves are actions against humanity , " said Mohamed Sheikh , a Bravenese community leader in Manchester in the north - west of England .
" The Islamists closed the mosques and said no - one could pray at the ones near graveyards - arguing that the prayers performed there could not be proper prayers and would amount to worshiping the graves themselves .
" These people [ he avoids mentioning al - Shabab by name ] cannot teach us about Islam .
Islam reached Brave and all the coastal areas when the religion arrived in East Africa 1,250 to 1,300 years ago .
" The living person can at least defend himself , but the dead cannot .
The spirits of the dead deserve respect .
Even when we walk near graves we walk slowly , because while the bodies are dead , the spirit is not .
Destroying graves is despicable . "
Fighting back
There is evidence that the anger is stirring the usually peaceful Sufis to take up arms and fight back against al - Shabab .
Has al - Shabab made a strategic error in antagonising the Sufis ?
The umbrella group Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama ( Sufi Sects in Somalia ) has condemned the actions of what they call the ideology of modern Wahhabism and the desecrations of graves .
They see Wahhabism as foreign and ultimately un-Islamic .
Wahhabism is a branch of Sunni Islam dominant in Saudi Arabia .
It preaches a more literal interpretation of Islam and condemns innovations in Islam and rituals .
It is at the opposite end of the spectrum of Islam to Sufism .
" These radical groups shed Muslim blood every day and they dig out and desecrate our graves .
They are funded from outside and their Wahhabi ideology is foreign and must be dealt with , " says the group 's spokesman Abdirasak Mohamed Al Ash'ari .
The group has now joined forces with the embattled government of President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , a moderate Islamist , against al - Shabab .
Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama now controls much of the Galgadud Region in Central Somalia after they defeated al - Shabab in a number of battles .
In one of their battles they managed to kill a senior al - Shabab leader .
By antagonising the Sufi groups , al - Shabab may have gone too far .

Last week the Minnesota attorney general sued the National Arbitration Forum alleging credit card companies were too closely tied to the creditors in the arbitrations the NAF conducted between consumers and credit card companies .
This weekend , a settlement was reached and the NAF - one of the biggest players in the credit card arbitration game , according the WSJ Law Blog - will no longer be a forum for consumer - related arbitrations .
This suit is going to get a lot of attention when Obama 's proposed Consumer Protection Agency gets rolling .
From Business
Week :
The settlement with the National Arbitration Forum comes after the Minnesota AG sued the firm on July 14 for consumer fraud , deceptive trade practices , and false advertising .
The civil suit , filed in state district court in Minneapolis , alleged conflicting ties between the NAF and debt - collection law firms that represented major credit - card companies .
The suit also alleged that New York hedge fund Accretive LLC owned stakes in such collection law firms and the NAF , sending arbitration business between the two .
Under the terms of the consent decree , dated July 17 and signed by the AG and NAF officials , the arbitration firm by the end of this week will stop accepting new consumer arbitrations of any sort .
These include arbitrations over disputed credit - card debt as well as new lines of business the NAF has moved into , such as arbitrating consumer debts in healthcare , telecommunications , utilities , mortgages , and consumer leases .
The only business NAF can now be involved with is in arbitrating Internet domain disputes , a business it has long been in .
The settlement throws in turmoil an increasingly favored venue for credit - card companies to collect disputed debts from card holders .
Since the beginning of the decade , most card companies have included mandatory arbitration clauses in credit - card contracts , forcing consumers to arbitrate rather than use the courts .
The Minnesota suit said that Bank of America , JP Morgan Chase , Citigroup , Discover Card , and American Express use NAF , which is based in St. Louis Park , Minn .
Attorney General Swanson will testify this week before Congress and will ask that mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer contracts be prohibited , according to the Minnesota Star - Tribune .
As we mentioned earlier , one of the powers of the proposed Consumer Protection Agency is to review and potentially ban mandatory arbitration clauses in certain contracts , although no one really knows which ones yet .
With AG Swanson already asking industry heavyweight the American Arbitration Association to voluntarily end its own credit card - related arbitrations , a major shake - up in the industry could be on its way .
If mandatory arbitration clauses are prohibited , when a customer dispute arises or the card company needs to enforce a debt and more informal collections fail , the company will have to either bring the case in court or request the cardholder submit to mediation or arbitration .
It is important to point out that nothing has been said about ending voluntary arbitrations .
The parties can still agree to arbitrate either once a dispute arises or when they enter into a mutually negotiated contract .
But if credit card and other consumer companies can no longer insist disputes be kept out of court , the flood of lawsuits tort reformers always threaten - according to the suit , the NAF handled more than 200,000 collection claims in 2006 - could actually occur .
Complete destruction of mandatory arbitration clauses is unlikely - the lobbyists for the related industries are sure to see to that .
But the back - and - forth could result in a few compromises that give consumers more power in choosing the location and forum for the arbitration , as well as increased abilities to appeal the arbitration decision .
Some argue there could be a flip side to that increase in consumer power .
Credit card companies clearly believe arbitration is the cheaper option , and any increase they see in costs to fight court battles will likely be passed on to consumers through higher fees , higher rates and less credit availability .
There 's no such thing as a free lunch , even if you put it on your credit card .
The intricacies of arbitration clauses are no doubt tiresome ( which is why none of us ever read them ! ) , but the fight over them could be huge .
adding science to executive pay
Paradoxically , huge bonuses at relatively long intervals set us up for failure .
After the recent AIG scandal , executive pay once again became a sore topic for many companies .
How much should they pay their CEOs ?
Are they paying too much ?
What about the prearranged severance packages and what do they mean to investors ?
But as they debate away , they may be missing something very important .
The underlying premise behind today ’s executive compensation with giant , year - end bonuses could be setting senior management up for failure rather than motivating them to perform better at work .
In my recent column for BusinessWeek , I examined studies by behavioral economist Dan Ariely which put the time honored idea of bigger pay motivating better performance to the test with a seemingly counterintuitive result .
For any task that requires creativity and problem solving , the lure of a huge bonus keeps throwing people off and impeding their performance .
It seems that after a certain figure , the bonuses are so outsized and the anticipation of the massive reward is so great , the stress starts messing with the brain and takes away our focus from the work we ’ll have to do to get the money .
If you ’re solving puzzles or taking tests in a study group , it ’s not a big deal .
If you ’re managing a company with 60,000 employees and untold billions in capital , a gargantuan annual bonus can steer you into disaster territory .
Snap judgments are made , risks are n’t properly evaluated , missteps happen and next thing you know , the company ’s stock is down 20 % and analysts are advising anyone who ’s listening to sell .
But wait a second , are n’t C - level execs supposed to be able to live up to the pressure ?
Yes , but their brains are working against them .
The evolution of the human mind has n’t caught up with the rigors of today ’s corporate life and its limitations are what ’s behind the problems we have with our attention spans when a bag of money is waved in front of our noses .
Ariely also found that the same problems appear when public scrutiny becomes a big factor .
The more we keep looking over people ’s shoulders , the more mistakes they make .
This does n’t mean we ca n’t go around criticizing bad bosses and CEOs who bet the farm and lost .
However , putting execs up to the microscope and publicly evaluating their every move is going to raise their stress levels through the roof and get them to make more mistakes .
It ’s just how their ( and our brains for that matter ) are wired .
So how do you reward a CEO for a job well done ?
A potential solution is to set up milestones at the end of every quarter , each one building up to where the company wants to be at the end of the year and if the quarterly goals are met , pay a smaller bonus at the end of the quarter .
This does n’t have to be a pay cut , it ’s just paying the annual bonus in quarterly installments and the smaller sums with shorter time horizons should help executives focus on getting to their end goal one step at a time and doing it right .
The same research which shows that the promise of immense rewards at the end of the tunnel throws off performance , also found that a moderate bonus both improves performance and keeps workers on task .
So if you ’re on a compensation committee of a company ’s board of directors , remember that just like everything else in life , a little moderation does wonders .
All right , now we know a potentially better way to structure an executive ’s pay but what about a total dollar amount ?
How much is too much ?
When does a CEO get too comfortable and starts losing incentive ?
Well , a study from the Great Depression by a then - Harvard finance instructor hints at an idea of an optimal ratio of revenue to executive pay .
In his research , companies that paid the highest percentage of revenues to their CEOs performed worse and recovered slower than companies with more moderate compensation schemes .
If someone were to do a reverse study and find a good range of pay to earnings ratio , we could establish a sliding scale that will help compensation committees in making their final decisions .
I have a resource scheduling issue in Java where things need to be sequenced , but there are restrictions on what resources can be next to each other .
A good analogy is a string of " digits " , where only certain digits can be next to each other .
My solution was recursive , and works fine for small strings , but run time is O ( X^N ) , where X is the number of possible digits ( the base ) , and N is the length of the string .
It quickly becomes unmanageable .
Using the compatibility matrix below , here are a few examples of allowed strings
Length of 1 : 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4
Length of 2 : 02 , 03 , 14 , 20 , 30 , 41
Length of 3 : 020 , 030 , 141 , 202 , 203 , 302 , 303 , 414
0 1 2 3 4 ---------------------
0| 0 0 1 1 0 1| 0 0 0 0 1 2| 1 0 0 0 0 3| 1 0 0 0 0 4| 0 1 0 0 0
My solution for counting all strings of length N was start with an empty string , permute the first digit , and make a recursive call for all strings of length N - 1 .
The recursive calls check the last digit that was added and try all permutations that can be next to that digit .
There are some optimizations made so that I do n't try and permute 00 , 01 , 04 every time , for example - only 02 , 03 , but performance is still poor as it scales from base 5 ( the example ) to base 4000 .
Any thoughts on a better way to count the permutations other than trying to enumerate all of them ?
One of the most talked about aspects of the emerging HTML 5 specification is the new video tag .
Several browsers including Google Chrome , Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox support HTML 5 video already , though to date Microsoft 's Internet Explorer ( IE ) does not .
The HTML 5 video tag removes the need for a browser to embed a separate video player ( like Flash ) and enables the Web page to control the player .
One of the big sticking points for the HTML 5 video specification revolves around the issue of which ( if any ) codec to include by default .
The latest iterations of the HTML 5 specification have removed any direct requirement for a codec , be it H.264 or Ogg Theora .
Mozilla supports
Ogg , while other browser vendors have been leaning toward H.264 which includes patented technologies .
It is issues around codecs and patents that could limit the effectiveness of HTML 5 video and its adoption by both Web site developers and even browser vendors .
" We do not currently support the AUDIO or VIDEO tag and are concerned about the patent issues that surround some of the codecs , " a Microsoft spokesperson told InternetNews.com .
" We 'll continue to be involved in the HTML working groups around this issue and work to find a viable solution . "
Microsoft released Internet Explorer 8 in March of this year and includes numerous features from the under development HTML 5 specification .
Among the HTML 5 features supported by IE 8 are AJAX Navigation which enables the use of the back button in Ajax Web sites .
DOM
Storage provides new capabilities to let the browser store and retrieve data on a user 's hard drive .
" We are committed to providing a browser that accurately supports Web standards , " Microsoft 's spokesperson said .
" Our primary concern was making sure that we got CSS 2.1 , a specification that has reached final candidate stage , done right before we moved on to specifications that are still in development and may change .
HTML 5 is still a standard in progress , and while Internet Explorer 8 does support some parts of HTML 5 and other browsers support some parts of HTML 5 , no one supports the whole thing . "
Mozilla 's recently - released Firefox 3.5 is among the browsers that support many HTML 5 features , including Video .
In the case of Firefox 3.5 , the Ogg video codec is specifically supported as part of Mozilla 's efforts to encourage open video across the Web .
Mozilla staffers have said in the past that they encourage others , including Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) and Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , to adopt Ogg as the default HTML 5 codec as well .
Spokespersons from Apple and Google did not respond to InternetNews.com 's requests for comment by press time .
Even without HTML 5 formally specifying a default video codec , Mozilla 's view is that the video tag is still useful .
" The video tag and the video JavaScript API allow developers to treat video as a first - class citizen of the Web , " Mozilla Standards Evangelist Arun Ranganathan told InternetNews.com .
" There is great value in the Video tag and API , but we are keen to see a common video codec emerge on the Web that is both free to use and of a high quality for Web applications . "
The HTML 5 specification itself is still in the drafting phase , which means the final version could potentially still be adjusted to specifically include a default video codec .
" We will continue to lobby for the inclusion of Ogg Theora as part of the normative part of the HTML5 specification , " Ranganathan said .
" Ogg is free and of high enough quality - per - bit for use within Web applications .

Serving the Doctor Who community since 1993
This is mainly a text WWW site that recalls a day before Facebook and Twitter , and the currently revised series of Doctor Who .
Yes , this website is a snapshot of the " lean years " before the Doctor returned in 2003 .
Since so many sites have tons of information about the new series of Doctor Who , I 've decided to not keep updating this site with that material but I 'm just leaving things as they were years ago .
So please do n't send me any updates on websites , or corrections to information since I do n't have the time to correct things .
Odds are you can find whatever you are looking for using Google .

Stats : Since I do n't use one of those dorky things that keep track of how many people log in ( I find that they slow down the page downloading ) I just give the year - to - date total .
I do like looking at stats - very revealing info .
Here they are :
In 1935 , a French politician asked Joseph Stalin to appease the Pope by tolerating Catholicism in the Soviet Union , where atheism was the state religion .
Stalin roared  The Pope !
How many divisions has he got ? 
In fact , the Pope had many divisions throughout the world .
Catholic churches and schools taught the faithful that God , not man , ruled over the universe .
These unarmed divisions destroyed Soviet - style communism from within and exerted Western Catholic pressure from without .
That was then , this is now .
Has Pope Benedict XVI lost his divisions , especially schools , to the relativism that he denounces in his recent encyclical ( Caritas in Veritate ) ?
From Rome , the Pope calls for virtuous conduct in the marketplace , yet Church teaching no longer trickles down to the Catholic masses the way it once did .
As spiritual transmission lines ,  Catholic schools face two challenges : the exodus of Catholics to value - neutral  public schools , and the subversive influence of academics who flout the  Magisterium ( the teaching authority of the Roman Catholic Church ) .
Historically , Catholic schools played a special role in America , where immigrants faced hostile Protestants who used public schools to impose their brand of Christianity on the inferior races  arriving from Eastern and Southern Europe .
In Race and Liberty in America , I show how anti-Catholicism peaked in the 1920s when the Ku Klux Klan persuaded Oregon to ban all church schools .
The Supreme Court struck down this odious law , declaring that children were not  mere creature [s ] of the state . 
Catholic schools continued to operate without State interference , thus offering Catholics and black migrants an alternative to state - run education .
As a graduate of Catholic schools , I benefitted from this school choice .
During the 1970s , my public schooling culminated with the violent anarchy of junior high school .
My parents sent me to a nearby Catholic high school .
The absence of fear was liberating .
The nuns , priests , and lay teachers offered a well - rounded education , including religious training .
In 1980 , I was off to Catholic college for study of the Great Books , history and rigorous coursework in religion ( biblical criticism is not for lazy students ) .
I gained a deeper understanding of Church teaching even if my work - hard , party - hard side sometimes got the better of me .
In 1994 I returned to my alma mater as a lecturer .
The college had opened its doors to sixties radicals bent on reconstructing the school in their own image .
As I taught History , the tenured radicals pummeled students with sensitivity training , lessons on white privilege ,  feminist discussion of the Goddess , and library display of gay or transgender authors .
The Great Books program was gone , replaced by a diversity  curriculum .
There was no time left for schooling future professionals in the virtues that the Pope and Church deem necessary for living the Good Life .
Fifteen years later , the situation is worse .
Catholic schools have blended into the great Blob of Diversity that has homogenized State schooling .
We are witnessing a disuniting of the American Catholic body by those hostile to Church teaching .
Academic administrators , eager for the respect of their peers , mimic the schools that once sneered at dogmatic Catholic education .
The best education , progressives argued , was pragmatism based on modern ( later postmodern ) notions of citizenship .
Few paused to consider how time passed by their pragmatic causes : eugenics , admission quotas limiting Jews progressives rushed off to new causes forgetting the damage wrought by their past handiwork .
One might ask :
Who will pass on the essence of Pope Benedicts latest teaching ?
Or the basic Truths of the Church ?
Or simply offer school choice to those trapped in failing public schools ?
Non-Catholics ought to be concerned about the survival of Catholic schools because Catholic dioceses subsidize the tuition of disadvantaged minority students an act of charity that our government has yet to take ( and probably shouldnt given the States track record ) .
American Catholics must recover sanity in their schooling .
In his latest message , the Pope reminds us that a marketplace of value - neutral people is on the road to destruction .
Benjamin Franklin said as much 200 years ago :  Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom .
As nations become corrupt and vicious , they have more need of masters . 
It is time for Catholics and others to abandon value - neutral schooling .
This is something that Catholics , Protestants , and Jews can agree upon .
The Catholic school is just one avenue to get the message across .
Home schools , Protestant schools , yeshivas are essential as long as the State abandons public school children to the anomie of mass culture .
 Trickle - down  theology via the mass media is not enough .
Virtue takes conditioning , and like learning a language , it is better to start young .
If Catholic schools dont do it , parents will simply leave the Church ( as they have in droves ) , for what have we to offer our children if we are like the rest of society ?
 You can not go on seeing through things for ever .
The whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it .
. . .
If you see through everything , then everything is transparent .
But a wholly transparent world is an invisible world .
To see through all things is the same as not to see .C. S. Lewis , The Abolition of Man

I am very concerned that some BNP members pass their sick ideas off as Pagan or " Odinist " .
This absolutely disgusts and infuriates me .
I am a Norse Tradition Pagan and my husband is a Pagan occultist .
We are raising our son with Pagan values , none of which remotely approach those of the BNP .
I have no doubt we , along with any other " alternative " religion would be stamped upon if the BNP came to power .
I have two very good friends who choose an itinerant lifestyle making their living as artists .
I should imagine they would be a target for persecution as would many following the Romany tradition .
Finally I have had too many good friendships with gay people to list individuals .
One of my best ever friendships was with a transgendered person ( sadly I have now lost touch with her ) .
You need only watch from afar the ridiculous furore going on over gay marriages in the US to realise how quickly the clock can be turned back , and gay , lesbian , bi and transgendered people denied their rights .

Pagans and Odinist
Where on earth did that one come from - I have never heard or read anything like this in the BNP material nor is there any intended persecution of any religion but there would be a promotion of Christianity .
Again , where is there talk of persecuting people following a romany way of life .
As for the gay way of life the BNP have no objection to what people do behind closed doors but the BNP will not actively encourage nor support the promotion of Gay lifestyles .

Effective
If this is your idea of effective action you are wasting your time .
Your article is full of exaggeration and half truths .
The BNP is not the real enemy of the people nor is it the answer to all our problems but like the UKIP is attracting support from people fed up being led into an EU Superstate , and seemingly unlimited immigration into an already overcrowded island .
The real enemy is the Rothschild Syndicate that rules the London Money Power that in turn through many tentacles is behind this push to centralisation of power and de-nationalisation .
The three main parties are all led by people leading us down this road .
Lord Mandelson is their current number ONE fixer in the government .
Sadly it is the nationalist parties that offer the only serious opposition to more and more centralisation ( communism ) and so those who oppose this have nowhere else to go except possibly the UK Green Party .
Their polices however , are a mixture of very good ( Monetary Policy ) and the really awful ( sustainable development , global warming ) .

Surely some mistake - i can't believe that many people actually agree with the BNP I can only assume that the majority of people who voted BNP did it as a warning to the main parties , or were oblivious of the hate - filled views of the BNP .
I had a look on the net for BNP policies and speeches and i am astounded at all the violent , racist , sexist , homophobic dross they believe in .
If they ever had any serious power , anyone who believes in equality of opportunity for ALL HUMANS would be at risk .
It is still my hope that the majority of the population would never let this happen , but we do have to remember the quote ( disputedly ) by Edmund Burke ; " All that is necessary for the forces of evil to win in the world is for enough good men to do nothing " .

Especially as DP has mnay other relatives here , and one of my Uncles is also a race traitor with 3 children .
I can't even begin to mention everyone we all work with and friends in similar situations .
The list would again treble I 'm sure !

Democracy under the BNP ?
My main concern is for the death of democracy under BNP rule .
They pledge to reinstate National Service and if you do n't join the armed forces then you wo n't have the right to vote .
Even if you do your National Service working as a civilian the right to vote will still not be afforded you .
How is that democracy ?
It 's in their 2005 Election Manifesto .

Re : Democracy under the BNP ?
Firstly your reply brought to my husband 's attention how many times the BNP have slightly changed the wording of their manifestos .
They arent exactly the most forthcoming and honest of groups as a whole .
Secondly , the problem ( well one of the problems ) with the BNP is their total lack of inclusion .
They want to run a country filled with people who think like them and obey them .
That will absolutely never happen unless they commit great acts of violence .
Any real contender for government would be able to govern the whole country and not just their mates .

Many had deep roots in the sub -continent .

Re : BNP the greatest I 'm not sure I follow your argument .
Britain ruled India as a government - India was a conquered land .
The East India Company exploited India and the British government took over total control .
It is not remotely the same thing as immigrantation .
You are confusing immigration with invasion .
And I am not sure stoic is the best word to use for everything that went on in India .

Abysmal
What an abysmal article .
I would have thought that now the EU election is over , all this anti British National Party propoganda would be at an end until the next election , of whatever kind , was imminent .
The BNP must be the only political party in existence where everyone else seems to have their own seperate ideas of what their policies are .
This article is typical of the stereotypical paranoia that the BNP 's opponents churn out at every opportunity , most of which appears to be based on other political parties from bygone era's .
The BNP made a strong showing at the recent EU election , but are still a long way off from power .
The real threat comes from various elements in the Labour and Conservative parties and the EU commissioners , to say nothing of leftist paranoia .
From : erinnorman

Re : Abysmal I appreciate what you are saying but I am not paranoid .
There is a lot of very strong evidence that the BNP are not inclusive or forward thinking whatsoever and indeed their participation with various forms of violence and bigotry is repugnant to me .
I am not writing this because of a looming election .
I am writing it because I want people to understand that a country ruled by a political party who bases their policies on race , religion , exclusion and xenophobia will damn our country .
Another commentator has said that progressives are the cause of society 's ills .
I dispute that .
Being progressive and forward thinking does not mean you get rid of all of the wonderful long standing traditions , or that you race towards an insane or unknown outcome .
It means you continually try to improve your world .
Thank god for progressive thinking it is what got us out of the dark ages and average lifetimes of 30 years .
I also disagree that being against the BNP makes you " leftist " or " liberal " .
I dont care one bit about fitting in to anyone 's standards or ticking any boxes .
I make each opinion and decision as much as possible based on my own reason .
And having a hatred for racism and bigotry does not necessarily a liberal make .
Perhaps the BNP are widely misunderstood because its leaders have so often slightly changed their stance .
How can you take a party seriously or have faith in their integrity when there is proof that Mr. Erikson said himself he was " deliberately provocative " to " stimulate debate " when it was proven that he was the man behind the infamous " rape / handbag theft " comparison in the Sir John Bull blog .
And then when confronted with proof of his authorship he says " It 's typical of the media to distort what the BNP say . "
Are we then in a position where a BNP leader or member can say any number of violent , reprehensible statements , and then have the convenient get out clause that the poor BNP are so misunderstood ?
Or perhaps people do not give them the benefit of the doubt because they are so often found deep in these pits of lies and hatred .
At any rate thank you for your contribution .

Yes , Let 's Erin , Go Home ?
All things considered this must be the most ridiculous article I can ever recall reading in an online newspaper , particularly in view of that , for better or worse , the British National Party received some 6.3 % of the vote in the recent EU election .
This I would imagine is their most successful nationwide election result to date .
Congratulations , British National Party .
However , no party gets anywhere near winning any election on 6.3 % of the vote and the prospect of the BNP or indeed any of the other ' minor ' parties like UK Independence Party
( congratulations , once again ) Respect or the Green Party , making any gains whatsoever , under the first - past - the - post Westminster parliament system , is extremely unlikely to put it mildly .
Therefore , one can only assume that this piece is , in fact , fundamentally based on either neurosis or paranoia or something similar .
In view of that I am not aware of any BNP policy , that advocates the removal of American 's from the UK , I can only assume that either the author is some type of ethnic minority herself or her husband is .
Yet , even in the event of anyone coming to power , who was intent on revoking anyone 's citizenship , then her option , unlike some others , would be fairly straightforward .
Go home , taking hubby and junior too .

Friction in the saddle may be a factor Professional cyclists should consider freezing their sperm before embarking on their careers , say researchers .
They found sperm quality drops dramatically with rigorous training .
The Spanish study of top triathletes found those who cover more than 186 miles ( 300 km ) a week on their bikes have less than 4 % normal looking sperm .
At such levels , men would have " significant fertility problems " , the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology heard .
Men training for triathlons are spending much more time in the saddle than the average social cycler or someone who might cycle to and from work
Dr Allan Pacey
University of Sheffield However , a UK expert said the average man cycling to work would be unlikely to suffer fertility problems because of their time in the saddle .
Study leader Professor Diana Vaamonde , from University of Cordoba Medical School in Spain said other studies had shown very high levels of exercise affected fertility in both men and women .
In the latest study , 15 triathletes with an average age of 33 , were asked not to have sex for three days before giving a sperm sample .
When the results were compared with their training routines , only cycling - not swimming or running - was linked with sperm quality .
All of the men - who had been training for an average of nine times a week for eight years - had less than 10 % of normal looking sperm , compared with the 15 - 20 % seen in the most fertile men .
In those who managed more than 186 miles a week on their bikes , the proportion of sperm that was the correct size and shape had fallen to 4 % , the point at which men may struggle to conceive without fertility treatment .
Abnormalities
Heat from wearing tight clothing , friction of the testes against the saddle and stresses on the body from the sheer amounts of energy needed to do such rigorous exercise , could all contribute to poor sperm quality , said Professor Vaamonde .
The team are doing further research work in how cycling may effect metabolic processes in the body which lead to the development of abnormal sperm .
She added it was unclear whether sperm quality would improve if men retired from the sport but that after years of wear and tear this was unlikely .
" Something which could be done would be to have their sperm frozen but when they start training they do not realise what damage can be done to their sperm . "
Ways of protecting cyclists against fertility problems should also be researched she said .
" Depending on the mechanism leading to creation of abnormal sperm , these could include giving antioxidants and modifying training regimes to all for recovery . "
Dr Allan Pacey , senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield , said there had been a lot of interest in cycling and male fertility but results had been mixed .
" It is important to stress that even if the association between cycling and poor sperm morphology is correct , men training for triathlons are spending much more time in the saddle than the average social cycler or someone who might cycle to and from work . "
He added that 40 years ago cycling was much more common but there is no evidence men then were less fertile .

Chin Peng .
May 31 , 2009 -- Malaysiakini --
The Socialist Party of Malaysia ( PSM , Parti Sosialis Malaysia ) became the latest party to urge the government to allow former Communist Party of Malaya ( CPM ) chief Chin Peng to return home for good .
The PSM said the government must honour the peace accord that it signed with the Communist Party of Malaya in 1989 and allow former CPM leader Chin Peng to return .
“ The government should not backtrack on the peace accord and deny the rights promised to the former communist leader ” , said PSM secretary - general S. Arutchelvan .
The peace accord was signed between the Malaysian government , the CPM and the Thailand government in Haadyai , Thailand , on December 2 , 1989 .
Chin Peng , 85 , whose real name is Ong Boon Hua , has been living in exile in Bangkok and has sought permission from the government to be allowed to return home .
However , his request has been rejected and a court case to compel the government to allow his return has also failed .
The court rejected the application when he could not produce his birth certificate and Malaysian citizenship documents .
Since then various quarters have asked the government to allow the former communist leader to be allowed to return based on his old age and his plea to visit his family members ...
The government has clearly stated that it would not entertain any request for Chin Peng to be allowed back .
However , the ban seems to be applicable only to Chin Peng as previously the government has allowed Communist Party members Rashid Maidin , Abdullah CD , Shamsiah Fakeh , Zainon Ah Yan , Suraiani Abdullah and Abu Samah Mohamad Kassim to return .
“ According to the deal , they [ former communists ] will be allowed to come back into the country and reside if they follow the Malaysian laws ” , explained Arutchelvan .
He also said that those who objected to Chin Peng 's return home should not be pointing to the cruelty of the communists as a reason .
“ The Japanese army during their occupation of Malaya had also tortured and murdered thousands of Malaysians .
However , now they are welcomed with open arms to invest in our country .
Why the double standards ?
Let us forget the past and move ahead through reconciliation -- that should be the Malaysian spirit , ” he said .
The PSM , with its national congress underway in Ipoh until June 1 , will table a resolution to urge the government to allow Chin Peng to return to the country .
PSM congress
This year ’s PSM congress will also see party polls taking place .
However , there will be no contest for the four top party posts .
Incumbent party president Nasir Hashim , 64 , deputy president M. Saraswathy , 56 , secretary - general Arutchelvan , 42 , and treasurer A Sivarajan , 39 , all retained their posts without contest .
However , there will be a keen contest for the election of five central committee members .
A total of 14 members are contesting in the election which will be held on May 31 .
It 's one of the few great archaeological mysteries of the world , and now a bunch of gadget - wielding geeks are going to try and solve it .
The tomb of Genghis Khan , founder of the Mongol empire and one of the world 's greatest and most ruthless emperors , has remained hidden for nearly eight centuries .
According to legend , Khan died in 1227 near the Liupan mountains of China and is thought to be buried in the northeastern region of what is currently Mongolia .
Now a group of researchers led by University of California San Diego 's Center of Interdisciplinary Science for Art , Architecture and Archaeology , with funding from National Geographic , have embarked on a quest to find this ancient grave .
Their secret weapon : an array of technological gizmos ranging from unmanned aerial vehicles to sophisticated satellites and 3 - D displays .
" This is a first of its kind , ” says Mike Henning , a researcher at UCSD , “ a large scale expeditionary - type project that promises to open up new doors for technology . "
Hennig and the entire expeditionary team left for Mongolia earlier in July and will be there until the end of the month .
They will do most of their work in an 11 - square mile region in Mongolia flying two UAVs , directing satellite imagery and collecting data that will be processed at home later .
GeoEye
Satellite imagery will play a key role in the search for the tomb .
GeoEye , a company that offers geospatial data from high - resolution cameras on board its orbiting satellites , will work with the researchers .
Based on their instructions , GeoEye will point its Ikonos satellite at regions where Khan 's grave is likely to be .
The resultant imagery will be downloaded from Ikonos via a microwave downlink and processed at GeoEye 's office in Denver .
" Kids in MIT are using our satellite imagery to study urban planning in Mexico City , " says Matt O'Connell , CEO of Geo - Eye .
" Georgia
Tech is working to track gorilla habitats and now we hope our satellite can help find the tomb of Genghis Khan . "
GeoEye's Ikonos satellite launched about 10 years ago .
Ikonos orbits the earth every 90 minutes and can create color images with a resolution of up to 1 meter .
The satellite is 423 miles up in the sky .
" With the Ikonos images we can see something the size of 32 inches on the ground , " says O'Connell .
Currently , GeoEye has three satellites in orbit : the Ikonos , GeoEye1 and OrbView 2 .
GeoEye 's customers include governments and businesses .
For instance , pictures from GeoEye1 satellite are used in Google Maps and Google Earth .
In tests earlier , the average GeoEye image given to the UCSD project members covered about 6.8 square miles and was about 300 MB in size .
" They can apply data mining algorithms to our imagery and scan for anomalies such as unnatural geometric formations , " says O'Connell .
" It 's the first step in their quest . "

UAVs
Researchers in Mongolia will also be counting on unmanned aerial vehicles to get pictures of the zones that they believe could hold the grave .
" We are looking at a GPS - guided aircraft that can do live streaming and digital still images at the same time , " says Gene Robinson , CEO of RP Flight Systems , whose two UAVs will be deployed for the task .
" Its capabilities are pretty impressive . "
The Texas - based company has been designing and selling UAVs used in search , rescue and recovery missions for about seven years .
Each UAV has a 4 - foot wing span and weighs around 4 pounds , including all the equipment .
The UAVs are made with a composite based on polystyrene and fiber glass and the hull is coated with Kevlar .
The UAVs , powered by a lithium - polymer battery , will fly at a typical altitude of between 400 and 600 feet with each flight lasting about an hour .
The UAVs are standard off - the - shelf systems called the Spectra Flying Wing .
The only customization is a modified camera that can do both infrared and full color images , says Robinson .
Each of the fully autonomous UAVs with sensors costs $ 15,000 .
The biggest draw of RP 's UAVs is that they are unclassified , allowing the images from them to be easily accessed by all .
Aerial vehicles from NASA or most governmental agencies are classified as ‘ dual - use technology , ’ marking them suitable for military and civilian use .
But it also limits how the technology or information derived from it can be used .
" If a dual - use airplane takes pictures , those are considered classified and have to be declassified before anyone can take a look at it , " says Robinson , a process that could sometime take days .
" With us the data is available for immediate distribution . "
Downloading the images from the UAV to a computer is as simple as unplugging the on - board SD card and hooking it up to a PC .
" The image analysis involves looking at patterns , colors , shapes that do n't belong in nature , " says Robinson .

Creating a computational algorithm
Earlier this year , Luke Barrington , a doctoral student at UCSD , released a Facebook application called ' Herd It ' that allows users to discover music , much like Pandora or Last.fm .
The app also lets listeners play word association games based on the music they hear and identify the key themes in the song .
The idea was to create a machine learning algorithm that could analyze and classify music .
Think of it as similar to what Pandora does — the difference being that the Herd
It uses people to train the algorithm instead of having people always classify the music .
" One of the key components in learning systems is that you need to train them with a couple of strong examples , " says Barrington .
" So with Herd It , I developed this game that would collect consensus about what genre a song belongs to . "
The crowdsourcing collects reliable , accurate examples of words people use to describe music , which can be used as training data for a machine learning system .
The system can then listen and analyze songs and describe them the same way that people do .
Turns out that 's exactly the kind of approach that the Genghis Khan expedition needs , which is why Barrington is turning his talents from pop music to image analysis .
With hundreds of satellite images to sift through , the team hopes to use people to find examples of unnatural features .
" One of the challenges with the satellite imagery is that we do n't know what exactly we are looking for , " says Barrington .
" We need human input to find examples of anomalies and unnatural patterns that can be used to train an algorithm . "
It 's also a way to give the larger community a chance to play Indiana Jones .
" We want to help people become a bit of explorers themselves , " says Barrington .
Above : The Herd It application created by Luke Barrington allows participants to rate songs and help the algorithm teach how to identify different kinds of music .
A similar program is likely to be created to help classify features seen in satellite imagery from Mongolia .

HIPerSpace
Picture a massive wall of displays that has the world 's highest resolution and can be used to look through aerial photos of the Mongolian region whose secrets are yet to be revealed .
UCSD 's HIPerSpace or the Highly Interactive Parallelized Display Space can do just that .
HIPerSpace was first deployed in 2006 as an ultra-high resolution distributed display system .
The system allows researchers to get a sweeping view of their images while still being able to see the smallest details .
" We hope to take the input people provide us on the satellite images and display it on this wall in almost real time , " says Barrington .
Geo - Eye offers the satellite imagery on CDs to scientists for further research .
HIPerSpace has 70 tiles with a display resolution of 35,840 x 8,000 pixels or 286,720,000 pixels total .
The wall uses 30 - inch Dell LCD screens .
And to process the graphics , the system has 80 NVIDIA Quadro FX 5600 graphics processing units .
Together that puts the theoretical computational capability of the entire system at 40 teraflops .

StarCave
If the world 's biggest wall of displays is n't enough , then it 's time to step into the StarCAVE – a five - sided virtual reality room where scientific models can be projected on a 360 - degree screen surrounding the viewer .
Viewers use 3D polarizing glasses to watch the images in front , behind or even below them .
They can even navigate virtually through a building .
When StarCAVE was opened in 2008 , the room had a combined resolution of over 68 million pixels distributed over 15 rear - projected walls and two floor screens .
The pentagon - shaped room has three stacked screens on each wall , with the bottom and top screens titled inward by 15 degrees to increase the feeling of immersion , say UCSD researchers .
" You can stand inside the StarCAVE and all these screens will project in 3 - D , so you almost get the feeling you are flying through the area you are looking at , " says Barrington .
The StarCAVE uses 34 Nvidia processors to generate to generate the images .
Add to that 34 high - definition projectors to create bright left and right eye visuals that combine to form the ultimate 3 - D image .
Each pair of projectors is powered by a quad - core PC running on Linux , with dual graphics processing units and dual network cards to achieve at least 10 gigabit Ethernet networking .

Will all this technological ammunition , can Genghis Khan 's tomb still remain hidden ?
It is possible , says Hennig .
" I would like to go in and think that we would be the ones to find it but there are so many variables , " he says .
" Cultures go great lengths to hide the things they want to . "
Legend has it Khan 's grave is unmarked and a river was diverted over it to make it difficult to find .
Over the centuries it has been a ' forbidden zone . '
It makes the search for the tomb a challenge worthy of our technological prowess .
" Even if we come back and do n't find anything , just being to go there and demonstrate what we can do today with our system is worth it , " says Hennig .
If UCSD researchers can with some certainty point to a location where they believe Khan and his family lie buried , it will be up to the Mongolian government do initiate the process of an archaeological excavation .
It 's now a battle between a wily warrior whose secrets have remained safe for nearly eight centuries and a community of geeks who are determined to unravel it .

An attempted display of unity failed .
Two candidates , Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi , did not attend the ceremony .
The former president , Hashemi Rafsanjani , who was due to have led the prayers , was also absent and Ayatollah Khamenei acknowledged some " different points of view " with the veteran powerbroker .
" Differences of opinion do exist between officials which is natural .
But it does not mean there is a rift in the system .
" Ever since the last presidential election there existed differences of opinion between ( President Mahmoud ) Ahmadinejad and ( former president Hashemi ) Rafsanjani .
" Of course my outlook is closer to that of Ahmadinejad in domestic and foreign policy . "
Album - a- Day is a Crap Art project .
That means that it 's a set of constraints ( the rules below ) which are meant to help you be creative .
There are no special requirements to participate , and no expectations of quality .
Embarking on the Album - a - Day project is a significant commitment of time , but I 've found that it 's pretty fun and rewarding !
To create an Album - a - Day , you record a piece of music following these rules :
When you 're done , you should upload the songs to the internet .
If you have your own web space , that 's great .
If you do n't mind releasing your work under a public license , try archive.org first , since users dont need to sign up to listen to your stuff , and they have really fast servers .
Album - a - day regular Maxfield suggests lulu.com , where you can you put your album up for free download and also sell CDs .
( However , an AAD must be available for free to qualify ! )
If you upload your album somewhere and want to be listed here , let me know when it becomes available .
We 're famous !
Do n't miss the Article in SPIN about us or the 2003 Reuters article covering a number of crap - art - like projects .
Here are some Album - a - Day projects which have been completed :
( The count so far is : 388 registered albums - a- day ! )
Spastic Moose - Then Come The Chunks ( not yet digitized ) - This one was recorded right before my bandmate Sophia and I split for college in 1997 .
We did n't know it was an album - a - day at the time , but it counts !
Tom 7 vs. Ultimate Warrior - Barmy Badger Backpackers ( 30 songs , 23:42 ) -
This one was made by me and my roommate Don , and was the first conscious Album - a - Day effort .
Mostly pretty embarrassing , but there are some gems , I think .
( Scroll down and start with one of my more recent albums , please .... )
Tom 7 - Album - a- Day 2 ( 25 songs , 20:55 ) -
My second project , about 6 months later .
Though there are some good songs on this one too , my warning to stick with later albums still holds ...
Patrick Shaughnessy - Spongy ( 30 songs , 23:57 ) -
This one is by a guy named pshaughn and his accordion .
Reminds me of Music Tapes , sort of .
Patrick Shaughnessy - Funeral Songs of Happy Cloudland ( 20 songs , ?? ) -
Wow , a followup !
Also by psaughn .
Patrick Shaughnessy - Albumhack ( 20 songs , ?? ) - A third by Patrick !
Multi-tracks and effects abound ...
Wum - In Many Houses & Trees ( 15 songs , 22:12 ) - Sophia 's first album - a- day .
Some US Maple influence , mostly good ol ' Sophia .
She has really sophisticated hardware and is good at this stuff , so hers sounds quite good .
Tom 7 - Spacewalk Underway ( 18 songs , 20:00 ) -
My third album - a - day .
Very sing - songy ; more introverted than my last two since I made it alone .
Patrick Shaughnessy - Hypothesis 40 ( 40 tracks , 33:19 ) - Another extensive (! ) effort from Patrick .
He writes , " Produced over a grueling nineteen hours , this album contains several tracks that actually sound like real songs .
I think . "
Maxfield - Plugged In ( 18 songs , 23:18 ) - Max made an album on 10 August 2001 .
Sounds like Ben Folds Five to me .
Good tunes and many untitled .
gif references !
( PS .
Max requests that I add a disclaimer similar to the one for my own first AAD , urging you to listen to his more recent albums first . )
Tom 7 - type mismatch circularity ( 20 songs , 22:30 ) - My 4th album - a- day , featuring mostly guitar songs and more beats than usual .
Tom 7 - Cybercrime Police Station ( 16 songs , 21:22 ) - My 5th album - a-day .
Mainly more of the same , with some beats and home - brew plugin experiments ...
Brackeen - Cartridge of Fun ( 14 songs , 21:06 ) - " i played drums in a band years ago , but since then had n't done much musically besides fool around with a bass guitar and tap drum beats on my desk .
so i went for it , and 16.5 hours later i had 14 amatuerish songs .
some of them are really embarrassing , but there are quite a few i really like . "
Tom 7 - Operation Exemplary Behavior ( 15 songs , 20:53 ) - Another installment of bedroom indie rock courtesy of me .
This one 's a little topical , and has some misleading educational parts .
Tom 7 - Table of Contents ( 15 songs , 20:03 ) - Yet another album ( my 7th ! ) .
Due to circumstances mostly under my control , I took a break in the middle of this album , so that my 24 hours were not contiguous .
How lame is that ?
This album gets - 1,000 points for flagrant rules violation !
Maxfield - The Day Won For The Unshaven ( 14 songs , 20:06 ) - Max 's second album .
This album comes with karaoke - mode !
Tom 7 - Waves 100 Years ( 16 songs , 20:11 ) - Very law - abiding AAD to make up for my 7th one .
Tom 7 - Testify in Hockey ( 15 songs , 20:14 ) - My 9th .
I was shooting for 10 albums in by the end of 2001 but did n't quite make it .
I made this one while I was home over the break with makeshift recording equipment .
Maxfield - Dynamic Equilibrium ( 13 songs , 20:30 ) - Max is entering the Trilogy club with this one .
It 's got drum 'n ' bass , truly .
Pault - Slicing the Mustard ( 10 songs , 20:02 ) - Fellow Pittsburgher
Paul writes , " I 'd been in a songwriting slump lately , so I decided to do this as sort of a calisthenic for the songwriting ' muscle . '
I actually ended up with a few songs that I felt OK with playing in public .
I tend to write a little longer than I 've seen on the other Crap Art projects , but that 's just the way I write ... hope it does n't get too dull . "
Tom 7 - East Key to Trip ( 15 songs , 21:23 ) - Finishing up my decathlon ( 185 songs , 3.5 hours ! ) .
Almost all detuned guitar stuff .
I 'm planning on a surprise for my next album ...
Pault - Pre-Emptive Followup ( 10 songs , 20:15 ) -
In the music biz we call this Pault 's " sophomore effort " .
I think the idea here is that he wrote this album before releasing his first .
Wum - Los Caballos Poseen La Calle ( 8 songs , 22:00 ) - Sophia 's second .
This one is different every time you listen to it , I hear .
Killjoy , FL - Wading in the Gloom ( 7 songs , 22:00 ) - Killjoy says , " Killjoy FL is a folktronica band which will probably dedicate itself entirely to AAD projects .
This was the first attempt , and barely got finished in the 24 hour deadline .
Some of the songs are n't so bad , some are .
But writing , recording and mixing an album in 24 hours is not nearly as easy as one might think .
Even one that sucks . "
They promise more , soon !
Marm & Toc - Reentrant Uperiodic ( 14 songs , 22:45 ) - " Marm & Toc " is the new name for " Spastic Moose " .
Sophia and I only get together once or twice a year , and only for a few days , so I guess this will have to be the new format for our band .
Anyway , this album rocks pretty good .
Rock , rap , neotechnology .
Tight 'n Sloppy style .
Wing L. Mui - Improvised A Crapella ( 17 songs , 20:19 ) - Wing writes , " This whole project started at 1:15 PM and , not counting the lack of fast Internet resulting in slow upload , was finished , including the covers and this page , in seven hours .
As the title implies , most of the songs here were improvised , sung without accompaniment of any sort , and are crap .
To further the crappiness the equipment used for recording was a 5 dollar mic .
Well , at least the lyrics are good .
They are !
Really ! = ) "
Wing L. Mui - Love Songs With Sugar And Milk ( 12 songs , 20:00 ) - Back again !
He writes , " My second album - a - day .
Exactly twenty minutes long .
It was more of a writing exercise since the writing of the lyrics took up the most time ...
Less silliness here than the other one though . "
Nice cover art .
Jason Artman - Dodongo Dislikes Smoke ( 12 songs , 22:48 ) - Zelda fan Jason Artman has put together an album with it all : Nintendo Entertainment System , Ambient , Trance , Robert Plant impersonations .
Cloud Street - A Tragic Life ( 13 songs , 20:02 ) - David from Tasmania recorded this electronica album while procrastinating over an exam .
He 's right , it does sound like Boards of Canada ( but with his own nebular twist ) .
Def Children In Area - Bitch Tits ( 10 songs , 22:00 ) -
They write , " been together for roughly 24 hours .
This was conceived , written , performed and produced within ten hours , and boy does it show .
But hey ten tracks in ten hours ... not bad , eh ! !!! " .
This thing has " Parental Advisory " written all over it .
NFAP !
Maigin Blank - Illustration ( 12 songs , 21:52 ) - I really like this one , the lo - fi stuff and video game keyboards are just my kind of thing .
Arthur Kamst - An Automatic One ( 9 songs , 20:40 ) - Arthur earns the unique distinction of being the first AAD artist to record two albums in two consecutive days .
This is his second ; he writes : " I started at 7:30 PM and finished recording 11:30 .
Three of the guitar / vocals ones ( Don Juan , Tight Noses , Cheddar Cheese ( wich is too long and dull to my taste ) ) have lyrics that were improvised while recording .
I 'm quite happy with how this album turned out to be . "
Max and Ben - Jurassic Bomb ( 11 songs , 20:30 ) AAD Veteran Max writes , " This album was made in 15 hours on 7/14/02 with help from my cousin Ben , who shared the keyboard drum duties and provided some great ( real ) orff instrument playing , as well as some New And Interesting Instruments .
This was the first time I got to use my newly - obtained Digital Performer 2.7 , so it features some harmonies and other overdubs . "
Tom 7 - S - P-E-C-T-R- E ( 16 songs , 20:42 ) I keep saying that my next album will be something different , but what the hell -- while I 've got the energy to keep cranking out the same acoustic bedroom rock , why not ?
Here 's my 11th .
Maxfield - Monograph ( 10 songs , 23:05 )
Max writes , " This is , as far as I know , the first ever ' concept ' Album - A - Day .
Created in a kind of woozy state two days after the removal of my 4 wisdom teeth , this album chronicles the entire experience , from finding out that the surgery was necessary , to recovering from it ( which had n't really happened yet but hey it 's Crap Art ) .
Crappy vocals were generously provided even though ( and because ) I could hardly open my mouth . "
Arthur Kamst - Requiem for the Western World ( 9 songs , 20:40 ) - Arthur says , " Finally , after two rejected categories ( alternative and indie ) for the song ' Dies Irae ' ( which now is enlisted in the Medieval category would you believe ) my first Album a Day is online .
I guess I earn my 1000 points for rules violaton too , as I did n't write the text of ' Dies Irae ' ; it 's an exerpt of the Catholic mass .
Learned my lesson I guess ;-) .
The first song , ' Borss ' I dreamt just before waking up .
Much crap , but ' Goldfish ' ( wich we now play in our band ) , ' In the end ' and ' Visions ' have become my personal favorites ... "
Taut Blue Quality - You Will Be Towed ( 17 songs , 22:52 ) - I got a new electric guitar and Heather helped me make this album .
It 's basically the same thing as the Tom 7 album - a - day series , except that there 's electric guitars and a chick singing sometimes .
Cloud Street - 20'05 " Before Death ( 13 songs , 20:05 ) - David is back again and writes , " To celebrate the end of University forever , I created this album , unfortuately that 's where all good feeling ended .
After a ( too ) pretty album last time I wanted to make something messy and angry .
To achieve this I wrote about a topic I feel terribly strongly about , the stupidity of people who insist on killing other people .
Dictators , terrorists , right wing pro-war supporters all get my wrath cast upon them . "
Belly Wog - Peakin' Out Bruvva ( 11 songs , 29:07 ) - Dave writes , " Sorry I think I 'm addicted , but this time I teamed up with a couple of my friends ( Angus and Paul ) who rose to the AAD challenge nicely .
We 've experimented a lot on this AAD , so what we 've done is organise the tunes in crap - a- logical order with the best songs at the top . "
Right -o. I put the best songs at the top and bottom , too , so that you 're forced to listen to the crap in - between .
Arthur Kamst - Third ( 8 songs , 20:48 ) - Arthur joins the trilogy club , too : " here it is , my third album a day , just in time for the closing of the year .
This time I got an FX - processor to experiment with .
which resulted in some nice deformed guitar - sounds ; I think ' Tear it Down ' is the best song on it . "
Tom 7 - Image Gap Committee ( 15 songs , 20:55 ) - Another one from me .
I think this one is really good ; try it .
team .
lift - trucking ( 8 songs , 20:08 ) -
This site 's in shockwave , so be patient .
It has a song called , " well , tom says I can not have outtakes . "
Hehe .
Maxfield - Total Process ( 11 songs , 20:20 ) - Veteran
Max writes of his sixth album - a - day , " A more straightforward effort after my weird ( but adorable ) last one .
Finished in about 15 hours ( with one 20 minute dinner break [ - 1000 points ?! ] ) , this one features more drum ' n ' bass stuff as well as the return of the Zube Tube ( R ) . "
You do n't lose any points for a 20 minute dinner break , Max .
( sub ) lime spider - Where 's My Bassline ( 10 songs , 20:04 )
Dave 's fourth : " My old band - mate Hugh has been living overseas for the past three years and we thought that an AAD would be the perfect band re-union , and despite three years of diversified listening on both of our accounts we still made music that sounded incredibly like the stuff we used to make - maybe it was just force of habit . "
Tom 7 - Examine Machines and Enrich ( 16 songs , 20:13 ) I tried to make an album with no " filler " at all .
That 's hard when there are no out - takes , but anyway , I did n't make up words as I went along for any of these .
I 've come to really like this album , so check it out .
Dave Dean - A World Without Words ( 6 songs , 20:23 )
Dave writes , " Written in twenty - three hours total , this is a seamless journey from song to song .
Something along the lines of BT and Oliver Lieb mixed together , I guess .
Definitely ' electronic ' in nature , and mostly danceable . "
Maxfield - Altered Beats ( 6 songs , 20:34 ) Max , the second most prolific album - a - day artist , writes , " I 'm pretty pleased with the way this one came out .
The songs are more electronic , featuring my new sampler on the title track which is my most legitimately drum ' n ' bass song yet .
For the most part , the songs are a little more wandering and focused than on my other AADs . "
Arthur Kamst - Cheap Mics ( 9 songs , 20:03 ) Veteran AAD artist Arthur writes , " Tried to steer away from my standard kind of songs , in which I did n't succeed ... ;-)
I think it 's got the first Dutch song in an Abum - a - day - album . "
Taut Blue Quality - Affinity Group ( 16 songs , ? )
Taut Blue Quality is back !
Some of these songs are kinda rushed , since all I really wanted to do that day was play my new Castlevania game .
But there 's some good stuff , too .
Tom 7 - As a Deaf Ear ( 19 songs , 21:35 ) -
This is my most experimental outing to date .
That 's because I made it with new " bonus " rules : I 'm not allowed to listen to the songs as I 'm writing them , or even hear myself play instruments or sing ( I recorded a CD full of noise to play on headphones loud while recording . )
Given the constraints I think it came out pretty neat , though .
Michael J. Nelson - Elephant and Duck , Together at Last ( 15 songs , 20:07 ) - Michael -- not the one from MST3K -- writes , " Some of it is pretty tolerable , I think .
Sounds rock - ish most of the time ; lots of guitar , lots of Casio SK - 1 .
Highlights include a Clash - sounding punk / reggae thing , some Jesus & Mary Chain - style feedback madness , and a nice little disco tune . "
Home For The Def - Open For Business ( 7 songs , 21:00 ) - Home reports , " This is Home For The Def 's first AAD recording - recorded on Tuesday 9th July 2003 in under 12 hours ( including time taken off for meals and about an hour when I went out and bought a new guitar ! ) .
It 's a nice genre ride , moving from hip - hop , hardcore , cock - rock , acoustica , electronica , and quite a few different combinations of all that ( which is more or less my normal style ) .
I found it quite stressful , lyrics were very difficult - I usually work quite quickly ( check my discography at www.homeforthedef.com for proof ) , but found that being forced to do it all in one day was quite hard .
I feel like I should be describing it as building up my chops or something ... "
Ammegand - Crazyflakes EP ( 9 songs , 21:44 ) - EP my ass !
Around here , 20 - minute musical outings are called albums .
Ammegand writes , " I made everything in fruityloops and the tracks are in chronological order .
Alot of the tracks i started at a high bpm and gradually slowed them down while continuously tweaking them and fleshing out parts . "
( And also points us to an earlier , aborted album - a - day effort ! )
Tom 7 - Earthquake Glue ( Doppelganger ) ( 15 songs , 20:06 ) -
This is a new kind of album - a - day .
To do it , select an album you 've never heard before ( I chose Guided By Voices ' upcoming " Earthquake Glue " ) and find a track list for it .
Then , make an album with the exact same song titles ( and imagined subject matter ) as the original .
Following my 13th , I intended this album to be wholly without filler , though A Trophy Mule in Particular comes close .
Cephalad - Cutups Vol. 1 ( 40 songs , 23:12 ) - Gordon from Pittsburgh made this album in January but just finally put it up .
Due to IUMA 's maximum file size limit , it 's presented as two ten - minute MP3s instead of one ultra-long megamix .
He describes his music as , " ... a potpourri of lo - fi techno / electronica , ambience / drones / noise , and other experiments , with a large number of samples strewn throughout . "
James Roberts - Am Aural Drooling ( 8 songs , 20:21 ) - James 's Favourite bits : " the underwater Latino bit which happens halfway through ' Terms With It ' , the weird harmonies on ' Conservatory ' , and the ' what happens when I twiddle these knobs ' bits on ' Mr Sun ' . "
James 's Unfavourite bits : " the discovery after finishing that I subconsciously copied the ' Inconsequence ' guitar from Blur 's ' Jets ' and ' Increase ' chords from Pachebel 's Canon .
( I think . ) "
Cephalad - Cutups Vol. 2 ( 40 songs , 27:20 ) - Another 40 - song , two - m p3 suite .
Gordon remarks , " This features many more solid beat - based instrumentals of a variety of moods and genres , as well as numerous ambient pieces .
In terms of production and overall quality , I would consider this a great improvement over my last Cutups EP . "
Fewn - The New Collapse of The Fourth World ( 13 songs , 27:51 ) - A member of Fewn writes , " i have a band at school with some friends of mine called Blasting Trout Overbite .
one day , we decided to form a new band called Fewn and write and record an entire album before the day was done , and we did just that .
we wrote 13 songs and recorded them that day .
we deemed the Fewn album a triumph , and promptly broke the band up ( though we have done a few Fewn songs live ) .
anyway , this was before we knew of the album a day project , but what we did fits all the criteria . "
40 - 16 - I 'm Falling Down The Stairs ( 5 songs , 53:37 ) - " 40 - 16 is a improvisational art - noise psusdu- ensemble , based out of what could be called Atlanta , GA .
While I 'm not sure this belongs here , it certianly falls well within the requrements , as it was created , start to finish , in less than 6 hours on August 14th 2001 , live without any plans , overdubs , or taste .
40 - 16 's second album is also a 24 hour effort , and will be posted ... eventually .
Furthermore , considering the nature of the psuedo - ensemble , it 's entirely likely that most future albums will also be Album - A - Days . "
TNB AllStars - Evil Eyeball of Doom ( 7 songs , 24:07 ) - David of Cloud Street / Sub( lime ) Spider writes , " Like my other AADs , this album marks a turning point in my life .
I 'm about to move to Japan to spend 12 months teaching English and exploring the country .
Unlike my other AADs , this album was recorded 100 % live with a full band .
Myself and Bryony on Vocals , Angus on Ax , Andrew on keys , Norman , Tracy and Di on Horns , Richard on Bass and Gaylen on Drums .
This was by far the most work I have put into an AAD and I 'm very pleased with the result . "
Standpipe - Dark In The Park ( 9 songs , 21:58 ) - Chris writes , " This is a musical version of my adventures during the blackout on 14 August 2003 in New York City .
I began writing at 10 pm on 16 August and finished the piece at 9:30 pm the next day . "
James Roberts - Album name : This Machine Does Not Accept Money ( 13 songs , 21:20 ) - James 's semi-concept album : " All tracks are titled after signs seen in a Leeds shopping centre .
Hence there 's a consumer - culturey pick - and - mix of genres : drum & bass , dance , blues , glam rock , ambient , noise and psych .
I 'm pleased with it : the quality of songs and production is pretty consistent , and at eighteen hours ' total creation time it did n't seriously derange my sleep patterns .
Still no vocals though . "
Download the ones that start with " AAD2 , " which are spread over two pages .
nothing nothings - Doppelganger : Frenzy ( 14 songs , 45:13 ) Nothing Nothings finished this one in just over 24 hours , but since it clocks in at a mammoth 45 minutes , it clearly makes the cut - off .
This is our second " Doppelganger " album , this time for an album called Frenzy by a band named Split Enz .
He 's posted a track of excerpts for all of our attention - deficit listeners .
Check the site for lots more info !
WiL ( aka TB ) - Twos , Fives , and Tens ( 11 songs , 24:15 ) - WiL writes , " For my album - a - day project , which comes as I prepare to head to Germany for a number of years , I have written a one - man rock opera .
An Eclectic mix of various electronica styles , rap , and various vocals done on my five - dollar mic .
I tried to make this one listenable and I think I 've suceeeded .
Considering I had no outtakes , I think I did a pretty good job of avoiding having any crap songs , but you , the listener , must judge that for yourself . "
Tom 7 - Isabel " Refuses to Weaken " ( 18 songs , 20:53 ) OK , this only " concept " in this album is that I spent only 7 hours on it , total .
Very little care was taken in the recording and mixing , but I think the songs are pretty good in general .
My sixteenth .
nothing nothings - Font of Wisdom ( 12 songs , 20:11 )
Here 's another from Nothing Nothings .
He describes it like this : " I threw away all my equipment and tried to [ do ] the indie bedroom alt - rock thing , but I think it came out more folkie kinda often . "
He gets - 1,000 points for taking a break in the middle his 24 hours ( for work , I guess ) , but gets +999 points because all his songs are named after fonts I made .
The Opportunitystakes - Whoops !
( 12 songs , 20:06 ) - " This electronica / slop metal / bubblegum punk / cheesecore album was made in my dorm room in about 5 hours .
All lyrics were improvised at the time of recording .
Interestingly enough , it is the greatest work of high art in human history . "
Maxfield - Revolution Forever ( 10 songs , 20:16 )
Max says , " Here 's my 8th .
This one has a more indie rock kind of feel than the others because it features poorly played live drums ( I happened to have a drumset at the house for the moment ) .
Also , my good friend Jon Rodgers stopped by about halfway through to help out with some of the songs . "
nothing nothings - Suggest A Title ( 11 songs , 23:10 ) Nothing Nothings joins the elite few who have recorded a trilogy for the AAD project .
He writes , " I invited my friends to give me song title suggestions ; I got about 100 .
I pulled all my equipment out of the trash , went to housesit for a friend where I could play my ( electronic ) drums , and even went a little crazy with ' keyboards ' ( which is actually a guitar synth ) .
I spent about 20 hours ( and slept for 4 hours halfway throgh ) .
Stylistically , it 's all over the map ; most noticeable is an attempt at a ska song . "
nothing nothings - Suggest A Title 2 ( 10 songs , 24:47 )
He says , " The day after I recorded ' Suggest a Title ' , I recorded another AAD , ' Suggest a Title 2 ' , based on the same list of song title suggestions .
For this sequel , I tried to stick more to guitar and avoid the synth - driven stuff .
I also did something a little risky : I recorded the basic idea for all ten tracks first , without having any clue what song they were , and then went back through them and picked titles and wrote lyrics for them .
( I had done this for a few songs on ' Suggest a Title ' , but not many . )
In a few cases , this worked really well ( I think ' Circle Girl ' is one of the best things I 've ever recorded ) .
On the other hand , I think I was a little over - focused on making things sound good , not crappy ( e.g. , what was I thinking recording four tracks of the snare drum in ' Out of Service ' ?!? ) , and as a result , although I spent 21 straight hours on it , I ran out of time to write lyrics and record vocals for all the songs , so half of them ended up as instrumentals with rapidly dashed - off , over - extended guitar solos . "
The Darth Vader Farmers - The Revenge of Zemulust Pontoon ( 11 songs , 22:04 ) - Jason writes in the third person , saying , " Recorded in a manic burst of energy with depressing breaks in between , The Revenge of Zemulust Pontoon is the first album - a - day outing for Jason and Ryan but certainly not the last .
The August 8th , a friday had been filled with both joy and pain , and so the album - featuring mostly acoustic instruments and found sounds - is a bit like a diary to the day that formed the Darth Vader Farmers . "
Maigin Blank - Mr. Drummond 's Got a New Son ( 11 songs , ?? ) - Maigin writes of her second , " Finally !
I got the second AAD that I made up and running ( hopefully ) .
This was recorded and made last year in Oct 2002 sometime , and I 'm just happy to finally have access to upload it . "
Maigin Blank - Mother Superior ( 9 songs , ?? ) -
And her third : " This is my favorite one .
It was also recorded a few weeks after the second AAD in Oct / Nov 2002 .
I think it has the best ' songs ' although they are kind of weird .
I dont know what was in my mind when I made it .
That 's what 's so great about ' producing ' , ' recording ' and ' mixing ' these albums in a day .
You never know what you will end up making . "
Arthur Kamst - Bossano ( 9 songs , 20:43 ) - Arthur writes , " Started saturday 11 am , I finished my fifth AAD just in time sunday , at 10:30 am .
That gets me - 1000 points ' cause I had my sister visiting us saturdaynight , ate , and SLEPT in between songs 5 and 6 .
Oh well .
What 's worse , this one was meant as a Doppelganger of the Pixies ' album Bossanova , but I ran out of time ... so I finished it as a regular one with the songtitles sounding oddly familiar to some . "
You 're free to spend the 24 hours any way you like , so there 's no -1000 point penalty for sleeping .
It 's simply not recommended !
Tim L - Tim L Album - A - Day Volume 1 ( 11 songs , 19:12 ) DJ
Tim from South Africa writes , " This album was written , performed , recorded , mixed and mastered , solo in just less than 23 hours ; with no sleep break in - between .
It just misses the 20 minute mark .
I certainly hope that this does not count against me .
I tried a mixture of short songs with the shortest track being 0:35 and the longest track being 4:41 .
Everything was done by yours truly .
No ideas were chosen before the day , which I found encouraged the creative process .
So what you are about to listen to is 110 % original . "
Well , I 'm pretty sure that Tim gets - 1,000 points for not hitting 20 minutes , but , close enough !
Adam Taylor - Singing Out Of My Range ( 9 songs , 21:00 ) Adam writes , " My first AAD project and I 'm pretty pleased with it .
I hope to get some bonus points for inclding a coconut as a percussive instrument .
It did n't take me long to write but it always takes me a while to work out how to add to initial versions of songs .
The mixing usually takes a while too .
A fun experience , I encourage others to do it . "
OK , +3 points for using a coconut as a percussive instrument .
Tim L - Album A Day Volume 2 ( 11 songs , 21:06 ) - Back for more , Tim writes : " This is my second effort and it went much smoother .
I completed the project in just under 21 hours .
I am really enjoying the creative challenge this provides to my talent .
If I can analogize : It 's like unpacking the attic in anticipation of finding something really interesting .
I hope you enjoy it . "
Maigin Blank - Just A Name ( 10 songs , 20:30 ) - " A new one !
I just finished it .
It feels a bit rushed , but the neighbors were stomping so I dont think they were happy !
I think the best songs are the ' groupie ' ones and the rest are alot of keyboard ones .
Still fun to do but I wish I could have continued to be loud !!! "
nothing nothings - I M So Goofy ( 8 songs , 24:02 ) - Addict Sean writes , " I M So Goofy is my fifth AAD , written and recorded from 6:30 am Saturday to 2:30 am Sunday .
This time around I wrote all the lyrics before anything else , so the song structures are a little tighter to the lyrics .
I think I spent too much time on the lyrics , which is why I only got eight songs done .
I do not recommend only writing eight longer songs -- would you rather have the chance for a couple of gems or just one longer gem ? "
WiL aka TB - starlight : underscore ( 9 songs , 20:43 ) WiL is back for more and says : " AAD # 2 for me .
This one was liked a lot more than the other one .
Track 07 inspired a very small southern california dance craze ( the ' Jett Dance ' ) which continues to this day .
Other people claim to listen to track 03 looped for hours on end .
One of my friends said , ' Well , one thing 's for sure .
Your album does n't bore me . '
SUCCESS ! "
WiL aka TB featuing One Legged Bunny - Bootleg ( 13 songs , 20:05 ) - But wait , there 's more : " This was my third album - a - day in two weeks , when it was first completed maybe two months ago .
This one is a total piece of crap art , done by me and a couple of my friends completely on a whim over the course of about forty - five minutes .
This superior braindump is , as per precedent , done in reverse crap order , with the songs i deem least crappy on top , and the crappier songs on bottom .
Some of this stuff is so messed up I can't even begin to describe how messed up it is to you .
Just listen .
I guarantee you wo n't be disappointed , if not a little disoriented . "
Quincunx - Listen Compute Rock Home ( 15 songs , 20:46 ) - Quincunx 's first album , a doppleganger , was completed in 24 hours .
" Most of the songs were done in a tracker ( sequencer ) program ; a couple were made directly in the wave editing program .
I did play the organ , mini electronic guitar , harmonica , nebulizer tube , etc. , myself .
( I used text - to - speech for the vocals , since , as I mentioned , my own voice is unsuitable . ) "
Zeke the Plumber - Album A Day ( 10 songs , 22:37 ) - All that Zeke cares to mention is : " Zeke the Plumber has no nose ! ! "
Danalog - Things ( 14 songs , 22:02 ) - Danalog 's clever twist : " Songs written using two music composition programs I 've never used before .
Two hours were spent finding and installing the programs , one hour each .
Each individual songs written within the space of one hour , except for the two songs which were the first I created in a given program , which got two hours each , to give me more time to learn the program .
One hour was spent in postprocessing , writing info , uploading , and submitting .
Musical styles are all over the place , the main focus was experimenting with the programs and learning what was possible , and not in actual musical creation . "
His songs all come in one RAR file , so if you click , get ready to decompress !
S/O - Unlit Cigarettes ( 6 songs , 19:21 ) - Shany writes , " this was our first AAD , main purpose was to kick shany in the butt , second purpose - explore our music abilties and get rid of that nasty critical sense . "
- 1,000 points for not quite making it to 20 minutes , but good try !
pia-muk - pre/post ( 6 songs , 20:20 ) - Pia says : " this was an extreme enjoyment for me .
usually i spend way to much time on a song ( longest was 3 months ) and it always sounds over produced .
i started this at 9:00 pm , worked till 3:00 am , and reconviened at 10:00 am , finishing at 3:00 pm .
the songs are simple and direct , but to have a nice flow into each other .
i hope you all enjoy this as much as me and my friends do , ( they could just be being nice ) .
they are reminiscent of electronic of yorn .
i can notice a trans am influence . "
Tom 7 - GGGCAGGG ( 17 songs , 21:45 ) - Just another album - a - day from me .
This one was a special present .
Sorry about those levels ...
Steven Mon - Songs of Desperation and Despair ( 7 songs , 20:11 ) Steven writes : " This was a lot harder than I thought .
I had this idea that I could churn out a song every 30 minutes , but it turned out to be 90 minutes .
Most of the tracks were recorded with one take , and a couple of the songs were improvised while recording .
After the sixth song , I was dead tired , and I kind of cheated with the last song , dragging it out to over seven minutes .
Still , it was fun , and I came up with little bits and pieces I think I can use . "
Jason Irvin - Squeezing the Baby Envelope ( 10 songs , 22:28 ) Jason is back for his 2nd : " I decided to go solo ( from the Darth Vader Farmers ) on this album a day .
It features a keyboard I borrowed from a friend of mine direct into my computer and recorded in Cool Edit .
This album is ambient and noisy , giving it a Merzbow meets The Residents feel .
Recorded 1-9-04 . "
nothing nothings - Seven Sins , Seven Dwarves ( 12 songs , 30:04 ) - Lifer Sean gets a double deduction : - 1,000 points for taking 26 hours and - 1,000 points for the 3rd song being " sort of a cover . "
Fortunately , if we erase song # 3 then it comes in at under 24 hours and over 20:00 minutes , cover - free .
Let 's just call # 3 a " b- side , " shall we ?
Tree Club - I Found Rock ! ( 16 songs , 22:10 ) - " This is the first album - a - day by the world famous Tree Club .
It was written , recorded and produced in 24 hours : from 9 pm 30/01/04 to 9 pm 31/01/04 ( we slept in the middle , so it was actually completed in something like 14 hours ) .
I think this album successfully chronicles how very strange the members of the Tree Club are , and I think you 'll agree when you listen . "
Watzo - This Any Day ( 7 songs , 20:17 ) - First timer Watzo says : " I decided to participate because I usually write / record one song per month , so I could use a little extra drive . "
That 's the spirit !
pia-muk - 1 + - ( 20 songs , 20:00 ) - Coming in at just on the nose , pia -muk writes : " Here it is , my 2nd a - a-d .
This was an experiment in which to see the degredation of a single note layered with a one plugin per song .
The songs are named after the plugin used respectively ( some of which are Tom 's creation ) . "
pia -muk - thirty songs in thirty seconds - ( 30 songs , 0:30 ) - Participating in " The Crunch , " pia -muk writes , " This one i made during one +.
i wanted to push the rules of a -d -d to the limit .
this album ( along with one + ) was made in 5 straight hours . "
It 's actually our first album that only qualifies because of the number of songs rather than the length .
pia -muk - thirty songs in fifteen seconds - ( 30 songs , 0:15 ) - Brevity nut pia -muk says : " thought i'd try it again a little shorter this time .
theres a bit of a structure to this one .
track 31 is all of the songs mixed ( it wasnt working out quite the way i wanted it to individualy ) .
am i overdoing this ?
enjoy !!! "
Whimsical Fetus - The In - Out , In - Outs of Whimsical Fetus - ( 4 songs , 27:33 ) - The mysterious and anonymous Whimsical Fetus writes , " We are pretty .
And we wear make - up .
And our breasts are the super large .
You will stare at us and we will hypnotize you with our musical jigglings .
We live in small rooms .
Attach ourselves to the walls of your favorite Bolliwood super star .
He plays the drums .
I play the synth .
And we give out free hugs .
This album is about free hugs . "
Whimsical Fetus - The Leg's Urethra - ( 6 songs , 31:32 ) - For an apt description of their tunes , read the included blurb : " We sat around in a garage overloading a synth and this cat kept looking at us meowing .
A soft little coo of a meow , it reminded me of Skeeter from Nickelodeon 's Doug .
Once when I ordered a Meatmen album from a respected online music dealership they sent me XTC's ' English Settlement ' instead .
I think I still have some pent up anger about that .
Word is Bond .
I 've named every single one of my instruments after John Henry , the steel driving man .
This album was recorded in one night back last summer .
Every child has an August of 2003 .
This album is dedicated to those that respect the broccoli , and tame the cauliflower . "
pia-muk - north avenue , apt. 2 ( 2 songs , 18:51 ) - Addict pia-muk writes , " bummer , this one comes in 1 minute under the limit .
i recorded this one about 4 years ago when i used to smoke alot of pot .
it was recorded in a winter evening in the y2 k to a tascam porta - 7 using a korg polysix , korg electrovibe , roland drum machine ( i think ) , boss tremolo and a fender strat pluged in direct from a fender combo amp .
i was listening to a lot of sonic boom 's stuff then ( e.a.r. , spaceman 3 ) and it shows .
good times and lonely places . "
- 1,000 points for not making it to 20 minutes !
Grinding Apathy - Right places , strange trash ( 11 songs , 24:17 ) - First timer Mark , who read about us in Newsweek ( ! ) , writes : " I had planned to work for the whole 24 hours but during the time the songs became stranger and stranger .
After 21 hours , when I had finished a song that sounds like a soundtrack for a fictitious C64 computer game I realized it was time to stop .
For the most part the songs are pure crap but at least they sound very obscure and therefore I like them somehow .
And overall the album has a rather dark atmosphere and is really varied so I think despite all it 's deficits it has some right to exist . "
There is a whole " .com " devoted to this album , apparently .
The Cast-iron Geronimos - The Lowland Sessions ( 12 songs , 30:20 ) - Spokesman for the Geronimos writes , " The collaboration of two great bands and five great minds .
Covering most genre's of music .
Pushing the boundaries of possibility even further .
The Conversation and The Generalissimos invade and conquer Devon for the good of music ! "
Feldspar - Between and Among Friends and Strangers ( 17 songs , 24:35 ) - " Feldspar 's first album .
Guy and guitar acoustic folk stuff .
An experiment in cognitive dissonance , mostly .
Songs without structure , words without sentences .
I started with seventeen improvised - at - random acoustic guitar tracks , each between one and two minutes long .
They took a total of fifty - one minutes to record .
I took a break to go to work , then came back , wrote lyrics , then , after a nap , recorded the vocals .
Then I uploaded .
I had a bunch of fun , too ! "
Tlogmer - 2 cigarettes ( 14 songs , 34:15 ) - " The first 20 minutes of Two Cigarettes were recorded in one fell improvisatory swoop around 1 a.m. on March 3rd ( very quietly , so as not to wake my housemates , though the mic being next to the speaker helped the keyboard come through ) .
I spent the next 2 hours dividing it into tracks ( 1 through 11 ) and giving them mildly pretentious titles , then took a picture of myself smoking a cigarette and went to bed .
On waking I decided that the the second Oasis cover , as well as not being strictly allowed , was really fucking bad , and improvised another 4 minutes ( tracks 12 - 13 ) .
Then I took a picture that did n't make me a diseased buffalo and played around with it in Paint Shop ; it 's desktop size and looks a bit like I 'm lighting myself on fire ( like a cigarette ; get it ? )
Finally , around 1 p.m. , I recorded Dr. Robotnik battles the forces of neutrality . "
Whimsical Fetus - Instant Instructions For Those Who Follow No Master ( 6 songs , 21:02 ) - Whimsical Fetus strikes again : " Alex Trebek is known for walking around the set of Jeopardy with a button that says ' Pat Sajack Looks Like a Badger . '
That is what this album talks about on a visceral level .
The perverse , voyeuristic pissing contest between these two giants of the Merv Griffin empire .
On the cerebral level , this is an album speaks to those who want to live independently from all rules and regulations , from those written in the law books , to those that are ' innately ' attached to us from birth .
This album presents the listener with a strict guideline of regurgitations and rools to reach disattachment and disenfranchise their business from the corporate monopoly that threatens to touch each and every one of us in our ' no - no zone . '
This was all done solo because all of my friends are married to corruption . "
Quincunx - Crystal Aegis Prototype ( 23 songs , 21:48 ) - Quincunx toots his imaginary horn : " Quincunx went to amazing lengths for this album .
He traveled from Maine to Finland to track down one of the few remaining prototype cartridges of an unreleased game from 1989 , made for a rare console few people even remember , let alone own .
Using an incomplete ROM dump from the damaged cartridge , obscure software , raw determination and brute force , he failed to compile a fully functional version of the game , but he did manage to extract much of the game 's 8 - bit soundtrack .
Unbelievable , is n't it ? "
nothing nothings - Sudden Cabin Decompression ( 10 songs , 20:28 ) Sean reports : " My seventh AAD and first entirely instrumental one , Sudden Cabin Decompression was rushed out in 4 hours to help me decompress for the one day I had between running this year 's Crap - Art-esque Indie Game Jam and attending a conference .
It 's pretty crappy , although it offers lots of tritones and funny time signatures , if that bloats your moat . "
Whimsical Fetus - Three Points ( 3 songs , 24:42 ) - " You know , gang , when you 're a noise artist , you never know where the day will take you .
You may find yourself strung out in a urine pool of true - to - life living .
Or you may find yourself going down to the store for a lozenge .
I 've witnessed small apes slapping each other on the chest in outrageous displays of bravado .
I once bought and drank an entire can of coconut milk before residing into my thinking lab for a few hours of creative expulsion .
I have even parallel parked poorly and did n't worry about getting a ticket or my car scratched .
So why face the risk of uncertainty every time you pick up your electronic devices ?
BECAUSE !
You gotta soak in that urine , you gotta suck that lozenge !
' Cause if you do n't ... who will ? " I think Whimsical Fetus will !
Niall Moody - The Outside World ( 13 songs , 21:25 ) - First - timer Niall Moody writes , " I ran out of time pretty quickly and ended up using more electronic sounds than I 'd intended , out of convenience .
I do n't think it 's too bad , but track 9's pretty terrible . "
pia-muk - bludgeoning the witness ( 5 songs , 20:10 ) - Regular contributor pia-muk writes : " One long eye burning 20 hour in front of blinking lights and precariously placed 1's and 0's acting as analog synth .
Geeks note : reason 2.5 , fruity loops 4 ( song 4 only ) nuendo 1.6 , sound forge 7 , cool edit pro 2 ; various plug-ins ; izotope ozone and waves ultramaximizer + for mastering .
no midi whatsoever .
all carpal tunnel inducing point and click .
too jobless for musical insturment digital interface .
( all song titles are quotes from serial killers .
that outta get yer juices flowin ' ) "
Jason Irvin - The Buzz : 90's Alternative Hits ( 11 songs , 20:01 ) - Jason , just squeaking by the twenty minute mark , describes his album as follows : " A piece of primarily computer generated noise that calls to the nostalgia of the grunge era .
Each song intends to your love of the songs they are named after without having anything to do with them .
Pick up your flannel and write ' i heart kurdt ' on your favorite cons , because it 's The Buzz .
Recorded on 4 - 4 - 04 , the first day of daylight savings . "
Charlie Crane - Crap Art ( 8 songs , 27:06 ) - Submit form minimalist Charlie Crane writes only that he began at 8:00 and finished at one minute after midnight .
Danalog - ckt3 ( 2 songs , 20:12 ) - Second timer Danalog writes , " Started at 1 PM April 21 , finished 8 AM April 22 .
Written while trying to recover data off my crashed main music hard drive .
Since I lost almost all my samples , I had to find a different source , so I used SBaGen .
Wrote the first song , had a good night 's sleep , and then wrote the second . "
berkano - super carbohydrate man ( 12 songs , 21:20 ) - Sprinter berkano writes , " This only took an hour and a half ( helped in no small part by my Casio 's auto - harmonisation & auto - accompaniment ) .
And it shows .
All the tracks were improvised and recorded in one take .
And it shows .
Although it might be unbearable , the album sounds best if you listen to the tracks in order - there is a vague structure to it .
Look out for ' mandelbork ' and ' more questions than answers ' , they 're my favourites .
Most of the titles were inspired by phrases I found in a local newspaper . "
WiL aka TB - Project 17 - Sherman Takes a Trip ( 18 songs , 1:03:02 ) - Rule - breaker WiL admits , " This AAD does not as strictly follow the guidelines as the others listed here .
Rick Veitch , one of the original creators of the 24 - hour comics , did his comic in ' short creative periods over a number of days totaling no more than 24 hours . '
In that spirit , then , was this album done .
The final product did in fact take a little more than 24 hours , but the project is the length equivalent of three albums - a- day , and it took far , far less than 72 hours over the course of the couple weeks worth of mornings that the work was accomplished .
I 'm rather proud of this one , myself . "
A couple of weeks !?
That sounds like - 1,000,000 points to me !
Acrnym - Life Is Too Short To Listen To Records ( 9 songs , 20:07 ) Apparent ' enlightened ' contributor Acrnym writes of his first album : " 21SSST CENTURY COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY !!!!!!
This took about two or three hours out of my day to make .
It sounds a bit uninspired , but my little sister likes some of the songy songs .
Some of it is noisyz for the boisyz .
LOLSIEYZ !!!!
Encoded into CRUNCHY LITTLE MP3S OF VARYING BITRATES !
For your downloading convenience !
Less of a dissappointing waste of time when you find out that these little beeps and gameboy camera and guitar experiments were not worth the hassle ! !! "
Jute Gyte - Jennifer ( 4 songs , 20:52 ) - " For my first AAD I decided to try mixing harsh electronic noise with sludgy doom metal .
I chose the Splatterhouse game series for inspiration because I thought the miserable atmosphere of the series lent itself well to the genres .
I think it turned out well .
Recorded 04/28/04 . "
pia -muk - space travel for acrophobics ( 5 songs , 21:30 ) - AAD
Regular pia-muk gives the following brief implementation details : " primary sound : moog modular v ; additional implications : reverb compression . "
Blue Lang - Beautiful Lunchbox ( 6 songs , 20:00 ) - Blue Lang comments : " Eighteen hours start to finish , no breaks .
Played all the instrument .
Only drum machine is what was used for a click track and later left in .
Only sample is a fucking White Stripes song added because I was 8 seconds short .
I wanted to do an AAD that was an album with actual songs and singing and whatnot , even tho I suck at both singing and songwriting .
It was also a really good studio exercise for just getting my crap together and doing that much recording all at once .
' President ' and ' Goals ' are everyone 's fave so far . . "
Glenn Case - Keeping the doctors away ( 6 songs , 20:04 ) - First - timer Glenn writes : " This was a lot of fun .
It took roughly 10 hours and 35 minutes to make .
All of the information should be easy to see from the site . "
He also promises lyric links and ' more evened out volumes ' soon .
charcoal - Do n't go golfing ( 6 songs , 20:38 ) - Another visitor from Songfight !
writes : " First shot at an album - a - day ; turned out to be a fun challenge .
Pulled six titles out of a random phrase generator , and 24 hours later , this is what I 'd come up with .
Could probably have used more time , but I think it has its moments of okayness .
For style , think slow , electric guitars with off - key singing and drum beats where they do n't belong .
Lyrics are all on the web - site , and I kept a running diary of what I was doing for the day , which also might make for interesting reading . "
Jim Tyrell - Yard Sale ( 8 songs , 21:30 ) - SongFighters are ( not surprisingly , based on the name ) very interested in battle .
Jim merely remarks : " Yet another SongFighter throws his hat into the ring . "
David Swain - Fish Bowl ( 7 songs , 20:03 ) - Dave says : " I wrote , recorded and mastered all 7 tracks on Tuesday in about 10 hours .
The styles range from song to song .
I have everything from blues to heavy metal to dark acoustic ballads to guitar / techno music .
They are all instrumentals because I cannot sing , but they hold up by themselves fairly well .
I used Soundforge and Madtracker ( http://www.madtracker.org) to compose and write all the songs .
I especially like the tracks ' You Can Tell , ' ' Ashes ' and ' Heroes for Ghosts . '
I hope you enjoy the songs and it was a LOT of fun doing this in such a restricted amount of time .
I will never forget doing this . "
15 - 16 puzzle - Traditional Classes Don't Work ( 13 songs , 20:32 ) - Sometimes people make AADs and then do n't even tell me about them , but I find them by some other means .
This is one of those .
Avarice - Stickin' It To The Man 24 - 7 ( 8 songs , 22:14 ) -
They took a break from stickin ' it to write : " This is our first attempt at an Album - A - Day or any album at all .
As a result , it is not exactly the finest accomplishment in the history of musical history . "
Andre was here at midnight - stream of subconcious thoughs on a friday ( 10 songs , 24:53 ) - Andre says : " it was late , i was board .. and i though to do an Album a day where i just hit record and start singing about anything thats in my mind .
unfurtunaly it did not come out like that .
even though most of the songs where ad lib vocally , i'd try to polish anything i though was worth it . "
He also has offered his flash AAD browser for anyone who wants to use it .
Heuristics Inc. - a very serious crime ( 12 songs , 21:04 ) - " This is an album - a - day project by Heuristics Inc .
I took some inspiration from Brad Sucks , and combined it with inspiration from SongFight !
and decided to do an album where I had to get all the song titles ( and the album title ) from spam emails that I had in my spam - box on the same day as the project .
It turned out to have an actual story that runs through the songs , so see if you can tell what 's going on .
Let me know what you think of it !
Took 15:36 to finish . "
c hack - AAD ( 24 songs , 42:30 ) - Newbie c hack submits a fairly hard - core attempt : " 24 songs , 24 hours .
Begun at dawn on June 20th ( the longest day of the year ) and finished by dawn on June 21st .
I got 3 hours of ( mostly accidental ) sleep , and ate 10 Newman 's O's and a small bowl of noodles and beef .
Aside from that , the whole time was spent on this project . "
Believe it or not , nobody has done a 24 song album up to this point .
Blind Mime Ensemble - Six On Sunday ( 6 songs , 22:19 ) - " Blind Mime Ensemble is the home recording plume thing for Bryan Baker .
Several folks at songfight.org had been talking about doing one of these things so I figured I 'd give it a shot too .
Turned out to be harder than I thought , but I made it .
Napping does n't help .
Whiskey does .
Writing lyrics for 6 songs is tough , but it gets easier once delirium hits .
Sweet , sweet delirium .
Shouting gets rough as well .
I resorted to milk for My Addiction .
Also it 's a good idea to know that drumming after midnight is gonna lose you some points with the neighbors probably .
Not that it matters . "
Feldspar - Playing Nuclear Bingo ( 14 songs , 20:18 ) - Feldspar says , " This is my second album - a - day .
It is about puppets .
We 're all puppets , you know .
Men and women , children , teachers , doctors , mailmen , all , everyone , all puppets .
I 'm a puppet , too . "
John Ingram - Oh Crap , What Have I Gotten Into ? ( 7 songs , 22:29 ) - " um . well I got about 5 hours into the project when it suddenly dawned on me that I wanted to go do something else .
so I struggled through another 2 hours to finish up 7 instrumental sketches .
6 of these were meant to have vocals in some capacity .
alas my attention deficit disorder would not allow it .
so I left them as they were .
I 'll admit to sleeping and stopping long enough to take my wife to the OB / GYN ( it 's a boy , fuckers ) .
total time from start to upload : 22 hours . "
Thanks for sticking it out .
Starfinger - Ho ! ( 9 songs , 21:00 ) Starfinger only reports that he " desperately needed to do this . "
Jon Eric - Teenager ( 4 songs , 15:18 ) Rulebreaker Jon writes : " I know it 's below the required length , but I had some extinuating circumstances ( damn surprise party wasted four hours ) , and the worst you can do , I reckon , is refuse to host it , right ?
I worked really hard on it , and I 'm pleased with the results , more or less .
I promise to have another one that actually does meet the requirements in one week 's time . "
That 's not the worst , Jon , you can get - 5,000 points !
Jim Tyrrell - Hey You ( 9 songs , 20:30 ) Jim says : " This is my second Album - A - Day , recorded on 6/20 / 04 .
I was trying to keep pace with c hack 's ' 24 - songs - in - 24 - hours ' challenge , but I could n't make it .
That said , this one went a lot smoother than the first , and I 'm happier with the results . "
The Tiny Paws of Fury - The Noble Art of the Knob Gag ( 11 songs , 22:50 )
The tiny paws write , " On my third attempt , I managed to get over my AAD ADD and finish one !
Total time 16 hours and 4 mins .
One hour mixing to mp3 .
It features lots of bad language and depraved ideas , so I guess it 's parental advisory , in the sense of ' advise yr parents to leave the room ' .
Music - Cabaret Voltaire meets Badly Recorded Acoustic
Folk , with kazoos .
And out - of - tune yet strangely charming crooning .
Words - hehehe .
Songs about smoking , taking drugs , clowns , science fiction , twisted priests & Hall & Oates .
Business as usual ! "
High Density -
The 4th of July ( 9 songs , 20:04 ) True Patriots " High Density " write , " Some people spent Independence Day picnicing , drinking , and watching fireworks .
We spent Independence Day recording this damn album .
We hope you like it . "
Jon Eric - Words ( 9 songs , 23:43 ) - A repentant Jon writes , " I promised I 'd have a real one in a week .
So one week from my dismal failure , out pops this .
The cover art is a detail of a painting by my late grandmother .
Hope someone out there enjoys this . "
Chuck Larish - Things Go Well ( 20 songs , 20:56 ) - Chuck , who knows how to use company resources , writes , " This is really an AAWD ( Album - A - Work - Day ) .
I work in the audio department for a childrens ' multimedia publisher .
Things have been a little slow , so to keep myself sane I wrote these songs between 12:00 and 17:00 on 07/08/04 .
The miniscule amount of post - production took place on 07/09/04 between 08:30 and 11:30 .
Even with a couple of projects rolling in I was still able to complete this in the 24 hour period . "
Niveous - The Scattershot ( 7 songs , 20:20 ) - " The Scattershot is lo - fi acoustigoth punk antifolk with themes ranging from werewolves , columbine - esque killers , suicide , overdoses , broken friendships , masochism and the space race .
It was a very hard project to do as I had very little time to work on it .
But it was a worthwhile venture .
Thanks to Johnny Cashpoint , Andrew was Here at Midnight , Fishboy Rex and everyone else who helped me with this album .
Get out your headphones and I hope you enjoy it . "
Maxfield - Pendulum ( 11 songs , 21:00 ) - Max is back again : " Here 's # 9 , recorded 6/19 / 04 .
This is a kind of electronic backlash to my mostly live last album featuring extensive use of my sampler .
It has a kind of ' time ' theme and a general weirdness loosely tying everything together . "
nothing nothings - Once More From Personal Experience ( 8 songs , 22:37 ) - Our friend Sean writes , " This is my eighth AAD .
You know what ?
I spend way too long writing lyrics for these , given that what comes out at the end is incredibly stupid even if it rhymes carefully .
I guess I 've gotta work on that .
My favorite songs are front - loaded , although my vocals are as weak as ever .
Also , much like my last AAD with vocals ( my seventh was a throwaway four - hour instrumental thing ) , one of the songs is sort - of a cover .
I know I should n't do this , but I get song title suggestions from friends , and ' The Hobbit Mafia ' , when I thought about it , really seemed to demand a particular reading , although I dunno how many people will get the joke .
( As before , I did n't actually listen to the song I was ' covering ' , so the music is n't actually the same , just inspired by . ) "
King Arthur - Dreams To Be Won ( 6 songs , 23 : ?? ) - Another Songfighter checks in with an AAD : " Recorded July 9 , 2004 , from 6:00 am to 9:30 pm. on an 8 - track home studio , using Band In A Box , real guitars and voice and a few synth flutes and strings to get a full band sound .
Songs are about ... whatever was on my mind that day , I guess ... "
Tom 7 - Fake Mars ( 18 songs , 20:33 ) - After a long break I 'm back with my 18th solo album .
Man , none of you guys will ever catch up to me .
I like this one pretty good , although I had a bad habit of winding down at the ends of songs -- even though they 're only about a minute long .
feldspar - Crush !
( 16 songs , 20:12 ) - Feldspar says , " Making every attempt to catch up to Tom7 .
Three AADs down , fifteen to go .
Got my work cut out for me .
This album was fun to make because it 's really really hot in my studio right now and I was afraid that if I turned on the fan then it would ruin the pristine quality of the recording .
Also I spilled chocolate milk on my guitar amp . "
reg - burn vitcums dreem comas ( 1 song , 30:28 ) -
One song wonder " reg " describes this simply as " Improvised music with some friends of mine .
drums , guitar and modified synth and piano . "
Jute Gyte - The Burning Path ( 5 songs , 20:52 ) - Regular Jute writes , " This is my second organic AAD ( the first being Jennifer ) and fourth overall ( I have 12 completed AADs collecting dust on my hard drive ) .
I had been listening to a lot of hard , screaming punk , and decided to attempt to emulate it while using only a very minimalist percussive palette ( two drum loops recorded by songfight cover artist dude Bortwein ) .
Some of it sounds a little like sloppily - played black metal .
The production is intentionally shoddy .
I like this album a lot . "
jcreed - Meat - Seeking Missiles ( 8 songs ; 24:06 ) - First timer jcreed says , " My first long - overdue attempt at doing an AAD .
I just pretty much sat down and improvised , though a few tracks are multiple passes .
There 's definitely a bunch of rythmic glitches , but I 'm pretty happy with it .
My favorite tracks are ' Intoxopower ' and ' I Guess We've Solved All Problems ' . "
This album is in MIDI format so you can download it all in like 3 seconds !
jcreed - Truly , All Robot # 7JQ Requires Is Love ( 7 songs ; 21:03 ) - Almost immediately after I posted his first album , jcreed adds : " I could n't help it ; I started playing some stuff while I was doing laundry and I could n't stop .
Album - A - Day 2 is here for your enjoyment or scoffing or what - have - you .
Tracks 2 , 3 , and 6 are somewhat carefully put - together multi-track affairs .
The rest are one - off improvisations .
1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 are my favorite . "
jcreed - Seek Him Who Shall Stand and Defend Western Music Notation ( 2 songs ; 21:38 ) -
At this rate , I 'm doomed .
Peter Toth - Agenturen ( 7 songs ; 19:22 ) - Peter writes , " ' Agenturen ' is my first attempt to do an Album - a - day .
I failed to comply to the rules , as the process took a bit over 25 hours ( due to technical problems , sleeping break etc. ) and the total length is only 19.22 minutes .
I 'm quite happy with the results , anyway .
Better luck next time !
' Agenturen ' was created using a tiny Casio SA - 3 keyboard , a guitar and a computer .
The songs are in Swedish and Hungarian . " - 1,000 points for not making it to 20 minutes !
MC Poncho - Poncho and Spooch's Big Album o' Fun ( 8 songs , 21:18 ) - " Well , this turned out much better than I thought it would .
I find it funny that Spooch and I considered inspirations and something wrong here to be the masterpieces of the album , and the big hit to be the joke catchy song .
Ironically , more people like the big hit , and pressure , than any other tracks .
Oh well .
I still think it turned well . "
Peter Toth - Case study : Beta ( 11 songs , 21:34 ) - " I think I 'm becoming addicted ..
This one contains slightly less electronica than ' Agenturen ' did .
More guitars and thematic explorations .
I 'm having a terrible cold , which lends my voice some special , um .. timbre .
The songs are in English and Swedish . "
pia-muk - muksys ( 13 songs , 24:38 ) - Pia -muk says , " after finishing my first attempt at circuit bending a speak and read , i recorded this in one shot .

WiL aka TB - In Praise of Dead Girls ( 7 songs , 21:11 ) - Regular
Wil writes , " Done hastily but methodically .
That noise at the beginning is my best representation of what I hear in my head whenver the lights are turned off .
I have synesthesia which in my case means I hear colors and feel sounds .
Other synesthetics have different brain wiring troubles , such as every letter on a page being a different color , and so forth .
This just happens to be my nightly curse , which is perhaps the cause and certainly an agitator of my insomnia .
Starting with that sound , I went with the idea of sleep and dreams , and came up with a concept album with ambiguous transitions between an ambiguous number of songs , hence the one big mp3 . enjoy . "
Avarice - Recorded Entirely Barefoot ( 5 songs , 26:28 ) - Riding the tail end of the Labor Day Weekend crowd , Avarice write : " Our second AAD is undoubtedly an improvement on the first production - wise , in that it actually plays from both speakers .
Musically , it is probably an improvement as well .
The title is true .
Also , our first recording of Another Space In Time was wiped out by a lightning - storm induced power cut , so clearly , God is no fan of ours . "
jcreed - Comme On l'Aime ( 5 songs ; 22:09 ) - Jason writes ,
" The titles are all phrases I saw in French advertising materials while in Montreal .
The first three were at McDonald 's , all part of one sticker , which the cover is a photoshopped version of , the fourth was a poster in the subway , and the fifth at Burger King .
I really love the pun between the letter M and ' aime . '
Those wacky Francophone typographers !
The audio quality is really bad , but I 'm pretty happy with actual music on this one , especially on the title track . "
Zen Tormey - Musical Vomit ( 23 songs ; 1:29:44 ) - First timer
Zen writes , " So I locked myself in my room for 9 hours and recorded 24 tracks of randomness with my Roland .
Some of it sucks , some of it is all right , but the mixdown ( track 00 ) of all 24 tracks at once is somewhat interesting .
This is all instrumental , I can't sing .
I kept everything I did , ( even the one where I played for 39 seconds before being interupted by someone knocking on my door ) , and did everything in one take ( except track 15 , which is 15 , 16 , and 17 mixed together ) .
This is my first AAD project .
This stuff is mostly piano and strings with a few exceptions . "
Future Boy - The Hotel Apartment ( 9 songs ; 20:17 ) - Future Boy says , " This was created in approximately 8 - 9 hours .
The song titles were used as search strings in Altavista 's audio search function to find source material for each track .
Some of the ' found sounds ' were left unaltered , but some were edited and processed so much as to become completely unrecognizable .
The resulting collage songs , I think , reflect quite well the mental condition of someone who has had to live in a hotel room for 4 weeks without a job and , until very recently , without a computer . "
pilesar - no good for eyeballs ( 7 songs ; 24:56 ) - Jason AKA pilesar contributes this album that he " threw together last week . "
jcreed - On the Breeding Edge ( 20 songs ; 45:53 ) - Jason drops this lengthy number on us , writing , " Jesus .
I was using some different software than before for MIDI recording , and I understood the ruler it had in its interface to be measuring seconds .
But no , it was measures .
And at 120 bpm 4/4 , that 's two seconds a measure .
So an album that was meant to barely sneak past 20 minutes barely snuck past 40 .
No wonder my hands are so tired .
Well , I can also blame practising the crazy finger - over - thumb 5 / 4 shit in ' Cello Kat ' for part of it . "
We Are Gloucester - Bathing In Welfare ( 9 songs ; 20:08 ) - " This was an experiment with completely vocal music .
Everything on here is created with my voice , and special computer audio trickery .
No instruments .
No other band members .
Just my awesomeness .
Rock . "
jcreed - Modal Logic ( 8 songs ; 20:55 ) - " This was supposed to be some experimentation with modal jazz , but I lost track of the theme somewhere around track six , I think . "
Feldspar - Welcome to Iceland ( 15 songs ; 23:33 ) - Lifer Feldspar writes , " There is a little bit of Iceland inside all of us , and that is what this album is about .
This is my fourth album - a - day .
It was recorded under the influence of cherry Jones soda and a Quiznos chicken carbonara sandwich . "
The Fuck Up - Homemade Bling Bomb Songs ( 13 songs ; 24:26 ) -
An over - caffeinated Liam writes , " I did it in exactly 24 hours , every second maxxed upon and translated back into a vomit of unbridled smacked up gabba killcore pornslutfuckedinthehead mp3's for sick fucks like me and my wretched existence for vengeance .
I know , I 'm insane , but an ' it great ! "
Max and Ben - Slide Show ( 9 songs ; 24:00 ) - Completing his own decathalon , Max writes , " This is my second collaboration with my cousin Ben , made 7/23/04 .
Ben is really good with his equipment so it was recorded quite well .
An organic mix of live and electronic elements .
Check it out ! "
The Fuck Up - Back With A Vengeance ( 13 songs ; 22:27 ) - " I suffered for this one , the sleep deprivation mixed with caffeine and cigarettes , gave me , once I finished this album and had slept in bed for a few hours , dementia , causing me to wake up screaming for 10 - 20 minutes .
Stress in other words on my system , awake for over 30 hours with a non -stop supply of the above .
Not good but regardless , it 's a fine album .
I 've got to respect my limits otherwise I 'll blow my brains out of fear . "
Cephalad - Cutups Vol. 3 EP ( 20 songs ; 20:49 ) - Cephalad is back , and writes , " Part 1 , with 10 songs , is the more placid side of this AAD project .
Part 2 , which also has 10 tracks , is more heavily reliant on beats .
Styles range from light IDM ( ' Warp Fever Fit ' ) to hyperspeed , sample - driven techno ( ' 299 Pennies , ' ' Gray Sand Fury Tank ' ) to ambient / noise compositions ( ' Dream For Minutiae , ' ' There 's the Scare ' ) . "
Heart Shaped Robots - ChromeCoalCobalt ( 8 songs , 21:00 )
This first - time robot writes , " Since finding out about the AAD project I 'd been waiting nearly 3 weeks for a free 24 hours to really bash something out .
Eventually though , I just decided to try cranking something out on a day I had to work .
This did get me to move things along pretty quick , but while I spent well under 7.5 hours recording I did go slightly over the 24 hour limit .
I know the rules , so I 'll be a man and take the - 1,000 points for not getting it all right my first time out . "
Danalog - 1018 ( 10 songs ; 20:10 ) - Danalog writes , " Started at 6:30 PM October 18th , finished 6:22 PM October 19th , just under the wire .
Named 1018 initially after the date , and then to keep the trend I named all the songs after error codes in various programs .
Listening order is unspecified . "
Available only as a convenient RAR file .
Heart Shaped Robots - Interstellar Discussion ( doppelganger ) ( 15 songs ; 22:30 ) - Second - timer HSR writes , " This is a doppelganger of Jandek 's Interstellar Discussion in honor of his live performace ( ! ) at a Scottish festival last week .
Making an AAD to the doppelganger rules was an interesting challenge / handicap to the time stipulation .
It made for some neat departures , although I had to make about half - dozen more pieces than I really wanted to and left a couple things as instrumentals I 'd have liked to write some lyrics for . "
Thumbs Down - 100 % Grade F Filler Vol. 1 ( 18 songs ; 20:04 ) - These
Thumbs write , " I believe I did not infringe on your rules in any way , except that I realized after the fact that track 6 sounds a little like tequila ( totally unintentional ) , and track 18 was inspired by bjork 's latest album ( but in no way is it a cover - besides who could actually cover bjork ? )
At any rate , this was a lot of fun to make , and I 'd like to thank you for coming up with such a great idea .
it really made me work until i wanted to die - which is a good thing now and then .
A few of the tracks are completely embarrassing , and ordinarily i would never show them to anyone , ever , but hey , no outtakes , right ? "
Garbage Eater - Yeshua ( 10 songs ; 22:53 ) - Mbeanis N. Alzin says , " Not intended as an AAD , but surprisingly close to meeting regulations .
Written and recorded one night and the following morning , but vocals were recorded a few days later due to equipment difficulties .
Total record time about 14 hrs .
I hope you like ' Check Out My New Beard ' and ' Faith Hand Grenade ' too . "
You know the drill : - 1,000 points for equipment difficulty .
Michael J. Nelson - Tree Nuts and Peanuts ( 16 songs ; 20:41 ) - Second - timer mjn recorded this album on Christmas Day 2004 .
He says , " Lots of fuzzy guitars , crappy keyboards , fake drums , and MIDI bass .
I was going to try some bizarre genre - mixing experiments , but the only one I got around to was noise - polka ( although I realized later on that maybe another song could be called baroque shoegazing ) .
I think it sounds kind of like Richard Hell 's second album , actually - - too much lead , not enough rhythm -- although it 's probably better than my first one . "
Fire Swallows the Ocean - Secret Frequencies ( 6 songs ; 21:55 ) -
This story is starting to sound familiar : " Started this at 9:24 AM Dec 21 and finished just over 17 hours later .
6 tracks of electronic stuff left exactly as I finished them - complete with strange mixing levels and the odd mistake .
I 've been having real trouble finishing anything recently so something like this was the ideal kickstart for me .
Hopefully I 'll be able to apply what I learnt by doing this to my other stuff .
Some of this came out really well and one or two of them were n't so hot - but I stuck to the no out - takes rule and put everything up online . "
Tony Asbestos - Two Days After ( 8 songs ; 20:33 ) - Yet another songfighter graces us , and writes , " Two Days After was recorded on December 27 , 2004 .
It was a very long but rewarding day .
When you have to come up with nearly a minute of finished music every hour for 24 hours straight , there is no time for writer 's block .
The ideas came out , and good or bad they made it into the songs .
I like the result . "
ClaudiusMaximus and Trel - Din And Sonic ( 3 songs ; 23:50 ) - " Me ( ClaudiusMaximus ) on synth , Trel on guitar , we decided to do an AAD the day before we did it .
Mostly just jamming , with minimal post production - with the conflicting aims of being longer than 20 mins to avoid the - 1000 points , and shorter than 24 mins so it would fit on 8 cm mini-CD .
The raw recording of the jam session was 37mins , so if you were being exceedingly pedantic I suppose you could deduct points on the ' no out - takes ' rule .
Artwork was also finished within 24hours , as was the upload to archive.org . "
Marcus Kellis - Bloggin ' ... And Other Assorted Love Songs ( 12 songs ; 20:09 ) - " Came in just shy of 24 hours recording time .
Mostly inspired by things around my desk , it 's wholly me and my guitar .
My guitar has a sticker that says ' Cutie on Duty , ' and that basically sums up the album . "
Future Boy - New Year 's Day ( Automatic Writing ) ( 12 songs ; 24:30 ) -
The holiday is bringing loads of new albums .
Second - timer Future Boy writes , " This album was written and recorded between 3 am and 11 am on New Year 's Day , 2005 , after returning home from a New Year 's Eve party .
The lyrical style is inspired by an improvised song performed by one of the children at the party named Milo .
He is almost 5 .
Some of the words of his song were written down and they appear on this album as the song Hoidle .
All of the lyrics were written in the space of about 30 minutes in a semi-stream of consciousness way .
The keyboard being used is a Rhodes Mark I Stage Piano , which I am currently baby - sitting for a friend of mine .
It is fun to play , but kind of hard on my wrists . "
Andre was here at midnight - Songs for the Dead - 7 songs for dreaming ( 8 songs ; 24:51 ) - Andre writes , " This came about after failing on my original intensions for this AAD ( a rock album ) .
Vocals on the original album where getting the best of me so I quit .
It was around 2 am already , and I wanted some sleep , so I thought I 'd spend the next couple of hours doing 20 minutes worth of music to later sleep through it .
The titles are all from actual previous dreams of mine . "
The Duckets - Ploop ( 7 songs ; 20:54 ) - " We 're a band who 's been playing together for about a year and a half now .
I read about the AAD project from Future Boy 's site and thought it would make for some nice mental floss .
We started at 7:25 pm and finished at 5:40 am .
Unfortunetly I had to take a 4 hour nap after tracking .
I can only do 24 hours at a time .
Woke up , then did the mixing in 3 hours . "
Gone over ?
That 's - 1,000 points for napping .
Domo Domo - Enemy of EQ ( 7 songs ; 38:42 ) - " This is my first Album a Day .
I learned a lot in the process .
For instance , I learned that the little ruler bar in my DAW does not in fact count the seconds , but some different arbitrary number .
So songs somehow ended up twice as long as they needed to be , as I was freaking out about time for no reason .
The results of this added constraint are , in particular , crappy . "
I have made this same mistake in the opposite direction .
Niall Moody - Quiet Rings ( 11 songs ; 21:39 ) - Niall writes , " My second AAD turned out a lot better than the first one , although there 's some pretty terrible time - keeping ( I should have used a metronome for more than 2 tracks ) .
Almost entirely acoustic . "
Kool Shades - Rome ( 9 songs ; 30:46 ) - The Kool Shades say : " This is our first AAD ; actually , it 's our first album at all .
It was recorded in about 7 1/2 hours on 1 -13 - 05 .
It 's extremely unprofessional and was recorded with the crappy external mic that came with my computer .
Play the entire album backwards to hear the secret message . "
Calfborg - Tromein ( 9 songs ; 78:55 ) - " This is my first and only attempt at noise .
It took about 6 hours to complete .
It was fun . "
Andre was here at Midnight - " Loneliness " The Soundtrack ( 8 songs ; 21:37 ) - Oops !
I just found this one from September 2004 misfiled into my spam folder .
Andre writes , " I 'd been wanting to do an all Classical music AAD for a while ... Saturday evening rolled around , I was board and though I 'd give it a shot .
Fortunately at the time , I did n't feel like doing classical , but more like a soundtrack for a movie that only existed in my mind , And here 's the results .
started around 11:00 pm
Saturday night , recorded most of it , till around 7:00 am Sunday morning .
Later finish 2 more track , all before 10:00 pm Sunday .
Overall am pretty please how the soundtrack came out . "
Maxfield - Redlines ( 8 ; 20:08 ) - AAD workhorse
Max says : " For this , my eleventh AAD , I wanted to do something really different from my previous ones .
So , I cranked up the distortion on everything and made a really loud , lo - fi , and rockin ' set of tunes .
Equipment included my brand new keyboard ( Nord Electro ) , Kaoss Pad , melodica and Garage Band virtual instruments ( needless to say I did n't use any of their prerecorded loops ) .
Everything recorded between 10 am 1/9/05 and 12:30 am 1/10/05 . "
Director Feline - " is this outer space ? " ( 9 songs ; 21:07 ) - According to the press release , " Director Feline is 1/2 of the psychedelic rawk band I APACHE EYE .
This particular album was written , recorded , and mixed in four hours on 1/27/2005 . "
Cuban Bimbo - Vampiric Quartet ( 10 songs ; 32:54 ) - Cuban Bimbo reports : " This is our first attempt at a CrapArt Album - A - Day album .
We recorded this album from 1 pm 1/29/2005 to 4 am 1/30/2005 .
We recorded the music first and then laid the vocals ( ? ) using lyrics created on various random lyric generators on top of that .
Other effects were added with a circuit bent DOD Flanger Pedal dubbed The Drunken Sailor Flanger .
Watch those ears !!! "
Spud - A Case of Octothorpe ( 7 songs ; 22:15 ) - " Glenn Case came out to Seattle and joined the Mighty ' thorpe for a day of song writing and recording . "
My goodness , they have uniforms !
berkano - a history of reading ( 10 songs ; 23:17 ) - Wily berkano writes : " My second contribution to the Album A Day project .
I saved loads of time by writing this album at 255 BPM then I slowed it down to 120 BPM .
The end result is a musical abomination , 23 minutes of material recorded and mixed in 20 mins flat . "
Darrin Ailes - Casual Friday ( 9 songs ; 23:11 ) - Newcomer Darrin writes , " This is my first AAD project ; written , recorded and mastered on January 19th 2005 from 9 am to 11 pm .
It was not an easy task , especially since I recorded full arrangements for most of the songs ( drums , guitar , bass and vocals ) .
I was in a creative rut , had n't really written anything in a couple of years , and figured that this would be a good test to see the little creative soul was still there .
Amazingly enough , it was .
I covered quite a few genres along the way .
I wanted to make sure any outlet was available to me .
The album is okay , I think , for being written in 14 hours .
A couple of the songs I really do like .
Some of the mastering is pretty bad , but at 11 pm , I did n't much care .
Not sure when the next attempt will be .
It was mentally and physically draining for me .
I think next time I may try very simple arrangements ... but then again ... what fun is that ! "
The Splott Community Workshop - In Absentia ( 11 songs ; 22 minutes ) -
The workshop reports , " Splott Community Workshop is the sound of two guys , a couple of guitars , a 1980's Casio keyboard and a computer .
The entire album was recorded with a crappy little modem mic you get free with your PC .
This is our first AAD project and is a doppelganger based on the Porcupine Tree LP ' In Absentia ' which we found just typing random search words into Amazon .
It 's an interesting mix of genres , skipping between Pavement - esque indie rock , tongue in cheek country ballads and death metal to give just a few examples .
The project sent us somewhat insane , with the last track that we recorded , at 4 am , ending up as a 43 second circus music romp with French vocals .... "
Feldspar - Calc Hole ( 15 songs ; 21:01 ) - Feldspar says , " This is my fifth album - a - day .
This one goes out to everyone who has ever found themselves opressed by mathematics . "
Dave Dean - i ♥ crap art ( 7 songs ; 21:08 ) - Dave is back , and writes : " This took about 19 hours , I thoroughly recommend ' Chris Martin Can Lick My Nuts ' , and ' Like Helium Balloons To Heaven ' .
Despite their rough mixes , both of those are amongst my favourite output over the past few months . "
BuZ and The Machine - Walking on Black Keys ( 14 songs ; 20:39 ) - BuZ says : " The juxtaposition of styles may not please to everyone , but who cares ?
that 's art ! :P
All done from 10 am to 10 am the next day , including the album cover art : ) "
Soulseek Records - 24 hour massacre -
The 24 HM team writes : " 24 Hour Massacre ( 24 hm ) is a variation of a on - going project series call OneMinuteMassacre ( 1 mm ) .
Using a soulseek chatroom , artists gathered for a 24 - hr period to create this album .
The idea was to give an artist 40 minutes to press as much creativity as possible into one short song .
After the 40 minutes was up , a new artist would be chosen who would download the previous song and create a new one using the previous as a focus point ; the idea basically to make the song transition seamless as if it were mixed .
The result - 26 tracks , each one with its own special and sometimes insane flavour .
In short , ' 24 Hour Massacre ' is a team effort .
Everyone 's work counts and when put together it becomes a solid piece of creativity under stress . "
Peter Toth - Machete ( 12 songs ; 20:54 ) - Peter says , " My third album - a - day .
This time I tackled everything from hiphop to afrobeat to ballads .
Well , not really , it 's mostly just weird crap .
Instruments used : Acoustic guitar , bass , software drum machine , djemb Ã© drum , agogo , kalimba , Baby Grand toy piano , vocals and one or two external samples .
Once again , I was having a cold when it was recorded , so the singing is messed up .
The mixing is awful too .
I like it .
( I missed the mark by about two hours so that 's probably - 1000 p for me ) . "
Damn straight : - 1,000 for running over !
Theophilus Monk - Tries Their Best ( 9 songs ; 20:01 ) - " Done between April 9 and April 10 2005 .
I 'd done one previously ( solo , Marcus Kellis ) , but this was with my band , Theophilus Monk .
We had a blast making it and did , in fact , try our best .
' Punching a Cow in the Face ' is my personal favorite . "
Andre was here at midnight - Guitar & Violin ( 9 songs ; 24:51 ) - Andre writes : " Here 's my 4th album a day , created out of boredom and a mild case of the flu , late Saturday night / early Sunday morning .
The most challenging album yet , but the most rewarding one also .
It took me about 26 hours to complete so I 'll take a big virtual slap in the face and - 10,000 points . "
Consider yourself slapped , slowpoke !!
The Francisbacons - Protocrystalline ( 12 songs ; 21:42 ) - News flash : AAD causes delinquency !
" Hello .
We are Christian & Rafa .
Congratulations on the project , it 's a great initiative .
When we found out about it we could n't wait to try and do an AAD , so we met the next day and skipped class !
We had never done anyhting musical together because we were too lazy and scared to try , so this was the perfect excuse ( yes , restrictions can help you be creative ! ) .
In the beginning we were planning on doing 30 songs , but as time passed by we got really tired ... so we reached for the 20 minutes instead .
The name of the band , the album and all the song titles come from Wikipedia 's random page generator ( www.wikipedia.org), so they did n't really mean anyhting .
Oh , we are spanish , even though the third song is the only one in spanish .
Maybe that 's new . "
Danalog - Sanila ( 10 songs ; 20:26 ) - " Started at 3:00 AM May 7th , finished 3:00 AM May 8th , ended up so close under the wire I had to stop partway through working on a song to stay in the time limit .
If converting to mp3 , writing this text , packaging up , and uploading counts in the 24 hour limit , I 'll take my - 1000 points , if not I 'm scott - free ! "
I do n't count packing things up as long as you 're quick about it .
Full score !
Willy & Oli - # 01 @ Montpellier ( 9 songs ; 21:27 ) Another close call : " Written , played & recorded in Montpellier , France , in 23 hours and 50 minutes , between April 7th and 8th 2005 .
A first experience of Album - A - Day , and probably not the last .
It 's been a challenge to make this album , but after almost a whole day , we can say we are proud of us ...
But we 'll try not to be so lazy on the next one ! "
Scrap Heap - Regressions in Succession ( 7 songs ; 22:13 ) - " Seven songs in seven genres in seven hours , including a new genre I invented , ' sketch . '
No vocals , because things were going just fine without any . "
New genres are encouraged .
Olivier - The Incredible Sound Of Magic Rabbit ( 8 songs ; 20:17 ) - Olivier says : " First experience alone , and the result is an incredible sound .
8 songs in less than 7 hours .
Enjoy ... "
Cat Podulke - Sango Slingshot Eject - Not a Good Idea ( 12 songs ; 28:30 ) -
In a display of post - AAD hysteria , someone from Cat Podulke writes , " We finished this about 8 minutes before 1 am on Monday morning ... almost not completing everything on time ....
Not promising anything particulary wowish , but everyone will probably laugh or gasp alternatively at ' Henry Rollins Got No Neck ' or ' Baseballhead ' ... truely not related .
It was very fun ... my first particular venture into producing an album , although one of the people involved in this project has REAL published music out ....
WHEEEE .
Pancakes .
Now excuse me , for I must sleep for 18 hours . "
Les Autistes Vagabonds - T'as Vu Ta Gueule ?
( 10 songs ; 20:14 ) - Olivier and friends write : " Kind of a challenge to make music with people you do n't know very well , and a lot more to make an album !
I especially like the song ' Do n't Trust What People Say ' , sort of warning about medias and stuffs . "
nothing nothings - Fictional Characters Get All The Girls ( 8 songs ; 21:17 ) - Sean writes : " Ten months (! ) after my last one , here 's my ninth AAD .
As usual I took song title suggestions from friends ; for some reason most of the titles I used were awfully long .
The city of Oakland ( and my apartment ) lost power for about an hour while I was in the middle of recording it , so it would n't be unreasonable to suspect that I chose to interpret ' 24 hours ' as referring to a contiguous block of 24 hours only in the version of the universe where space - time is appropriately ruptured and re-sown together to compensate . "
A true master AADician rocks through adversity ( perhaps by resorting to pre-electricity recording devices like wax cylinders ) but we 'll let Sean get away with it without penalty this time .
John Governale - Songs of the Oxford Hills ( 8 songs ; 22:50 ) - John says , " I wrote and recorded these eight songs over May 22 and 23 , 2005 , just making the deadline in 23 fun but exhausting hours .
Though I have written a lot of songs over the years , I never released an album because my recording efforts , despite endless retakes and tweaking , always sounded unprofessional .
AAD solved that for me .
No more fruitless belaboring — just write 'em , record 'em , then post 'em .
I love it . "
M#gic Rabbit - Flying Without Wings ( 7 songs ; 21:58 ) - " I tried to make this one really fast ( less than 5 hours ) and i did n't sing on it coz a friend of mine told me i was always out of key .
New for me : i put some samples of drums on it , and i think it 's kind of cool . "
Eric Thortsen - Myfirstalbumaday ( 17 songs ; ~ 20 min ) - Eric describes his album with only two capitalized words : " MIDI HEAVEN . "
Eric Thortsen - New Folder ( 13 songs ; ~ 24min ) - Eric describes this album as , " if you have ears you can listen to my album otherwise take a hike , " but then later adds : " I thought this was apparent , but now i'm beginning to think no one will get it .
Basically , it 's a world where things only communicate with music and it's a story about a couples night together and there experience with god .
the song titles are supposed to be translations of what the song means in english .
It 's supposed to be like really awkward and funny becuase you picture the music being either the husband , wife , or god talking and the way they talk is just so strange . "
Swaytek - The Unconditional EP ( 13 songs ; 20:55 ) - Mike AKA
Swaytek says : " this album took me about 3 hours to make ... it has a bunch of random hip hop beats i made ... hope you guys like it "
5dots - 5 dots presents a 24 - hour discussion of sonic possibilities , with friends .
( 10 songs ; 20:42 ) - 5 dots say : " I had friends who also make music come over to help , which worked for a while .
I did take a break to sleep , then got up and finished production in the morning .
I became very aware that I was running out of time , and recorded the last song as an effort to fill up space , which is why it 's completely awful .
' With Time ' is really good , though . "
Kool Shades - The Children 's Party Handbook ( 9 songs ; 22:03 ) - " This is our second AAD and significantly better than the first .
Perhaps it 's our idea of a children 's album , full of gloom and sadness , consistently undercut by goofiness and unprofessionalism .
Pure pleasure ! "
slappfisk aka neon - sitrondrops ( 14 songs ; 20:13 ) - slappfisk writes with a lengthy album logbook , which says things like : " slappfisk is norwegian and means lazy fish . " and " it was lots of fun .
probably not my last aad album . "
Juicy Jew - Big Words ( 14 songs ; 18:10 ) - Asaf writes : " This album is called ' Big Words ' mainly because of the way its lyrics were written .
I took a piece of paper and divided it into 14 squares and then wrote several words on each , on random places , related to each other only by association .
Then i filled the blank spaces between them and got me some lyrics for a 14 songs album .
The site where this album is hosted is in hebrew , so I tried to write anything I could in english to make it more international ... "
Cephalad - Cutups Vol. 4 EP ( 20 songs ; 20:11 ) - nth - timer Cephalad writes : " This album was finished June 18 , 2005 .
It mostly consists of heavily distorted beatboxing , spoken word , pure noise , and sounds generated by tapping or hitting objects lying around the computer ... lo - fi beats and very few melodies , so you 've been warned ! "
the guy who did that one album - The Keyboard Instruments , and other Varied Instruments ( 8 songs ; 34:59 ) - Eric is back , and writes : " Through this journey , we witnesses intrumental music of the highest caliber .
Never has , nor could man have alone seeped so deeply into the human spirit crying out truths beyond most mens sight , for this album was created by the Spirit of Nature , and handed down to the one called puppet puppet music pants . "
Adhesion - It 's Really Hot Outside !
( 7 songs ; 20:48 ) - Adhesion says , " My first AAD experiment ( and second real album ) made from 12:30 PM July 6th to 2:30 AM July 7th , 2005 .
Went strangely well - I was surprised at how I could write melodies in such a short period of time that did n't suck .
Genres explored ( exploited ? ) include eurobeat ( track 5 ) , noise ( 4,6 ) , ambient ( 7 ) , chiptune / NES ( 3 , my favorite ) and , uh , I do n't know ( 1,2 ) .
Made entirely in software - be on the lookout for a couple instances of bufferoverride and rezsynth .
Also , please note that the weather was actually pretty good when I made this album . "
Los Bastardos ! - # 1 Hits ( 16 songs ; 37:51 ) -
The bastardos write , " This was recorded Feb 12 2005 .
I put up a bit of a story about our day on the site .
We had a few problems actually getting started , not enough spots in the mixer , that sort of thing .
So we had to improvise with our equipment a little .
No overdubs !
Recording took somewhere around 2.5 hours .
it was mastered a little later , the entire process from setup to finishing the mastering took approx 9 hours .
Recording live is great . "
Adhesion - Uncertainty1 ( 8 songs ; 20:35 ) - Adhesion is back , and writes : " Barely two weeks after my first , I made another AAD : this time I jumped right into crazed experimentalism and tried the dreaded Deaf Ear AAD .
None of the songs were heard while they were being written or produced , however , ( and take some points off for this if you must ) I had to do some post - production mixing work after hearing the songs to make them not sound like crap .
Honestly , I do n't think it 's possible to do a Deaf Ear AAD electronically ( all in software , mind you ) without terrible mixing .
Anyway , some of the songs came out pretty good for having been written without any idea what they were going to sound like - particularly the first and last tracks . "
dotCommunism - Making Music Sure Is Hard Work ( 7 songs ; 20:57 ) - dotCommunism , a friend of Adhesion , says : " My first AAD .
Just for the hell of it , i decided to do a deaf ear one right off the bat .
It was quite fun and i definitely had enough ideas to go the whole twenty minutes .
This album was done entirely with software .
I guess making music is n't as bad as the title might make one think "
Tom 7 - Quad Emotional Damage ( 13 songs ; 20:24 ) - I 'm still at the forefront of rapid album making ( at least in quantity ) despite this one coming a year after my last one !
This is a break - up album ( like relationship break - up , not band break - up ) , so it is supposed to be sad .
I also enforced a " no gimmick " policy ; every song is just me and my guitar and nothing else .
There are definitely some good songs on it , but I really suffered to finish ...
Adhesion - Opus Magnus ( 44 songs ; 2:23:25 ) - " Well , this is n't exactly an AAD , but I 'd thought I 'd submit it as an album made under extreme stress .
Originally conceived as an attempt at 7 AADs in 7 days , it ended up taking 11 , due to unforeseen circumstances and other things .
At the end , I had a double album full of a random smattering of genres as per usual .
Again , some pretty good tracks emerged from the chaos , like Fridge , Thorian Ninja and Last Star . "
Um , - 1,000 for taking too long , but like +7,000 points for making seven albums in a marathon .
AOR - Deconstructing Neodialectic Deappropriation ( 1 song ; 25:01 ) -
This may be the least self - recommended AAD so far : " AOR , the collaboration project between Adhesion and dotCommunism , finally makes its first AAD .
Made in only five hours , it consists solely of one horrible track that is at best an abomination .
At an excruciating twenty - five minutes , Grandiloquent Longorrhoean Pleonasm ( the title of the only track or the alternate name of the album ) treads the line between music and noise making the listener very uncomfortable in the process .
Recommended only for those with a brave heart and hardy ears . "
Arthur Kamst - Ain't It So ? ( 8 songs ; 23:17 ) - Summer is the time for old - timers to come back to the game , I guess .
Arthur writes , " After nearly two years , here is my sixth Album a Day .
It 's called Ain't It So ? , and was actually all done in one evening , August 16th 2005 , between 21:00 and 2:00 .
Just like its predecessor , it was meant as a Doppelganger ; this time of dutch band Hallo Venray 's album Merry go Round .
But again , I ran out of time , so I ended up using eight of the twelve songtitles for this album , which I actually quite like . "
Danalog - FUCK_VERIZON !
( 13 songs ; 20:40 ) - " What do you get when you combine Verizon screwing me out of internet for over a month plus insomnia ?
My fifth Album - a - Day , of course ! "
Do n't those bastards know a guy gotta get his inet ???
Feldspar - Park Reverse Neutral ( 14 songs ; 20:11 ) - ' Tis the season for returning elders , and Feldspar has challenged me to a race , at " only a baker 's dozen short " of my record !
He says of this album : " This is my sixth album .
It is about bugs and monsters and girls .
Some of the guitar work is really shoddy and the vocals are tired , but I guess those are sacrifices you must make for the comfort of recording an album while lying in bed . "
Maxfield - Restless ( 12 songs ; 20:14 ) I told you 'twas the season .
Max says : " I went into this , my 12th AAD , intent on making a sort of song cycle where tracks transition seamlessly into one another all connected by an overarching theme and recurring motifs and subject matter , namely a night of dreaming ( sort of using Neutral Milk Hotel 's classic ' In The Aeroplane Over the Sea ' as a loose model ) .
As ambitious as this was , by some miracle I was able to accomplish this pretty much exactly as I had hoped .
The trickiest part was that , since I had to have songs transition into one another , I made the album in chronological order and had to keep thinking at least one song in advance .
This resulted in a pretty ' album '- sounding album with a nice arc from start to finish , though .
Another tricky part was that these songs demanded far more lyrics than any of my other AAD's .
In any case , there 's plenty of textural variety and good stuff here IMO so give it a listen ! "
Andre Was here at Midnight - Before the Breakdown ( 8 songs ; 21:42 ) - Andre is another returning elder ; he writes just , " Been wanting to do another album a day for a while , this past memorial day weekend finally got a chance . "
ClaudiusMaximus - Soft Rock EP ( 4 songs ; 20:48 ) - Claudius says : " This time solo , armed with a laptop and free / libre open source software .
I started about 1 am , finished around 7 pm with plenty of time to upload .
The bulk of the sounds are the result of chaotic interactions between mutually modulating oscillators , programmatically tweaked to make the tracks progress . "
Giant Waxy Monkey Treefrogs - Whatever Happened to Elizabeth Gilpin ? ( 9 songs ; 29:21 ) -
All that these treefrogs have to say is that this is their first , and best , album in a day .
David Strope - Misery The Audiophile ( 7 songs ; 22:53 ) - David reports , " It 's not long .
It 's not beautiful .
But it is my first attempt at Album - A - Day .
I jumped in with a concept album about a guy named Misery who happens to be an audiophile ...
Recorded in the hours between 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM on Friday , October 7 . "
Peter Toth - Time warp ( 7 ; 20:07 ) - Peter returns to tell us : " My fourth AAD , the first one after having converted to GNU / Linux and free software .
My first AAD using my electric guitar , too .
As usual , there are many genres here , as well as more awful singing "
Phunt Your Friends - How the Tales of Incubi , Djinns , and Nymphs May Interweave ( 13 songs ; 25:48 ) - " This album tells a story about about love and death , and lots of other stuff too .
The relevant characters are : Ariane , a prostitute who used to be a nymph ; Cosette , a prostitute who used to be a djinn ; Freddielove , a debonair playboy who used to be an incubus ; Dead Nose ( pronounced ' day - odd no - zay ' ) , a incubus who used to work with Freddilove and an assassin working for the demigod Ashok ( who does n't appear in this story ) . "
Tyler McCool & Friends - are completely effing insane ( 9 songs ; 22:17 ) - " So this was my second album - a - day .
The first one Los Bastardos ! - # 1
Hits was a lot of fun and I 've been wanting to do another for a while .
This time the plan was to have as many people involved as possible and create something completely different .
Instead of going for the completely low - fi sound like I did last time I wanted to clean up the sound a little and create a nicer sounding recording .
I started at 12 pm on Saturday and kept going until about 5 am Sunday . "
Bjam - October 13th ( 8 songs ; 22:12 ) - Bjam , another songfighter , says : " I decided to do this in a day off from school , and this happened .
All songs are vocals , acoustic guitar ( Mr Sparkles ) , and an electric guitar ( Mr Sun ) .
I heard about AADs through SongFight .
Org . "
Olivier - Me vs Myself ( 7 songs ; 20:35 ) - " Third AAD alone for me , under different names , but this one 's the first i made in Canada ...
I 'm waiting for some friends to make one with me , maybe only by internet ...
Need to think about it .
Again , thanks Tom7 for this f***ing good idea of AAD .
It 's saving my life . "
Well !
You 're f***ing welcome !
A Pisces - Crumbs ( 10 songs ; 20:32 ) - Zage says : " A pop rock album , lots of melodies , lots of guitars , lots of electronics , lots of my inner influences ( Smashing Pumpkins , Nine Inch Nails , Beatles , whatever ) but when under the pressure of time it came out all of my deeper unconsciousness . "
RedwaX - Silus ( 1 song ; 22:47 ) - " Began recording at around 2:10 PM , 10 - 24-05 , finished mixing at about 5:06 PM the same day .
Not exactly what I was expecting , most of it is an exercise in annoyance , excess , and dischord .
It 's the story of a young boy named Silus .
Silus is dead .
Enjoy . "
Pumpkin Buzzard - American Jellyfish ( 10 songs ; 20:12 ) -

Pumpkin Buzzard - Sunshine Synthesizer ( 7 songs ; 31:36 ) - " Our third album - a - day was completed in approximately 6 hours .

Boobootin - pop music ( 16 songs ; 30:16 ) - Motti from Israel says : " i found this site album a day .
i like the idea to do album in 24 hours .
i try and i like what i did . "
GlaudiusMaximus - Dice Music ( 99 songs ; 38:49 ) - Here 's a 99 - song record - breaker : " Laziness strikes a few minutes into an album - a - day project , why not get the computer to do the grunt work ?
This ' music ' is algorithmically generated , but is unpredictable in an amusing and addictive way ( at least to someone who has been awake all night ) .
I can't remember when I started , but it 's been ( not much ) less than 24 hours since I last woke up , so by the power of arithmetic I deduce I managed it in time . "
Algorithmically generated music is totally legit , as long as you do all the programming on the day itself .

Slipperystar - Dandelion Wine ( 8
I 'll pay for half those star tattoos to be removed , says the man who engraved 56 on 18 - year - old girl 's face
The tattooist embroiled in a row with a teenage girl who claims he tattooed 56 stars on her face when she only asked for three has said he will help pay for them to be removed .
Rouslan Toumaniantz said today that Kimberley Vlaminck ' absolutely ' agreed she wanted 56 stars tattooed on the left side of her face .
But now the 18 - year - old is suing Toumaniantz , claiming she had asked him for only three stars - and had fallen asleep during the procedure , waking up to a nightmare in her Belgian hometown of Courtrai .
A distraught Kimberley Vlaeminck speaks on her mobile phone at home in Belgium today - the 56 tattoos still healing across her face
Toumaniantz - himself covered from head to foot in tattoos and piercings - said he would help pay for half of the treatment to remove the tattoos .
' I maintain that she absolutely agreed that I tattoo those 56 stars on the left side of her face , ' he told newspaper La Derniere Heure .
' A witness , a woman who was present , has already been questioned by police , and she confirms it .
' But be that as it may : Kimberley is unhappy and it is not my wish to have an unsatisfied client .
There is a way to remove the tattoos with the help of a laser .
I accept to pay for half the cost . '
Scarred from life : Kimberley Vlaminck shows her tattooed face .
The 56 stars will cost £ 8,500 to remove
Toumaniantz claimed Kimberley was happy with the work when she left his shop in Coutrai but changed her mind when her father saw the stars .
' She 's 18 years old , she 's an adult , ' he said .
' I do n't regret it .
To tell you the truth , this has given me some publicity . '
Kimberley is suing Toumaniantz for £ 10,000 after she paid £ 55 for ' the graffiti that has ruined my life ' .
She claimed the Toumanaintz misunderstood her French and English .
She claims she fell asleep while he was doing his work ... and awoke to ' this nightmare ' .
' It is terrible for me , ' said Kimberley yesterday .
' I can not go out on to the street , I am so embarrassed .
I just look horrible .'
Denial : Rouslan Toumaniantz , who runs the tattoo parlour , says Kimberley asked for 56 stars
Rouslan Toumaniantz 's tattoo parlour in Courtrai , Belgium , where Kimberley 's face was tattooed
' I think he did n’t understand what I wanted .
He spoke only fractured English and French .
' But I explicitly said in my native tongue , French , and also in a little bit of English when he looked confused , that I wanted three little stars only near my left eye . '
Toumaintz , who runs the tattoo parlour called The Tattoo Box in Courtrai , said Kimberley was awake and actually looked in the mirror several times during the procedure to see how it was going .
He said she knew ' exactly what she wanted ' .
' The trouble all started when she went home and her father and boyfriend threw a fit .
' They are saying things now like I doped her or hypnotised her .
What rubbish !

Too many people die needlessly at U.S. hospitals , according to a sweeping new Medicare analysis showing wide variation in death rates between the best hospitals and the worst .
FIND YOUR HOSPITAL : See failure death rates near you
LOWER READMISSION RATES : Baylor hospital leads way for heart patients
The analysis examined death rates for heart attacks , heart failure and pneumonia at more than 4,600 hospitals across the USA .
At 5.9 % of hospitals , patients with pneumonia died at rates significantly higher than the national average .
With heart failure , 3.4 % of hospitals had death rates higher than the average , and 1.2 % of hospitals were higher when it came to heart attack .
Researchers also found that the majority of U.S. hospitals operate the equivalent of revolving doors for their patients .
One of every four heart failure patients and slightly less than one in five heart attack and pneumonia patients land back in the hospital within 30 days , data show .
" We have double failure in our health system , " says John Rumsfeld of the Denver VA Medical Center and chief science officer for the American College of Cardiology 's National Data Registry .
The analysis by U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) comes as the White House and Congress debate ways to cut costs and improve quality in the nation 's health system .
One idea on the table is to reward doctors and hospitals not just for how many procedures they perform but how well their patients fare .
More than 200 hospitals have death rates better than the national average , and hundreds fare better on readmission rates .
The findings are based on more than 1 million deaths and readmissions among Medicare patients from 2005 to 2008 .
A separate USA TODAY analysis of the data found that patients have higher death rates at hospitals in the nation 's poorest and smallest counties , compared with those in larger , more affluent areas .
Death rates in hospitals in counties with fewer than 50,000 people rank 1 to 2 percentage points higher than their most - populated counterparts , a significant difference .
A similar pattern emerges at hospitals in counties where the median household income falls below $ 35,000 a year .
Barry Straube , director of CMS ' office of standards and quality , says the agency aims to intensify competition between hospitals by giving patients the information they need to seek out higher - quality care and by giving hospitals a way to measure their performance against their competitors .
It also provides a tool that government and private health plans can use to determine which hospitals merit higher pay for better performance .
" This kind of information is absolutely the backbone of many of our efforts to reform the health system , " says Janet Corrigan , head of the National Quality Forum , a consortium of government agencies , insurers , hospitals and doctors ' groups that approved the methods used in the analysis .
" Based on what we see here , we have our work cut out for us . "
Brazilians are kicking up a stink over 1,200 tonnes of British garbage , including toilet seats , dirty diapers and used syringes , that are rotting at two southern ports after arriving in container ships .
The trash , which arrived in Brazil earlier this year , was destined for Brazilian companies that said they were expecting shipments of recyclable plastic , officials say .
Instead , port officials found the containers that originated at the British port of Felixstowe packed with trash ranging from the chemical toilet seats to food remnants and computer pieces .
Brazil 's federal prosecution office asked the foreign ministry on to request that Britain take back the shipments .
" We will ask for the repatriation of this garbage , " said the Brazilian environment agency IBAMA president Roberto Messias .
" Clearly , Brazil is not a big rubbish dump of the world . "
IBAMA has imposed fines on the import companies involved in the shipments and Mr Messias said it was " difficult to believe " they were innocent of any wrongdoing .
The British Embassy said in a statement it was investigating the case and would " not hesitate to act " if it was found that a company had violated the Basel Convention on the movement of hazardous waste .
Both countries are signatories of the treaty , which came into force in 1992 .

We 've already had a pretty good idea about what 's in store for iPhone OS 3.0 , but Apple naturally still had a few tricks up its sleeve , and one of the most impressive is the new " Find My iPhone " service to help you locate your lost phone .
While complete details are still a bit light , the service will apparently let you login into your MobileMe account and instantly show your iPhone on a map , and even send a message to the phone and force it to play a sound whether it 's in silent mode or not .
As if that was n't enough , you can also use the Remote Wipe feature to erase all the data on the iPhone from afar and restore it to the factory settings .
We guess the electric shock will have to wait for for iPhone 4.0 .
While some kids are out playing , “ coasterdude ” decided to design and build a roller coaster in his very own backyard .

Where can science fiction possibly go when real - life headlines proclaim that researchers have created LED lightbulbs from salmon DNA ?
University of Connecticut researchers have added fluorescent dye to salmon DNA and spun the DNA strands into nanofibers to create a brand new material that gives off a bright white light .
A LED light is coated with the DNA nanofibers , and voila , a salmon DNA lightbulb is born .
While other scientists have experimented with materials like silica nanoparticles and block copolymers to alter the color of light given off by a LED bulb , salmon DNA has proven most successful .
Tuning the light quality from cool white to warm white is just a matter of tweaking the ratio of dyes because , according to researchers , “ the DNA fibers orient the dyes in an optimum way for efficient [ fluorescence energy transfer ] to occur . ”
So salmon DNA bulbs could overcome at least one hurdle for LEDs –complaints about brightness .
But despite advances in color tuning , University of Connecticut scientists do n’t know if their LED bulbs will be cheaper or more energy - efficient than current LED bulbs , which are already more efficient than CFLs and incandescents .
And with high - end LED bulbs selling for as much as $ 80 , price will ultimately be the barrier that makes or breaks the success of LEDs in the market .

Introduction
The Pentax K - 7 is one of the more exciting new DSLR cameras of 2009 , signalling Pentax 's entry into the super - competitive semi-pro category .
Going up against the likes of the Canon EOS 50D and Nikon D300 , the 14.6 megapixel K7 certainly has a lot to offer on paper , surpassing its main rivals in many ways .
The Pentax K - 7 joins the growing list of DSLR cameras that can record video , with a best quality setting of 1536x1024 pixels at 30 fps .
In - camera High Dynamic
Range is another up - to - the - minute feature , combining three differently exposed images on - the - fly to create a single photo with expanded dynamic range .
Autofocus , traditionally one of the weaker points of Pentax SLRs , has been significantly upgraded to a new 11 - point wide - frame AF module with 9 cross sensors and 2 line sensors .
The dust - , weather - and freeze - proof Pentax K - 7 has 77 weather / dustproof seals , a stainless - steel alloy chassis , a shutter designed for 100,000 releases , a top shutter speed of 1/8000th second , a through - the - lens optical viewfinder with 100 % frame coverage and 0.92 x magnification , and a new 77 - segment matrix meter .
With barely a pause for breath , the K7 boasts a high - resolution 3 - inch LCD monitor with 920 k dots , built - in dust removal and shake - reduction systems , continuous shooting rate of 5.2 fps , improved Live View with Face Recognition AF , and automatic compensation of lens distortion and lateral chromatic aberrations with DA and DFA lenses .
In the UK the Pentax K - 7 costs £ 1199.99 body only , £ 1229.99 with the 18 - 55 mm kit lens , and £ 1329.99 with the 18 - 55 mm + 50 - 200 mm double kit lens .
In the US , the K - 7 body only costs $ 1299.95 and the new lenses are priced at $ 199.95 for the 18 - 55 mm and $ 249.95 for the 50 - 200 mm .
Ease of Use
The Pentax K - 7 is a little smaller - 96.5 ( H ) x 130.5 ( W ) x 72.5 ( D ) - and a little lighter - 670g without the battery or memory card fitted - than the older K20D model , but in many respects the two cameras share a very similar external design .
As soon as you pick the K - 7 up , you can instantly tell that it 's a serious camera , feeling more solid than its main rivals , the Canon EOS 50D and Nikon D300 , despite being quite a lot smaller than them .
This is mainly due to the K - 7's stainless - steel alloy frame and lightweight magnesium - steel alloy body , which is a world away from Pentax 's much smaller and lighter entry - level DSLR cameras , signifying the company 's attempt to provide a DSLR that will appeal to more experienced photographers .
The K - 7 is dust , cold and water resistant , thanks to a system of 77 special seals used throughout the design , and it can operate at temperatures as low as - 10°C .
This shows itself most obviously via the battery compartment and the memory card slot .
The former is opened via a small rotating latch , which is reassuring but a little fiddly to use if you 're in a hurry though .
The K - 7 features a newly designed shutter unit which provides a fast top shutter speed of 1/8000th second and a very competitive 100,000 shutter release life - span , a figure more commonly associated with professional SLR cameras .
One of our main criticisms of the K20D kit has been addressed with the introduction of a new standard 18 - 55 mm kit lens that 's better built and more weather - proof than its predecessor .
The smc PENTAX - DA 18- 55 mm F3.5-5.6AL
WR lens features a newly designed , simplified weather - resistant construction designed to minimise the intrusion of water and moisture into the lens barrel .
There 's also a special coating which repels dust , water and grease and makes it easy to wipe off fingerprints and cosmetics .
Consequently it feels much more at home on the K - 7 than the previous 18 - 55 mm kit lens did on the K20D , although it remains a rather slow lens at both ends of the focal length ( f3.5 - 5.6 ) .
As it 's aimed at the more experienced digital SLR owner , the K - 7 is a complex camera in terms of functionality and the number of external controls that it offers , with over 25 in total and a lot of them having more than one function .
Despite the presence of so many buttons and switches , the Pentax K - 7 does n't feel too cluttered or intimidating , although it will certainly take some time to adapt to for people moving up from an entry - level SLR .
Departing from the recent trend of ultra-compact SLR models , the K - 7 is definitely designed for " normal " hands .
The camera has a deep , contoured handgrip on the right - hand side , coated in a rubberized compound to aid grip , that enabled me to use three fingers to hold it and my right forefinger to operate the shutter button .
There is a generous contoured area where your right thumb sits , with the rest of the body finished in a textured matt black .
The shutter release action on the Pentax K - 7 is quieter than on the K20D but still quite loud and mechanical , something that you will either love or hate .
I liked it , although it is n't great for close - up candid photography as your subject will probably hear you if you get too close .
On the front of the camera body is the RAW button , which instantly sets the image quality to whichever RAW format is selected in the menu system ( either Pentax 's PEF format or Adobe DNG ) , useful if you are shooting in JPEG and want to quickly switch to RAW mode for a particular image .
Located underneath is the Autofocus Mode switch , with three available modes , and above a small button for opening the pop -up flash , which extends quite high above the lens to help minimise red-eye .
On the bottom of the K - 7 is the weather - sealed battery compartment , housing a rechargeable 1860 mAh D - LI90 lithium - ion battery .
The camera managed over 750 shots using the supplied rechargeable Li-ion battery before being depleted , a significant improvement on the older K20D .
There 's also a metal tripod mount that 's perfectly in - line with the centre of the lens mount .
On the right - hand side of the K - 7 is the weather - sealed SD / SDHC memory card slot , and located below is the remote cable release connector .
On the left - hand side is a large vertical flap covering the DC In , AV Out and HDMI connectors .
The HDMI port allows you to connect the K - 7 to a high - def TV set , but only if you purchase an optional HDMI mini-cable .
Above this is a small Mic port for connecting an external microphone , protected by a round rubber seal that refused to stay in place .
Front Rear
The Pentax K - 7 follows conventional DSLR design in having a shooting mode dial on the top - left of the camera , which allows you to select either one of the advanced mode like Aperture - priority , Shutter - Priority and Manual , or the more point - and - shoot Auto and Program modes .
There are no scene modes on this camera , signaling its intent as a serious photographic tool .
You 'll instantly notice that the K - 7 has a couple of unusual shooting modes that you wo n't have seen before on any other camera ( apart from the older K10D and K20D models ) .
These are the Sensitivity - Priority and Shutter & Aperture - Priority modes , and they are genuinely useful additions .
Sensitivity - Priority automatically selects the best combination of aperture and shutter speed for your chosen ISO speed .
The sensitivity can be shifted instantly ( in 1/2 or 1/3 steps ) by turning the rear control dial .
This allows you to quickly select an ISO speed , without having to access the menu system , which is very useful in rapidly changing light conditions .
In Shutter & Aperture - Priority mode the camera selects the most appropriate ISO speed for a shutter speed and aperture combination , allowing you to use ISO sensitivity as a third factor in determining the correct exposure .
As digital cameras have always offered the unique ability to instantly change the sensitivity , it 's surprising that Pentax are still the only manufacturer to allow you to use ISO in this way .
At the base of the shooting mode dial is a switch which selects from one of the three metering modes - multi-segment , centre - weighted or spot - which all use the new 77 - segment multi-pattern metering system .
On the right hand side of the top of the K - 7 is the small shutter button , surrounded by the on / off switch .
This has a third setting , which by default activates the traditional Depth of Field Preview function , stopping down the lens so that you can see the effect of your chosen aperture .
Located in front of the shutter button is one of the e-dials , predominately used to change the shutter speed , while behind it are the Exposure Compensation and ISO buttons - these commonly - used functions are now ideally located for easy access .
Pentax have retained the traditional top LCD panel which displays quite a comprehensive amount of information about the current camera settings , including the shooting mode , current aperture or shutter speed , flash mode , battery level , number of remaining frames and drive mode .
A similar amount of settings are also displayed in the viewfinder .
In addition , when you turn the K - 7 on or change the shooting mode , a graphical overview of how that mode operates is briefly displayed on the rear LCD screen .
The Pentax K - 7 does a very good job of providing easily understood information about the settings that it 's using .
The Pentax K - 7 has a traditional eye - level optical TTL viewfinder which offers an impressive 100 % scene coverage , beating both the Canon EOS 50D and Nikon D300 .
Being able to see exactly what will be captured means that you can only blame yourself for poor composition and unwanted details creeping into the frame .
The viewfinder is bright and free of any distortions or aberrations , making it suitable for both auto and manual focusing .
It also features a new Natural - Bright - Matte III focusing screen to improve focusing accuracy during manual - focus operation .
The in - finder status LCD runs horizontally along the bottom and it shows most of the camera 's key settings .
The rear of the camera is dominated by the large 3 inch LCD screen .
The K - 7's LCD screen has a very high resolution of 920 K dots , wide viewing angle and it remains visible outdoors in all but the brightest of conditions , making it one of the best LCD screens that we 've seen on a DSLR .
The colour temperature of the screen can be modified if you think it does n't match that of your calibrated computer monitor , but the contrast and gamma can not be altered .
Gripping the K - 7 with both hands means that the glass of the screen inevitably soon becomes covered with thumbprints , though this is true of most DSLRs in its class .
The rear screen also doubles as a comprehensive status display , which can be called up by pressing the OK button in record mode .
If you then press the INFO button , you can also change all the settings right on the screen using a combination of the navigation pad and the rear e-dial .
This ingenious solution spares you the pain of having to enter the menu , and makes most setting changes very simple .
Located above the LCD screen and to the left of the viewfinder are the self - explanatory Play and Delete buttons .
To the right of the viewfinder is the rear e-dial , mainly used for changing the aperture , and the AE - L button , handily placed for locking the exposure .
Underneath the rather innocuous looking button with a small green dot is unique to the K - 7 .
It has two uses - firstly , when shooting in Manual mode , a single push of the green button allows you to instantly set the correct exposure for the subject , as calculated by the camera , useful if you need a starting point for your own exposure .
Secondly , the K - 7 offers a Hyper Program function which instantly switches to either the Shutter - Priority or Aperture - Priority mode from the Program mode , simply by turning either of the control dials on the grip .
Pressing the Green button then returns to the Program mode .
The AF button is an alternative way of locking the focus , surrounded by the Autofocus Area switch which can be set to Centre AF , Auto / All 11 AF points , or User Selectable .
The new LV button turns on the K - 7's Live View mode ( see below for more details ) .
The traditional 4 - way navigation pad is split into separate buttons , providing instant access to the drive mode / self - timer , custom image , flash and white balance settings , with the OK button confirming actions .
The Menu button accesses all of the 89 different menu options that the camera offers , reflecting the fact that this a complex and very customisable DSLR .
Thankfully you will only have to set about half of the settings once and can then forget about them .
The menu system has a fairly logical tabbed system with four main tabs , Rec. Mode , Playback , Set - Up and Custom Setting , each divided into several sub-pages , and it 's easily readable with a bright display and a large font size making it perfectly visible even in low light .
Front Top
Live View has thankfully been greatly improved on the K - 7 , offering a much more usable system than the K20D .
You can use it to hold the K - 7 at arm 's length or mount the camera on a tripod , with a single press of the new LV button on the rear displaying the current scene on the LCD screen .
Focusing is still achieved by pressing the small AF button on the rear of the camera , rather than half - pressing the shutter - button , which is less intuitive .
Thankfully the LCD screen no longer blanks out momentarily , making it much easier to use Live View for tracking a moving subject .
In theory at least - unfortunately the AF system in Live View mode takes several seconds to lock onto the subject , even if it 's stationary , making it much better suited to subjects that do n't move .
The new Face Recognition AF mode does work quite well , as promised quickly identifying people in the frame , but again it takes a couple of seconds to lock onto a non-moving subject .
Impressively Live View can be used in the continuous shooting mode with no restrictions on the 5.2 fps rate , as the K - 7 sets the mirror to the lock - up position .
Alternatively you can use manual focus in Live View mode , with up to 10 x magnification available via the Info button to help you fine - tune the focus ( you can also use the Info button to magnify the subject by up to 6 x when Auto Focus is on ) .
All of our main criticisms of the K20D 's Live View mode have been addressed on the K - 7 .
Most of the main camera settings are displayed , including a helpful electronic level that helps to keep your horizons straight , although a histogram is still conspicuous by its absence .
You can now change the aperture , shutter speed , exposure compensation , ISO speed and a number of other settings when Live View is activated , which means that it 's much more than just a glorified version of the Digital Preview option , as on the K20D .
A big improvement then , let down only by the slow and hit - and - miss AF system .
Live View is also used for the feature that will generate a lot of interest in the Pentax K - 7 : its movie mode .
This is the first ever Pentax DSLR camera to shoot HD quality video , recording high - definition video at either 1536 x 1024 pixels or 1280 x 720 pixel resolution at 30 fps in the Motion JPEG ( AVI ) format .
Video can also be recorded at 640 x 416 pixels at 30 fps .
The maximum size of a single video clip is either 4 gigabytes or 25 minutes .
There 's a built - in microphone for mono recording and also a socket for connecting an external stereo microphone .
It also has an HDMI port for playback on a HD TV , using the industry - standard HDMI mini - out connection , but note that you 'll need to purchase a suitable cable separately .
You can also still connect the K - 7 to a standard TV set via NTSC / PAL .
By offering video capture in a DSLR , Pentax has made it possible for filmmakers to play with depth of field the way they never could , taking advantage of the relatively big APS -C image sensor and the wide assortment of Pentax lenses .
There are , however , some notable drawbacks to the Pentax K - 7's video mode .
It 's quite difficult to actually start recording one .
You have to set the Mode Dial to the Movie mode , then the AF - On button to set the focus , then press the shutter button to begin recording ( with the same button ending the movie ) .
It 's not on a par with the one - button system that some rivals offer , and you can't take a still shot during recording either .
As with all other DSLR cameras that have a vidoe mode , you can't autofocus during movie recording .
Focusing manually is the only option , although most AF lenses have MF rings with very little ' travel ' between their close - focus point and infinity , and in a quiet environment it's also possible to hear the sound of the focusing ring in the video .
In addition you can't set the aperture from the camera during recording , only before , so you will want to use lenses that have an aperture ring if possible .
The K - 7 can be set to Auto Aperture Control , which removes the flexibility of being able to set the aperture yourself but at least enables the camera to change it during recording to suit the subject matter .
The shutter speed cannot be set by the user in movie mode either , so you will have to rely on the camera 's auto - exposure system while filming .
Handholding the K - 7D and shooting video is very difficult , with the DSLR form factor not lending itself well to controlled shooting at arm 's length .
It 's a much better idea to mount the camera on a dedicated video tripod .
Casual users hoping to grab some quality footage of the kids may be put off by the inherent difficulties of shooting video using the relatively alien SLR format .
The Pentax K - 7 features an improved Shake Reduction system .
Turn it on via the main menu option and the K - 7 automatically compensates for camera shake , which is a slight blurring of the image that typically occurs at slow shutter speeds , providing approximately 2.5 to four shutter steps of compensation .
As this system is built - into the camera body , it works with almost any lens that you attach to the K - 7 , providing a significant cost advantage over DSLRs from Canon and Nikon , which use a lens - based image stabilisation system ( compatible lenses are the PENTAX K- , KA- , KAF - , KAF2 - and KAF3 - mount lenses ; screw - mounted lenses ( with an adapter ) ; and 645 - and 67 - system lenses ( with an adapter ) ) .
In practice I found that it does make a noticeable difference , as shown in the examples on the Image Quality page .
You do n't notice that the camera is actually doing anything different when Shake Reduction is turned on , just that you can use slower shutter speeds than normal and still take sharp photos .
The K - 7 also displays a blur icon in the viewfinder to warn you that camera - shake may occur , regardless of whether or not Shake Reduction is on .
If you 've had a bad experience with DSLRs and dust in the past , then the K - 7 offers an improved Dust Removal mechanism .
This automatically shifts the low - pass filter located in front of the CMOS image sensor at very high speed , shaking the dust off the low - pass filter .
I did n't experience any issues with dust during the 3 weeks of this review .
If you do , there 's a neat feature called Dust Alert which is designed to show exactly where the dust is on the image sensor .
A vertically and laterally correct image of the sensor shot at f/16 is shown on the LCD screen , indicate exactly where any stubborn dust particles may be lurking .
While this feature wo n't prevent dust from getting onto the sensor , it does provide a quick and easy way of checking for it .
In addition Dust Removal can be set to activate whenever the camera is turned on , and you can also use the built - in Sensor Cleaning function to lift the mirror and clean the image sensor with a blower brush or third - party cleaning solution .
Memory Card Slot Battery Compartment
The Pentax K - 7's HDR Capture option ( only available for JPEGs ) takes three images with different exposures , and then records a single image that combines the properly exposed parts of each one , expanding its dynamic range .
It 's important to always use a tripod to prevent camera shake from blurring the HDR image , and it does n't work very well for moving subjects .
Similar to Nikon's D-lighting , Sony's DRO , and Olympus ' Shadow Adjustment Technology , Pentax 's D - Range allows you to correct the highlights ( On or Off ) and / or the shadows ( 3 different levels ) before taking a JPEG or RAW image .
Although this option is always at your disposal , remember that it is meant to be used in strong , contrasty lighting at base ISO .
The Pentax K - 7 also has a multi exposure mode that allows you to combine between two and nine different JPEG or RAW images into a single photo .
Pentax 's Custom Images , similar to Nikon 's Picture Styles and Canon 's Picture Controls , are preset combinations of different sharpness , contrast , saturation and colour tone settings .
You can change the saturation , hue , high / low key , contrast and sharpness for each of the seven options ?.
The Pentax K - 7 additionally offers seven different Digital Filters , which allow you to quickly apply an artistic effect to a photo before taking it ( JPEG images only ) .
Note that applying the Digital Filters slows the camera down somewhat , as it has to process the image for a few seconds after it 's taken .
The K - 7 can also be set to automatically compensate for both distortion and lateral chromatic aberration of any DA - and DFA - series lenses .
The rather innocuous - sounding AF Adjustment custom function will be of particular interest to current Pentax owners .
If you have a collection of older Pentax lenses and you 've never been quite sure how accurate they focus when mounted on a DSLR , this is the function for you .
Essentially it allows you to alter the focus of each lens .
You can use a focusing target like the new LensAlign range of products to test if the lens focuses correctly , and if it does n't alter it slightly using the AF Adjustment option , then test again until perfect focus is achieved .
With all other DSLR systems you 'd have to send the camera and lens off for calibration ( and maybe even have to pay for it ) , but with the K - 7 , you can calibrate all of your lenses in the comfort of your own home .
The start - up time of the Pentax K - 7 , from turning the camera on to being ready to take a photo , is very quick for at around 1 second .
Focusing is also quick and consistent in good light with the standard 18 - 55 mm kit lens , a marked improvement on previous Pentax DSLRs , with the 11 point AF system offering fairly generous scene coverage , and the camera happily achieves focus indoors and in low - light situations .
Note that the 18 - 55 mm lens has an annoyingly loud focusing mechanism though .
Unlike the K20D , the powerful AF Assist lamp can be used even the built - in flash is n't raised .
It takes about 1 second to store a JPEG image at the highest quality setting with no discernible lockup between taking shots , allowing you to keep shooting as they are being recorded onto the memory card .
For RAW images the Pentax K - 7 takes about 2 seconds to store an image and again there is no lockup between shots .
In the continuous shooting mode you can hold down the shutter button and take 5 shots per second for up to 40 JPEGS or 15 RAW files , an impressive performance given the large 14 megapixel files that this camera produces .
The camera does lock up for a few seconds once the maximum number of shots is reached , although you can continue to shoot continuously , just at a much slower rate .
Once you have captured a photo , the Pentax K - 7 has a good range of options for playing , reviewing and managing your images .
You can instantly scroll through the images that you have taken , view 9 thumbnails , zoom in and out up to a magnification of 32x , and see very detailed information about each image by pressing the Info button .
You can also delete , rotate , resize , protect and crop an an image , view a slideshow and set various printing options .
There are an expanded range of digital effects available which can be applied to JPEGs - Black and White , Sepia , Color , Extract Color , Soft , Illustration , High Dynamic Range , Slim and Brightness .
The camera shows you a preview of what the effect will look like when applied , and the effect is applied to a copy of your image , thus preserving the original intact .
Image Comparison allows you to compare two images side - by - side complete with zoom .
The Index option creates an index print from up to 36 images , Save as Manual WB sets the camera 's Manual White Balance setting to the colour balance of the current image , and RAW Development converts a RAW file into a JPEG or TIFF with various conversion parameters available .
Importantly the Pentax K - 7 offers a histogram after taking a photo which is a great help in evaluating the exposure , plus any areas that are over - exposed flash on and off in the LCD preview to show you want you should be compensating for with your next attempt .
If you have never used a digital camera before , or you 're upgrading from a more basic model , reading the comprehensive but relatively easy - to - follow manual before you start is a good idea .

Anal Penetrating Chair Kills Teen
A fourteen - year old boy in China was killed when a chair he was sitting in exploded .
Chunks of metal pierced the boy ’s rectum resulting in extensive and fatal bleeding .
This is not the first time such a thing has happened , but it is the first fatality .
The boy was alone when the accident occurred , sitting on his computer chair .
Bravely , he managed to make one last phone call to his father despite being in horrific pain .
An ambulance was immediately summoned , but it took an hour to get him to the hospital and he died enroute .
The “ killer chair ” was a common gas - cylinder - based chair the height of which can be altered via a cylinder located at the base of the chair , which contains highly pressurized gas .
Allegedly , energy created by the seat cushion caused the explosion .
The fact that three similar incidents were reported at a hospital in the last month alone , suggests an influx of malfunctioning chairs .
Back in 2007 , such a chair propelled a metal part into the rear of a 68 - year - old man , who suffered a severe wound but survived .
In all of the incidents three factors were implicated :
• Non-nitrogenous gases contaminated the cylinder of the chair .
• Deficient materials in the cylinder reduced the durability of the part .
• The cylinder was not completely airtight .
Although oil - based hydraulic devices are said to be safer , most such chairs on the market today use gas cylinders and the majority of them come from China .
So all you computer workers with adjustable height chairs better watch your butt …

2 Timothy 2:8 , 9
Last Sunday morning while we were gathered in worship a gunman entered a Lutheran ( ELCA ) church in Wichita , Kansas and shot to death the nation ’s most famous abortionist , a man whose specialty had long been the dismemberment of late - second and third trimester infants , while he was serving as an usher .
A notorious murderer met what is certain to become a notorious end .
By the goodness of God the witness of the Church was not entirely silenced in Dr. Tiller ’s life .
He had been excommunicated by his previous congregation , a church of the Missouri Synod Lutheran denomination .
And so the judgment of God had been declared ; not every watchman was silent , not every shepherd proved a hireling .
But the point was reached where a man despaired of change through government and took matters into his own hand .
I do not view the actions of Dr. Tiller ’s killer as defensible , but not for many of the easy and often self - serving reasons advanced with alarm and indignation even by many Christians in recent days .
Violence is not always wrong .
Killing is not always forbidden .
Opposition to abortion does not obligate us to oppose all forms of killing .
In saying this I make a biblically defensible statement .
God has given the power of the sword to the state so that it may judge and execute judgment .
This is true internationally and locally .
Condemnation of the vile sin of abortion , the murder of an infant , an innocent , in its mother ’s womb is not the same as the death penalty , properly applied .
Nor do I believe that Dr. Tiller ’s killer necessarily acted inappropriately as self - appointed judge , jury and executioner .
Like the couple who boldly went into the tent before the congregation at Peor and were immediately killed by Phinehas , Dr. Tiller ’s bold practice of the indefensible , his brazen boasting of his practice rendered judge and jury superfluous .
He was self - accused and self - convicted .
But what Dr. Tiller ’s killer did which Phinehas did not do was to kill against the will of the nation ’s civil authority .
It was an act of rebellion posing as an act of justice .
The killer was an assassin who lacked the courage to attack the root of abortion , our national leaders , and so attacked the branch .
His was not an act of saving babies or of executing justice .
Other men will continue Dr. Tiller ’s practice .
A bucket of water taken from the sea will not create a hole in the ocean .
Others will fill where Dr. Tiller left off .
Abortion will proceed because , and this is vital to say , abortion is blessed by the law of the land .
The logic of Dr. Tiller ’s killer is the logic of John Brown , of Absalom , of Ehud .
If there should come a time when shots are legitimately fired to prevent the murder of babies in America , it will be —as in the American Revolution and the Civil War — when those who shoot do so under civil authority , not as self - appointed makers of a new national order through acts of personal rebellion and assassination .
You may ask , “ What civil authority ? ”
Where is legitimate authority found to oppose the king or president appointed by God ?
The answer is , God raises lesser authorities to confront higher authorities .
David had legitimate authority in the kingdom of Israel when he stood against Saul .
His actions were not illegitimate because his status was not self - appointed .
The same is true of Jeroboam in his rebellion against Rehoboam .
His was a legitimate under- authority in the nation .
The Reformers relied on the protection of princes against kings and kings against popes .
They did not take up arms on their own initiative as anarchists and agents provocateur pressing for their own conceptions of right and wrong .
They relied on junior officers , secondary rulers , lesser - magistrates to advance the cause of righteousness against greater rulers and kings .
I have said that it is wrong to take up arms hoping to provoke war so that righteousness may prevail without legitimate authority calling us to such action .
But let me add equally that participation in the wicked deeds of evil rulers — or even silent acceptance of such deeds — because our rulers , after all , are established by God is cowardly wickedness .
Calvin writes of the Hebrew midwives who disobeyed Pharaoah ’s order to kill the male children of the Israelites :
Although tyrants do not easily allow their commands to be despised , and death was before their eyes , they still keep their hands pure from evil .
Thus , sustained and supported by reverential fear of God , they boldly despised the command and the threatenings of Pharaoh .
As a result those , who because of fear of man , refuse to take the right course , betray by their cowardice an inexcusable contempt of God , by preferring the favor of men over His solemn commands .
But this doctrine extends still more widely ; for many would be more than preposterously wise , that , under pretext of due submission , they obey the wicked will of kings in opposition to justice and right , becoming in some cases the agents of greed and rapacity , in others of cruelty ; yes , to gratify the passing kings of earth , they take no account of God ; and thus , worst of all , they purposely oppose pure religion with fire and sword .
It only makes their impudence more detestable , that while they knowingly and willingly crucify Christ in his members , they plead the frivolous excuse , that they are obeying their princes according to the word of God ; as if he , in ordaining princes , had resigned his rights to them ; and as if every earthly power , which exalts itself against heaven , should not instead most justly be made to give way .
So the question remains : in an increasingly God-hating day , a day of rampant insolence toward God , His commands and His Word , what is a righteous man to do ?
How may he respond ?
What avenue is open to him ?
How may righteousness be advanced if not by sword or gun ?
And the answer is , we must do precisely as our passage would have us ....
2 Timothy 2:8 , 9
Remember Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , the offspring of David , as preached in my gospel , for which I am suffering , bound with chains as a criminal .
But the word of God is not bound !
Let me point out the implications for this evil day of our passage .
This passage , I said two weeks ago , is a wonderful mixture of the earthy and sublime , the human and the Divine .
In verse 8 Paul urges Timothy — and through Timothy , us — to remember Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , seed of David .
Three juxtaposed contrasting pairs are found in these three simple statements .
First we have those implicit in the name Jesus Christ .
Jesus , a simple name , the Aramaic form of Joshua a name rooted in the Hebrew words Yahweh ( or Jehovah ) is Salvation .
Mixed with this common name given countless Jewish boys is Christ , Xristou , the anointed one .
Jesus , Messiah .
Man , God .
Second the statement , risen from the dead , contains a further mixture of ignominy and glory .
Death requires humanity .
Rising from death demands divinity .
Third , in seed of David , Jesus ’ human lineage is stressed .
Seed is human .
God is not of any man ’s seed .
Jesus was of the seed of David .
Yet seed of David is glory too .
David was king of kings and lord of lords prior to Jesus .
Jesus sits on the great throne of David .
Yet David calls him “ Lord . ”
He comes after David , He is the seed of David , yet He is also David ’s Lord .
Thus we find in verse 8 the first of two legs the Christian must stand on in evil times .
Jesus is King .
Jesus is Lord .
He is King of Kings .
He is Lord of Lords .
He is Jesus , risen from the dead .
The resurrection of Jesus was and is a revelation of Christ ’s ultimate authority .
It demonstrates to an onlooking world that Jesus is God .
He rose from the dead .
The kings of earth did their utmost and still He arose .
I will follow a man who can rise from the dead .
You will too , if you have any sense .
He is obviously , manifestly superior to the greatest human authority .
Place Jesus , holes in hands and feet , wound in His side , against Caesar on his gilded throne and only a fool follows Caesar .
But not only is Jesus revealed to be God by His resurrection , He is declared God in power by the Holy Spirit .
Paul writes that Jesus ,
… was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead …
The resurrection is not just revelation , but declaration .
Revelation is left to us to understand and heed .
Declaration comes to us directly .
Revelation is God speaking through human voices , revealing His Word through human messengers .
Declaration is God speaking directly , declaration is a trumpet blast from heaven .
God has declared Jesus King of kings and Lord of lords by the resurrection .
There is nothing revelatory about it , no ambiguity , no messenger , no interpretive room for error .
It is declaration , clear and simple — a piercing bugle note , not the rustling of leaves from which we interpret the blowing of the wind .
Jesus is God .
He is King .
He is Lord .
This has earthly implications which we must understand and declare .
Jesus is Lord.
ALL earthly authority belongs to Him .
This means that every form of earthly authority is subject to the Son .
He is the King of earth .
It is not merely a future authority .
It is not the authority of a fugitive king or a future kingdom .
Jesus began
His earthly ministry with this declaration , “ The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand ; repent and believe in the gospel . ”
The Lord Jesus has been given all authority in heaven and on earth , and He must reign until He has made His enemies a footstool .
Of the increase of His government there will be no end .
He has ascended ;
He has given gifts to men .
His kingdom has come , His kingdom is coming , and His kingdom will come .
If Christ were not King of the world today , we would not need to suffer as Christians .
But our declaration of a present kingdom , a present Lord , a present authority is what necessitates our suffering .
The kingdom and authority of Christ right here , right now is the reason the Gospel is so often a threat to earthly rulers .
Earthly rulers live for today , not for the tomorrow of life beyond the grave .
If our declaration of Christ ’s authority is only future , it contains not the slightest threat to earthly kings who care nothing for the future .
But Jesus is King right now .
And every government and ruler which stands in opposition to the authority of Jesus Christ is a government and ruler which stands under the judgment of God now , not merely in eternity .
Yes , God will judge in eternity .
But God causes kings and emperors to fall today .
Herod is eaten by worms .
Caesar is assassinated .
Jerusalem is destroyed .
Rome falls .
God judges kings and kingdoms in human history as well as in heaven .
The declaration of this truth is the God - given response to our president and our nation in this wicked day .
President Obama stands as our head .
He is our representative not just under our federal form of government , not just in earthly terms , but in heavenly terms , before the throne of God .
He stands before God for all the righteousness and wickedness of our nation .
He either opposes the sins of the nation and reaps blessing from God , or stands in affirmation of them and reaps their judgment .
And in this regard I call on us to declare and President Obama to hear the Word of God .
President Obama , you have promised not to make abortion a litmus test in nominating judges to the Supreme Court .
The King of kings , Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , however , has declared the murder of innocents a high sin , a sin so vile that even after Manasseh repents of his butchery of the innocent and is followed by the righteous Josiah , God will not turn back his judgment on Judah .
President Obama , you are not the first American political leader to embrace this slaughter .
Others have gone before you in this .
Others bear equal or greater responsibility .
But you are president today .
And you are the leader of a nation which is at war against God in this , President Obama .
We have rejected the Word of God and the Lordship of Christ in this matter .
You must oppose abortion in obedience to the King of kings for whom the murder of innocents is indeed a litmus test of righteous authority .
President Obama , in your declaration of June 1 , 2009 , “ NOW , THEREFORE , I , BARACK OBAMA , President of the United States of America , by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States , do hereby proclaim June 2009 as Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , and Transgender Pride Month .
I call upon the people of the United States to turn back discrimination and prejudice everywhere it exists .
IN WITNESS WHEREOF , I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June , in the year of our Lord two thousand nine , and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty - third .
BARACK OBAMA . ” President Obama , you speak of “ the year of our Lord , ” yet you honor what God despises , declaring a matter of pride that which is an abomination to God .
In declaring good what God has judged wicked you are in rebellion against the Lord of Lords , Jesus Christ .
President Obama , in your speech in Cairo last Thursday you said , “ All of us have a responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians can see their children grow up without fear ; when the Holy Land of the three great faiths is the place of peace that God intended it to be ; when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews and Christians and Muslims , and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of Isra , as in the story of Isra , when Moses , Jesus , and Mohammed , peace be upon them , joined in prayer . "
In that same speech you also said , “ I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear . ”
But I say to you as a minister of the Gospel you claim to believe : Scripture tells us God hates all false gods and that Jesus is earth ’s sole Lord of lords .
When Moses , Elijah and Jesus stood together on the mount of transfiguration and Peter suggested building tabernacles for all three , God thundered from heaven the unique authority of His Son .
You proclaimed yourself a Christian in your speech .
In so saying you claimed to accept the authority of Jesus Christ .
Surely any Christian knows that Scripture teaches the unique authority of Jesus .
You , Barack Obama , by using your office to defend the impostor Mohammed , and to suggest that Jesus and Moses are equals , usurp the authority of Christ and are in rebellion against King Jesus .
The second leg we stand on as Christians in evil times is this , and again , I speak God ’s Word to you who are here this morning and to President Obama .
President Obama , if you were to hear these words , it may occur to you that I am a pastor of little note ministering in a not - overly - large church in a not - overly - significant city .
And from this pulpit I address you .
Preposterous , you might think , delusional .
Others may think the same , perhaps even some here this morning .
But though you wield a sword ordained by God , President Obama , and though by that sword you rule without fear of insignificant pastors such as myself , never even knowing I exist , the disparity between our powers is much to my advantage .
It is true that you rule over me and all Americans with real power .
Indeed , the whole world is affected by your rule .
You place a supporter of abortion on the Supreme Court and millions of children continue to die .
You declare war and the world is at war .
You decree June a month of pride for an abomination and homosexuals rejoice and I cannot rescind your decree .
I am a pea , a gnat , a worm before you in every earthly sense .
But — and this I stand on , this all Christians stand on in every evil day — though a worm in earthly terms , I wield a mighty sword .
You , President Obama , bear the sword of the state , the earthly power of governance and rule .
I wield the Sword of the Spirit , the Word of God .
I understand that this is a bold claim — so bold , it may seem preposterous .
Yet so it stands .
Wielding the sword of state carries responsibility .
You will give an account to the Lord of lords and King of kings for your deeds as president .
I too bear responsibility .
I will give an account for the wielding of the sword ordained to me .
It would be blasphemy to bear this sword for personal benefit or as a partisan of a political party .
The captain of the Lord ’s army is only for the Lord .
The Sword of the Spirit is wielded only on behalf of the King of kings .
And I will be judged more severely than those who bear the sword of government if I misuse this power by allying it to a particular political party .
So I speak — from a church few have heard of in a city of little note — to you , President Obama .
I am not bound with the chains Paul refers to in verse 8 of our passage .
I do not wear steel cuffs .
I am not shackled to a dungeon cell .
The chains I and other American pastors suffer from are soft , velvet rather than steel : they ’re chains of human insignificance and small - town unimportance — and often the self - imposed chains of affluence , comfort and ease .
But chained by steel as Paul was , chained by insignificance as I am , the Word of God is not bound .
This is our confidence .
Though we are nothing , the Word of God is the power of God .
And we wield the Word : not the gun of the assassin but the unbound Word of God .
This Word will not return void .
Jesus is King . Jesus is Lord. Jesus ’ Kingdom is here .
It will come .
It has come .
It is .
I call on you , President Obama , to do today what you must certainly do one day .
Repent in accord with the Word of God .
Turn in obedience to your King .
Bow before Him .
Kiss the Son and seek His mercy .
His promises of forgiveness and salvation are for you as much as for those you rule over .
It may be that the bloodshed of America ’s butchered children cries so loud to God that our nation must suffer
His wrath as Judah suffered for the bloodshed of Manasseh despite his repentance .
We do n’t know His mind .
But what we do know is that though temporal judgment may have been decreed , it is not too late to seek
His forgiveness for the salvation of our personal souls in eternity and , perhaps , so that He may remember mercy even as He causes us to suffer his earthly wrath .
The Word of God is not bound .
Better the Sword of the Spirit than all the divisions of America ’s armies .
We have a King .
We have a weapon .
We have the promises of God ’s Word .
Do we have the faith to follow ?
A SHOWPIECE cycling event in the London 2012 Olympic Games is set to be moved away from Hampstead and Highgate , to the dismay of residents .
The International Cycling Union wants to move the bulk of the race outside the capital altogether , after the example set by the Beijing Olympics last year .
Catherine Budgett - Meakin , chairwoman of the Highgate Society said : " People will be so disappointed .
This would have put us on the map and people all over the world would have seen what an attractive area it is .
It is such a suitable venue for this event . ”
The original route was set to follow the course of the 2006 Tour of Britain , which went from Regent 's Park , through Primrose Hill and Kentish Town , up the daunting Highgate West Hill and around the Heath .
If the route is altered , the area could lose out financially with Whitestone Pond , which was on the original course , due to be given a huge makeover with the Olympics in mind .
A spokeswoman for the London 2012 Organising Committee said : " The road cycling route for the London 2012 Olympic Games was scheduled to go from Regent 's Park through Hampstead and Highgate .
" Following the road cycling competition in Beijing in 2008 , the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) has asked the London 2012 Organising Committee to re-examine the route .
" They would like the route to start at a more central part of London and move out of the city .
We are in discussions with the UCI about what this route might be and will undergo a full process of consultation about any proposed changes in due course . "
Malthus 's Revenge
The graph above is , I admit , a bit weird .
It comes from Brad DeLong by way of Paul Krugman and is meant to illustrate that , for the bulk of human history , the much - derided Thomas Malthus was right : Population growth consistently overwhelmed technological growth .
As you can see from the clustering of purple boxes there , technology did not traditionally solve our problems .
It merely kept us afloat .
And sometimes , it barely did that .
" We only think Malthus got it wrong because the two centuries he was wrong about were the two centuries that followed the publication of his work , " writes Krugman .
But his theory did a pretty good job explaining the first 58 centuries of human civilization .
Why am I talking about this ?
I spent some time today thinking about Brad Plumer 's article asking whether the climate crisis can only be averted by massive technological breakthroughs .
It 's not a marginal viewpoint .
Steven Chu , who now heads the Department of Energy , apparently believes it .
We 're going to need " technology that is game - changing , as opposed to merely incremental , " he has said .
We 're going to need understandings of basic physics and chemistry that are " beyond our present reach . "
We have , in ways that are pretty wonderful , a post - Malthusian attitude about technology .
On some level , we trust that it will rescue us when necessary .
We may not be able to predict the form of that rescue in advance .
But in recent years , trusting that our knowledge will outpace our problems has been a pretty good bet .
This has , I think , bred a certain background level of comfort with climate change .
There are plenty who believe it a bad thing , but on some fundamental level , do n't believe that really bad things still happen .
We 'll find a way out .
We always do .
If this were a television program , we 're barely at the first commercial break .
And maybe that will prove true .
Maybe the hydrogen breakthrough is just around the bend .
There 's no obvious reason to think otherwise .
But it 's worth remembering that for most of human history , our problems were at least as big as our brains , and technology rarely intervened to avert calamity .
There 's no iron law that human civilization can't be torn apart by catastrophe .
It has happened before , as you can see on the part of the graph coinciding with the Black Death .
It will likely happen again .
Malthus could still be vindicated .
So it 's good to put policies in place that make a breakthrough on energy technology more likely .
But it 's probably not a safe idea to put such insufficient policies on carbon emissions in place that our real policy is to hope for an technological breakthrough .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Africa ’s farmers need help to access loans , fertilizer and export markets to avoid future food supply crises caused by climate change and commodities speculation , a top agricultural expert said on Tuesday .

Wheat , rice and maize prices have fallen sharply from their 2008 highs , when protests broke out across the developing world over unaffordable staple foods and countries imposed export bans to ensure their people had enough to eat .
Akinwumi Adesina of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa , an aid group headed by former U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan , said commodity markets dampened by recession were serving to mask “ the next storm . ”
“ The global food supply remains far from secure , ” Adesina told the U.N. Conference and Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) .
“ We have not yet tamed the forces of speculation , climate change will yet trample our farm fields , crop diversity remains under increasing threat , ” he said in a speech .
“ Global grain reserves may be replenished for the time being , but global food security remains a goal , not a reality . ”
One of the biggest problems , according to the agricultural economist from Nigeria , is the persistently paltry harvests from Africa ’s farms , most of which are tended to be “ without access to basic farm inputs , finance or markets . ”
“ While yields across the globe , especially in Asia and Latin America , have steadily increased , the yields of Africa have remained constant -- sitting at about one - quarter of the global average , ” Adesina said .
MORE FINANCING NEEDED
He called for international donor agencies and the banks and insurance providers active in the agricultural arena to step up their activity in Africa , and work to help farmers access small loans that meet their productive needs .
“ Lack of access to finance is a major constraint to unlocking the potential of agriculture in Africa , ” he said .
The diversity of crops now being produced across the continent must also be preserved .
Plant diseases such as the blight that ruined Ireland ’s potato crop and caused famine are among the biggest risks to the global food supply , especially if major staples such as wheat or rice should be affected .
Adesina said the variety of foods being produced in Africa , often on the same farm -- with maize , groundnuts , rice , cowpea and sweet potato all grown in a cycle -- served as an important insurance that must be maintained however possible .
But he allowed that hefty costs may be involved in boosting the productivity and output of small - holder farms across the vast continent , which is highly vulnerable to extreme weather and the effects of climate change .
Citing figures from the International Food Policy Research Institute , the expert said that Africa will need $ 32 billion to $ 39 billion annually to achieve an agricultural transformation -- not including infrastructure costs .

Camps funded by NGOs and the UN are housing thousands of people Tens of thousands of people have been fleeing the fighting between the Pakistani army and the Taleban in the Swat district .
According to the UN , there are more than 300,000 people registered as displaced and the Pakistani government says it expects that figure to reach one million .
Here are the stories of three internally displaced people who were forced to leave everything behind and start a new life full of uncertainties .

We left Mingora three days ago .
The situation had become very dangerous .
We were caught up in the brutalities between the Pakistani army and the Taleban .
We were trapped inside our homes for a week , while there was constant shelling .
A mortar demolished a house just a few yards from our home .
There was no water , no power , everything was destroyed .
Swat is empty now and we do n't want to go back ever
To add to that , the Taleban threatened to kill young people if they did n't join them in their so - called ' jihad ' .
There have been personal threats to our family too , as my father is an outspoken critic of the Taleban .
We had to leave .
We left everything we had and went on foot to Malakand .
There was no transport available .
We were walking with thousands of people .
It was a difficult journey .
There was no food or water , but most importantly we were going through a war zone and we were scared that we 'd encounter Taleban militants .
Once in Malakand we hired a truck and drove to Islamabad .
We are relatively safe here but I do n't know for how long .
We left everything and now we are with empty hands trying to start our lives again .
We are trying to leave the country .
Swat is empty now and we do n't want to go back ever .
MAJID , 24 , STUDENT , NOW IN PESHAWAR
We fled Mingora last Friday , together with much of the population of the city .
Our life had become very difficult : we were trapped in curfews , electricity was cut , there was no water or food .
School lessons have resumed for these girls at a refugee camp in Swabi
In the early hours on Friday morning we were under attack from gunship helicopters .
Later the army told us we had to leave Mingora .
We got up , put clothes on and rushed out of the door .
We did n't have time to pack anything .
We did n't even prepare food for the journey .
We just shut the door and left .
People were running , everyone was so scared .
We did n't know what was going to happen next .
I feel depressed .
Swat has been brought back to the Stone Age .
There 's no life there any more
We decided to go to Peshawar .
The first part of our journey was on foot , until we reached Malakand .
The road was packed with people , thousands of them .
My grandfather is old , he could n't walk for long and needed regular breaks .
And it was a hot day .
Then we hired a truck and drove to Peshawar .
Many people stayed behind , as not everyone could afford to hire a vehicle .
I am staying at a university hostel with friends .
My family is at some relatives ' house .
Many joined refugee camps , but those must be full , because I see lots of people lying on the roads , people for whom there 's no accommodation or help .
The nearby park is full of people from Swat .
There are Swat people all over the city , everyone with their own story .
Everyone is deeply disturbed by this experience .
We left everything and our life here is uncertain .
I am thinking of leaving the country to study abroad .
My dad says that he 'll try to set up his own business and open a shop in Peshawar .
I feel depressed .
Swat has been brought back to the Stone Age .
Each and every individual has left .
There 's no life there any more .
I am not hopeful that things will get better any time soon - they can't clear this mess up in a hundred years .
GHALIB GUL , TEACHER , NOW AT A CAMP IN SWABI From the BBC's Urdu service I am from the Damghar area in Buner .
There was no school in our area so I decided to start a school .
At first we had only 28 children but with time the number rose to 90 .
Ghalib : I hope to be able to restart my school one day
That was four years ago .
One day , the Taleban arrived in my village .
They threatened to kill me if I did n't close it down .
I informed the other villagers that it was not possible for me to continue to run the school .
That 's how it ended .
I feel very sorry , because the kids were so bright .
A day after the school was closed , the army started the operation against the Taleban .
My son Muaz did not have any food for three days and kept on asking why these planes were bombing us .
I told him that they were killing the Taleban .
The Taleban is to blame for this situation more than the government .
It is true that the government forced us to leave the area , but at the same time it is providing relief for us .
When we suffer from the Taleban , they never help us .
I would like to be able to go back and restart my school but I do n't have any hope that the army operation will end any time soon .

Despite my ethnicity , I do n’t know how to speak Chinese ( in any dialect ) , but I do know a fair share of naughty cuss words in Cantonese and Hokkien thanks to family and friends while growing up in Malaysia .
So when I saw this blog post on CNET Asia ( disclosure : I work for CNET.com , the parent site ) , my jaw dropped in sheer horror , which then turned into bellyaching laughter .
It seems that Francesco Logozzo , a developer at Microsoft , has come up with an “ abstract interpretation - based static analyzer for modular analysis and verification of Java classes , ” which admittedly sounds pretty boring , until you see what he decided to call it :
That ’s right .
Cibai .
Non-Hokkien speakers might be scratching their heads as to why this is so shocking , but to put it bluntly , that ’s like calling the application “ Vagina ” but with the much more offensive four - letter version .
In Malaysia and Singapore at least , the word is often used as a catch - all swear word that replaces the f-word and other offensive terms like “ bastard ” and “ dickhead ” , and is rarely used in a literal way .
As for this application , apparently the name stands for Class Invariants By Abstract Interpretation , and you can insert your own joke here about what “ class invariant ” means when it comes to female genitalia .
Needless to say , I immediately shared this link around to my Chinese - speaking friends and we were all extremely amused .
Does this Microsoft developer know about this unfortunate meaning for the name of his application ?
I highly doubt it .
But something tells me he ’ll know about it soon enough .

You ca n’t hang up on the taxman .
[ efoods ]
Eleven federal , state and city levies add as much as 33 percent to the cost of New Yorkers ’ cellphones , a Post analysis found .
A typical cell plan costing $ 49.99 a month comes with a total tax bill of $ 10.59 — a 21.18 percent tax rate that helps give New York the fourth - highest cellphone taxes of any state .
And cheaper plans favored by the frugal and poor are taxed at higher rates .
Someone with a $ 29.99 T - Mobile Basic plan with 300 minutes pays $ 6.95 in taxes monthly , a rate of 23.18 percent , 2 percentage points above the typical city bill .
People trying to save money with multiline family plans are hit harder .

Well we 're up .
We 're in a small crowd of journalists just outside the doors to the main event .
So far nothing too exciting going down ... though there is a rumor that someone has spotted Steve Jobs wandering around .
Sure guys , sure .
The Apple Store is down .
You know what that means : new Airport Extremes .
Now on the floor -- literally .
Still waiting for these doors to open .
There 's no shortage of familiar media faces here , and everyone is in pretty high spirits .
Word on the street is that the doors will actually open around 9:30 .
Tick tock , Apple .
And we 're in !
We 've just gotten ourselves a sweet aisle seat , and hey ... power !
Thanks Apple , you sure know how to treat the livebloggers right .
Some thumping techno / rock on the soundsystem here -- mood is nuts .
No one has been trampled yet though .
Radiohead ... again .
' 15 Step 'Okay , now it 's just straight up dance party music in here .
Oh wait .
Dave Matthews Band -- we take it back .
No one is dancing .
" Good morning ladies and gentlemen -- welcome to WWDC 2009 -- please silence all cellphones and PAGING DEVICES .
" The lights are dimming ... and people are cheering .
This thing is about to get really real .
And here we go !
A welcome from John Hodgman ... PC .
" Welcome to the WWDC ...
I want to be the first to wish you a week with some innovation ... but not too much . "
" You 've already sold 1 billion apps ... do n't you think that 's enough ? "
" Hello I 'm a Mac , and PC is trying to say have a great conference . "
And Phil Schiller is out !
Huge applause .
" Thank you , thank you very much .
Welcome to WWDC .
We have an amazing week planned for all of you , and I mean all of you .
Ca n't you feel the love in this room ?
This is the best level of excitement for our dev conference yet .
I 'd like to show you one reason for that .
" " Here 's a chart of OS X users over 10 years . "
It goes from 5 m to 25 m .
" But something has happening ... " he changes the chart to move up to 75 m .
" We 've tripled the amount of users since iPhone . "
Big applause .
" No wonder is trying to follow in our footsteps , so we 'd like to tell you what we 're doing to continue this market growth .
" He 's intro'ing who will be out , Scott Forstall will be making an appearance .
" Now I get to begin with a section on the Mac .
They 're the best they 've ever been at Apple .
New customers are choosing new notebooks , and we 're in love with this new design .
" Now Phil is reminding us of just how super duper awesome the unibody build technique is .
" Customers could n't be happier with them . "
" We do n't want to stop though , we want to continue to extend that lead ...
I 'm happy to show you a brand new version of the 15 - inch macbook pro" Apple is going to use the same battery from the 17 - inch version -- looks to be non-removable , just like that model .
Lithium - polymer .
Up to 7 hours of battery life .
" A typical user will get about 5 years of life from this battery . " " Unlike our competitors , who will go through 3 batteries and not dispose of them properly .
" " When you open it up , it 's got a gorgeous display ... still insanely thin ... if you zoom in you see something different . "
A new SD slot instead of the ExpressCard slot !
That is pretty nice if you 're doing a lot of photo work ... but we would like that ExpressCard slot !
" But there 's a lot more ... it 's the fastest notebook we 've ever made .
Up to a 3.06GHz Core 2 Duo CPU , and up to 8 GB of RAM . "
Big cheers .
" You can get up to 500GB in hard drives , or up to 256GB SSD . " " It starts at an even lower price ... just $ 1699 .
" Three standard configs , $ 1699 ( 2.53GHZ , 4GB RAM ) , $ 1999 ( 2.66GHz , 4GB RAM 320 GB HD ) , $ 2299 ( 2.8GHz , 4GB RAM , 500GB HD ) SD slot is there too .
" Now you 're looking at this thinking , why is n't this just the MacBook Pro ?
What can we add ?
Well it can also get up to 8GB of RAM , 500GB of storage , and the backlit keyboard is now standard as well .
" Boo ya !
FireWire 800 port !
Whoa -- they 're adding the 13 - inch to their MacBook Pro line .
" It starts at $ 1199 .
" Wow -- nice showing here .
Price cuts are welcome for sure .
" We 're also going to update the MacBook Air with more aggressive configs and pricing .
It starts at $ 1499 ... the SSD config is $ 1799 . "
Wow , that 's a deep cut .
$ 700 than previous .
Now Phil is reminding us that these are the most environmentally sound laptops they 've made .
" World 's greenest lineup of notebooks ... "
So they claim .
" Great hardware deserves great software , so I 'd like to invite up Bertrand Serlet " Ouch .
" What a sharp contrast with Vista our OS is . "
Laughter .
" What a big hole Microsoft has dug -- they 're trying to get out of it with Windows 7 . "
Now he 's listing things like the registry and defrag .
Really toasting Windows users here .
" Even more complexity is present in Windows 7 .
The same old tech as Vista .
Just another version of Vista . " " We come from such a different place .
We love Leopard , we 're so proud of it -- so we decided to build upon Leopard -- we want to build a better Leopard , hence Snow Leopard .
" Adding Exchange support to Snow Leopard .
We 've got chills .
Chills we tell you !
" The Finder .
We love the way it is -- for SL we did n't change it .
What we did is rewrite it , and from that there 's lots of little benefits . "
" Next up , the Dock -- we 've had a feature that we use to deal with clutter , called Expose , and now we 've built it into the dock . "
You click and hold on an app and it automatically zooms out your active windows .
"
We 've made installs 45 % faster .
And after you install , you recover disk space ... it 's over half the footprint of the previous version . "
Wow -- 6 GB of savings .
That 's not nothing .
" Preview , we 've changed the way text selection works -- we use AI to find the right text in the right place . "
Big applause for this , seems minor , but hugely helpful .
Wow -- they 're adding handwriting recognition for the trackpad .
" Next Safari .
It 's been in beta for a few months ... today we 're shipping Safari 4 for Leopard , Tiger , and Windows . "
Chuckles , cheers .
" Safari 4 offers unparalleled speed . "
There 's a chart .
Another cold dis to Windows -- IE8 is way way at the bottom .
Oooh , he 's boasting that it 's passed the Acid3 test 100/100 ... IE8 ?
21/100 .
" Here 's some things you get in SL .
Crash Resistance -- the number one browser crash cause is plugins -- so now , the plugin crashes , but your windows are intact .
Just reload the page .
" Demo time !
" We 're going to start with Dock and the Finder .
Let 's talk about Stacks -- in SL , stacks handle content "
You can go deeper in level on stacks now , down to other folders .
Now showing off new Expose tricks in Safari and Mail -- lots of ways to uncover content , and select through it .
" Let 's say I want to drop an image in this email message , mail springs into Expose and I can drop it right in . "
Wow , huge applause for that .
" Next up , Safari 4 .
It is the fastest browser on any platform .
And that extends to JavaScript .
Let 's look at Google Maps . "
Wow , super fast -- they are n't joking .
" The final area of Safari I 'd like to cover is full history search .
I just click in the lower right , and I get a cover flow view across my browsing history .
But I also have full spotlight search too . " " QuickTime is designed to put your video center stage .
As soon as I start playing , the controls and titlebar fade away .
When I want to go back , they fade back in .
Another great feature is the ability to trim and share my video ... I get a visual timeline . "
Audience : ahhhhh .
You can grab ends of the clip region you want to trim , then just cut it right down .
Export quickly to MobileMe , etc . " Thank you !
" " So lots of refinements in Snow Leopard .
But there 's also powerful new technologies .
They take advantage of the power of silicon .
When you look at a modern Mac , there are things that were n't possible just a few years ago .
"
" To take advantage of all this , you need the right software .
So first , 64 - bit .
The obvious reason is to take advantage of a lot of memory .
When you run in 64 - bit , the memory limit is ... 16 billion GB .
It 's unlimited . " " All the major system apps run in 64 - bit mode in Snow Leopard . " " Let 's talk multi-core CPUs .
The challenge is how to take advantage of them .
The answer is threads .
So we have a solution for this .
Grand Central Dispatch .
It 's built - in support for multi-core all across Leopard .
" Now looking at threads in Leopard compared to Snow Leopard .
" It uses more threads when busy , but when idle , they all go away , unlike Leopard , where they remain .
It 's a big win in responsiveness . " " Now let 's talk graphics .
The way to use GPU power is OpenGL , but we want to move beyond that .
We 've devised a technology called OpenCL ... "
Uh huh .
Sounds familiar .
" We 've decided to make it an open standard . "
Big cheers for that one .
" All the top manufacturers of graphics cards are involved . " " So let 's talk business -- what we 've been missing is Exchange .
So we 've built in Exchange support to Mail , Calendar , and Address Book . "
Demo time again .
Mail auto - discovers
Exchange data , and also provides Spotlight search for Exchange messages .
Exchange contacts and calendars are integrated with your personal data , but kept separate .
You can also drag a contact out of Address Book and directly into a calendar to create an event .
Nice .
" So Exchange support requires Exchange 2007 servers .
We offer it at no extra charge , it 's built - in to Snow Leopard .
So that 's Exchange and this is a little tour of some of the new features of the OS .
It will be available for all Intel Macs , past and present .
So how should we price Snow Leopard ?
We want all Leopard users to upgrade to this , so we are pricing at $ 29 . "
Huge huge applause .
But of course , we knew this , did n't we ? " $ 29 for Leopard users , and a family pack is $ 49 .
It will be available this September , and today we 're making a dev preview available . "
" Now I 'd like to turn to Scott ... for the iPhone . "
Here we go kids .
Hang on to your hats .
" Alright , let 's talk about the iPhone . " " The response from devs on the iPhone has been staggering .
They 've been prolific in building and posting apps to the App Store .
There 's now more than 50,000 apps in the store . "
" We 've been working hard to to build a growing user base .
These apps run on all iPhones and iPod touches .
We 've sold more than 40 m iPhones and iPod touches . " " These customers love running and downloading apps from the App Store .
We hit 1 billion downloads , and that 's just in 9 months . "
" We put a video together to share stories from developers ... "
A little video now .
We 're seeing a highlight reel of successful developers .
This is pretty emotional stuff .
We 're getting some tissues out , just in case .
" It 's always been my dream to travel around and make my own games ...
I knew the iPhone was going to be something special . "
" I was at a baseball game , and they showed a commercial for my app , and I watched a bunch of fans pull out their phones and start downloading the game right there . "
" Sometimes I have to stop and say , ' whoa , this is a mobile device I 'm developing for ' because it feels like a desktop .
" So the soundtrack to this video sounds like Arcade Fire ... but it 's not Arcade Fire .
Let 's hope Arcade Fire does n't find out .
Now they 're showing users ...
" My favorite app is ... " Big , big applause .
The devs like that .
And hey , why not ?
They deserve some credit !
" Let 's talk about iPhone OS 3.0 .
Let me highlight just a few , starting with cut copy and paste . "
Now we 're running through the demo from the iPhone 3.0 event .
Now mentioning shake to undo , developer APIs , Cocoa Touch support for text .
" Next is landscape .
Since 1.0 we 've had support for this in Safari .
Now we 're taking this to our key apps . "
Smattering of applause .
Seems like most people know about this .
Now Scott is on to MMS .
Less than a smattering of applause , a droplet of applause .
" 29 carriers will support MMS when we launch ...
AT&T will be ready at the end of the Summer . "
Laughter .
What ?
End of Summer ?
You 're kidding us , right ? " Next up , Spotlight .
You can search anything on your phone , including apps .
Next , iTunes .
You 'll now be able to rent and purchase movies right from your phone . " " This is great if you 're getting ready to get on a flight , you can purchase and download right at the airport . "
" We 've also added support for iTunes U right on the phone .
Next , important additions to parental controls .
We 've added control over a number of items , most importantly , ratings control for movies and TV , as well as apps .
" Tethering !
" This allows you to share you connection with your computer . " " This works with Macs and PCs , wired over USB , or wireless with Bluetooth .
It is a seamless experience .
There 's no need to run any software once it 's turned on .
This requires carrier support .
We have 22 partners in 44 countries ... "
No mention of AT&T .
What !?
The audience is not happy .
" Next up , Safari .
SunSpider benchmark .
In iPhone OS 3.0 , we run JavaScript almost 3 times faster .
Next , support for HTTP streaming audio and video . " " Next , AutoFill -- you can now remember user names and passwords to login to websites .
We also use your contact info to fill out web forms . "
" We have been driving and tracking the HTML 5 standard , and now we 're adding support for new standards like audio and video tags .
" Adding new languages ... more than 30 languages supported in OS 3.0 .
Okay .
Sweet .
Find My iPhone .
" This is a great one .
If you 've ever misplaced or lost your phone , it can be ... somewhat traumatic . "
Ha !
A scene from 30 Rock .
" Hopefully you have n't had a 30 Rock experience , but this is why we created Find My iPhone .
If you lose or misplace the phone , you can login to MobileMe on any browser and it will show you where the phone is . "
Wow -- big applause .
You can send a message to the phone .
You can send a message to your phone which plays a sound as well , whether or not it 's in silent mode .
" If you 're like me , and it shows you that your phone is at your house , the alert still plays until you find that your kids hid it under the couch . "
" Now , if it is lost or stolen , you can send a remote wipe command which will delete all of your data . "
Big cheers .
" These are only a few of the tools that we offer in 3.0 .
The SDK has more than a 1000 new APIs ... let me talk you through a few , starting with in - app purchases .
" Free apps remain free .
In App purchase is only for paid apps .
Only ever .
Forever .
Okay ?
Peer - to - peer .
Wirelessly over Bluetooth , no pairing needed .
Does n't look like this is any different than what we saw at the 3.0 event .
" For 3.0 , we 're opening up the possibility for developers to build apps that talk directly to third - party hardware . " " These companion apps can talk over Bluetooth or the dock connector . " " Next is Maps .
You can embed Google Maps into your applications .
This is the heart of our app that we ship with the phone .
You get all of the same functionality .
And we 're allowing developers to build turn - by - turn apps . " " Next , push -- which is in iPhone OS 3.0 . "
" There are 3 types of notifications you can push , text alerts , numerical badges , and sounds alerts . " " Ever since we announced 3.0 , we 've been seeding developers with betas , and here 's a few to show you what they 've accomplished , starting with Gameloft .
" Gameloft is showing off what we saw at the 3.0 event -- racing app .
One moment , we need to get our leathers on .
Ah , that 's right .
You can play music from your iTunes collection ( on the phone ) in the app .
Nice touch .
Wow , game is incredibly fast too .
" Next up is Airstrip Technologies .
They allow doctors to monitor patient data on their devices .
I 'd like to invite up Dr. Cameron Powell .
" This is all a bit doctory for us .
I mean sure , every editor at Engadget is also a licensed physician , but that does n't mean we want to use our iPhones for healthcare .
This is actually pretty amazing .
You can see a real - time stream of a patients heart monitor data .
" Thank you very much . "
Big applause .
Really impressive app -- gives you a real picture of the scope of what 's being done for this platform .
It 's no laughing matter .
Now a demo of Iceberg , a book - buying app for the iPhone .
Looks like someone wants to run up against Amazon here .
" Next up is TomTom ... "
Audience oohs .
" The first GPS unit I purchased was a TomTom -- here 's the CTO and Co-founder of TomTom , Peter - Frans Pauwels . "
" We 've worked hard on this .
We 've delivered real TomTom navigation on the iPhone .
Here 's an example . "
About time on this , guys !
" It will dock the iPhone , you can use in portrait or landscape , and thanks to the accessory framework , we can enhance your GPS data .
Finally , we 'll power your iPhone as you drive , so you 're fully charged when you arrive . " " This will be available this Summer , TomTom for iPhone is here ! "
Huzzah .
Seriously .
Huzzah .
No mention of price though .
We 're thinking kind of expensive .
Next up , ngmoco -- founder Neil Young .
No , no .
Not that Neil Young .
Star Defense demo ... tower defense ...
IN SPACE .
Now showing off the downloading capabilities .
" And bam !
A whole new galaxy in my pocket . "
The audience liked that one .
Another demo .
Pasco .
A science app which shows off theory / experiments .
Ha !
Scott just came back out in a lab outfit .
He 's going to perform an experiment ... Uh oh -- demo is n't working right .
" Where 's the rapid increase in pressure ? "
" The rapid increase in pressure is right here . "
Points to himself .
Too bad the demo did n't work .
" Sometimes these things happen , but we can show you how this flatline zooms quite well . "
Laughter and applause .
Well played sir .
Scott : " That 's the last time I 'm dressing up for an experiment .
Next up is Zipcar .
" Luke Schneider from Zipcar .
" We 're excited to introduce our app today .
Jonathan ( who is demoing the app ) does n't own a car .
The application immediately locates him , and it shows him where the nearby Zipcar locations are .
" This should be handy for Zipcar users .
We 'll be using it to find Zipcars to crush with our monster truck .
Wow -- you can unlock the car from within the app !
Big applause for that one .
Now demoing a variety of sounds .
Some audio trouble it looks like ... not quite doing what it should .
" So ... it 's only rock and roll . "
The demo is n't working .
" It 's quite possible we have a little communication problem between the phone and the guitar . "
Oh man , this sucks -- seems like a really cool app .
" Well you 'll have to go to our site and see what this sounds like . "
Apparently you can also retune the guitar ( a Veriax ) via the app .
Pretty awesome stuff , though it 's a little disheartening that the demo took a nosedive .
That would be very , very bad at a gig .
Scott assures us that the demo worked fine in rehearsal .
Somewhere Steve Jobs is shaking his fist in anger .
" We think you 'll love 3.0 -- it 's free for iPhone users , $ 9.95 for touch users .
And it will be available June 17th . " " For developers -- we 're giving you the GM seed today . "
" And that is iPhone OS 3.0 . " " And with that , I 'd like to hand it back over to Phil . "
Here we go guys .
" To call the iPhone 3G a hit would be the understatement of the year .
It 's changed how people think about their phones .
It was n't that long ago that we were so frustrated with these ... crappy devices . " " It 's changed the things people want to do with their phones . "
Oh ouch .
Showing the available apps ... 18 for Palm !
Nasty , nasty burn .
" BlackBerry broke a 1000 ... and somebody else ...
I can't read it , it 's too small . "
Wow.iPhone 3GS !
Well we 've seen this one .
" This is a really fast iPhone .
Something as simple launching messaging , 2 times faster ... everything is faster .
These are all speeds against an iPhone 3G .
" Wow -- SunSpider test is less than half the rating of the 3G with 3.0 .
Up to 2 times faster across the phone , but not with everything .
7.2Mbps HSDPA ... Brand new 3 megapixel autofocus camera ...
" Amazing hardware and software which works together .
Auto focus , auto white balance ... and we have tap to focus ... you just tap on what you want to focus on . "
Just like the leak we saw !
Macro as close as 10 cm away , and better low light performance .
" And there 's an API for developers .
But the best thing about this camera , is that it also captures video ... " " So how does that work ?
You go into the camera application , select if you want to do video , 30 fps , VGA , with audio ... auto focus , auto white balance .
" Video demo .
Wow -- it looks great .
Really high quality .
" When you go into the app , you can see the video and scrub along with your finger ... you can also edit it with a tap of your finger .
"
" And you can share it with anyone , I can tap share and send it in an email ... if my carrier supports it , I can send as an MMS . "
Nice jab at AT&T .
" Best of all for devs , there 's an API for this .
Build video capture right into your apps . " " There 's another great feature -- we call it voice control .
You can hold down the home button , and a brand new UI pops up -- the voice control interface .
"
" And talk about easy to use , the commands you make are scrolling by as you use it . "
" You can make calls with your voice , you can control your iTunes by voice . "
" I can ask my phone , ' what 's playing now ' and it'll speak the title and artist back to me . " " There 's also a built - in digital compass .
The compass app is a new one that comes on the iPhone -- you can tap to go right into Maps , and if you tap a second time , it will orient the map to where you 're facing .
" Accessibility : " We have some great new settings on the 3GS -- it can read text , you can zoom in the display , invert black and white ... " " We 've also built in support for Nike + " Nice !
" And something businesses have asked for ... hardware encryption .
All new iPhone 3GSs will have it .
" " All this ... and yet we 've improved battery life as well .
" Up to 5 hours 3G talk time , 9 hours of WiFI internet .
Also a greener device .
23 % smaller packaging .
" The 3GS -- the most powerful iPhone yet .
" Okay ... now let 's get this price .
" The iPhone 3GS ... just $ 199 .
" 16 GB of storage , and $ 299 for a 32 GB version .
Black and white ... no colors .
" But we want to reach even more customers .
So we 're going to keep the iPhone 3G on the market ... at $ 99 .
" " And that starts today ... " " So when does the iPhone 3GS become available ?
Just a week and a half . " " After that even more countries , over 80 countries will have it by August .
" New ad !
Ha -- more of the spy theme .
A lens looking at the 3GS " I think it 's the same . "
" So today , we 've shown you a whole new line of MacBook Pros , Snow Leopard , really our first public demo , Scott showed you iPhone OS 3.0 , and I 've shown you the iPhone 3GS .
" " But that 's just the start of our show here at WWDC ... "
Ah , he means for devs .
So , no lime green iPhone then ?
" I 'd like to say as we leave , thank you to everyone who has worked so hard on these products .
" And that 's it folks ... now let 's see if we can find one of these badboys !
I saw a great share ( by @jurgenappelo ) a little while ago in my Twitter stream ( I am so glad that I got a new twitter account , I can actually keep track of my stream now ) .
It was a post by Krishna Kumar on his blog Though Clusters regarding his views on the problem with the software craftsmanship concept .
Now , I am a big believer in the idea that software development is a craft and that you can hone your skills and become increasingly good at it year after year ( i.e. become a master craftsman in time ) .
While I could see where Kumar was coming from with his post and while it certainly might appeal to the vanity of the younger developers out there ( myself included I guess ) , I am forced to disagree on several important points .
Firstly , it is certainly possible for a young developer to create great tools , products etc. and do something more experienced developers did not .
But this has nothing to do with craftsmanship , it is all about having a great idea and having enough drive ( and yes even talent ) to make your idea a reality .
This is entrepreneurial spirit , it ’s capitalism , and while your new idea may appeal to the masses , it does not stop the code behind your idea from being a total mess .
Craftsmanship does not even come into the picture .
What about all the new technologies and tools that are available to the young developer ?
Thing is , all these technologies are also available to the older developers .
This industry does not reward resting on your laurels .
If an experienced developer , stops learning and improving , he is pretty much guaranteed to become outdated in short order .
But , no developer who aspires to be a craftsman would ever allow himself to stagnate and therefore they are just as well equipped with all the latest tools and trends as the youngsters
The difference is , they have years more experience learning to be a craftsman in their profession and so their ability to apply these new technologies and skills is that much greater .
The interesting thing about our industry is that truly new and innovative ideas do n’t really come along all that often .
Most of the time the ‘ flavor of the months ’ technology is not a breakthrough , but is instead just an updated execution of an older concept using all the latest widgets and buzzwords .
If you ’ve been around long enough ( I do n’t mean just existing I mean proactively in the thick of things learning your craft ) you start to see the parallels and patterns and so your ability to use and abuse these ‘ new ’ technologies is almost infinitely greater than someone who is seeing the concept for the first time .
What about simply writing clean , nice code and doing it quickly and well .
While I would love to say that anyone can do it no matter how ‘ old ’ they are , I would be lying if I did .
Any developer who has ever looked at code they themselves wrote 1 , 2 or 3 years ago will tell you that this is one skill that you can hone and improve until the day you , errr – become a manager ( do n’t bite my head off , i am only kidding : ) ) .
The point is , having a skill that you can continue to improve for as long as you ’re able is the very definition of craftsmanship .
What about soft skills , I mean , being a developer is not all about technology and writing the next Facebook or Twitter .
Some of us need to work in teams , communicate with customers and managers , be able to give and take feedback , be able to mentor and be mentored etc .
Sure some people have these skills naturally but they are the exception , the rest of us learn this over time and hopefully get better at it ( although many never do ) .
And here once again an aspiring craftsman will have an advantage over the freshly minted youngster .
This is not only true in our profession , but in any field , soft skills take years to develop .
And so I come to my final point .
One of the great things about our industry is the possibility that as a relative junior you have it in you to create something truly remarkable and will appeal to many people .
It is also one of the great problems that our industry faces because things that appeal to the masses inevitably become products and teams of more experienced craftsmen ( and women : ) ) come in to work on these products .
At which point they start fighting a loosing battle against the software that in many cases is spaghetti code .
Badly designed , badly put together without any regard for the patterns and practices that some have been trying for years to instill into the zeitgeist of our industry .
It is both the beauty and the curse of software that something which is constructed and designed so badly , can bring so much value .
My great - grandma always used to say that you do n’t carry knowledge around in a backpack , meaning that more knowledge is never a burden .
It might get outdated , but it will never be useless , the lessons you learn are always applicable you just need to see how to apply them .
Becoming a master craftsman developer is all about learning how to apply everything you know to your current problem , the more you know the more angles you see , which lets you come up with more elegant , cleaner , faster , better solutions .
It is possible for people without the same experience to come up with the same solution , sometimes it will be by accident , other times they will simply be exceptionally talented people .
These however will be rare cases and will certainly not be the rule .
This is why I try to learn something new every day , try to increase the depth and breadth of my skills , not just in software but in general , it all helps .
I would encourage all young developers to foster the same attitude , not because you want to join some mythical elite but simply because you want to be as good as you possibly can be at what you do .
And I guarantee that no developer who aspires to be a craftsman would ever lord their skills over those more junior ( or less skilled ) .
You do n’t differentiate yourself based on years in the industry , you differentiate yourself on your attitude , your passion , your knowledge , your insight and your expertise – experience just tempers all these and makes them more potent .
But if you never had these ( or tried to develop them ) in the first place , no amount of experience will help you find them .
That ’s what the concept of software craftsmanship is all about .
And just as a quick addendum to the above , I am a 27 year old software developer , so do n’t think that what you read above is a dinosaurs view of the world ( even in software 27 is not that old :) ) .
Dolphins ’ first round pick Vontae Davis was arrested on June 9
Dolphins ’ rookie cornerback Vontae Davis was arrested in Champaign on June 9 for “ unnecessary vehicular noise ” and driving without a valid license according to The Daily Illini .
The incident occurred at 6:47 p.m .
The report summary said the stop was a “ Terry Stop , ” which Champaign Police Department spokesperson Rene Dunn defined as a routine traffic stop .
The loud music is n’t a huge deal , I mean , who has n’t blasted a little REO Speedwagon on the car stereo from time to time ?
But the fact that the moron was riding around without a valid license while blasting music ( which certainly drew attention to himself ) shows a major lack of judgment .
I ’ve never made it a habit to drive without a valid license but if I ever do , I can assure you that my hands will be at 10 and 2 , while the music is at whisper - level .
On the surface , this might not be a huge deal and we do n’t need to paint Davis with a Pacman Jones - type brush .
But Ron Zook benched Davis twice while he played at Illinois because he had behavior issues and word has it that second rounder Sean Smith has outplayed him so far in offseason OTAs .
Thus , this has n’t been a good start to Davis ’ pro career and it sounds like the young man has some growing up to do .
Davis might have to pay a trip to Bill Parcells ’ office soon for a come to Jesus meeting .
Update : Apparently Davis was n’t even in the state of Illinois on June 9 .
The Daily Illini screwed the pooch on this one , and made me look like a fool in the process – a fool !
My apologizes to Vontae Davis for believing anything the Daily Illini printed …a fool !

I think she 's the Burger Queen .
Edit : Husband just reminded me that we have pics on our cell phones of someone driving their motorized scooter up to the drive - thru ATM , but she was just old , not fat .
The scooter had hella flags all over it and she was wearing a helmet .
Will post if I can find them .
Edit Edit :
WASHINGTON  President Obama and his top national security aides on Monday urged North Korea to release “ on humanitarian grounds ” two American journalists sentenced to 12 years of hard labor for entering North Korean territory .
But administration officials said that the harsh sentences were likely to be used as a negotiating ploy by the North as it tries to avoid new sanctions in response to its nuclear test two weeks ago .
In public statements , administration officials frequently referred to the two journalists as “ young women ” who might have inadvertently crossed the North Korean border , and urged North Korea to return them to their families .
“ Their detainment is not something that we ’ve linked to other issues , and we hope the North Koreans do n’t do that , either , ” Robert Gibbs , Mr. Obama ’s press secretary , told reporters on Monday afternoon .
Clearly , the sentencing on Monday of Laura Ling , 32 , and Euna Lee , 36 , to serve in North Korea ’s famously brutal labor camps  where stories of starvation , overwork and mistreatment are legion  greatly complicated the Obama administration ’s agenda .
The administration has been working at the United Nations Security Council for a series of new sanctions that would both cut off funds to North Korea and interdict cargo , to search for missiles , weapons or nuclear technology .
Administration officials appeared to be weighing whether to send a special envoy in a high - profile effort to seek the release of the two women , who were detained by North Korean soldiers at the Chinese border on March 17 .
The two most likely candidates are former Vice President Al Gore , whose Current TV channel employs the two journalists , and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico , who has visited North Korea a number of times and arranged the release of another American 15 years ago .
Around a month ago Trevor Loudon blogged on Margaret Trawick .
Trawick is a Professor of Social Anthropology at Massey University , teaching The Cultural Construction of Gender and Sexuality amongst other papers .
I did n’t see the original post , but did see a later post by Loudon where he responds to an e-mail from Trawick demanding he remove his post , and issue an apology to “ all Tamil people , most of all to New Zealand Tamils , to Massey University , and to me . ”
Trawick objected to Loudon quoting her comments on a Marxist feminist mailing list , being :
>
> Women and girls do 2/3 of the world ’s work for 5 % of the income .
> So when women stop everything stops .
> …. and everyone starves .
Do n’t you think women know that ?
This is why we can not go on strike .
Be glad we do n’t kill every one of you fuckers .
All we need to perpetuate the species is your sperm .
Funny that Marx did n’t think about this .
MT
It seems this is taken out of context according to Trawick .
Well the quote is online here , and people can read the context for themselves .
I did exactly that and started reading the other e-mails in the discussion .
I then found this e-mail from Professor Trawick :
I cannot bring myself to hate any category of human beings so much that I would want to kill them all – despite what I said last night .
Is n’t this supposed to be a good thing ?
Not sure about others , but that to me sounds like you hate men ( as a category of human beings ) , just not quite enough to advocate their extermination .
Anyway , it is not guys ’ fault that they are guys .
Not that it matters whether it is their fault or not .
After all , it was not the smallpox virus ’s fault that it was the smallpox virus .
So men are like the smallpox virus ?
But it got eradicated anyway – nothing personal .
The Holocaust was based on this idea .
Better not go there .
Okay – we are clear on that – the Holocaust was a step too far – even a male only Holocaust .
But even lesbians do not as a rule advocate male infanticide – while female infanticide is practiced all over the place .
And it is the mothers who do this , of course .
“ Right - to - life ” advocates say abortion is like the Holocaust .
We disagree with them .
But in a way they have a point .
Selective female feticide happens in China and India .
We think it is wrong .
Too close to infanticide .
But abortion is not wrong – as long as it is not gender selective .
But would selective male infanticide be wrong ?
Well I tend to think so .
Of course you are not advocating such , just asking the question of course .
And then another e-mail :
If female human beings have been exploited and misused by males since time began , if the most fundamental class division is between female and male human beings , and if females can get along fine without males , except for basic reproductive purposes , then why do not females simply eliminate males , cull them as male calves or goats or sheep are culled by farmers and sold for meat .
Because if males are allowed to reach adolescence , they only make trouble from then on out .
They fight and kill one another by nature .
Better to cull them before they reach this stage .
Cull is a much nicer word than exterminate .
Please understand that I could not advocate such a program .
My only children are two sons , and I love them more than I love anyone or anything else in this world , and after them comes my love for my partner , who is male .
I would die for the sake of any one of them if I had to , no
questions asked .
Yep .
You personally do not advocate the genocide of males , as you ca n’t hate “ any category of human being ” so much .
But you are not sure if selective mail infanticide is wrong .
Now these are all e-mails from a publicly archived mailing list .
Personally I have little interest in the ramblings of a Massey Professor .
But demanding Loudon removes his post and apologises for quoting them is what got my interest in these – as universities are meant to be bastions of free speech .
Please note I will be deleting abusive comments on this post .

Finally !
The U.S. Department of Defense released its FY2008 Annual Energy Management Report .
I do n’t know why the report was delayed 3 months .
What I do n’t understand , in fact , why DESC still has n’t published its Factbook for FY2008 .
FY2008 Annual Energy Management Report , as usual , hides the vital information .
If you want to get the big picture you have to do your own calculations .
The whole report , in my opinion , is kind of attempting to validate some famous sayings about statistics , like “ statistics are like bikinis .
What they reveal is suggestive , but what they conceal is vital , ” and “ Do not put your faith in what statistics say until you have carefully considered what they do not say .
” Renewables , energy efficiency , how well the DoD did to reduce its energy consumption etc cover 99.9 % of the report .
BUT it does not give you a real fact based summary , not even in “ Executive Summary .
” So , I decided to prepare three charts based on the data provided , as usual , at the end of the report .
1 . The DoD site delivered energy consumption in Fiscal Year 2008 was 890 trillion Btu .
In 2007 , it was 865 trillion Btu .
Note that the figures refer to site delivered energy consumption .
A better metric is primary energy consumption .
If looked from that angle DoD energy consumption indeed is 1138 trillion Btu .
2. Anyway , let me go ahead with site delivered energy consumption ( which is the preferred metric by the DoD ) .
Almost 75 % of site delivered energy was consumed by tactical vehicles ; 23 % in buildings , and slightly over 1 % in energy intensive or exempt facilities and by nontactical vehicles respectively .
3 . Jet fuel is still the king .
It accounted for 56 % of total DoD site delivered energy consumption .
Add other oil types , you get 76 % .
Another 11 % for electricity and 8 % for natural gas .
Oh , I forgot , share of renewables is negligible .
4 . Money , money , money : DoD hit a new record in FY2008 .
It spent $ 20 billion for energy .
( 79 % of which for tactical vehicles , 19 % for buildings , and less than 3 % for the rest ) .
Or better , over 80 % for mobility , and 20 % for installations .
5 . Yes , $ 20 billion : Mostly for oil ( $ 16.5 billion , followed by electricity , $ 2.5 billion )
6 . DoD oil consumption in terms of barrels per day : 350,000
7 . Average cost per gallon of jet fuel in FY2008 : $ 3.12
8 . Average cost of electricity : 6 US cent per kWh.
Question : what is the average cost of electricity produced from renewable energy sources ?
Well , not indicated in the report .
It is hidden behind the numbers .
Or I missed .
9. Conclusion : DoD is and will remain the single largest energy consumer in the world .
a. DoD should get over with its renewable energy mania and try to look at where its biggest pains are .
Just read the points above .
b. DoD should answer the following question :
How much money is spent for renewable energy ?
How much renewable energy is used ?
How much conventional energy supposedly saved ?
What are the costs and savings per unit of energy ?
10 . Still open questions :
How many installations , e.g. building are privatized ?
How many utility services have been outsourced ?
How many / how much transport service has been given to contractors ?
Why are n’t they included in DoD energy consumption ?
This week Big Shots travels to Tokyo for beach sumo wrestling , rides the mechanical bull in Mesquite , Texas , and sails the Alinghi 5 America 's Cup catamaran on Lake Geneva .
We climb the Mont Ventoux , the Tour de France 's most brutal mountaintop finish , and paraglide past the Matterhorn .

The Cornish beach that inspired Virginia Woolf 's novel To The Lighthouse has been sold for £ 80,000 .
A private buyer from London who originally hails from Cornwall bought Upton Towans beach in Gwithian , complete with a view of the Godrevy Island lighthouse , at auction .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
All the proceeds will go to the Hall for Cornwall theatre in Truro because Dennis Arbon , a trustee of the performing arts venue who has owned the beach for the past 19 years , wants the sale to be of benefit to the people of Cornwall .
The guide price for the 76 acres of beach near Hayle was £ 50,000 .
Woolf 's novel , published in 1927 , was set in the Hebrides but drew on her childhood holidays in St Ives , where she stayed at a house from which Godrevy Island was visible .
A landmark of early 20th century literature , Woolf called her most autobiographical work “ easily the best of my books ” .
She used the money garnered from sales to buy a car .
Planning restrictions mean the new owner is not allowed to build on the land or excavate minerals .
The auction generated interest from the US and Russia , and a three - way bidding war was conducted by telephone .
A spokesman for estate agents Colliers CRE said : " The winning bidder now has their own 71 acres of sands and five acres of dunes to play with .
Not many people can say that . "
Heart surgery can be extremely complicated Outcomes for adult cardiac patients in the UK have improved significantly since publication of information on death rates , research suggests .
The study also found more elderly and high - risk patients were now being treated , despite fears surgeons would not want to take them on .
It is based on analysis of more than 400,000 operations by the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery .
Experts said all surgical specialties should now publish data on death rates .
DEATH RATES
Coronary artery bypass surgery alone :
2001 : 2.3 %
2008 : 1.5 %
All coronary artery bypass surgery :
2001 : 2.6 %
2008 : 1.7 % Heart valve surgery alone :
2001 : 5.2 %
2008 : 3.5 % Combined valve and coronary artery bypass surgery :
2001 : 8.3 %
2008 : 6.1 %
It had been feared that publication of death rates , which began in 2001 , would make surgeons more defensive about their work , and reluctant to take on higher - risk patients who may damage their statistics .
However , the latest analysis suggests that the availability of reliable data on risk has emboldened surgeons to take on more complicated cases .
It suggests that more people who would have been considered too sick to undergo an operation just five years ago are now routinely treated and doing well .
For instance , one in five coronary artery bypass patients are now over 75 , and the average age of aortic valve replacement patients has increased from 61 in 1994 to 68 in 2008 .
Between 2001 and 2008 there was a 50 % increase in the proportion of coronary surgery patients who had diabetes , and the proportion who had high blood pressure increased from less than 60 % to nearly 75 % .
However , overall operation mortality rates are continuing to fall .
Big progress has been made in coronary artery surgery , with the overall death rate falling by 21 % , and the death rate for people under the age of 70 undergoing planned surgery now less than 1 % .
The data also shows that surgeons are having to open up patients for a second time less frequently due to complications such as internal bleeding and infections .
And operations associated with elderly patients , such as aortic value replacement , are becoming more common , suggesting people with heart disease are living longer .
Women worse off
However , the data also shows that survival rates remain significantly worse for women than men , with the gap between the sexes failing to close .
It is now planned to publish more extensive data covering other aspects of patient care .
We are now taking on older , sicker , higher - risk patients , and these patients , rather than doing worse because of their risk , are actually doing better than they did before
Mr Graham Venn
Cardiothoracic surgeon Mr Graham Venn , a cardiothoracic surgeon at Guy's and St Thomas ' Hospital in London , said surgeons had initially been suspicious about how adverse data would be handled .
But he said : " Pleasingly , the trusts and the regulatory bodies have handled this very responsibly .
" When adverse trends have been identified they have usually been found to be due to system or resource issues and it has been possible to reverse these and reverse the adverse trends before they become a problem . "
Mr Venn said the data had also helped him pin down and explain risk to individual patients , and his team to improve planning of surgery to ensure best quality care from first to last .
" It is tightening the quality of the whole system .
Everybody on the team is involved , all pulling in the same way .
" We are now taking on older , sicker , higher - risk patients , and these patients , rather than doing worse because of their risk , are actually doing better than they did before .
Results continue to improve year on year . "
Raising standards Researcher Mr Ben Bridgewater , a consultant cardiac surgeon at University Hospital of South Manchester , said : " One of the benefits we are now seeing from public reporting of outcomes is not just about bringing poor performers ' into the pack ' but improving the performance of the pack as a whole .
" The very act of auditing services brings about improvements as centres learn from one another . "
Mr John Black , president of the Royal College of Surgeons said : " This new report proves that open reporting works if well funded and led by the clinicians .
" All branches of surgery are following the trail on reporting outcomes that cardiac surgeons have blazed and this should spur those efforts on .
" All of medicine should take note of the findings that full audit has not resulted in risk - averse behaviour . "
Professor Roger Boyle , the Department of Health 's national director for heart disease and stroke , welcomed the findings of the study .
He said : " This report provides invaluable information not just in terms of the numbers of people who have benefited but also tells us about improvements in the effectiveness of treatment , patient safety and patient experience .
" I am particularly pleased that the evidence shows we are treating more people successfully in older age . "

BBC News , Beijing
Falun Gong is banned in China , but tolerated in other Asian countries A Chinese official says the country has been successful in efforts to crack down on the spiritual movement Falun Gong , 10 years after it was banned .
Li Anping , from the China Anti-Cult Association , told a national newspaper that people now realised the true nature of the movement .
But Falun Gong still exists , and has organised protest events outside China to mark the anniversary .
Falun Gong was banned in China in 1999 for carrying out " illegal activities " .
' Violent campaign '
The Chinese government is not keen to mark this anniversary and there has been little mention of Falun Gong in the media over the past few days .
But Mr Li told China 's Global Times : " As people have realised the true essence of the cult , it 's [ now ] impossible for them to organise a massive activity . "
His association is a non-governmental body made up of volunteers , although it receives government backing .
Protests outside China have been held to mark 10 years since the ban But the Falun Gong information centre , based in New York , puts forward a different picture .
It says the Chinese government has carried out a violent campaign against practitioners over the last 10 years .
It claims that more than 3,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands tortured in China 's crackdown on the movement .
" This anniversary is a time of commemoration for the millions whose lives have been unalterably changed by this violent campaign , " said Levi Browde , executive director of the centre , in a statement earlier this month .
In China , the centre 's claims are almost impossible to verify .
Falun Gong was initially tolerated in China , but was banned after 10,000 practitioners staged a protest outside the central government 's leadership compound in Beijing .
Officials said the ban was introduced because the group carried out illegal activities , promoted superstition and disrupted social order .
It is often referred to by the government as an " evil cult " .
Since then the Chinese government has waged a relentless publicity campaign against Falun Gong and its followers .
But it is clear that some Chinese people continue to support the movement , which is based on breathing and meditation exercises .
Although the group is banned in mainland China , it is legal in Hong Kong , which was returned to China in 1997 .
There have also been demonstrations against China 's crackdown on the movement in Hong Kong , Taiwan and the United States over recent days .
And there are still people in the mainland who ignore their government 's ban and continue to practise in secret .

This advisory that applying Vicks Vaporub ( a brand of mentholated topical cream ) to the bottom of one ’s feet at bedtime , then covering those feet with socks , will stop persistent nighttime coughs hit the online world big in March 2007 .
At that time , the National Research Council of Canada ( NRC ) , the agency touted in the advisory as having “ discovered ” this cure , sent us a statement denying it extolled the application of Vicks VapoRub to a child ’s feet as an effective counter to nighttime cough :
The National Research Council of Canada ( also referred to as NRC ) has recently learned of an email that is circulating which claims we have proven that Vicks VapoRub can be applied to the feet to cure a persistent cough .
We would like to take this opportunity to dispel this suggestion .
The e-mail suggests that NRC has conducted research comparing the effectiveness of prescription cough medicines in children to alternative therapies like acupressure .
However , our databases indicate that no such studies involving Vicks VapoRub have been conducted at NRC .
It is rare for NRC to engage in research into alternate applications of medications .
Home remedies , homeopathy and alternative therapies for illnesses are popular areas of interest for Canadians , especially in recent years .
Although NRC conducts some research in these areas ( NRC conducts research on nutraceuticals and therapeutic attributes of plants ) , our focus is more frequently on medical and pharmaceutical treatments for illness and disease .
Some of our best - known advancements have been in this field , including : the first practical motorized wheelchair , the first artificial pacemaker , the Meningitis - C vaccine , the cobalt bomb and research into food - borne pathogens and water safety , to name a few .
However , while the NRC has neither researched the claim slathering VapoRub on a child ’s feet will alleviate nighttime cough nor endorses the practice , that particular home cure had been proffered by many people in the health industry prior to the March 2007 e-mail .
( That e-mail , by the way , refers to that body as the “ Canada Research Council , ” but its proper name is the “ National Research Council Canada . ” )
Joe and Teresa Graedon of “ The People ’s Pharmacy , ” a health advice feature run as both a syndicated newspaper column and a weekly show on National Public Radio , included mention of this potential use of the salve in their 2002 “ Guide to Unique Uses for Vicks . ”
Expanding on the 2002 suggestion “ Easing chest congestion is standard , of course , but have you considered applying it to the soles of the feet for a persistent nighttime cough ? ” in February 2007 , they wrote : “ We also suggest putting Vicks VapoRub on the soles of the feet for a nighttime cough .
Put on socks to protect the sheets . ”
Vicks ’ usage instructions state nothing about slathering its VapoRub product on one ’s feet ; instead , they instruct those looking for temporary relief of cough due to common cold to rub a thick layer of the salve onto their chests and throats .
And contrary to the instructions outlined in the e-mailed advisory , some health agencies have warned camphor - containing products should not be used on children and should be used only in accordance with the directions on their labels :
The [ New York City ] Health Department warned New York City parents and caregivers to keep products containing camphor away from children .
Some camphor products can be toxic to children when accidentally ingested or excessively applied to skin .
Three recent cases of seizures associated with camphor have been confirmed in the Bronx .
All three children have recovered .
The Health Department is investigating seven additional cases suspected to be associated with camphor .
Camphor , alcanfor in Spanish , is a common ingredient in many products used for colds , pest control , to ward off illness , or as air freshener .
Camphor is sold in cubes , or as a balm or ointment .
Camphor cubes and tablets are not approved by the FDA for use as cough or cold medicine .
Camphor products that are not labeled with ingredients and do not have manufacturer information should not be used ; they are unsafe and illegal .
Legal camphor products , such as some chest rubs used to relieve congestion , should only be used as directed on the label .
( Vicks ’ VapoRub product has about a 5.26 % camphor content ; the unapproved camphor cubes and tablets referenced above may contain higher concentrations of camphor . )

About a year ago , we calmly speculated about the implications that a slug - eating robot might have for us delicious humans .
Recently , there have been reports of the development of a steam - powered robot that can fuel itself by consuming any organic material in its path , from leaves to twigs to ( gulp ) humans .
Now might be a good time to panic , at least if you value your body with its flesh intact .
According to the developers of the Energetically Autonomous Tactical Robot , appropriately abbreviated EATR , the bot could live independently for years on old furniture , dead animals and , of course , human corpses , which provide the greatest fuel of all .
Fox News reports :
EATR ... which uses an " external combustion chamber " burning up fuel to heat up water in a closed loop , generating electricity ....
Upon the EATR platform , the Pentagon could build all sorts of things — a transport , an ambulance , a communications center , even a gunship .
In press materials , Robotic Technology presents EATR as an essentially benign artificial creature that fills its belly through " foraging , " despite the obvious military purpose .
Essentially benign ?
We 're not so sure about that .

Article Index Alan Turing 's ACE From Pilot ACE to Full ACE Page 1 of 2 Alan Turing is known for the " Turing Machine " but this is a theoretical device used to prove what computers can do .
What is less well known is that he designed a real physical computer - the ACE .
One of the early computing machines built in the UK , the ACE is one that should not be forgotten or overlooked .
This machine was the brainchild of Alan Turing and perhaps deserves to be called a Turing machine rather more than the theoretical machine more usually given this name .
Is it interesting not only because it is the product of one of the greatest of computer scientists , it is also a very strange machine .
We tend to think that there really is only one design for a computer .
Even the earliest valve based serial computers are sufficiently like the standard Von Neumann design for us to be able to understand them and see how they fit into the overall development of hardware .
The ACE is so different that it comes as something of a shock , a refreshing shock …
When the Second World War ended the UK had gained considerable expertise in computing because of the code - breaking efforts based at Bletchley Park .
The machine built there , Colossus , was n't a general purpose computer even in the limited sense that the ENIAC was but it contained the elements of one .
It was a digital computer custom - built to solve a particular problem .
But this did n't stop the people involved in building it seeing that a general purpose machine was possible .
Alan Mathison Turing ( 1912 - 1954 )
The Mathematics Division at the National Physics Laboratory ( NPL ) at Teddington was set up in 1945 and was intended to be a national centre for machine computation - the only problem was they did n't have a computer .
More to the point there were no general purpose computers in the UK , but the scientists from the recently disbanded Bletchly Park thought that they could build one .
Max Newman moved to Manchester University where he started the " Calculating Machine Laboratory " where the Mark I was eventually built .
Flowers and Coombs , who had done much of the actual engineering , returned to the Post Office Research lab at Dollis Hill , and Alan Turing joined the new Mathematics Division at the NPL .
There was some talk that a collaborative effort should be mounted to build a " national computer " but as it turned out the Post Office was too busy putting the telephone system back to rights and Manchester was busy doing its own thing .
When he arrived at the NPL , Turing set to work designing a new computer .
Early in 1946 he presented his paper to the executive committee of the NPL , complete with an estimate of how much it would all cost - £ 11,200 .
The then current NPL director , Charles Darwin ( grandson of the originator of the theory of evolution ) thought in terms of turning Turing 's design into a national project .
The NPL did n't really have the electronics expertise needed to build a computer on its own , although Turing had tinkered with electronics as part of the code breaking projects .
Robin Addie recalls
Turing at work : " His aim was to develop active elements for his computer ideas , largely NOR / AND gets etc …
My vivid memories are of a man of medium build with a round head of crewcut hair bending over what we used to describe as an electrified bird 's nest of resistors , capacitors and odd components insecurely fixed to a prototype chassis .
All components were held aloft by little blobs of solder .
At one end was a power supply delivering several hundred volts .
I would watch fascinated as Turing plunged a hot soldering iron in the midst of this wonderwork .
Needless to say calamities happened ; sparks flew , fuses blew , and things got hot , but Turing just pressed on . "
After failing to persuade anyone to collaborate with them , the NPL group , now expanded to include Mike Woodger and James H Wilkinson , continued to work on the logical design of Turing 's machine that had come to be called ACE - Automatic Computing Engine .
In early 1947 , Harry Huskey joined the group from the USA for a year .
Huskey had been involved in the engineering of the ENIAC and some of the design of the EDVAC and when nothing practical seemed to be happening he made the suggestion that they should build something .
The something he had in mind was a small enough amount of hardware to pass as experimental but big enough to actually be used for some computation .
Turing Moves On Turing was n't keen but the rest of the group was .
Turing did n't want to waste time building test machines he wanted to go straight to the real thing - as far as he was concerned it was obvious that the ACE would work .
A lot of his certainty came from his experienced during the war and Colossus but , as this was still strictly classified information , he could n't use any of this in his proposal or arguments for the ACE .
The ACE test assembly , as it was called , was never finished .
Work started in 1947 and after a few months Turing left to take a year ’s sabbatical at Kings College Cambridge .
Wilkinson took over control of the project and Turing never returned .
In late 1947 Darwin decided that the mathematicians did n't know enough engineering to build the ACE .
It was decided that the NPL Radio Division should become involved and the morale of the Mathematics Division collapsed .
At first the Radio Division was n't sure it wanted to be involved in the very odd design that Turing had invented but in August 1947 it was announced that a " pilot " ACE would be built .
The Pilot ACE was essentially an extension of the test machine but this time it was really going to be built .
The machine ran its first program in the May of 1950 .

Pickled Red Onions recipe
Pin 2 K 4 K Shares
I ’m a big fan of any recipe that uses minimal ingredients — but has maximum impact .
And I especially warm up to a recipe that ’s also easy to make .
And these tangy , sharp , and beautiful Pickled Red Onions fit that bill .
I recently made a fantastic red chile - cooked pork shoulder , similar to red chile braised beef and served these onions alongside , with some tortillas .
They have a stunning red color , which always surprises French guests .
Red onions are considered sort of a specialty in France and are four times the price of regular onions , so they ’re not used quite so often .
But if you live somewhere where onions prices are equivalent , revel in as many red onions as you can , and feel free to double or triple this recipe .
As Joni Mitchell sang , you do n’t know what you ’ve got ’til it ’s gone .
I do n’t think she was singing about onions , although these pickled ones are certainly something to sing about .
Pickled Red Onions Print Recipe Four servings Inspired by recipes at Ms. Glaze and Simply Recipes .
These onions make a over - the - top side dish and I serve them not just with Mexican food , but with barbequed meats and even chopped in potato salad .
Reserve any liquid and use it to add tang to cole slaw or chopped vegetable salad .
You can vary the seasonings .
I used allspice and bay leaves , and sometimes I add a few kernels of black pepper and cloves .
But cinnamon sticks and star anise would work , and I ’m thinking of experimenting with very thinly sliced cloves of garlic or carrots , for contrast .
3/4 cup ( 180 ml ) white vinegar 3 tablespoons ( 50g ) sugar pinch of salt 1 bay leaf 5 allspice berries 5 whole cloves a small , dried chile pepper 1 large red onion , peeled , and thinly sliced into rings 1 .
In a small , non-reactive saucepan , heat the vinegar , sugar , salt , seasonings and chile until boiling .
2 . Add the onion slices and lower heat , then simmer gently for 30 seconds .
3 . Remove from heat and let cool completely .
4 . Transfer the onions and the liquid into a jar then refrigerate until ready to use .
Storage :
The onions will keep for several months , but I find they ’re best the week they ’re made .

I am assuming you are either 1 .
Just out of college and eager to prove yourself by threatening a faceless person on the telephone , 2 .
A wannabe lawyer who is not smart enough to ever pass the BAR exam and therefore miserable in life , or 3 .
Someone who was picked on a lot in high school and believes this job is his calling to get revenge on all those bullies who made life a living hell .
Ours is definitely a missed connection , because after the first threatening phone call , I instructed our receptionist to screen all calls from you .
Sad , but where I work , as I informed you several times , I cannot continue to speak to you without raising my voice , and unfortunately I cannot tell you everything I really want to say , as I am in public and do not want my coworkers to hear the trash language I would use .
You see , debt collector , my bills have always been paid on time .
I am not a deadbeat , nor do I avoid paying my credit cards .
But when you have a bank like Bank of America , who gets $ 20 billion dollars of US tax payers money , then turns around and changes credit card interest rates from 10 % to 29.99 % with no explanation , increases the monthly minimum amount due from $ 150 to $ 675 and turns your account over to a bottom feeder collection agency after two months because their customer could only pay $ 300 each of those months , there is a problem .
And the problem does not lie with me .
Like millions of other Americans who work hard every single day and are struggling , I am not rolling around on a pile of bailout money .
I am not buying up other banks and then changing the credit card rules because I can .
I am not an executive of Bank of America who lives in a $ 4 million mansion and flies to exotic places on a private jet while millions of people lose their homes and their lives .
I am , in fact , a college - educated professional who is completely dumbfounded by the state of this country .
In fact , I bet the money you say I owe that I am more educated , smarter and make more money than you .
I simply do n't make enough to pay you the thousands of dollars you claim I owe you today " or else " .
By the way - those fees and surcharges totalling more than $ 2000 that you tacked on to my Bank of America account balance is not going to fly .
So here 's what I shall do to ensure that we are not just another missed connection .
The next time you call me at work , I will take you call .
I will also record the call , since it is illegal for you to continue calling at my place of employment once I have requested that you stop .
I will submit the tape to my attorney , along with my intent to sue you for harrassment , threats and stalking , along with emotional distress ( I had to have two glasses of wine to calm my nerves after your call ! )
And then I will sit back with my family , relax and know that eventually , this matter will be settled and behind me , and I will continue my life of love and laughter .
You , on the other hand , will still be at your dirty little desk , dressed in your dingy suit and tie , calling other " deadbeats " and lashing out at them because it makes your own pitiful little life seem less empty .
Maintaining a monarchy is costly , as Britain found out when a newly published account revealed that Queen Elizabeth II will be out of pocket by 2012 unless the government boosts funds for the Royal household for the first time in 20 years .
The total cost of keeping the monarchy increased by £ 1.5 million ( $ 2.5 million ) to £ 41.5 million pounds ( $ 69.23 million ) during the last financial year , according to royal accounts published on the UK monarchy 's official web site .
The Queen had to tap the reserve fund by £ 6 million to supplement the cost of running the Royal household , the accounts showed .
The Queen 's Civil List pays for things like staff salaries and has been frozen at an annual £ 7.9 million by the government nearly 10 years ago .
It is due to be open for renegotiation in 2010 .
Once £ 35 million , the reserve fund has now declined to £ 14 million and Buckingham Palace estimates it will have disappeared by the end of 2011 .
A senior household official told to the daily newspaper The Telegraph that on current spending , the Queen will be unable to balance the books in two years time .
" The Queen is naturally very thrifty , " the official told the newspaper .
But accounts show travel expenses for the Royal family rose to £ 6.5 million in the last financial year , while salaries amounted to £ 9.9 million , administration £ 1.5 million , housekeeping and furnishings £ 700,000 , £ 1.1 million was spent on catering and hospitality and £ 600,000 on garden parties .
The " flat - rate sex " promotions , which are based on all - you - can - eat restaurants , have been introduced by brothel owners in a bid to revive trade that has fallen around 30 per cent in the economic downturn .
Congress is teaching Energy Secretary Steven Chu a lesson in politics , as it gets ready to stuff $ 204 million for hydrogen fuel cell research down his throat , the Wall Street Journal reports .
When Chu took over , he slashed the budget for hydrogen , saying it would be 20 - 30 years before hydrogen cars were a reality .
Instead ,
Chu wants to focus on electric cars and plug ins .
Those are promising technologies ready today .
Well , the last administration had already set the wheels in motion for hydrogen research and development .
As such , the major automakers like GM , Ford ( F ) and Honda ( HMC ) all started working on hydrogen cars .
Slashing the funding hurts those companies .
It also hurts certain states , like New York , and North Dakota .
Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) calls fuel cells " an economic engine " for New York .
Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) , says the " Department made a significant mistake " cutting off funding .
Dorgan , the Journal reports has " steered millions of federal dollars over the past five years to the National Center for Hydrogen Technology at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks . "
Even though Steven Chu thinks hydrogen cells are a lost cause for now , the Senate will force the DOE to spend $ 204 million researching fuel cells .
It looks like it comes at the cost of something near to Chu 's heart .
The Secretary wants to create series of small labs across the country to study alternative energy .
His model is based on AT&T Bell Labs , where he did the work that led to his Nobel Prize .
To build those labs , Chu wanted $ 280 million .
Instead , he 's getting $ 35 million to build one lab , rather than eight like he hoped for .
A businessman has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after confronting a gang who were allegedly attacking his stepson in the family 's front garden .
A teenager was left with stab wounds after Colin Philpott , 58 , a company director , went to help his 25 - year - old stepson , Alex Lee , drive off teenagers said to have been vandalising his van .
After being released on bail following 18 hours in the cells , Philpott described how he awoke last Friday night on hearing noises in the front garden of his detached home in Crowthorne , near Wokingham , Berkshire .
He went to investigate and found Lee , his wife 's son , with a broken nose .
Philpott , who runs a business cleaning escalators , said : " My stepson was alerted to some youths outside , vandalising one of my vehicles .
He … asked them to stop and was attacked … when I appeared on the scene I was set upon as well , and as a result of that one of the youths received some stab injuries , which he had to get medical treatment for .
I asked my wife to call the police and ambulance , which she did . "
Philpott was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and later released on police bail until 25 September .
A 16 - year - old , who was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and assault , was taken to the Royal Berkshire hospital , where his injuries were described as not life threatening .
Three 17 - year - olds and another 16 - year - old were arrested on the same charge , and all were released on bail .
Philpott 's wife , Susanne , 51 , a training consultant , said her husband had rushed out to defend her son with a letter - opener .
" My son and I came out at about 11 pm after hearing a bang and we saw two young guys outside our house .
They returned 15 minutes later – with three others – and all were visibly drunk .
I took a digital camera and told them that if they vandalised anything else I 'd take pictures as evidence .
" One said that he would kill me and burn down my house .
I was terrified and when Alex tried to calm him down , the other four got worked up and attacked him .
Alex ended up on the ground with all five of them on him , kicking him in the head and stomach .
I was so frightened for him I screamed for Colin , who was in bed .
" He came running out – still barefoot and half asleep – and saw the mess Alex was in so ran back into the house .
He grabbed the first thing he saw , which was a letter - opener , and confronted the boys .
They attacked Colin and I saw one stumble into the road as Colin screamed for me to call the police . "
She said that when the police arrived they arrested her husband .
" It was heartbreaking to see him handcuffed and carted off … he is a hardworking , honest , family man and was only trying to protect us . "
She added that the neighbourhood had been blighted by teenagers attacking cars and gardens for several months .
Other residents said gangs of youngsters had ripped up flower beds , thrown eggs at them and thrown objects through open windows .
Neighbours had reported anti-social behaviour to the local council and a councillor is said to have asked Thames Valley police to take action .
Does just the thought of your annual gynecological exam make you cringe ?
You 're not alone .
While many women have no qualms about visiting the gynecologist , other women often experience fear and anxiety just thinking about that annual visit .
According to Marifran Mattson , an associate communications professor at Purdue University who studies health communications , " Many women suffer tremendous anxiety about their annual gynecological exam .
The anxiety is preventing women from receiving the best care possible , and many women who seek care regularly are not pleased with their visits . "
Mattson suggests that patient education is key to alleviating this anxiety , as it will help women feel less vulnerable , and inspire them to be " more confident in demanding that their individuality be respected and their input be considered . "
A survey , conducted in 2003 by Mattson and Maria Braun , an associate professor of communication studies at West Virginia University , showed that a high percentage of women between the ages of 18 and 71 have fears about the care they receive from their gynecologists .
They also expressed displeasure over how their gynecologists reacted to their anxiety .
The Sources of Women's Fear
Nearly two - thirds of the women surveyed expressed some degree of anxiety about the gender of their gynecologist .﻿﻿
Other reasons for fear given by the surveyed women include :
Feelings of discomfort
Embarrassment
Feelings of personal intrusion
Fear of finding a problem such as cancer ﻿ ﻿
The women , for the most part , did not communicate their feelings to their gynecologist , in most cases because they felt that doctors were " uncaring and patronizing . "
Women who did share their feelings said their gynecologists often laughed or told them to relax .
Women expressed that they want better communication with their doctors , but they often do not feel comfortable sharing their concerns .
" Physicians need to see women as people who experience real anxieties , " says Braun , " not just illnesses .
And patients need to start , or continue , being assertive when addressing such concerns with their gynecologists . "
She suggests they work on making eye contact and avoid being condescending .
She also suggests patients demand more time with their doctor to share their concerns and ask the questions about their health that worry them .
Is It Time to Find a New Gynecologist ?
What can you do if your gynecologist does n’t share your concerns , or if you are unable to express your personal fears and anxieties with them ?
First , decide whether you would feel more comfortable with a male or female doctor .
Then ask family and friends for recommendations .
Personal referrals are often one of the best ways to find a doctor who is willing to have an open line of communication with you .
If finding a gynecologist through personal referral is not possible , call several gynecology offices in your area and talk with the staff .
Ask if you can talk with the doctor 's nurse about the doctor 's communication style and patient philosophy .
The most important thing to remember is that you are not obligated to continue seeing a particular gynecologist if you are not comfortable .
Do n't be afraid to seek another doctor or to ask for second opinions when you are not comfortable with your gynecologist 's evaluation of your health .
Your comfort is something you cannot deny yourself !
It 's long been a mystery why sex become so hot back when life evolved beyond simple creatures that reproduced asexually by simply dividing in two .
Asexual creatures do not even need to find a partner .
While that might not sound like much fun , it certainly is efficient , working out to twice the reproductive capacity for a given number of organisms .
So why did pond scum eventually evolve to procreate as we know and love it ?
It might have all been a reaction to parasites , one theory holds .
See , the bad thing about reproduction sans sex is you make clones , and clones , and more clones .
Every organism has the same DNA , other than mutations that occur over time .
If a parasite figures out how to exploit a vulnerability , the entire species can be doomed .
But with good ol ' sex comes unique combinations of DNA and genetically unique individuals .
A parasite may kill many , but it 's likely that some organisms wo n't be vulnerable and the species will live on .
All this has been modeled before .
But the true test for any theory is what actually happens in nature .
So for 10 years , scientists studied Potamopyrgus antipodarum , a New Zealand freshwater snail that comes in a sexual and an asexual version .
They counted the snails and the number of parasite infections for each variety .
Clones that were plentiful at the beginning of the study became more susceptible to parasites over time .
As parasite infections increased , the once plentiful clones dwindled dramatically in number , the scientists write in the July issue of the journal American Naturalist .
Some clonal types disappeared entirely .
Meanwhile , sexual snail populations remained more stable over time .
This , the authors say , is exactly the pattern predicted by the parasite hypothesis .
" The rise and fall of these female - only lineages was surprisingly fast and consistent with the prediction of the parasite hypothesis for sex , " said study team member Jukka Jokela of the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology .
" These results suggest that sexual reproduction provides an evolutionary advantage in parasite rich environments . "
The results add to those of a study on yeast in 2005 found that a sexually reproducing strain did better at procreation than the asexual strain when they were all deprived of food .

BEIJING : About 30,000 Chinese steelworkers clashed with police in a protest over plans to merge their mill with another company , and they beat the company 's general manager to death , a human rights monitor said .
Several hundred people were injured in the clash on Friday in the north - eastern city of Tonghua , the Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Hong Kong said .
Employees of Tonghua Iron and Steel Group objected to plans for Jianlong Steel to take control of the company , the centre said .
It said Jianlong , whose headquarters are in Beijing , controlled the company temporarily last year , and employees blame Jianlong for financial problems suffered at the time .
Tonghua employees attacked Jianlong 's general manager , Chen Guojun , during the protest and beat him to death , the centre said .
Workers were angry that Mr Chen was paid about 3 million yuan ( $ 538,500 ) last year , while some retirees received as little as 200 yuan a month , the centre said .

“ As the first way out there was religion , which is implanted into every child by way of the traditional education - machine .
Thus I came — though the child of entirely irreligious ( Jewish ) parents — to a deep religiousness , which , however , reached an abrupt end at the age of twelve .
Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true .
The consequence was a positively fanatic orgy of freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies ; it was a crushing impression .
Mistrust of every kind of authority grew out of this experience , a skeptical attitude toward the convictions that were alive in any specific social environment - an attitude that has never again left me , even though , later on , it has been tempered by a better insight into the causal connections .
It is quite clear to me that the religious paradise of youth , which was thus lost , was a first attempt to free myself from the chains of the ‘ merely personal , ’ from an existence dominated by wishes , hopes , and primitive feelings .
Out yonder there was this huge world , which exists independently of us human beings and which stands before us like a great , eternal riddle , at least partially accessible to our inspection and thinking .
The contemplation of this world beckoned as a liberation , and I soon noticed that many a man whom I had learned to esteem and to admire had found inner freedom and security in its pursuit .
The mental grasp of this extra-personal world within the frame of our capabilities presented itself to my mind , half consciously , half unconsciously , as a supreme goal .
Similarly motivated men of the present and of the past , as well as the insights they had achieved , were the friends who could not be lost .
The road to this paradise was not as comfortable and alluring as the road to the religious paradise ; but it has shown itself reliable , and I have never regretted having chosen it . ”

Something for which people were willing to pay hundreds of dollars for a poor quality VHS copy .
And now , thanks to the magic of the internet , it 's available to all of us .
We 're talking about " Trader , " the 1987 PBS documentary about trader Paul Tudor Jones .
Jones famously objected to the documentary after its original airing , demanding that PBS stop airing it .
Of course , as Gawker points out , this only made everyone want to see what the fuss was about .
Gawker dug up the description of the film written on the back of the box that the VHS tape came packaged in :
Is financial trading an art , science , profession or out - and - out gamble ?
If you 're interested in money and you want to know what it 's really like on Wall Street , this is the video you , your family , your colleagues and your friends should own .
Filmed before Wall Street 's October 1987 crash , TRADER is a riviting one hour documentary of a fascinating man , Paul Tudor Jones II .
It delivers a rarely seen view of futures trading and explains the workings of this frantic , highly charged marketplace .
It gives viewers an inside look at his estate in Virginia , skiing in Gstaad , his New York apartment .
It also examines Jones ' prediction that America is nearing the end of a 200 - year bull market .
If he 's right – and he almost always is – this country and the world are about to experience economic changes of unprecedented proportions .
The entire film is now available , broken up into seven parts on YouTube .
You can watch the entire thing on the next seven slides .
PHUKET , Thailand 
The United States and North Korea fell into an acrimonious exchange on Thursday , with the North Korean government ridiculing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton as a “ schoolgirl ” and a “ pensioner , ” two days after she compared its leaders to unruly children .
At a meeting of Southeast Asian nations here , the war of words competed for attention with Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign to marshal worldwide pressure on the North Koreans to dismantle their nuclear weapons program .
On Thursday , the Foreign Ministry in North Korea issued a statement criticizing remarks Mrs. Clinton made this week to ABC News , in which she said the best response to North Korea ’s behavior would be to ignore it , as one would a child clamoring for attention .
“ We cannot but regard Mrs. Clinton as a funny lady , as she likes to utter such rhetoric , unaware of the elementary etiquette in the international community , ” the North Korean statement said .
“ Sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping . ”

The Emergency Unemployment Compensation ( EUC ) program began in June 30,2008 .
Benefits under the act have now been extended twice .
Unless Obama extends the program a third time , it 's the end of the line for many receiving unemployment benefits .
Please consider
First wave of jobless exhaust unemployment benefits .
Thousands of jobless Pennsylvanians are joining the growing ranks of people around the country who are exhausting unemployment benefits , as some experts worry about another blow to a stumbling economy .
Gov. Ed Rendell said 17,800 Pennsylvanians exhausted their jobless benefits in the week that ended Saturday , the first big wave of Pennsylvanians to do so .
He urged legislators to pass a bill to extend the benefits .
Around the country , the number of people exhausting their benefits is piling up .
By the end of September , more than 500,000 people will exhaust their benefits checks , with the biggest groups in Pennsylvania , California and Texas , according to estimates by the National Employment Law Project , an advocacy group for low - wage workers based in New York City .
That number will nearly triple by the end of the year , the group said .
New York Qualifies For Extended Benefits
The number of jobless New Yorkers across the state jumped significantly during the month of June , according to state Department of Labor statistics released Thursday .
The unemployment rate increased from 8.2 percent in May to 8.7 percent in June .
That 's the highest level since October of 1992 .
In New York City , the rate increased from nine percent in May to 9.5 percent in June -- the highest level in more than a decade .
That translates into more than 850,000 people out of work in the state .
" Because of our 8.7 percent unemployment rate , we will qualify for an additional seven weeks of unemployment insurance benefits , " said New York State Labor Commissioner M. Patricia Smith .
" So right now New Yorkers will be eligible for 79 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits . "
Unemployment benefit extensions are expected to help an additional 47,000 jobless New Yorkers who would have lost their benefits in August .
Continuing Claims + EUC Extended Benefits from 2000 - 2009
The original extension passed in July 2008 paid up to 13 weeks of additional benefits .
Effective November 23 , 2008 , we can pay up to 7 additional weeks of benefits .
Effective December 7 , 2008 , we can pay up to another 13 weeks of benefits .
Unemployment Insurance Exhaustion Rate
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the move in claims has nothing to do with any improvement in the economy .
I think this is all about the fact that with GM and Chrysler in bankruptcy and all the permanent shuttering of plants and workers , there are fewer of these employees left that go though the normal seasonal shutdowns .
So , fewer seasonal layoffs in the auto sector , I firmly believe , are behind these recent declines in initial jobless claims .
We will know if this thesis is correct in a few weeks .
( Also keep in mind that the shutdowns happened in June this year , not July , as is normal , and hence this is giving a skew downward to the claims data .
To reiterate , these numbers are telling us nothing about the economy . )
Claims dropped 47,000 to 522,000 in the July 11th week , on top of a 48,000 slide the week before — combined falloff of 95,000 .
At the same time , the non-seasonally adjusted data soared 108,000 over the past two weeks .
Go back to the same two weeks in 2008 and you will see that a similar decline in unadjusted claims ( - 115,000 ) translated into an 18,000 drop in the seasonally adjusted data .
So something with the seasonal factors is at play here ; not the economy .
Note that in the month after the seasonal auto effects ran their course last year , claims popped up more than 80,000 .
To be sure , continuing claims plunged a record 642,000 to a still - high 6.273 million but this actually reflected bad news in the sense that it likely reflects the end of the up - to - 20 weeks extended benefits that President Obama provided under the stimulus plan .
These people are certainly not going to be doing very much spending over the next little while .
Also note that the claims data would be much higher if a record number of unemployed folks were n’t seeing their benefits cut off — see the chart below for an illustration of what we are talking about .
Microsoft is having an especially bulky Patch Tuesday , with the release of ten updates - six of which will address critical flaws .
The June edition of the software giant 's Patch Tuesday update cycle will bring critical security fixes for flaws in IE , Windows ( two ) and Microsoft Office components ( three ) .
As usual there 's not much by way of detail just yet , aside from the warning that all six flaws create a means to inject hostile code onto vulnerable systems .
Four “ important ” updates address a quarter of lesser security vulnerabilities in various ( unspecified ) Windows components .
All supported versions of Windows are affected , although client systems are more at risk than those running Redmond 's Server software .
Vista is better protected against the Windows flaws than XP , for example , but it is still just as badly exposed to the IE vulnerabilities .
Most systems will need to be rebooted after the updates are applied .
More information ( but not much more ) can be found in Microsoft 's alert here . ®
" What is reality ?
" Reality is that which , when you stop believing in it , does n't go away . "
What is real ?
.
" all reality must indeed be a mind , "
or an object of thought in a mind . "
" In Heraclitus it is difficult to tell how far the designs in God 's mind are distinguished from the execution in the world , or indeed how far God 's mind is distinguished from the world . "
The kosmos is not as it appears to be , and what it probably is , at its deepest level , is exactly that which the human being is at his deepest level — call it mind or soul , it is something unitary which lives and thinks , and only appears to be plural and material .
Much of this view reaches us through the Logos doctrine regarding Christ .
The Logos was both that which thought , and the thing which it thought : thinker and thought together .
The universe , then , is thinker and thought , and since we are part of it , we as humans are , in the final analysis , thoughts of and thinkers of those thoughts .
Modern Gothic as a term fits a lot of artwork around right now .
Young critics are keen on it , magazines are featuring it , and galleries are showing it .
When certain things become visible they become visible all at once .
It was that way with Magic realism , Visionary , Neo-surrealism painting , and Neo-romanticism art .
The contemporary Gothic revival is less a movement than a trend .
Many dark landscapes of Goth , Black Metal , Cyber Punk , and Surrealism deal with gothic art attributes such as mystery , horror , ghostly shadows , unease , and religious - themed terror .
They might be described as " gloomy , " " grotesque , " " sinister , " " mysterious , " " unnatural creatures , " " ancient fears , " " underground rituals , " " esthetic death , " " the imminent terror " .
You may ask why Gothic now ?
First , we have to remember that the Gothic has never really left , another replaced one hell , but the artistic imagination has been filling the void .
In the art gallery 's world , fear and confusion have brought a return of the metaphysical .
There 's been a shift from the big picture to the little one , from the cultural to sub cultural , the outer world to the inner one .
Cults are more absorbing to artists than society ; optimism has turned into skepticism .
Artists are using images and symbols in ways that attempt to short - circuit the sense that things are controlled from outside or underworld .
The Goth art has always had a conflicting relationship to authority .
In the Gothic , the hero and the villain resemble one another ; the evil can be redeemed .
Therefore , fluid definitions of sexuality , self and subject matter are typical .
This keeps the Gothic art pictures more elusive , deluded and stylish .
Punk and Goth culture in here too , although it was mostly amateur .
Still , we 're talking about Dungeons and Dragons , Doom and Gloom , teenage angst , masculine overdrive and the Cure .
Modern Gothic is many things , some of them extremely promising .
However , most art pictures that are primarily Gothic have been dilettante .
Many of them are prosaic , banal , nostalgic , and openly shallow .
Without a doubt , any art that is essentially one thing is in danger of becoming repetitive .
Forms stagnate ; discounted thrills and cliché prevail ; compelling symbols and ridicule horror are readily embraced .
The best Modern Gothic art is way more than historical Gothic itself , and that 's what makes it worth looking at right now .

Members of Congress probing threats to the global financial system — especially the threat of concentration of risk — will have a lot to ponder in newly mandated disclosures highlighted by a Fitch Ratings report issued last week .
While derivatives use among U.S. companies is widespread , an “ overwhelming majority of the exposure is concentrated among financial institutions , ” according to the rating agency ’s review of first - quarter financials .
Concentrated , in fact , among a mere handful of financial - services giants .
About 80 % of the derivative assets and liabilities carried on the balance sheets of 100 companies reviewed by Fitch were held by five banks : JP Morgan Chase , Bank of America , Goldman Sachs , Citigroup , and Morgan Stanley .
Those five banks also account for more than 96 % of the companies ’ exposure to credit derivatives .
About 52 % of the companies reviewed disclosed there were credit - risk - related contingent features in their derivative positions .
Such features require a company to post collateral or settle outstanding derivative liabilities if there ’s a downgrade of the company ’s credit rating .
The Fitch analysts also found that just 22 companies disclosed the use of equity derivatives .
Just six nonfinancial firms — IBM , General Motors , Verizon , Comcast , Textron , and PG&E — reported exposure to share - based derivatives .
For the report , the rating agency reviewed first - quarter 2009 filings of the companies , which come from a range of industries and represent almost $ 6.4 trillion in aggregate outstanding debt .
The companies also recorded a total notional amount of derivative positions of more than $ 296 trillion .
Unlike the financial firms , which both use derivatives and issue them for profit , nonfinancial companies seem mostly to use derivatives just to hedge specific risks , according to Fitch .
While “ derivatives trading by utilities and energy companies appear to be very limited , ” for instance , “ most of the companies reviewed in both industries report the use of derivatives for hedging commodity risks , ” the report found .
The first - quarter 2009 financial reports marked the first time comprehensive derivatives disclosure was mandated for all U.S. companies .
“ The need for better disclosure on derivatives has been obvious since the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 133 , Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , ” according to the Fitch report .
But comprehensive disclosure of derivatives was n’t part of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for most companies until March , when the Financial Accounting Standards Board implemented SFAS 161 , Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities .
The latter standard is an attempt to simplify hedge accounting , perhaps the most notorious example of the complexity of U.S. financial reporting .
More than 800 pages of rulemaking and guidance were needed to make sense of SFAS 133 .
For its part , SFAS requires companies to improve their disclosures about how they account for and use derivatives , and how derivatives affect their balance sheets , income statements , and cash - flow statement .
“ The new derivative disclosures are a welcome addition for analysts and investors , and they bring much - needed transparency to financial reporting , ” says Olu Sonola , a Fitch Ratings director .
“ The disclosures reveal plenty , but careful analysis and additional scrutiny must be applied . ”
In particular , users of financial statements need added information about the sensitivity of companies ’ derivative valuations to major assumptions , according to the ratings agency .
Since risk analysts often base their derivative valuations on quantitative models , changes in significant valuation assumptions are particularly important , says Fitch .
The firm ’s analysts reported that perhaps “ the most surprising information coming from our review of energy companies ” was that Exxon Mobil — the biggest U.S. energy company — had no derivative exposure at the end of the first quarter .
Instead , the company appears to rely on what ’s called natural hedges — countervailing trends within the corporation itself — to manage potential risks .
The report cited Exxon ’s 2008 10-K :
“ The corporation ’s size , strong capital structure , geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the upstream , downstream and chemical businesses reduce the corporation ’s enterprise - wide risk from changes in interest rates , currency rates and commodity prices .
As a result , the corporation makes limited use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of such changes .
The corporation does not engage in speculative derivative activities or derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with leveraged features . ”
As a connoisseur of kimchi , South Korea ’s national dish , Kim Soon - ja takes a package of the fermented cabbage everywhere -- even overseas .
But there has always been one indelicate matter : how to mask the garlicky and often offensively pungent odor .
“ My tour guide asked me not to take out my kimchi in public because it can be distasteful to foreigners , ” Kim , 56 , says of a trip to Europe several years ago .
Instead of being insulted , Kim went to work on a novel culinary concept that in this country was about as revolutionary as the seedless watermelon :
She wanted to take the funky odor out of her beloved kimchi , which ranks among odoriferous global foods such as Limburger cheese and China ’s “ stinky tofu . ”
Advertisement
The ambitious curly - haired woman had already been named by the South Korean Food Ministry in 2007 as the nation ’s first kimchi master , a designation that honors her mastery of the dish .
Working with a team of food experts , she set to work to come up with a new type of freeze - dried pickled cabbage that does n’t smell even after water is added , appealing to both foreigners and the fussiest Korean eaters .
Kim says she is the first to create freeze - dried kimchi and has secured a patent .
“ When it soaks in water either hot or cold for a few minutes , it will become just like ordinary kimchi , ” says Kim , the owner of Han Sung Food in suburban Seoul .
Koreans are crazy about kimchi , the ubiquitous dish that is served with every meal and is available as both entree and appetizer .
There are kimchi pancakes , soup and fried rice .
Even Western restaurants here offer the dish .
And there ’s a kimchi museum in Seoul .
Advertisement
As kimchi folklore goes , Koreans began eating the pickled dish about 1,300 years ago .
Making kimchi is often a family affair : Parents and children pickle the Chinese cabbage harvested in the fall so it will last year - round .
Most South Korean households have a special kimchi refrigerator to keep the odor from contaminating other foods .
Yet in a nation that has set a goal of establishing its cuisine as among the world ’s five most popular by 2017 , kimchi’s odor has always been a stumbling block .
According to a survey by the Seoul - based Corea Image Communication Institute , the unique smell of Korean food is the biggest barrier to globalizing the cuisine .
Even in South Korea there ’s a social no - no known as kimchi breath -- the whiff of cabbage seasoned and fermented in chili , garlic and ginger that can send listeners reaching for their handkerchiefs .
Kim , who has run her own kimchi factory since 1986 , is n’t stopping with freeze - dried cabbage .
She says the concept can be used in beer and wine , and for making such snacks as dried kimchi dipped in chocolate .

“ Crispy but yummy ! ” she says .
“ Also , it ’s full of fiber . ”
But not everyone here is convinced that less stinky means better .
Food critics suggest that the pungent smell is a fascinating part of the blood - red dish .
“ Some people who like freshness could dislike ” dried kimchi , says Cho Jae-sun , a food science professor at Kyung Hee University .
The dish , an acquired taste , is n’t the same without its telltale aroma , Cho says .
Kim shrugs off such doubters and says she has already taken one order from Japan , even though her product has yet to go into mass production .

Twists on kimchi have come -- and gone -- in South Korea .
There was the kimchi burger and kimchi risotto , both now footnotes in the history of the nation ’s cuisine .
Kim hopes that her new odorless kimchi will create more global fans of the food .
She ’s ready to start her campaign but manages to stop long enough to have her picture taken .
She smiles and , as the camera flashes , utters her favorite word in the Korean language .
“ Kimchi , ” she says .

Everyone predicted Microsoft Corp. would n’t take long to fire back against Google Inc. 's latest foray into its home turf .
It took less than a week .
On Monday , Microsoft said it would offer a free version of its popular Office software suite that would run on the Internet .
The Redmond , Wash. , company did n’t mention its archrival by name , but analysts saw Monday ’s move as a strategy by Microsoft to protect one of its most profitable businesses against Google , which already dominates the Internet search market .
Advertisement
The Web - based version of the Office suite will be available next year .
“ Microsoft was forced to provide a free product ” as an answer to Google Docs , a suite of free , browser - based document and spreadsheet editing software , said Sheri McLeish , an analyst with Forrester Research .
“ It ’s a very competitive market out there , and this was Microsoft ’s opportunity to one - up Google by offering a much better product . ”
The announcement , made at Microsoft ’s developers conference in New Orleans , is the latest tit - for - tat in an intense competition between the two technology giants .
The Mountain View , Calif. , search giant said last week that it would develop an operating system designed to attract users away from personal computers , where Microsoft is ubiquitous .
Google ’s Chrome OS and software would run on the Internet , where Google has a commanding share of the Web audience .
Advertisement
Last month Microsoft released Bing , its answer to Google ’s popular search engine .
By giving away versions of its Office software , Microsoft risks cannibalizing one of its most profitable products .
The company ’s business software division , which includes Office , made $ 9.3 billion in profit from $ 14.3 billion in sales during the first three quarters of its 2009 fiscal year .
The unit also has revenue from other software applications and services such as Microsoft Exchange , but the bulk of its sales comes from Office , which includes the Word and Excel applications .
About 80 % of companies recently surveyed by Forrester use Microsoft ’s Office .
Less than 8 % use other document editing software , including IBM Corp .'s Lotus Symphony , Sun Microsystems Inc.'s StarOffice and Google Docs .
For Microsoft , the imperative is to maintain its dominance , according to Melissa Webster , an analyst with IDC .
She said a recent survey found that nearly everyone who used Web - based document editing software such as Google Docs also used Microsoft Office .
Advertisement
Many , for example , create a document using Excel , then upload it to the Web to share with colleagues , who may read and edit the spreadsheet using a Web - based program such as Zoho Sheet or Google Docs .
“ Web - based tools are not taking share away from Microsoft ’s desktop Office suite , ” Webster said .
“ But to the extent that these products are complementary , Microsoft needs to get in the game .
They risk losing users as people get more comfortable using Web - based tools .
And they risk losing their edge . ”
Microsoft ’s group product manager for Office , Chris Bryant , said its customers were increasingly using the Web to share and edit documents .
“ It ’s something our users have said they ’d like , ” Bryant said .
“ Customers are telling us they expect to use the Web - based applications as companions to their desktop software . ”
Advertisement
Bryant declined to outline how Microsoft would make money with the move , but hinted that business models could include advertising and fees for premium services such as online storage of large files .
The free versions wo n’t include all the features of the desktop software , priced between $ 70 for a basic student version and about $ 350 for the professional version .
For the upcoming software suite Office 2010 , Microsoft plans to let users edit video in PowerPoint and manipulate images in Word -- features that would be unavailable in the free versions .
Investors did n’t appear to be concerned about Microsoft ’s proposed giveaway .
On Monday its shares gained 84 cents , or 3.7 % , to close at $ 23.23 .

Eine Geschichte wie im Disney - Film : Die zwei unzertrennlichen Border Collies Bonnie und Clyde streunten bei strömendem Regen durch die Felder und Wiesen , bis sie an einer Landstraße von Mitarbeitern des Hunderettungszentrums aufgegriffen wurden .
Die Tierretter wussten zunächst nicht , warum der eine Hund immer dem anderen folgt .
Eine Mitarbeiterin fand schließlich heraus , dass Bonnie seinen blinden Freund Clyde führt , der wegen einer Degenerationskrankheit sein Augenlicht verlor .
„ Wenn Clyde sich unsicher ist , wo er ist , tastet er sich auf einmal hinter Bonnie und legt seine Schnauze auf ihren Rücken , so dass sie ihn führen kann “ , sagte Hunderetterin Cherie Cootes dem Sender BBC .
Im Beisein der Fernsehkamera zog Clyde verängstigt seinen Schwanz ein und lief schützend auf die andere Seite von Bonnie .
„ Er vertraut ihr völlig “ , sagte Cootes .
Deshalb müsse für das ungewöhnliche Duo ein gemeinsames Zuhause gefunden werden .
Clyde sei etwa fünf Jahre alt , Bonnie zwei oder drei .
Woher sie kommen , ist unklar .
Sie trugen keine Hundemarke , als sie gefunden wurden .
Die Collies könnten ohne einander nicht leben , sagte Cootes .
„ Wenn sie läuft , neigt sie zum Anhalten , um sicher zu gehen , dass er bei ihr ist – sie hält nach ihm Ausschau .
Wenn sie dabei ist , merkt keiner , dass er blind ist , aber wenn sie weg ist , weigert er sich zu gehen . “

Frequently Asked Questions
This is absolutely right , and I think it's why Obama was right to say that he wanted to nominate a justice who is not just " dedicated to the rule of law , who honors our constitutional traditions , who respects the integrity of the judicial process and the appropriate limits of the judicial role " , but who has the " quality of empathy , of understanding and identifying with people 's hopes and struggles " .
This is not opposed to caring about getting the law right ; it 's about understanding what is at stake in various cases well enough to see how the law , as it is written , actually applies .
" The nature of the Supreme Court is that a great many of its most important cases concern the rights of women and various kinds of minority groups .
It ’s absurd to think that a forum of nine white , male , heterosexual Christians could possibly compose the best possible forum for deciding these kinds of issues .
The reality is that a nine - person group can’t possibly fully represent the diversity -- in terms of religion , sexual orientation , ethnicity , gender , etc. -- that exists in the country at large .
But one can do better or worse on this regard and it makes perfect sense to aspire to do better .
That ’s not an alternative to caring about the quality of the jurisprudence , it ’s part of trying to get good jurisprudence . "
" I oppose using a person 's sexual orientation as a job qualification for the same reasons that I oppose the privileging of a candidate based upon their race or sex :
It boils individuals down to their immutable traits .
The only aspect that Obama should consider as he weighs his options over the next few days is the candidates ' jurisprudence . "
Bowers was a case in which Matthew Hardwick , who had been arrested for engaging in consensual homosexual sex in his own home , challenged the Georgia sodomy statute under which he had been charged .
One of the crucial questions on which the case turned was : are sexual activities between consenting adults , carried out in their own homes , protected under either the ninth or the fourteenth amendments ?
Is the right to decide which consenting adult to have sex with , and how , one of those fundamental interests that we take the ninth and fourteenth amendments to protect , or is it not ?
or just a right to engage in homosexual sodomy , as the majority claimed " the fundamental interest all individuals have in controlling the nature of their intimate associations with others " , Given previous cases involving the right to privacy , it was crucial to decide whether such acts involved what Justice Blackmun , in his dissent , called
2 , The Constitution does not confer a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy . "
In their arguments ( 1 3 ) , the majority discussed only gay sex , even though the Georgia statute also criminalized heterosexual sodomy .
They also described their findings in terms of their application to homosexuals , saying things like : "
One might therefore ask : did the various Justices have any clear conception of the importance , to gay men and lesbians , of being able to have sex with the people they love ?
One might think that anyone would understand that , but that is only true if one accepts the idea that gay men and lesbians are people , rather than members of some strange alien species .
So : how did the Justices think about gay men and lesbians ?
Here 's some evidence from Jeffrey Toobin's The Nine , pp. 218-219 ( note that Justice Powell was the swing vote in this case , and came down in favor of upholding Georgia 's sodomy statute ) :
" One Saturday in the spring of 1986 , Justice Lewis Powell struck up a conversation with one of his law clerks , Cabell Chinnis Jr. , about Bowers v. Hardwick .
As Chinnis recounted the exchange to Joyce Murdoch and Deb Price , authors of a history of gay rights at the Supreme Court , Powell asked about the prevalence of homosexuality , which one friend - of - the - court brief estimated at 10 % .
Chinnis said that sounded right to him .
" I do n't believe I 've ever met a homosexual " , Powell replied .
Chinnis said that seemed unlikely .
Later the same day , Powell came back to Chinnis and asked , " Why do n't homosexuals have sex with women ? " " Justice Powell , " he replied , " a gay man can not have an erection to perform intercourse with a woman . "
The conversation was especially bizarre not just because of its explicit nature but because Chinnis himself was gay ( as were several of Powell 's previous law clerks . ) "
You have to feel for the poor clerk : there he is , a closeted gay man , being quizzed by his boss about why homosexuals do n't have sex with women .
( Apparently , Justice Powell was n't thinking of lesbians at all . )
I think that a good working definition of empathy would be : that quality that allows a straight man or woman to know the answer to that question without having to ask his or her law clerks .
And I would think that the fact that Justice Powell had to ask that question might explain why he believed , falsely , that he had never met a homosexual : if you were gay , would you tell him ?
Justice Powell was , as I said , the swing vote in a case that upheld criminalizing consensual gay sex carried out in the privacy of one 's own home .
It seems pretty clear that he had no conception of what it was like to be gay , and was therefore in no position to decide on the importance of the rights that he was deciding on .
That is not a good way to interpret the law when , as in this case , the importance of a right is central to the question whether or not it is protected .
Consider how different things might have been had there been an openly gay man or woman on the Supreme Court , one who might have explained his or her take on this to Justice Powell .
I do not believe that we ought to try to represent every group in existence on the Supreme Court .
Most importantly , representation obviously matters less than things like wisdom , devotion to the law and to its faithful interpretation , depth of understanding , and so forth .
For another , there are only nine justices , and many more groups whom it would , other things equal , be good to represent .
( This is one reason why empathy matters : it 's obviously impossible to represent everyone , so there 's no substitute for Justices being able to understand the impact of their decisions on people unlike themselves . )
And the groups people normally think of are not all the relevant ones : in terms of understanding the importance of laws to those they affect , I think that Sonia Sotomayer 's having grown up in the projects is as important as the fact that Kathleen Sullivan and Pam Karlan are openly gay .
( Side note : some conservatives seem to think that empathy necessarily favors criminals .
I do n't think this is true at all .
Growing up in the projects might give someone a particularly clear understanding of just how much damage crime does to inner city communities .
I think that it 's the understanding that matters , not which side it turns out to favor in a given case . )
From Tianya :
China ’s Most Niu “ Street - Front Building ” , Definitely Will Shock You !
In Henan Province Luanchuan County Jiahe Town , this building is very conspicuous .
Right next to a public road , it it looks like a small two - story building at a glance , with freshly painted white walls , but you would n’t know that this building is actually only about 1.5 meters deep , built to comply with the “ new rural development ” of building new houses by peasants / farmers who do not actually have the money to build “ real buildings ” so they can only do this .
When the superiors / leadership come to inspect , they only look from their car , so how could they know that behind the resplendent wall are old and run-down adobe houses .
In the town , all adobe or brick houses near the street must be painted white , even the outhouse / latrine must be made white , so that the entire county ’s situation appears to be good .

Incredible , too incredible , whose idea ???

Fuck , the leadership are this wise and far - sighted now , making things look like the real thing .

It can be said that this kind of surface / image project can be found anywhere , including the Jiangsu developed area .
As long as it is a second - class highway or above , every rural building on both sides of the road must have their road - facing walls painted , either white or light blue color .
However , just this side is painted , while the remaining three are ignored , and for who to see ?
For the leaders passing by on the road to see .

Impressive !
Chinese people are still pretty wise and far - sighted !

Very characteristic , strongly suggest making this a historic building to be preserved for the education of the next generation !

I wonder how much money this kind of building has wasted for our rural / farmer / peasant brothers !
Heartache !
I wonder which brilliant leader thought of this method !

There are many places like this , there is nothing to be surprised about .
I wonder if the leadership / government knows or does n’t know ???
No matter what , the ordinary common people all know !!!
Comments from NetEase :
hui367012530 :
Only China ’s government officials can do this kind of niu thing !!!
77fly :
The ordinary commoners do not have this kind of IQ or ideas .
The people with the intelligence to do these kind of things must at least be those geniuses who have at least lived off the government ’s money for 5 years .
abclaoyuzhen :
Many Beijing buildings along streets also did a lot of “ face ” construction projects .
These buildings will soon collapse and long ago should have been torn down , yet they all spent a lot of money to repaint them .
This kind of expenditure is really so wasteful , and my heart aches just seeing them .
It would have been better to get together and steadily do some really useful things .
wtj711022 :
This kind of thing happening in Henan is very normal .
If it did not happen , then it would actually be abnormal .
占飞 :
Was the majority of this house carved up by the previous government official who came to inspect ?
[ meaning the previous government official already stole most of this house / people ’s money ]
kingyeming :
Whether you are an official or an ordinary commoner , you should reflect .
Officials want face , but this is taxpayers ’ money .
The ordinary common people should have reported this [ waste of money ] .
lzb94121 :
How much better it would be if China ’s officials put this kind of ingenuity on proper things !
This post must be reposted more !!!
Let everyone get to know these people ’s bad characters !

" We contacted Five Boro Mold to inspect our home .
We had no idea that the cause of our water problem in the basement was a result of poor gutters & drain spouts .
They also pointed out that our sprinkler heads were too close to the foundation of the home and that when the sprinklers turned on , it caused excessive water to seep around the foundation and into the basement .
After we fixed the gutters , extended the drain spouts and aimed the sprinkler heads away from the foundation , the water problem in the basement was repaired . "

( CNN ) --
A cash - strapped Olympic hopeful in New Zealand says he has been forced to open a brothel to fund his bid for taekwondo glory in 2012 , but officials say his entry into the sex trade could mean his exit from international sport .
Logan Campbell represented his country in the Beijing 2008 Olympics .
Logan Campbell , who represented his country in Beijing last year , says without the financial injection from his " gentlemen 's club " he will be unable to continue his intensive training for the London Games .
" There is no point me going to the Olympics to make up the numbers if I go I want to be a medal contender , " Campbell told the local TVNZ network .
The 23 - year - old , who finished in the top 16 in Beijing after losing his first match , says he needs to raise $ 190,000 over the next two years .
But his brothel business has upset his sport 's national governing body , which says it could hurt his chances of competing .
Sound off :
Do you think a brothel owner should be allowed to compete in the Olympics ?
" It may be unlikely that he will be selected because of his involvement , " Taekwondo New Zealand 's Secretary General Matt Ransom said .
Campbell insists he should be entitled to compete as his Auckland business does not violate New Zealand liberal laws on prostitution .
Watch Campbell defend his brothel »
" This is perfectly legal , so I do not see why I would wreck my chances , " he said , adding that if people had other ideas how to raise the cash , he would be willing to consider them .
A lawyer for Goldman Sachs has been accused of luring an underage teenager with explicit internet chat and then trying to consummate the cyber - affair by traveling to Westchester .
Todd Genger , was caught in a sting operation aimed at perverts who solicit young girls for sex , the Daily News reports .
From the Daily News :
In reality , the " girl " Genger was chasing was an undercover investigator posing as a teen in the chat room , the Westchester County district attorney 's office said .
Genger , a Manhattan resident who is married and has three children , was snared after a series of Internet conversations that began April 13 and ended Monday , officials said .
The investigator was posing as a 15 - year - old and made it clear " she " was underage , said Lucien Chalfen , a spokesman for the district attorney .
Genger was charged with atttempting to disseminate indecent material to a minor .
He 's been released on his own recognizance pending an August 11 court date .
WASHINGTON -- Vice President Joe Biden said the Obama administration " misread how bad the economy was " and did n't foresee unemployment levels nearing double digits , in comments likely to intensify calls for the administration to do more to counter job losses .
Some economists are pressing the White House to enact a second round of stimulus spending or find some other way to avert a prolonged job and wage slump .
But the White House is in a tough spot .
Officials want to give the $ 787 billion stimulus package passed in February time to work -- only 10 % of the spending is out the door so far -- and there is little appetite in Congress , particularly among Republicans , for spending more money at a time of record deficits .
The gloomy job picture threatens any economic recovery .
The unemployment rate hit 9.5 % last month , figures released last week show , and many now expect it to stay high for a long time , eventually reaching double digits .
At the same time , wage growth is slumping .
People facing unemployment or wage cuts are less able or willing to spend the money needed to stimulate the economy .
Already , job losses are hindering recovery in the housing market as foreclosures among people with good credit who have been laid off compound the problems with risky mortgages that triggered the sector 's implosion .
" They 're in a bind because the recovery package is just starting to generate positive benefits but , to the extent we know something about the future , unemployment is too high and is going to stay high for a long period , " said Lawrence Mishel , president of the Economic Policy Institute , a left - leaning Washington think tank .
" When we hit 10 % unemployment , which we will within months ... even those who do n't lose a job will be affected by the squeeze on wage growth , furloughs and the cutbacks in [ retirement ] plans , " he said .
The Obama administration ’s plan to increase the powers of the Federal Reserve , says one critic , is like giving a teenager “ a bigger , faster car right after he crashed the family station wagon . ”
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner disagrees .
He argues that the Fed is “ best positioned ” to oversee key financial companies , and that the Obama plan would give the Fed only “ modest additional authority . ”
Mr. Geithner is right about one thing :
The Fed ’s power is already vast .
But it was n’t even well - positioned to supervise the likes ...

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to talk to the cops while you 're tripping ?
Have you considered what it would be like to be abruptly interrupted while minding your own business in the middle of an intense trip by a lengthy police interrogation ?
Terrifying is n't it ?
I 've been there , read on .
The night began around 8:30 pm , with the ingestion of the hit of blotter acid and about 2 grams of mushrooms .
I had just finished smoking a blunt and my stomach was nearly empty , so the trip began in about 20 - 30 minutes .
My companion for the night had eaten about the same amount of mushrooms , but no acid .
I had never combined LSD and mushrooms , so I did n't quite know what to expect of this trip .
We began by watching TV , waiting to come up and trying to subtly urge my roommate and a few mutual non-tripping friends to leave the room so the trip could really begin .
I find it quite uncomfortable to trip around those who are n't .
Even though they are relatively experienced psychedelic drug users I just feel awkward , inappropriate and just plain goofy around non-trippers .
They were in the process of getting drunk , and thus they were glad to leave us be and go play pool or something .
I 'd like to note that one of the friends , who I 'll call Steve , left about eight beers in our fridge .
Remaining alone with another tripper , in retrospect , was perhaps not the best of ideas .
However , at this point in time I was starting to trip pretty hard , and the combination of effects from the two hallucinogens was interesting and strange .
The visuals were less intense than usual but much more detailed and intricate than any I had ever experienced before , the walls of my room seemed to be an intricate lattice of colors and figures that extended miles beyond my sight .
The universe seemed to break down into thoughts and ideas rather than objects and processes , I pondered to what extent reality was merely an artificially constructed set of ideas and perceptions rather than a physical , solid , definable universe .
After spinning glowsticks and listening to music at a high volume for an hour or so , I had another friend of mine roll a joint on my desk and the three of us went on a drive to smoke .
The marijuana enhanced the visuals greatly , as has always been the case when I trip and smoke .
Big mistake # 1 was a few stems and seeds left on my desk , and the bag of pot left in the drawer .
Being outside , away from the music and glowsticks and confinement of the dorm room took the trip in a new direction .
I became grounded in reality to an extent .
I could envision the entire universe as an enormous self - perpetuating machine , in which every bit of matter played an intricate role in the greater workings of our existence .
I pondered the extent to which I could control my place in the machine , and the extent to which the machine would control me .
Little did I know , at this point , the extent to which I would get stuck and nearly caught in that machine .
We arrived back at the dorm building and went back into the room after socializing with a few people in the pool room downstairs .
I was feeling a bit more social now , but I did n't stay for long .
We smelled strongly of marijuana , but that was nothing that normally concerned me .
I 'll call this big mistake # 2 .
Once back in the room I started to spin glowsticks again and we turned the music back on .
The music was at a fairly high volume , but nothing that would normally cause any trouble in the building .
Everything seemed to be going great at this point .
I was having an intense , thoughtful , fulfilling and unusual trip with no concerns to keep me from really enjoying myself .
This is exactly the point where everything goes wrong .
Two of the building RA 's opened my door while I was spinning , and at first I did n't have any idea what was going on .
There was a male RA and a female RA .
They told me that my music was too loud , and they walked in and immediately spotted an empty beer bottle .
They told me they would have to search the room and that I should go ahead and get rid of any other alcohol .
We complied and emptied out all of Steve 's beer in the bathroom , and at this point they spotted the stems and seeds on the desk .
They told us we smelled strongly of marijuana , and accused us of drinking and smoking in our room .
We told them we had n't been drinking and they believed us immediately , we obviously did n't look drunk .
The male RA stayed upstairs and told us the cops were already on their way , while the female RA went downstairs and called the cops .
I still did n't comprehend the seriousness of the situation at this point , I was very confused as to exactly what was happening .
The male RA tried to gather up the tiny amount of stems and seeds , but without either of us noticing it my co-tripper had thrown them behind the desk .
He took one of my paper towels and asked me to sweep them up and hand them to him .
Much to my own confusion , I swept up mostly dust and a few very tiny green particles .
I was under the impression that he had already picked up the stems and seeds that he had seen .
He took us out into the floor lobby , and while we waited for the elevator my co-tripper said he had to use the restroom .
Unbeknownst to me , he stashed his glass pipe on top of a ceiling tile above the toilet .
While the RA followed him into the bathroom , I went back into the room and grabbed the bag of pot .
They had already told us that they would be searching the room , and no consent was needed because it 's university property .
I stuffed it into my pocket and came back out , where the RA decided that we 'll take the stairs .
Walking down six flights of steps gave me a moment to collect myself and finally comprehend the seriousness of the situation .
I tried to clear my head as much as possible , and assess what I needed to do to .
My mind seemed to instantly sharpen , my basic survival instincts kicked in .
We arrived downstairs and the RA told me to sit in the RD 's office and wait for the police officers .
I told him that I needed to use the restroom , with the intention of flushing the pot down the toilet .
However when I got into the bathroom , I encountered a good friend of mine taking a piss .
My mind seemed to work instantaneously , I shoved the pot in his pocket and pulled my car key off of my key ring .
I whispered to him , ' Put this in my car , I 'll explain later . '
Just as he walked out of the bathroom , the RA poked his head in the door and told me not to flush the toilet .
I probably would have already flushed it by then , but the closeness of the situation made my heart start to pound .
It should be noted , at this point , that I was fully aware that none of them had any idea that I was tripping .
Though I 'm sure my pupils were the size of flying saucers , they had no idea what state of mind I was in .
I sat down on the bench - seat facing the RD 's desk next to my co-tripper , and the cops entered .
This was one of the most intense moments I have ever experienced .
The cops were assholes , trying to accuse us of this , that , and the other .
They told us condescendingly that they were getting high just smelling us .
We told them that we had n't been smoking , but rather we had just been in the car with some friends .
It was quite obvious to all four of us that we were lying , but I managed to stay on top of the cops ' mind - games .
We kept our story straight , made up some names of the people who were actually smoking pot in the car .
They were some old friends from high school , we did n't know their phone numbers , addresses , etc .
He told us to empty our pockets but did not pat us down or search us .
He kept insisting that they would n't leave without locking somebody up , giving me the impression that I could go to jail at any moment .
I did not allow myself to be overrun with this fear , but it was terrifying nonetheless .
I thought , at that point , that the cops had a few stems and seeds in their posession .
I had no idea what was going to happen , I had no idea what they could do to me for stems and seeds .
It eventually became apparent to me , as much as the officer tried to suggest otherwise , that they were n't interested in my stems and seeds .
They wanted a bust , and we were n't going to give them what they wanted .
They tried to talk circles around us , mix us up , catch us for anything so they could go back to the station with a couple of freshly - cuffed stoners .
The whole ordeal seemed to stretch out for hours , but we were really only in the room for about 30 minutes .
Everything said to us seemed preconcieved and phony , it was all just a big show being put on for us by these assholes whose salaries are paid for by my taxes .
I instantaneously analyzed everything the officer said to me , carefully trying to determine the motives behind questions and reading between the lines .
By the end of the interrogation I felt as though I could predict what the officer was going to say to me , based on my perception of his motives and my internal analysis of what he had already said to me .
Finally , they gave up on us .
' You 're free to go , ' he said so nonchalantly .
I went outside and smoked a few cigarettes , still quite overwhelmed and trying to piece the situation together in my mind .
I could n't really comprehend what happened for a while .
My co-tripper and I had a lengthy conversation , which helped me put things together and figure out the things that I did n't know .
We talked to a few friends who helped us further understand why our room had been raided in the first place .
As I started to relax more , I began to trip harder again .
Suddenly I felt the most immense happiness .
Freedom !
We had escaped !
There were so many close calls and things that could have gone wrong , but we came out almost entirely unscathed .
I would say entirely , but I 'm sure I 'll get a dorm - building violation and probably have to write a paper on drug usage or something .
I fell back into the trip , and thinking back on the night overwhelmed me with profound happiness .
This was probably around 2 am .
The whole ordeal seemed to fit perfectly into the trip , the way the great machine of society tried to force its will upon us while we tried our hardest to resist .
It felt like we had been through a monumental struggle , and the feeling of coming out on top was incredible .
I pondered the contrast between the great happiness I was feeling and the intense terror I had experienced mere hours earlier .
This is one of the most profound lessons I learned from this trip , everything seemed so much better at that point because of the hardship I had endured .
Good times and bad times are all relative , good exists only in its contrast to bad , and vice - versa .
Glowsticks wo n't glow unless you surround them with darkness .
A constant supply of good will lend one to stop appreciating it , thus leading to bad .
Good can not exist without bad .
And suddenly the universe is balanced -- black and white , good and evil , chaos and order , yin and yang .
A foetus was removed from Darlene Haynes ' body , an autopsy found
A 23 - year - old pregnant woman has been found dead with her unborn baby cut from her womb , police in the US state of Massachusetts have said .
Police are trying to find the missing eight - month - old foetus , which they say could have survived with medical help .
Darlene Haynes was discovered on Monday by her Worcester city landlord , who had noticed a " horrifying smell " .
Her body was in the bedroom closet wrapped in bedding and had apparently been there several days , police said .
The last known contact anyone had with Ms Haynes was on Thursday when she sent a text message to a friend saying she was having drinks with a friend in her apartment in Worcester .
The case is being treated as a murder , though the autopsy has not determined the exact cause of her death , police said .
Ms Haynes was also found to have suffered head injuries .
It is not the first such case in the United States .
Lisa Montgomery was convicted two years ago of murdering Bobbi Jo Stinnett , whose foetus she removed .
The baby girl survived .
There have been at least four other similar cases in the US .

ebook readers Ebooks are digitised versions of paper books .
That is to say , they are computer files .
The ebooks available from Project Gutenberg Australia , all of which are free of charge , are usually provided in ' txt ' or ' html ' format and can be read on any personal computer or laptop , using a text editor such as Notepad , which comes bundled with every copy of Microsoft Windows , or with a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox .
However , when this basic method is used to read ebooks one is not able to bookmark pages for future reference or jump to a particular chapter from the Table of Contents .
These shortcomings , have been overcome by the development of software specifically designed to read ebooks on personal computers and laptops .
Good examples are Tom's eTextReader from Fellnersoft and yBook and yRead from Spacejock Software .
This software boasts many features to make the experience of reading ebooks more rewarding .
The yRead software will even read the book back to you , using a synthesised voice .
You want more , I hear you say .
Well , both offerings are free of charge and can be downloaded directly from the internet .
Microsoft Reader software , for both PC an PocketPC is also very popular .
The meaning of words can be looked up in a dictionary , and bookmarks can be added .
Check out the Microsoft Reader site .

Of course , books are not usually read while one is sitting in front of a computer .
We want to be able to carry them with us and read them while sitting on a train , or while resting in an easy chair or at the beach .
This need for mobility precipitated the development of proprietary ebook reading devices ( ereaders ) .
Such devices have been around for quite a few years now , with varying degrees of success .
Recently we have seen the release of several new offerings , including the Sony Reader and the Amazon Kindle .
The iRex iLiad , iRex DR1000S , HanLin and Cybook are ebook readers which are also available in Australia , at the time of writing this article .
The software available for use with these devices often allows for ebook files to be converted into a format which makes the ebooks easier to read on a particular device .
The ' epub ' format , a free and open standard set by the International Digital Publishing Forum ( IDPF ) , may , in time , become a universal standard for ebook publishing so that ebooks published in epub format can be read on any ereader .
Many people use a personal digital assistant ( PDA ) or a tablet or mobile phone , such as the iPhone , to read ebooks .
One usually needs to convert the basic text file or html file , which comprises the ebook , into a file format more suitable for display on the device 's screen .
Calibre software was specifically developed for just this purpose and may be downloaded from the Calibre web site , free of charge .
The HTML format is used universally on web sites to display content .
Many of the ebooks available from Project Gutenberg Australia are provided in html format .
By using this format , it is possible to display images in the ebooks and to provide a Table of Contents from which users can jump to the start of any chapter in the ebook .
The use of coloured text and different printer fonts can also be used to enhance the appearance , readability and utility of the ebook .
Some of the software and devices mentioned above support html files , however images which are displayed in the html files often cannot be seen on those devices .

( Adds details , background )
BEIRUT , July 30 ( Reuters ) - A Lebanese man suffering from a serious illness died from the H1N1 swine flu strain on Thursday , Health Minister Mohammad Khalifeh told Reuters .
The 30 - year - old victim had been receiving treatment for leukemia when he contracted the virus , possibly from relatives who had just travelled from Australia to Lebanon , the minister said .
Lebanon has recorded more than 100 cases of H1N1 .
H1N1 swine flu has swept around the world in weeks , infecting millions and killing more than 800 by official counts .
While only a " moderate " pandemic by World Health Organisation standards , it could worsen as temperatures cool in the northern hemisphere , making conditions better for viruses .

Apple has told the U.S. Copyright Office that modifying the iPhone 's operating system could crash a mobile phone network 's transmission towers or allow people to avoid paying for phone calls .
The claims are Apple 's contribution to the Copyright Office 's regular review of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , a law that forbids the circumvention of copy control mechanisms .
Apple says that modification of the phone 's software , a process known as jailbreaking , could lead to major network disruptions .
Jailbreaking gets around the copyright control features that prohibit , for example , the installation of applications unapproved by Apple .
Apple 's arguments , filed June 23 , seek to rebut a request to the agency by the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) that modifications to the iPhone 's software do not violate the DMCA and should be allowed .
The U.S. Copyright Office holds hearings every three years to consider requests to make exceptions to the nation 's copyright law .
Jailbreaking continues to be popular with iPhone users , who can also then use their devices on the networks of operators who have not signed distribution deals with Apple .
Apple argues that the practice constitutes copyright infringement .
No one has been prosecuted for jailbreaking , although Apple discourages it .
Apple 's latest filing describes potentially severe technical problems operators could face with jailbroken phones .
Since the OS code is accessible on a jailbroken phone , Apple said it would be possible to reprogram one to gain access to the phone 's BBP ( baseband processor ) , which controls the connection to the operator 's network .
" Because jailbreaking makes hacking of the BPP software much easier , jailbreaking affords an avenue for hackers to accomplish a number of undesirable things on the network , " the filing said .
By gaining access to the BPP , hackers could change the phone 's ECID ( exclusive chip identification ) , which identifies a phone to the transmission towers , Apple said .
" With access to the BBP via jailbreaking , hackers may be able to change the ECID , which in turn can enable phone calls to be made anonymously ( this would be desirable to drug dealers , for example ) or charges for the calls to be avoided , " Apple said .
While some of Apple 's claims may be true , network operators rely on a separate identifier , contained in the phone 's SIM ( Subscriber Identity Module ) , to distinguish between customers for billing and authentication purposes .
Apple went on to say that if several phones were modified to have the same ECID , it could cause a transmission tower to malfunction or kick phones off the network .
Also , operator limits on data transmission could be circumvented , allowing a hacker to conduct a denial - of - service attack and crash the tower .
" In short , taking control of the BPP software would be much the equivalent of getting inside the firewall of a corporate computer -- to potentially catastrophic result , " Apple said .
Technical considerations aside , the EFF has argued that Apple 's lock on the iPhone is unmerited from a copyright protection perspective and aims to " suppress competition from independent iPhone application vendors . "
The Copyright Office is expected to make a decision in the case later this year .
A Washington Township man known for flying his flags upside down had his stars and stripes stolen on Independence Day , police said .
Township police Chief Daniel Cotturo said thieves stole four flags from the pole on Joseph Yamrus ' front lawn .
The flags were flying upside down when they were stolen , Cotturo said .
The thefts happened sometime 2:30 and 7 a.m. at Yamrus ' home in the 100 block of Molasses Road .
Cotturo said thieves cut the line on the pole to remove the flags .
He said , to his knowledge , Yamrus has not recovered his flags .
But Yamrus made it clear he wants to catch whoever is responsible .
He is offering a $ 500 reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the thief .
Yamrus made headlines last year when he filed a civil suit against the township after they cited him for flying his flags upside down .
Yamrus , who is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania and a Philadelphia law firm , claims his first amendment rights were violated .
The suit was filed after he was cited in 2007 for insults to national or commonwealth flags , police said .
An Army veteran , Yamrus began his flag flying habit in protest of the role some members of Congress have played in the nation 's Middle East policy .
A passerby was offended by the display and reported it to township police .
Police asked Yamrus to either turn the flag right side up or take it down .
He did neither and was cited .
The case , which is in federal court , is still pending , court records say .
So will the political struggle , which is on two different levels .
One is between the two factions of the 1978 - 79 revolution — one led by Ayatollah Khamenei , the other by Mr. Rafsanjani , a cunning and controversial figure .
There certainly is ideology and theology in the mix , although some of the “ acrimony ” is analogous to the late Wallace Stanley Sayre ’s observation that academic politics is so bitter because “ so little is at stake . ”
Here ’s where understanding politics , Chicago style , comes in : it ’s about survival .
If Mr. Ahmadinejad loses , Mr. Rafsanjani is more empowered .
One of Mr. Rafsanjani ’s posts is as head of the Assembly of Experts , whose primary function is to choose , or replace , the supreme leader .
If Mr. Rafsanjani — who was attacked for corruption in this election even though he was n’t on the ballot — loses , he may be in peril .
The second struggle is generational .
Both sides invoke the slogans and tactics of the campaign used to overthrow the hated shah .
Some three - quarters of Iranians were born in the last 30 years and have experienced none of those moments .
All of which makes the American debate over whether Mr. Obama has been tough enough seem sophomoric .
The White House claim that the president has been consistent is also ridiculous .
He has hardened his position both as a response to political pressure , from some Democrats as well as Republicans , and as circumstances got worse after the June 12 election .
Critics , led by Senator John McCain and some neoconservatives , charge that a stronger American response would hearten the freedom - loving forces in Iran and hasten change .
That simply is n’t credible , most experts say .
Moreover , if the United States encourages protests and they are violently put down , what does the U.S. government then do ?
Use force in another Muslim land ?
A material that is a hundred thousand times heavier than water and more dense than the core of the Sun is being produced at the University of Gothenburg .
The scientists working with this material are aiming for an energy process that is both more sustainable and less damaging to the environment than the nuclear power used today .
Imagine a material so heavy that a cube with sides of length 10 cm weights 130 tonnes , a material whose density is significantly greater than the material in the core of the Sun .
Such a material is being produced and studied by scientists in Atmospheric Science at the Department of Chemistry , the University of Gothenburg .
Towards commercial use
So far , only microscopic amounts of the new material have been produced .
New measurements that have been published in two scientific journals , however , have shown that the distance between atoms in the material is much smaller than in normal matter .
Leif Holmlid , Professor in the Department of Chemistry , believes that this is an important step on the road to commercial use of the material .
The material is produced from heavy hydrogen , also known as deuterium , and is therefore known as “ ultra - dense deuterium ” .
It is believed that ultra - dense deuterium plays a role in the formation of stars , and that it is probably present in giant planets such as Jupiter .
An efficient fuel
So what can this super - heavy material be used for ?

“ One important justification for our research is that ultra - dense deuterium may be a very efficient fuel in laser driven nuclear fusion .
It is possible to achieve nuclear fusion between deuterium nuclei using high - power lasers , releasing vast amounts of energy ” , says Leif Holmlid .
The laser technology has long been tested on frozen deuterium , known as “ deuterium ice ” , but results have been poor .
It has proved to be very difficult to compress the deuterium ice sufficiently for it to attain the high temperature required to ignite the fusion .
Energy source of the future
Ultra -dense deuterium is a million times more dense than frozen deuterium , making it relatively easy to create a nuclear fusion reaction using high - power pulses of laser light .
“ If we can produce large quantities of ultra - dense deuterium , the fusion process may become the energy source of the future .
And it may become available much earlier than we have thought possible ” , says Leif Holmlid .
“ Further , we believe that we can design the deuterium fusion such that it produces only helium and hydrogen as its products , both of which are completely non-hazardous .
It will not be necessary to deal with the highly radioactive tritium that is planned for use in other types of future fusion reactors , and this means that laser - driven nuclear fusion as we envisage it will be both more sustainable and less damaging to the environment than other methods that are being developed . ”

Ericsson AB , the giant Swedish telecom - equipment maker , is poised to build the world 's next generation of wireless networks after winning an auction yesterday for most of the wireless assets of bankrupt Nortel Networks Corp .
In the proposed deal , subject to regulatory and bankruptcy court approval in Canada , the U.S. and Europe , Nortel will be paid only $ 1.13 billion ( U.S. ) for its most valuable business .
That 's about half what Nortel was expecting the unit to fetch when it filed for bankruptcy protection in January and began a rapid dismantling of Canada 's long - time R&D flagship in fire - sale deals with foreign buyers .
Ericsson may just have struck one of the best deals in the industry 's recent history .
It will almost double the Stockholm - based firm 's sales in North America , which will become its biggest wireless market .
Over the next two to five years , Ericsson 's North American market share will soar by almost 30 per cent , and its global share by more than 5 per cent .
Ericsson is to obtain Nortel 's commanding position in CDMA , or code division multiple access , the standard for wireless networks serving more than half of the U.S .
Like Nokia Siemens Networks BV , a losing bidder yesterday for the Nortel unit , Ericsson 's current strength is in GSM , or global system for mobile communications , the dominant wireless standard outside North America .
As a fading technology destined to disappear over the next decade , CDMA wo n't require lavish R&D spending by Ericsson , as its CEO noted yesterday .
Which means it throws off a lot of cash .
More important , CDMA is the ideal " platform " from which the world 's telecoms will migrate to the next - generation wireless standard , LTE , or long - term evolution , in which Nortel has a significant edge .
LTE increases both speed and bandwidth .
That will enable Nortel cellphone - network customers like Bell Canada and U.S. giants Verizon Communications Inc. , Sprint Nextel Corp. and Leap Wireless International Inc. to peddle lucrative , bandwidth - hogging services such as interactive TV , video blogging and sophisticated games to users of cellphones , smartphones and netbooks .
" The Nortel unit is very profitable , " Pierre Ferragu , a London - based industry analyst at Sanford Bernstein , told Bloomberg News yesterday .
" I was surprised to hear that Nokia Siemens let Nortel go to Ericsson at such a low price . "
Ericsson by no means has a lock on the prize .
Its deal with Nortel is not set to close until later this year , plenty of time for Nokia Siemens to trump Ericsson 's offer .
Or for Waterloo - based Research in Motion Ltd. , the BlackBerry smartphone maker , to launch a formal bid .
RIM last week expressed a willingness to pay roughly the same $ 1.1 billion ( U.S. ) with which Ericsson won yesterday 's auction .
The near giveaway price Ericsson is offering for Nortel 's prized CDMA and LTE technology and patents , which alone are expected to generate an effortless revenue stream of $ 2.9 billion ( U.S. ) over the next 15 years , is likely to bring pressure on Nortel 's board from creditors anxious to see more generous proceeds from Nortel 's fire sale of assets .
Nortel has a history of negotiating sale and joint - venture deals this decade , with Siemens AG , Nokia Corp. , Avaya Inc. and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. , among others , that failed to come to fruition .
Ericsson 's due diligence will also reveal that many key Nortel engineers working on LTE have defected since Nortel 's bankruptcy filing , including former LTE general manager Doug Wolff .
Like many other ex-Nortel engineers , Wolff now works at Ericsson rival Alcatel - Lucent SA of France .
And if Ottawa is persuaded by RIM 's argument that Nortel 's wireless assets are of national strategic importance , it can invoke provisions of the Investment Canada Act .
Last year , Ottawa blocked a deal in which arguably less important assets were at stake when it prevented MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. from selling its satellite and robotics technology to U.S. rocket maker Alliant Technologies Inc .
Late last week , both Jim Flaherty , the federal finance minister , and Tony Clement , the industry minister , expressed disappointment that a Canadian firm was excluded from the bidding for the Nortel wireless assets .

As night was falling across the Americas on Sunday , August 28 , 1859 , the phantom shapes of the auroras could already be seen overhead .
From Maine to the tip of Florida , vivid curtains of light took the skies .
Startled Cubans saw the auroras directly overhead ; ships ’ logs near the equator described crimson lights reaching halfway to the zenith .
Many people thought their cities had caught fire .
Scientific instruments around the world , patiently recording minute changes in Earth ’s magnetism , suddenly shot off scale , and spurious electric currents surged into the world ’s telegraph systems .
In Baltimore telegraph operators labored from 8 p.m. until 10 a.m. the next day to transmit a mere 400 - word press report .

Prince Walid bin Talal is one of the world 's richest businessmen
A member of the Saudi royal family has called for the assets of his brother to be frozen .
Prince Khaled bin Talal denounced his brother 's media empire in an unprecedented public attack from within the ruling family .
Prince Khaled accused Prince Walid bin Talal of disseminating vice and violating the rules of Islamic Sharia in the conservative kingdom .
Prince Walid is one of the richest businessmen in the world .
It has long been known that there is a split within the ranks of Saud family between liberals and conservatives .
But , until now , they have always managed to keep a lid on the problem .
Prince Khaled said he had been forced to speak out after quiet efforts to advise his brother to mend his ways had fallen on deaf ears .
Prince Walid , known for his liberal lifestyle , owns a media empire which features entertainment channels that have long angered conservative Saudis .
Prince Khaled , told an Arabic website that his brother 's plan to introduce cinema into Saudi society was the straw that broke the camel 's back .
This was a reference to a Saudi film financed by Prince Walid , and shown in Saudi Arabia late last year despite fierce opposition from Islamist activists .
Nearly all forms of modern entertainment - particularly those that bring men and women together - are regarded by conservative Saudis as morally corrosive and can , in their eyes , undermine the religious foundation of the Saudi society and state .
Michael Shellenberger is one of environmentalism ’s persona non grata de jour .
He and Ted Nordhaus founded the Breakthrough Institute in order to push for technological solutions to environmental problems instead of policy solutions that both men have argued are doomed to failure from the word “ Go . ”
This was not exactly a popular thing to say in the halls of Congress or around the water cooler at any number of large environmental organizations dedicated to creating policy solutions .
An analysis of the American Climate and Energy Security Act ( ACES ) by Shellenberger and Jesse Jenkins , Breakthrough ’s Director of Energy and Climate Policy , found that the offset provisions of the legislation are so loose that they essentially make the carbon cap portion of the ACES - defined “ cap - and - trade ” system almost meaningless .
The problem , as illustrated in the image above , is that the Congressional Budget Office estimates that companies will buy more carbon offsets ( such as reforestation credits ) than carbon allowances under the cap - and - trade proposal .
Not only will this suppress allowance prices by an estimated 70 % , Breakthrough estimates that it will also result in reductions of “ cumulative emissions in supposedly capped sectors of the economy by just 0.5 % through 2020 . ”
That ’s 55.1 billion metric tons instead of 55.4 billion metric tons of carbon emissions .
( UPDATE : A typo in the Breakthrough Institute ’s analysis has been corrected and the cumulative emissions is now 2 % . )
Offsets are a huge problem in general – they ’re difficult to verify and thus prone to fraud and easy to game .
And this analysis illustrates that the sheer number of offsets available in ACES undermines the bill ’s goal of cutting carbon emissions , perhaps fatally .
I ’m still personally ambivalent about ACES .
But if the analysis is accurate ( and not everyone agrees that the Breakthrough analysis is ) , it means that parts of ACES are in desperate need of repair .
Unless problems like this are fixed or , at a minimum no more problems like this crop up , I could actually find myself hoping for ACES to fail .
And that is just depressing .

China rejects binding GHG cuts
In yet a further indication of “ the more things change , the more they stay the same , ” TerraDaily reports that China will not accept binding cuts in greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions .
According to a quote from Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang :
China is still a developing country and the present task confronting China is to develop its economy and alleviate poverty , as well as raise the living standard of its people .
Given that , it is natural for China to have some increase in its emissions , so it is not possible for China in that context to accept a binding or compulsory target .
This is bad , but it ’s hardly news .
China has been hiding behind the “ we ’re a developing nation ” and “ the U.S. and Europe have to cut first because they ’re more responsible than we are ” excuses for years now .
The problem is that China and the U.S. combine to total more than 50 % of all GHG emissions globally , especially carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) , so no real progress can be made on cutting emissions without both nations going along .
And without a binding national cap , China has essentially said that they ’ll continue to emit GHGs as necessary to grow their economy .
China ’s emissions will fall naturally due to the global recession just as U.S. emissions have fallen .
China ’s economy is overwhelming driven by exports , and other nations simply lack sufficient money to import all the Chinese goods that China can manufacture .
But China ’s electricity is overwhelming generated from burning coal , their coal plants are n’t particularly efficient , and they ’re still building coal plants at an alarming rate .
As such , smog is a serious problem throughout China .
And because of government corruption and horrible living conditions , I suspect that popular pressures to reform government and clean the nation ’s air and water will ultimately slow China ’s economic growth and it ’s related carbon emissions .
But if not , then there ’s always a carbon tariff on imported Chinese goods .
That would get China ’s attention ….

USGS study suggests peak coal may be closer than previously thought
“ The United States is the Saudi Arabia of coal . ”
“ We have enough coal deposits in the U.S. for 250 years . ”
These kinds of claims are heard all over the place by proponents of coal power and coal - to - fuel conversion technologies .
And the claims are technically correct – to a point .
But what coal boosters fail to mention is that there ’s “ total coal , ” and then there ’s “ coal that can be extracted economically using available technology . ”
And , as a Daily Green article about a United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) study from 2008 points out , the two are most definitely not the same .
According to the Daily Green article , the USGS studied the Powder River Basin coal deposit in Wyoming and found that the recoverable reserves were only 38 % of the total demonstrated reserves of 201 billion short tons .
This difference was due to rights of way , coal deposits under rivers and towns , and so on .
But the USGS also estimated that the amount of coal that was economically viable to mine at 2008 prices was only 6 % of the total , or just 10.1 billion short tons .
I looked up some Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) data on total coal reserves and consumption rate and did some quick calculations .
The EIA estimates that there are 489 billion short tons of coal in demonstrated reserves nationwide .
But if we cut that down to only 6 % of the total using the economic arguments made in the USGS paper , that produces a total of 29.34 billion short tons of coal that can be extracted profitably .
Assuming that coal consumption grows at an annual rate of only 0.86 % ( the average of the growth rates between 2002 and 2008 ) , the U.S. would consume all of that available coal by 2032 .
Now , there ’s a lot of caveats to this quick estimate .
First , as prices rise , more and more coal will become profitable to extract and better extraction technologies will be developed .
Second , the USGS analysis was for one coal deposit in one region , but there are massive coal deposits in the interior of the U.S. and in Appalachia .
Whether the Powder River analysis holds for those other regions is presently unknown , at least to me .
But if my quick estimate holds water over the entire country , then there ’s a question I have to ask – does it make sense to spend billions of dollars developing carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) technologies that might not even be ready for deployment until after we ’ve passed peak coal ?

FutureGen coal CCS pilot project revived
Late in the Bush Administration , the FutureGen coal CCS pilot project was canceled because of supposed cost overruns – or because President Bush ’s home state of Texas was rejected in favor of President Obama ’s home state of Illinois .
It later turned out that the overruns were erroneous , but the project was n’t reinstated .
According to the NYTimes last week , the Department of Energy ( DoE ) revived FutureGen .
The DoE will supply $ 1 billion while the private energy and utility companies involved in the project will pay between $ 400 and $ 600 million total over several years .

EU needs to upgrade its electricity transmission
Electricity transmission is likely to be one of the more difficult problems facing deployment of renewable energy .
Most people do n’t want high voltage power lines running near their property and environmentalists do n’t generally like the idea of spoiling wilderness or habitat with the same .
But under one renewable paradigm , more transmission lines are necessary if electricity will be moved from where it ’s generated to where it ’s consumed , such as moving wind power from the Midwest to the east coast of the U.S .
But there ’s another , related problem that needs to be solved with transmission of renewable electricity – old transmission lines may be unable to carry the new electricity at all .
According to an article in the Guardian , this is precisely what a new study of Europe ’s transmission lines has found .
According to the article , the European Academies Science Advisory Council ( Easac ) electricity grid working group found that the 20 % renewable electricity generated by 2020 could be “ wasted unless it can be distributed properly . ”
Furthemore , the article says that the Easac report also found “ [ u ] pgrading the grids in individual countries should be done to common standards , and eventually the movement of electricity across Europe might even be managed centrally . ”
A report last year ( and reported by the Carboholic ) found that all of the EU ’s electricity needs could be met by large solar farms located in the Sahara that then transmitted the electricity via high voltage direct current ( HVDC ) transmission lines to Europe around and across the Mediterranean Sea .
The Guardian article says that the Easac report found the following :
In order to do that , you need to design the transmission system so it can cope with the large power flows through existing countries ’ networks [ but ]
Italy ’s transmission system is not designed for that , nor is Spain’s .
No single country ’s electricity grid is designed to carry half a continent ’s electricity through its borders , which is essentially what would happen with Spain and Italy .
There is another renewable energy paradigm that might help alleviate the transmission bottleneck , at least enough to give the EU time to build out a whole new set of modern transmission lines – distributed generation of electricity .
The question is whether or not solar and wind power could be made cheaply enough and deployed widely enough to make centralized renewable generation ( like the Sahara proposal ) largely unnecessary .
Time will tell .

Deep water wind turbine undergoing testing
According to an NYTimes GreenInc article last week , a deep water marine turbine is nearly ready for testing off the coast of Norway .
The article and some background available on StatoilHydro ’s website say that the turbine will float upon a tower that is anchored to the bottom with wires .
The physics of a deep center of gravity ( approximately 100 meters below the ocean ’s surface ) and some intelligent control systems will reduce the amount of bobbing that the floating turbine suffers as a result of wave action .
The technology has been adapted from offshore oil drilling platforms , StatoilHydro ’s area of expertise .
There are a number of reasons why deep water turbines are being developed .
First , as the nearly eight year saga that is the Cape Wind project attests , environmentalism can run afoul of NIMBYism even in the most “ liberal ” of places – Nantucket Sound , Massachusetts .
In this case , the wealthy homeowners along the Sound did n’t want white turbine towers spoiling their ocean view .
But deep water turbines could be placed much farther out to sea , reducing the threat of NIMBY lawsuits .
Second , the American Wind Energy Association points out in their FAQ that winds tend to be stronger and blow more consistently farther offshore .
This means that turbines will produce more electricity more consistently than near - shore or on - shore turbines will .
And third , according to the GreenInc article , not all regions of the world have shallow off - shore continental shelves that are suitable for shallow - water , near - shore wind turbines .
In these situations , deep water turbines are the only offshore wind power option .
The turbine is slated to start generating electricity in July after the transmission line is laid from the turbine to the shore and will run for two years .

More wind power means fewer hydroelectric dams ?
Last week , the NYTimes had an article about the interaction between wind power and hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest .
The Bonneville Power Administration is building out large numbers of wind turbines along the Columbia and Snake rivers , but as the number of wind turbines goes up , environmentalists interested in restoring salmon habitat and spawning grounds have started to suggest that now is the time to remove the dams and return the rivers to a ( more ) wild state .
This provides yet another example of the tradeoffs and problems that environmentalists are going to have to face as their goals of wilderness protection , endangered species protection , renewable energy , sustainable agriculture , etc. come into conflict .
One of the problems facing this kind of a tradeoff is that the wind does n’t blow all the time , and so standby electricity generation is necessary to fill in the gaps .
In most parts of the country , that extra capacity is provide by natural gas or coal plants , but the Pacific Northwest is largely powered by hydroelectric .
So removing too many dams and the electricity generation the dams provide will probably make the grid in the Northwest less stable , a point made by Bonneville in the NYTimes article .
In response , Bill Arthur , a Sierra Club representative for the Northwest , suggested in the article that Bonneville build more turbines scattered across a wider geographic area , with the idea being that the wind will probably be blowing somewhere and that the additional turbines would “ smooth out ” the wind power supply .
And he pointed out that “ dismantling [ dams ] could take six or more years , allowing plenty of time to plan the transition to new power sources . ”
One of the problems with Arthur ’s suggestion is that the list of alternative power sources that are likely to be available by the time the dams come down are the usual suspects : coal and natural gas , with possibly some solar power added into the mix .
Is trading a hydroelectric dam that stresses salmon for a coal plant that poisons them or overheats their river ( directly via cooling water discharges or indirectly via climate disruption ) a good idea ?
I do n’t know .
But I do know this – these tradeoffs are n’t going to go away .
In fact , they ’re going to get more common and become thornier different environmental projects collide head first more and more often over the coming years and decades .
Ultimately , some hard decisions and difficult compromises will be necessary .

The Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels have been officially recognised at a ceremony in Papua New Guinea , 60 years after they helped Australian diggers during World War II .
Wesley Akove , 86 , cared for sick and wounded diggers during the brutal campaign to repel the Japanese advance along the Kokoda Track in 1942 .
He is one of 50,000 PNG civilians who worked with Australian troops during the war .
They were paid with rations , clothes and tobacco , but their role was never officially recognised - until now .
Today at a ceremony at the Bomana War Cemetery outside Port Moresby , Australian Veterans ' Affairs Minister Alan Griffin presented Mr Akove with a commemorative medallion .
" On behalf of the Australian Government and the Australian people , thank you Wesley , " he said .
Mr Akove 's brother Benjamin translated for him , saying , " it 's very much appreciated and will go down in history with him " .
Mr Akove is the first to receive the special medallion but he will not be the last .
After this celebration ends , the real work of expressing Australia 's gratitude begins .
Other Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels are being urged to apply for the medals and the Australian High Commission is expected to be inundated with applications .

To this day , whenever I 'm home , after morning coffee with my dad , I take the MBTA into the Google Boston office in Kendall Square
Now , all those routes that I -- and millions of other riders -- have traveled over the years can be planned with Google Maps .
Today at South Station , we accompanied the Massachussetts Bay Transportation Authority to announce the availability of the MBTA 's commuter rail , subway , bus , and ferry schedules through Google Transit , joining nearly all major U.S. transit agencies and more than 400 cities around the world in making their transit data available .
For locals and visitors alike , Google Transit makes it easier to search and discover public transportation options that get them into , around , and out of Boston , Brookline , Cambridge , Quincy , Somerville , and the surrounding areas -- or to travel to and from other MBTA - linked cities like Brockton , Gloucester , Lowell , Providence , and Worcester .
One of the great benefits of Google Transit is that it helps people discover the availability of public transit by showing a MBTA itinerary as an alternative to driving directions in Google Maps .
But when you know that public transit is your first choice , you can also head to maps.google.com / transit for a complete trip planner , accessible both from your web browser and your mobile phone .
Here are a few ideas to get you started :
Do n't worry about parking ( and parking costs ) when going to a Red Sox game at Fenway Park
Consider taking public transport to and from Logan International Airport
Navigate your way to one of Boston 's municipal courts when summoned for jury duty
Spend a summer afternoon , when the weather invites , at Carson Beach , Revere Beach , or Singing Beach
If you 're one of the many students moving to Massachusetts for college in the fall , test the best transit routes in advance so you 'll feel like a local expert upon arrival

View Enlarged Image A pyrrole compound ( red and blue ) self - assembles with tetraethoxysilane to form a layered structure ( silica sheets are gray ) .
Polymerizing and heating converts the ordered material to a single layer of carbon sandwiched between sheets of silica , which can be removed with dilute acid to yield single - layer graphene .
Text Size A A
By using a surfactant that serves as a structure - directing agent and a source of carbon , researchers in China have developed a synthesis method for producing graphene — a single layer of carbon atoms .
The method yields purer products , is more reproducible , and offers additional advantages relative to other ways of making this ultrathin form of carbon ( Angew .
Chem .
Int. Ed. , DOI : 10.1002/anie.200902365 ) .
Owing to its outstanding electronic , mechanical , and structural properties , graphene holds promise as a key component in various applications , including nanoelectronic devices and supercapacitors .
As a result , researchers have developed a number of " top down " preparation methods based on peeling apart sheets of graphene from bulk graphite and high - temperature treatment of silicon carbide .
Weixia Zhang and Guangtao Li of Tsinghua University , in Beijing , and coworkers now demonstrate a " bottom up " synthesis that proceeds under mild conditions and yields gram - scale quantities of pure single - layer graphene .
By reacting a lysine - based surfactant bearing a terminal pyrrole moiety with tetraethoxysilane , the team exploits a self - assembly process that packs the pyrrole units into a confined layer between sheets of silica .
They then polymerize the pyrrole and heat the intermediate product to convert the organic component to a single layer of carbon .
Finally , they remove the silica sheets with dilute acid to yield single - layer graphene .

The scenario is a Hollywood staple : Terrorists infiltrate a poorly guarded nuclear weapons facility , capture the bomb , and hold the world hostage to their diabolical demands .
But that could only happen in the movies , right ?
Unfortunately , no .
Nearly eight years after 9/11 , nuclear specialists are only just starting to coordinate industry - wide practices to keep the materials used to make doomsday weapons from falling into terrorist hands .
The nuclear industry has long collaborated on safety issues , such as preventing reactors from exploding .
But even as the threat of terrorism has grown , security has remained an ad hoc affair , with each individual facility or country left more or less to its own devices .
It was only last September that a Vienna - based nongovernmental organization called the World Institute for Nuclear Security ( WINS ) began bringing nuclear security specialists together to formulate procedures to prevent violent extremists from obtaining the key ingredient in nuclear bombs .
The group was the brainchild of former senator Sam Nunn , a longtime proponent of nuclear nonproliferation who , along with Ted Turner , cochairs the Washington - based Nuclear Threat Initiative .
With initial funding of $ 6 million — half from Nunn ’s organization and most of the rest from the US Department of Energy — WINS focuses on securing fissile materials at facilities around the world .
It ’s led by Roger Howsley , the former director of security , safeguards , and international affairs for British Nuclear Fuels , the UK ’s government - owned nuclear concern .
Mother Jones talked to Howsley about the alarming gaps in security at nuclear plants around the world .
Mother Jones :
There has been a lot of talk about the risk of terrorists obtaining nuclear weapons .
Is the concern justified ?
Roger Howsley :
It ’s a matter of record that there are terrorist groups that have made plain that if they could access nuclear weapons or nuclear materials and use them for terrorist purposes , they would do so .
If you look at some of the court cases related to terrorists , you find that there are people who have actively tried to get hold of nuclear or radioactive materials or have planned to try to get hold them with a view to using them .
You have to presume that there is still interest in doing so .
MJ : How active is the black market for nuclear materials ?
RH :
The number of occasions where nuclear or radioactive materials have been smuggled or stolen is pretty small .
The International Atomic Energy Agency keeps a trafficking database in which they have recorded upwards of 100 incidents a year , but I think a lot of those are very small , low - level things of no real significance .
Of course the thing that governments most worry about is the possibility of someone stealing a nuclear weapon or enough nuclear material to produce an improvised nuclear device , which would be shocking .
But we also need to understand that there would be a high level of public paranoia if it were just a small amount of radioactivity that was dispersed .
I ’ve heard people call dirty bombs “ weapons of mass disruption ” as opposed to destruction — psychologically , people do n’t respond proportionately to the scientifically calculated harm that might be caused from a radioactive release .
You only need to look at the sarin attack on the underground in Tokyo to draw parallels .
Quite understandably , people react in a very frightened way when these sorts of things happen .
So we should n’t underestimate the potential harm that a dirty bomb would do .
MJ : What is the most likely scenario under which terrorists might steal nuclear materials ?
RH : I can remember once being contacted when I was a security officer at British Nuclear Fuels .
It was a high security transport company calling .
They said they ’d been away for a couple days ’ brainstorming on how they could improve security and thought they ’d like to benchmark ( that is , compare ) with other transporters that carry particularly sensitive materials .
They wanted to compare the number of attacks they ’d had on their facilities and their transport operations compared with us .
And I said , “ Well , you can come and talk to us about it , but we ’ve actually never had an attack on our facilities or transport operations , ” whereas they regularly had their high security vehicles intercepted by bandits or whatever .
The point of me saying this is that we do n’t have statistical data to justify what we think is most likely to happen .
MJ : What does WINS hope to achieve ?
RH : There was enormous reaction across the world after Chernobyl .
People began to take nuclear safety much more seriously .
In 1989 there was a new organization formed called the World Association of Nuclear Operators .
They had looked at the situation , realized the nuclear industry was politically on its knees after Chernobyl , and unless they took really serious action , it was possible that the entire nuclear industry would just grind to a halt .
WANO has worked well over the last 20 years or so to improve nuclear safety standards but also to improve the efficiency of reactors .
It is very much a model for what we are trying to do .
Human nature being what it is , though , people are usually better at reacting to events than trying to prevent them from happening .
We should think today what we would do tomorrow after an event , and not wait for it to happen .
MJ : How can the nuclear industry improve security , given that so much remains unknown about potential threats ?
RH :
One thing that we ’re trying to do is actually look at other industries , what their philosophies are .
If you look at the diamond industry or the gold industry , they have a definite risk .
People try to steal diamonds and gold all the time , so what are they doing in terms of insider threats ?
What I want is for WINS to think like that , think more imaginatively about how we can improve things .
We ’re not always necessarily looking for people to spend a lot more money on what they ’re doing ; it ’s much more of a management attitude .
MJ : What is the biggest challenge to improving the security of nuclear materials ?
RH :
The security problem we have is that if you ’re not attacked , you do n’t necessarily have data .
So you report to your chief executive or your board of directors that in January , nothing happened .
February , nothing happened .
March , nothing happened .
April , nothing happened .
And people can very quickly become bored .
People lose interest ; they can become less focused in terms of the attention they give security , and that ’s the worry about complacency .
Just because nothing happens , you ca n’t differentiate whether nothing has happened because you ’re a really hard target or because nobody has tried .
MJ : Why has n’t the nuclear security community come together sooner to share best practices ?
RH : One of the things that ’s characterized security generally over the years is that you ca n’t talk about it …for security reasons !
Whereas people in the nuclear safety community have really got to know one another — there ’s a stack of international groups that deal with nuclear safety and share best practices — the nuclear security community has n’t done that .
For example , after 9/11 , when I rang my counterparts in nuclear companies in Europe and elsewhere , I found myself quite often introducing myself for the first time to the security director , saying I ’d like to come and talk to you about what you ’re doing in response to these terrorist attacks .
There was just no infrastructure in place to do that .
People keep to themselves .
It ’s “ need to know , ” and all of the things that have been criticized in various reports following 9/11 .
MJ : Are there any legitimate security reasons for this ?
RH :
When you think about the risks we ’re worried about , actually getting a group of professional security people together to talk about best practice does n’t strike me as being a very great risk .
We ’re talking about good management practices and how to get your guards properly recruited , trained , motivated , deployed … things that are generally transferable around the world .
We ’re not talking about sharing the combination codes to one another ’s facilities .
Further climate change could make life even harder for struggling African farmers ( Image : Daniel Berehulak / National Geographic / Getty )
African farmers will soon face growing seasons hotter than any in their experience .
To cope with this rapid climate change , they – and the plant breeders who supply their crops – will need to make big changes , and soon .
Agricultural experts have predicted for some time that farmers are likely to face problems as climates become hotter and drier than they are today .
Indeed , some farmers in South Africa are already reporting difficulties ( pdf ) .
To see how fast , and how broadly , this will strike , Marshall Burke , an agricultural economist at Stanford University , and colleagues , averaged the results from 18 global climate models to forecast likely temperature and rainfall conditions in 2025 , 2050 and 2075 in regions of Africa where maize , millet and sorghum are grown today .
Then , assuming that year - to - year variability would remain the same as today – perhaps a conservative assumption – they asked how much these future climates would overlap with existing climates .

They found that farmers in Africa will face average temperatures outside the current range of experience in their locality in 42 % of years by 2025 – and 97 % by 2075 .
Since temperature strongly affects crop yields , farmers will need to find new varieties adapted to these higher temperatures , Burke says .
Future rainfall showed more overlap with current conditions , largely because rainfall already varies more from year to year .
Maize trap
The researchers then looked to see whether the warmer temperatures forecast for 2050 can be found anywhere in Africa today .
If so , they reasoned , these analogous conditions might yield crop varieties already adapted for the future conditions .
A few lucky countries , such as Tanzania , Ethiopia and South Africa , have diverse enough climates today that they can find climates analogous to the potential conditions of 2050 within their own borders today , Burke ’s team found .
At the opposite extreme , Sahelian countries such as Chad , Mali and Niger may have nowhere to turn .
“ By 2050 , they ’re going to be hotter than any current growing season in any maize country in the world , ” says Burke .
Most countries , however , will be able to find analogous climates in other countries today .
That would be good news , except that plant breeders have done very little collecting of locally adapted varieties from some of the most likely analog countries , such as Cameroon , Sudan and Nigeria , Burke ’s team found .
To cope with future climates , genetic prospectors must sample much more of the genetic diversity of crops in these countries – and those nations must then do a better job of sharing these genetic resources , says Burke .
“ We ’ve got to do something serious about agriculture and we ’ve got to start now , ” agrees Gerald Nelson , an agricultural economist who heads research on agriculture and climate change at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington DC .

Bobby Kotick ’s choice words for Sony sparked outrage amongst PS3 fans , and quickly became one of the most controversial subjects of the summer .
The outspoken CEO suggested Activision would drop support for PlayStation if Sony did n’t lower the price point on the PlayStation 3 .
The glare of the corporate flames shine a light on what is actually a very bold statement , coming from a publisher responsible for some of this years most expensive video games .
Basically Activision has a lot of nerve .
The PlayStation 3 ‘s biggest fault is it ’s price .
Especially in this global economic climate .
Sony ’s beautiful black beast , although not selling poorly , is clearly being held back because of it ’s $ 399 price tag .
This equates to a smaller installed base , which Kotick feels is holding back profits for publishers such as Activision .
Activision closed 2008 with over $ 344 million in net profit , and tallied over $ 2.9 billion in total revenue .
Thanks to franchises like Call of Duty , Guitar Hero , and more Activision saw it ’s 16th consecutive year of growth .
So how does Activision plan to increase profits in 2009 ?
By having some of the most expensively priced video game products on the market today .
The recent announcement of $ 149.99 priced Modern Warfare 2 : Prestige Editon stuck out like a sore thumb after claiming Sony needed to lower it ’s behemoth console .
Other Activision franchises have shocked with their pricing strategy .
Games like Tony Hawk ’s Ride , which will literally take you for a ‘ ride ’ with it ’s $ 119.99 price tag .
Or DJ Hero , at the same $ 119.99 price , might have you ‘ scratching ’ your head , asking if it ’s really worth the cost of 2 new games .
Even though Guitar Hero World
Tour does pack a whole band into the bundle , the $ 189.99 MSRP is still astronomical just to play one game .
Do the math , four of Activisions most profitable franchises would comes to a total of $ 579.96 .
While the “ expensive ” 80 GB PlayStation 3 bundle ( featuring Killzone 2 , and MGS4 ) offers for just under $ 180 less .
Without the streets there would be no cars , Activision needs the PlayStation 3 to “ drive ” sales of these expensive titles .
Granted the Prestige Editon of Modern Warfare 2 is completely uncessary , even after removing that $ 149.99 from the equation the three remaining games values are about as expensive as the aforementioned PS3 bundle .
Activision needs Sony as much as Sony needs Activision .
Both have some of gaming ’s highest priced items .
However Sony easily offers a much greater value in it ’s PlayStation 3 , than any combination of 3 Activision titles listed above .
Maybe Activision should look into lowering it ’s own prices , before calling the kettle black .
GM plant closing tears at Ohio community
ONTARIO , Ohio 
When General Motors , the biggest employer in town , laid off 400 workers in December , it was like a boulder falling into a very small pond .
April and Rick Allison lost their jobs stamping out doors and other car parts .
They plan to leave to find work .
Their departure means their landlord , Angelo Sorrenti , is worried about his business , so he 's holding off buying a new pickup .
That hurts Graham 's Auto Mall , which has laid off sales manager Steve Brown .
Now Brown can't make his regular contribution to the United Way .
The United Way has reduced donations to charities such as Friendly House 's after - school and summer program for low - income children .
Friendly House is increasing its summer day camp fees .
Single mom Pamela
Hall worries if that keeps up , her 9 - year - old daughter Courtney will have to stay home .
The struggles facing the people of Ontario and its neighboring communities show how the 400 layoffs ripple far beyond the gates of the GM plant , where 860 people still work .
The stories reveal how job losses at a plant tear the web that binds the workers and their neighbors .
And Ontario is just one of 12 cities facing the bleak prospect that its GM plant will shut down in the next two years .
President Obama promises a stronger , healthier future for the restructured GM and Chrysler , but the White House acknowledges that it means downsizing .
For Ontario and its 5,200 residents , already under strain , downsizing means losing the remaining 860 jobs .
" Something like this can devastate a little town , " says Kim Hill , assistant director of research at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , Mich .
More layoffs will ripple across Richland County , where the recession already has led to a 13.1 % jobless rate , well above the state 's 11.1 % and the nation 's 9.5 % .
Situated between Cleveland and Columbus , the county 's biggest community is Mansfield , an industrial city next to Ontario with a population of 50,000 .
Ontario , a mix of farms and newly built suburban mini-McMansion subdivisions , has grown into a retail hub for the county with shopping strips and big - box stores .
That 's largelythanks to the GM plant .
Hill says that for every job cut at a stamping plant like the one here , three more could be lost as the facility no longer buys supplies or hires contractors for services , such as cleaning ; retailers and restaurants see fewer customers ; and local government receives less tax revenue .
Ontario officials are bracing for big drops in income and property taxes as jobs disappear and people leave .
The largest chunk of the city of Ontario 's revenue , about 44 % , comes from a tax on wages .
Revenue from the 1 % tax — $ 3.7 million last year — goes toward police , street repair and other services , Mayor Ken Bender says .
About 40 % of that tax was a product of jobs at the GM plant .
This year , even before the plant shuts down , the city expects to collect at least $ 300,000 less .
Bender says the plant closing will have " a catastrophic effect " on the police force and other services .
Already , the city has laid off eight people from a workforce of 56 , including two police officers and two dispatchers .
Bender does n't know how bad it will get , but he says less revenue and more layoffs are likely .
Politicians and area residents are petitioning GM to keep the plant open , but the company says the closing is final .
" There 's not really any alternative , " says GM spokesman Tom Wilkinson .
" In order for the company to be viable going forward ... we need fewer plants .
That 's the reality . "
Starting over
The Allisons moved to Ontario to work at the stamping plant five years ago when the auto parts maker where they worked in Dayton scaled back .
" When we came up here we were told it was the best plant .
...
We felt safe coming up here , " says Rick Allison , 30 .
" The fact that it was going to stay open for many , many years was another plus , but obviously , it did not turn out to be the truth . "
They 've been out of work since December , except for two weeks in April when the company called them back temporarily .
They are each eligible for a $ 45,000 buyout to leave GM , or they can take a chance that the 10 years they have in the company puts them high enough on the seniority list that they can transfer to another plant .
The uncertain future weighs heavily .
With a newborn baby and three daughters under 12 , do they gamble with GM to hang onto their health insurance ?
Or do they each take the buyout and cut their ties to the company ?
" You want to make sure you are doing the best for your family , but you do n't know that until things pan out eventually , " says April Allison , 32 .
" I 'm scared to death . "
Either way , they know they wo n't be staying in Ontario .
" We 're going to go back home and start over , " says Rick Allison .
" We had lives before GM ; we 'll have lives after GM . "
' We have cut back '
As the Allisons prepare to start over elsewhere , their landlord , Angelo Sorrenti , is expecting more turnover in the 20 three - bedroom houses he rents out .
The $ 650 to $ 700 monthly rents he collects supplement the income on his homebuilding business , Arcangelo Builders , which has taken a bad hit since the economy tanked last fall .
Sorrenti , who built homes that sold for up to $ 500,000 , went from putting up five houses a year and employing nine people to building none this year and laying off seven workers .
Now , he 's working on smaller jobs he would n't have taken a year ago , such as remodeling kitchens and bathrooms .
The plant closing comes in an already tough time for Richland County home sales .
Latest figures show 87 homes sold in June , down from 113 the same month last year .
The average sale price fell to $ 78,015 , down from $ 92,364 in June 2008 .
" This is the slowest period I 've ever experienced in the last 28 years , " says Sorrenti , 51 .
So he is scaling back .
He was thinking about replacing the pickup he bought at Graham 's Auto Mall eight years ago , but now that 's out .
" We have cut back in all areas of our life , " he says .
" If everybody does that , we 'll be hurting more and more in our community . "
Even so , he is upbeat about the place that became his home when he left Italy 38 years ago .
" I have seen this happen in the early ' 80s , when many factories closed , " Sorrenti says .
" But believe it or not , we 've been able to re-adapt going through these difficult times , which is why I tend to have a positive outlook for us . "
Fear of the unknown
At Graham 's in Mansfield , where the mainstay of the business for 40 years has been GM cars , sales are down 25 % for the first five months of 2009 from the same time last year , says general manager Kenneth Williams .
As more customers like Sorrenti hold off car purchases , Graham 's has laid off three workers out of 165 in January .
One was Steve Brown , a sales manager who 's been in the car business for 20 of his 49 years .
He spends his days looking for jobs online at home in Savannah , a rural spot 20 miles from Mansfield .
Brown says he never expected to be out of work so long .
He 's applied for 30 jobs but says local businesses , reacting to GM 's problems , are not hiring .
Unemployment benefits , savings and his wife 's job as a manager at a plastics manufacturer will pay their bills through the end of the year .
" What if this time next year , I 'm still out of work ? " he wonders .
" Unemployment is gone .
It 's the fear of the unknown . "
His plans for a comfortable retirement have crumbled .
He and his wife of 28 years have lost more than a third of their 401 ( k ) retirement savings in the recession .
" We were doing it right .
... I was n't going to be a burden to anybody , " he says .
" It turned out nothing like we 've been planning . "
He and his wife spend only on necessities : food , house payments , utilities and insurance .
His charitable giving was one of the first things to go .
His donations to the United Way used to come out of his paycheck .
" We can't do it right now , " he says .
' We ca n't be negative '
The United Way of Richland County has seen fundraising suffer for three years as GM 's troubles and the recession have put more people out of work .
Donations fell from $ 1.9 million in 2007 to $ 1.7 million in 2008 .
Executive director Skip Allman expects an even bigger drop this year .
That means the 27 charities the United Way funds will receive less money .
Friendly House received $ 239,000 from the United Way this year , $ 31,000 less than last year .
The drop meant director Terry Conard had to raise the fee for the 10 - week summer day camp to $ 30 from $ 10 last summer .
The program , which provides tutoring , swimming lessons , games , and arts and crafts for kids under 18 , is a life - saver for Pamela Hall .
She does n't have to worry about paying a babysitter or leaving her daughter Courtney , 9 , on her own while she is at work .
Hall worries that she wo n't be able to afford any more fee hikes for the day camp .
" There 's a lot of low - income families that can't afford it , not even $ 5 or $ 10 , " says Hall , 39 .
" I do n't know that I 'll be able to send my daughter .
I 'm a single mom trying to make things work . "
The Allisons used to give to the United Way during drives at the plant .
Now , their charitable giving is on hold , too , as they dismantle their life in Ontario .
United Way 's Allman expects the trickle - down effect from families like the Allisons leaving the area will touch every corner of the county .
Right now , everyone feels as if they are in a boat , riding out the gales and hoping the waves will let up .
" We do n't know how bad it can get , " Allman says .
" Of course , we can't be down .
We can't be negative .
It 's a luxury we do n't have ...
We 've never had to come together like this . "

The first article of the series , on the conventional Oil and Gas reserve , can be found here .
Thanks to ace 's diligence an error was identified and corrected , resulting in an update to the graph on Commulative Oil and Gas Discovery over 400 meters deep .
This is a guest post by Jean Laherrère , the second of a series on the current knowledge of the deepwater Oil and Gas reserve at the Gulf of Mexico .
In this second installment Jean analyses the Methane Hydrate resource of the region , in face of recent claims of great drilling results in the region .
Last year I wrote a paper on worldwide hydrates : Hydrates updated , published by The Oil Drum on April 17 , 2008 .
But since then , a survey on hydrates was carried out in the Gulf of Mexico ( GOM ) .
Seven deepwater slim holes were drilled last April as part of Leg II of the Joint Industry Project ( JIP Leg II ) .
The results were claimed by Dr Collett to be " very encouraging " :
Our drilling at Walker Ridge block 313 and Green Canyon block 955 has discovered the most promising marine gas hydrate accumulations in the world [… ]
What 's unique about the Gulf of Mexico accumulations identified is this .
It 's the first time we 've seen highly concentrated hydrates in conventional sand reservoirs that could be commercially producible , [...]
Let ’s see on what the basis for this claim is .
Oil and gas fields reserves need well samples and production tests to calibrate all the other measurements .
In particular porosity and permeability , estimated from well logs , need to be calibrated with cores .
To be brief : no core , no reserve estimate .
After my previous paper , one of the comments was that it does not matter that hydrates were n't recovered in the core , because they are very unstable and disappear .
So hydrates should be in the ground , even if not recovered in the corer !
The pressure corer is supposed to fix the problem and exactly that was used in the GOM JIP .
Furthermore , it is surprising to see that in other places like at Lake Baikal it is very easy to recover hydrates ( see TOD 3819 ) .
Why is GOM hydrate so hard to recover if present everywhere ?
All hydrate programmes mention the need for coring :
For marine hydrates , there is a need for multi-well drilling expeditions in the Gulf of Mexico , with coring and logging ( similar to the 2006 Indian hydrate expedition ) to characterize hydrate deposits and to validate emerging exploration technologies .

Phases 1 and 2 resulted in the 2005 drilling , logging , coring of two sites in the Gulf of Mexico to investigate safety aspects of hydrates in fine - grained sediments .
Phase 3 ( currently in planning ) will pursue improved pressure coring tools , evaluate locations for gas hydrates within coarse - grained ( sand ) sediments , conduct initial drilling and LWD evaluation of those sites ( 4Q2007 ) and conduct follow - on drilling and coring operations ( FY2008/2009 ) .

The main objective of the JIP cruise was to collect sediments cores and a full suite of logs on seismically well - characterized sediments that show evidence for occurrence of gas hydrates .
Although the petroleum industry has operated in the Gulf for decades , relatively little information has been collected on the nature of the shallow sediments , and seismic records and well logs have not been calibrated for the interpretation of gas hydrates .

Fire in ice , Summer 2005 .
Gas hydrate saturation cubes such as those shown in Figures 17 and 18 must be calibrated .
It should be noted that , despite the large number of drilled hydrate wells worldwide , quality hydrate logging and coring data are scarce , especially in the Gulf of Mexico .
Such data are urgently needed .
Until we devote resources to undertake such logging , coring , and laboratory measurements , current estimates of possible gas that can be obtained from gas hydrates must be questioned .

But there was no coring in JIP leg II , completed last month , only well logs within slim holes were obtained ( lack of funds , lack of suitable rig ? ) !
There is no explanation for the absence of cores , especially since it was in the planning !
Coring is now planned for 2011
Phase 3A is currently ongoing .
Site selection and detailed scientific and operational planning for the drilling / logging expedition have been completed .
The expedition was initiated on 3/16/09 and sites involved are to include Green Canyon 955 , Walker Ridge 313 and East Breaks 992 ( contingency sites include Green Canyon 781/825 and Alaminos Canyon 21/65 ) .
The multi-location , multi- hole program will include a full suite of well logs and will provide vital information related to occurrence of hydrate in coarse grained sediment in the Gulf of Mexico , will help prove out the prospecting methodologies used in the selection of targeted sites and will lay the ground work for Phase 3B coring expedition .
Phase 3B will involve the planning and carrying out of a separate hydrate coring cruise ( anticipated in 2011 ) , the follow on analyses , interpretation and dissemination of information generated from project activities .

We have to wait until 2011 to know more about the GOM hydrate potential !
What are the hydrate in - place resource estimates ?
In its 2000 report Oceanic gas hydrate research and activity review [ pdf ! ] ( MMS 2000 - 017 ) , the MMS claimed ( Kvenvolden 1993 ) that the distribution of worldwide organic carbon in gas hydrate ( onshore and offshore = 10 000 Pg ) was twice the amount of fossil fuels ( coal , oil and natural gas = 5 000 Pg ) .
This figure was still being used by the USGS in 2006 ( Collett et al ) .
This was unrealistic because most hydrates are located in the first 600 m of recent oceanic sediments ( water depth > 500 m ) which covers a period of time of a few millions years , while fossil fuels sediments cover a period of about one billion years , with larger surface and thickness ( >6000 m ) .
In his book " The Deep , Hot Biosphere " Thomas Gold in July of 1992 ( which convinced the Swedish government to drill two wells on the Siljan meteorite crater looking for abiogenic oil and gas .
He justified his theory by the large volume of oceanic hydrates :
The large quantities of methane hydrates ( methane - water ices ) found in many areas of the ocean floor , and thought to contain more methane than all other known methane deposits , suggest a widely distributed methane supply from below .
There is no convincing occurrence of abiogenic oil anywhere and this explains the failure of Gold ’s theory , based on hugely wrong hydrate estimates .
However , if oil is a complex product needing organic matter to be generated in Nature , methane is a simple molecule and can be generated from chemical reactions involving mantle rocks ( it is , for instance , found in space ) , explaining the desire of Gold to find abundant methane in the Earth 's mantle .
But Alexei Milkov ( the most respected hydrate expert with experience from Russia and US hydrate surveys ) shows a graph ( present in my previous hydrates article ) which shows that hydrates estimate have been in decline since 1973 .
The estimated quantity has fallen by a factor of more than 1000 , with the resulting volume now similar to that of conventional gas , but without any technique to produce them .
Milkov estimates hydrates to be between 500 and 2500 Gt , to compare with 10 000 Gt by Kvenvolden in 1988 ( which is unrealistic , looking at the geological time involved for hydrates compared to fossil fuels ) .
If the quantity of hydrates is 500 Gt , the quantity of hydrates is lower than that of geopressured dissolved methane , which 30 years ago was described ( 50 000 Tcf in the Gulf Coast ) as the energy of future ( as hydrates are now described by some , in particular in the IPCC's SRES scenarios ) .
But pilot production projects of geopressured dissolved methane were commercial failures , unable to handle pollution problems .
This unrealistically huge estimate is still found in a 2008 Canadian report on hydrates :
Recent estimates suggest that the worldwide volume of gas trapped in hydrate accumulations is in the range of 1 to 120 x 1015 m3 ( 35,000 to 4,200,000 trillion cubic feet , Tcf ) .
The French version is 35 000 to 4 200 0000 billions de pieds cubes , because for the SI of units ( which is the official rule in Canada but also for the US Federal agencies since 1993 ) billion is square million or 10E12 cf or Tcf , T being tera and not trillion ( trillion in SI is cube million = 10E18 or exa )
In Energy from gas hydrates : assessing the opportunities & challenges for Canada The Expert Panel on Gas Hydrates [ pdf ! ] , Council of Canadian Academies , 2008 - 11-05 .
This shows that billion ( or trillion ) should not be used in papers outside the US , but only symbols as M for mega , G for giga , T for tera , E for exa or 10E3 , 10E6 , 10E9 , 10E12 .
The SI rule is also not to use the comma for thousands but a space , because in some countries the comma is used as the decimal separator .
With very few drilling and coring data sets available , a reliable estimate of global volume of natural gas hydrate appears to be elusive .
It is also difficult to assess the quantity of gas hydrate present on a given margin because of the heterogeneous sedimentological environments along each margin deposits varied significantly , even within tens of metres ( Riedel et al. , Proceedings of the IODP , 2006 ) .
Extrapolation from the local scale can be unreliable without additional knowledge of the scale of heterogeneity .
MMS 2000 - 017 indicated that :
In the Gulf of Mexico , drill core samples are especially needed to characterize gas hydrate deposit locations and behaviors before any kind of production is attempted
[...]
Gas hydrate extraction may become a reality as soon as 2015
[...]
« In 1995 , the USGS completed its most detailled assessment of US gas hydrate resources .
The USGS study estimated the in - place gas resource within the gas hydrates of the US to range from 112 000 Tcf to 376 000 Tcf , with a mean value of 320 000 Tcf .
Subsequent refinements of the data in 1997 using information from the Ocean Drilling Program have suggested that the mean should be slightly downward , to around 200 000 Tcf .
In a later report , entitled Preliminary Evaluation of In - Place Gas Hydrate Resources : Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf [ pdf ! ] ( MMS 2008 - 004 ) the estimate ( through Monte Carlo runs ) of gas hydrate in - place was a 95 % chance of 11 112 Tcf and a 5 % chance of 34 423 Tcf ( in fact the text confuses T trillion ( or Tera ) and thousand ) :
For instance , there is a 95 - percent chance that at least 11,112 thousand cubic feet ( TCF ) of gas hydrate are in place in the GOM , and a 5 - percent chance that more than 34,423 TCF are in place .
The probabilistic distribution of in - place gas - hydrates resources for the GOM is given as below ; it is obviously the result of a Monte Carlo run ( usually tens of thousands ) which transforms a very simple guess into something looking like a looking real data plot !
But as indicated before , most of these estimates have been carried out guessing the occurrence of hydrates without the backing of core data .
Where are the cores showing oceanic hydrates ?
It is very difficult to recover hydrate in cores , because hydrate melts with the change in temperature and pressure when they are brought to surface .
It is necessary to keep the pressure within the core .
Different core equipments were built since this problem occurred when JOIDES drilling began ( it was a main concern when I was a member of the JOIDES Safety Panel in the 1970s ) .
Each new survey tests a new equipment ( pressure corer like HYACE , HYACINTH , Fugro , .. ) and concludes that better equipment or a new survey is needed .
The first industrial hydrate survey in Nankai Japan in 1999 did not recover any hydrate in the recovered cores and JNOC decided to get some hydrate core from permafrost sediments in Canada ( logged since 1972 as Mallik 2 ) to know more on hydrate behaviour .
But permafrost hydrate accumulations in Mallik ( or Messoyakha in Russia ) are completely different from oceanic hydrates , being gas fields in good sandy reservoirs trapped before the glaciation ( about 2 million years ago ) .
These shallow reservoirs are now within the hydrate stability zone ( deeper reservoirs are just conventional natural gas ) .
From Collett et al 2006 in permafrost ( Alaska ) :
Instead , oceanic hydrates occur in clay sediments where gas was converted into hydrate , being unable to migrate , for the pressure and temperature keeps it in the solid state .
Only gravity can eventually move the hydrate , because it is lighter than water .
The USGS is active in the US hydrate programme .
From Collett et al 2006 :
Ten years later , Japan conducted two drilling surveys in 2001 and 2004 , amounting to six months drilling with a JOIDES resolution ship .
This time they finally did core some hydrate , but very little geological information is published and no picture of these cores can be found on the Internet .
According to a presentation delivered by Abe at IIASA in March of 2008 , the estimate for the hydrate reserves in Nankai is 20 Tcf ( with 40 Tcf for resources ) .
But production experiments are planned only for 2012 and 2014 ( METI , AIST & JOGMEC ) .
For a country in great need of domestic energy , hydrate is either not a priority , or they feel that the potential for domestic hydrate production is weak !
The oil industry knows hydrates well because they are a nuisance : plugging pipes and production tubing are vulnerable to hazards caused by hydrates when drilling in deepwater .
The MMS requires in the Application for Permit to Drill an evaluation of the hazards of hydrates in order to avoid them .
In 2001 a JIP group was formed , led by Chevron , to investigate the problems of hydrates in the GOM within the oil industry .
JIP includes Chevron , ConocoPhillips , Halliburton , JOGMREC ( Japan ) , MMS , Reliance , Schlumberger , Total , KNOC ( S. Korea ) and Statoil Hydro ( who joined recently ) .
In 2005 the JIP Leg I drilled 7 wells on AT 13/14 and KC 151 in the course of 35 days ( Ruppell et al 2008 ) with a dynamic positioning semi-sub that recovered 19 cores ( total length 6 m ) :
The JIP launched a 35 - day expedition in Spring 2005 to acquire well logs and sediment cores at sites in Atwater Valley lease blocks 13 /14 and Keathley Canyon lease block 151 in the northern Gulf of Mexico minibasin province .
No gas hydrate was recovered at the drill sites , but logging data , and to some extent cores , suggest the occurrence of gas hydrate in inferred coarser - grained beds and fractures , particularly between 220 and 330 m below the seafloor at the Keathley Canyon site .
The expedition did not recover visible gas hydrate during any of the coring operations , nor was gas hydrate directly imaged in pressure cores that were subjected to X - ray analyses ( Claypool , 2006 ) .
C. Ruppel , R. Boswell , E. Jones Scientific results from Gulf of Mexico Gas Hydrates Joint Industry Project Leg 1 drilling : Introduction and overview Marine and Petroleum Geology 25 ( 2008 ) 819–829
In my 2008 review I indicated that because of finding of no hydrate in the 2005 cores , the oil industry concluded that hydrates pose a minimum - drilling hazard .
The seismic section of leg 164 is shown with 3 sites : 994 , 995 and 997 .
The so called BSR ( Bottom Simulating Reflector ) was absent on site 994 and present in sites 995 and 997 , but the log on these three holes was similar to the hydrate zone .
It is now well established that BSR depends on the gas below the hydrate stability zone , before a small concentration of fizzy water ( lemonade ) drastically changes the velocity of the sediments .
BRS has nothing to do with hydrate concentration , even though this was assumed in most of the resource estimates .
In Leg II three wells were drilled in Green Canyon 955 between the April 22 and April 28 , 2009 .
The first well encountered more than 300 ft of porous sands as predicted ; however , these sands contained primarily water – with only modest indications of gas hydrate :
The JIP 's discovery of thick gas hydrate - bearing sands at GC955 validates the integrated geological and geophysical approach used in the pre-drill site selection , and provides increased confidence in assessment of gas hydrate volumes in the Gulf of Mexico .
It is expected that further evaluation of the complex geology of these sites , including both fracture - filling and pore - filling gas hydrate in numerous fault blocks ( with potentially varying geochemical conditions and gas hydrate / free gas configurations ) will add significantly to the understanding of the nature and occurrence of gas hydrate - saturated sands in the marine environment [...]
The so - called hydrate target looks dispersed and of limited horizontal extent ( 100 m ! ) .
It was written that :
Phase III of the project is to collect data on hydrate bearing sands .
Both logging and coring operations are planned .
Phase III of the project began in September of 2007 and will focus on obtaining logs and cores of hydrate bearing sands in the GOM [...]
Coring is indicated in the planning of the several selected locations , but it was not carried out in Leg II , without any explanation .
Phase 3A is currently ongoing .
Site selection and detailed scientific and operational planning for the drilling / logging expedition have been completed .
The expedition was initiated on 3/16/09 and sites involved are to include Green Canyon 955 , Walker Ridge 313 and East Breaks 992 ( contingency sites include Green Canyon 781/825 and Alaminos Canyon 21/65 ) .
The multi-location , multi- hole program will include a full suite of well logs and will provide vital information related to occurrence of hydrate in coarse grained sediment in the Gulf of Mexico , will help prove out the prospecting methodologies used in the selection of targeted sites and will lay the ground work for Phase 3B coring expedition .
Phase 3B will involve the planning and carrying out of a separate hydrate coring cruise ( anticipated in 2011 ) , the follow on analyses , interpretation and dissemination of information generated from project activities .

Alaska
The USGS estimates hydrate resources in the North Slope in the range of 25 Tcf to 157 Tcf , with a mean of 85,4 Tcf .
This mean was 590 Tcf in the 1995 estimate , ( quite a drop ! ) but they claim that back then it was in - place whereas now it is technically recoverable gas .
Two hydrates wells were drilled and cored in the last 5 years :
Hot Ice 1
In 2003 & 2004 a well was drilled by Anadarko with the goal to recover hydrate , because its name was clear : Hot Ice .
It was cored for more than 200 ft and no hydrate was found , neither in the core or in the logs !
During the winter operations seasons of 2003 and 2004 , Anadarko Petroleum in cooperation with Maurer Technology and Noble Corporation and with the partial support of DOE drilled and cored a shallow well , Hot Ice 1 , located at 30 - T9N - R8E , Umiat Meridian , on the North Slope of Alaska .
The Hot Ice 1 well was drilled from the surface to 2300 ft .
There was almost 100 % core recovery from the bottom of surface casing at 107 ft to TD at 2300 feet measured depth from the surface .
Based on the best estimate of the bottom of the methane hydrate stability zone core was recovered over its complete range .
Approximately 565 ft of good sandstone reservoir rock was recovered in the Ugnu formation and approximately 215 ft were recovered in the West Sak .
There were gas shows in the bottom part of the Ugnu and throughout the West Sak .
No hydrate baring zones were identified either in the recovered core or on the well logs .
Signal et al , Characterization of potential hydrate bearing reservoirs in the Ugnu and West Sak formations of Alaska ’s North Slope .
Milne Point BP 2007 Mt Elbert gas hydrate project
500 ft of continuous core were recovered in 2007 with the stratigraphic well " Mount Elbert " ; logs indicate 30 m ( in two layers ) of gas - hydrate saturated , fine grained , sand reservoir .
But the only picture that I found shows grey sediment ( they mention ice cementation with gas saturation of 45 to 75 % ) different from the typical white spots oceanic hydrate .
Tests were conducted recovering methane ( thermogenic and microbial gas ) .
Investigation of gas hydrate - bearing sandstone reservoirs at the " Mount Elbert " stratigraphic test well [ pdf ! ] , Milne Point Alaska , R. Boswell ICGH 2008 Vancouver
There is a video showing the gas dissociation of the Mt Elbert at the NETL webpage ( direct link to mpeg file here ) .
There is obviously methane release from these cores , like it happens with marshy gases or with cow flatulence ( 1 m3/ d ) .
50 % of green house gases ( GHG ) emissions in New Zealand come from cows and sheep .
This figure is only 14 % in Australia , where kangaroos do not emit any methane because of a special bacteria in their guts ( they are trying to move it to cows and sheep ! ) .
A long production test is needed to know more about Mt Elbert 's potential , but that it is not yet decided !
Production
A Permafrost hydrate in sandy sediments is quite different from an oceanic hydrate in clay , mostly unconsolidated sediments .
Permafrost hydrates were drilled in oil and gas producing basins : they are old accumulations and mainly thermogenic .
Oceanic hydrates were drilled in oil and gas producing basins ( e.g. GOM ) .
In the North Slope hydrates seem quite uneconomical ( the Mallik test was less than a CBM test ) and their interest is negligible when Prudhoe Bay free gas reserves are still stranded ( in unconventional production the size of the tank does not matter , it is the size of the tap ! ) .
It is a far future prospect , needing first a gas pipeline and much higher gas prices because of the small flow ( no pressure because shallow depths ) .
Collett et Petrotech 2009 ( Geologic and engineering controls on the energy resource potential of gas hydrates [ pdf ! ] ) states that the maximum rate on Mallik 2008 was 4000 m3/d .
There is no production concept for oceanic hydrates , because no one knows how to extract them , if they mainly lie in unconsolidated impermeable sediments .
Furthermore , the heterogeneity of oceanic hydrates ( few centimetres vertically and few meters horizontally ) seems to be a difficult obstacle to overcome .
Conclusions
Hydrate is the Santa Claus of many who do not want to change their way of life .
But hydrate occurrences are hard to evaluate , mainly because of a lack of samples ( cores ) , which is the only way to calibrate all the visible proxies : well logs and seismic data .
The GOM is now claimed to have the " most promising marine gas hydrate accumulations in the world " , but unfortunately this is only wishful thinking without the coring , which is now planned only for 2011 or later .
As usual , the data is incomplete to back up such optimistic claims , in particular for the GOM .

The cocaine was found inside sealed plastic tubs beneath bags of soil
Two British men have been arrested in France after customs officers found a record 684kg ( 1,507lbs ) of cocaine inside their lorry , officials say .
The haul , estimated to be worth 27 m euros ( £ 24 m ) , was discovered during a routine check on the A9 motorway near the city of Montpellier on Wednesday .
The two men had driven from Spain and were heading to London via Calais .
On Friday , Budget Minister Eric Woerth called the biggest ever seizure of cocaine on mainland France " historic " .
The regional customs directorate in Montpellier said its officers had become suspicious because the lorry was being driven erratically .
A scanner then revealed the presence of " abnormal merchandise " - drugs - which was found inside sealed plastic bags and tubs beneath bags of soil , it added .
Coffee beans had also been placed inside the vehicle to confuse sniffer dogs .
Both of the arrested men deny all knowledge of the illegal cargo .
In this image , the Apollo 11 lunar lander and it shadow can be seen in a view from NASA 's new Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , which is scouting the moon for new landing sites for future astronauts .
This story was updated at 2:45 p.m. ET
For stubborn folks who still believe the Apollo astronauts never landed on the moon , NASA has new images - definitive proof - that clearly show the Apollo 11 lander that carried the first astronauts to the lunar surface 40 years ago .
The images , taken by NASA 's first lunar scout in more than a decade , the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) , show the Eagle lunar lander at Tranquility Base , where Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on July 20 , 1969 .
They were snapped between July 11 and 15 of this month and released by NASA today .
" The LROC team anxiously awaited each image , " said LROC principal investigator Mark Robinson of Arizona State University .
" We were very interested in getting our first peek at the lunar module descent stages just for the thrill -- and to see how well the cameras had come into focus .
Indeed , the images are fantastic and so is the focus . "
The image does not reveal whether the U.S. flag planted there is still standing or not .
Whether or not the flag will be visible in later images is n't uncertain , Robinson said , adding that he thinks the Apollo 11 flag was knocked over by the thrusters when the astronauts left the moon 's surface .
The Indian and Japanese missions have also snapped images of the Apollo 11 site , but they do n't have the high resolution of LRO 's images , Robinson said .
The Apollo 11 landing site was n't the only one that the LRO camera ( dubbed LROC ) photographed :
It also snapped pictures of the landing sites of the other five Apollo landings .
( The remaining site , for Apollo 12 , is expected to be photographed in the coming weeks . )
The lunar modules for all of these sites imaged are visible as small dots ; their shadows can also be seen .
A few more details can be seen in the image of the Apollo 14 landing site , taken only two days ago , including scientific instruments and astronaut footprints .
" Of course it was fantastic to see the hardware lying on the surface , and it was exactly as we expected it to be , " Robinson said .
" Sitting on the surface waiting for us to come back . "
As LRO gradually descends to a lower orbit , the images will improve and provide closer looks at the lunar landing sites .
" This is only a first glimpse , " said Michael Wargo , chief lunar scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington , D.C. , " From now on , they 're only going to get better . "
The images of these sites are expected to show scientists how the sites have changed since the astronauts trod across them , whether there are any new craters and how the leftover human artifacts have fared in the lunar environment .
And the pictures wo n't just serve as a record of our past presence on the moon , as scientists will be able to use the information in them to make topographic maps of the lunar surface at those sites .
About the size of a Mini Cooper car , the $ 504 million LRO probe , an orbiting satellite , launched toward the moon on June 18 .
The probe is expected to spend at least one year mapping the moon for future manned missions , as well as several more years conducting science surveys .
Some people have questioned whether NASA really went to the moon or if the whole thing was faked .
No serious and level - headed historian , researcher or space industry analyst doubts the moon landings , however .
You can't store these in the freezer forever - they 're not sealed like jams are .
But you can certainly make them up well ahead of time and freeze them for a bit .
When you 're ready to bake these , take the jar out of the freezer and turn the oven on to preheat it at 375 oF .
Take off the lid and put the frozen jar on a plate or baking vessel so you 'll have less thermal shock when it goes in the oven .
Put a ring of foil around the edge of the pie for the first 45 minutes , take it off for 15 .
Let it cool and either eat it out of the jar or run a knife around the edge to get it out .
And lastly , a note from Simple Simon , our inspiration :
The whole " glass shattering from temp changes " fear is the thing to worry about when you put the glass into direct contact with the change in temp , e.g. the stove , a campfire , boiling water , etc .
A hot oven is n't the same thing at all because air has lousy heat transfer .
Consider how you can stick your hand in a 210o oven for several seconds .
Now consider sticking your hand in boiling water .
Same temperature , but one causes a little discomfort while the other causes severe burns .
The reason is that water transfers heat very well , as does metal ( like a stove ) .
Do n't ever stick your frozen jars into warm water .
Do n't ever stick your glass jar on the stove .
Do n't ever stick your hot glass jars into even room temp water .
But frozen glass into a hot oven ?
Go for it .
Cooks Illustrated ( and their sisters , ATK and Cook 's Country ) have several recipes for things that go straight from freezer to oven with no trouble in the test kitchen , and they are where I got that information .
Simon Linnett , Executive Vice - Chairman of Rothschild , has called for a new international body , the World Environment Agency , to regulate carbon trading .
In a recently published paper , Trading Emissions , for the Social Market Foundation , Mr Linnett argues that the International problem of climate change demands an international solution .
Unless governments cede some of their sovereignty to a new world body , he says , a global carbon trading scheme cannot be enforced and regulated .
The full paper - Social Market Foundation
" An urgent global response . "
This was how Nicolas Stern described the problem of carbon dioxide emissions , in his recent review of the economics of climate change .
The sense of an impending crisis infuses our all debates on this issue .
The human causes of climate change are now well established .
The overall measures we must take - a reduction of our emissions - is painfully obvious .
But like a group of rabbits caught in the headlights , our actual means of escape remain unclear .
We know what our end goals are , but how do we get there ?
How can governments achieve delivery ?
The first step must be to recognise the scope of the problem .
Unlike other pollutants , such as litter or nuclear waste , CO2 emissions have impact on a global level - and only on a global level .
This means we have to deal with the issue internationally .
The problem is literally too big for any one country to handle .
Old alliances , divisions and ' special relationships ' are a meaningless hindrance .
I believe it is essential that governments and the private sector work together to solve the problem .
As a banker , I suppose I would say that , but only such a partnership will we be able to harness what Al Gore called the multitude of little solutions , which all add up to a better outcome .
Only the private sector can successfully develop those solutions , but only governments can provide a framework for them to be applied internationally .
As a banker , I also welcome the fact that the ' cap - and - trade ' system is becoming the dominant methodology for CO2 control .
Unlike taxation , or plain regulation , cap - and - trade offers the greatest scope for private sector involvement and innovation .
Furthermore , taxation and regulation can only be levied at local or national levels , whereas cap - and - trade can operate on a global level .
And remember , the problem is global .
But for the private sector to participate enthusiastically in a global carbon trading market , governments must collectively establish a robust framework within which trading can occur .
It must be long , loud and legal :
Long : it is going to be around for a long time ; Loud : it will be the dominant mechanism for sponsoring changes in behaviour and we are going to make this perfectly clear to the world 's people ; and Legal : we will enforce it through law .
A key implication of creating a legal yet global system of trading , is the loss of sovereignty it implies .
Governments must be prepared to allow some subordination of national interests to this world initiative , on the issue of emissions .
This need not mean a new system of government , above individual nations .
But it would mean a change to the way treaties are agreed and worded .
Instead of saying " we will cut emissions by x per cent by date y " ( pledges which are inevitably broken ) , such statements will have to morph to " we will make our contribution to a scheme which cuts , across certain industries and gases , emissions by x per cent by date y . "
The European nations already do this , on certain issues , yielding sovereignty to the EU .
And in time , the EU itself will eventually have to yield to a larger body - one which includes the economic powerhouses of India and China .
The cynicism that greets such programmes is well known , since the Asian economies seem bent on rapid expansion .
However , I believe that both India and China will soon recognise the benefits of joining a global carbon trading scheme .
First , a properly constituted , one - member - one - vote system would mean that they have a proper ' say ' .
More importantly , since the allocation of the emissions cap might trend towards recognising world populations rather than current levels of emission , both countries would stand to gain a great deal .
If emissions trading could expand into different areas of economic activity , so too could its message .
When an individual receives an electricity bill , they will come to know what the cost of turning on the gas or a light was to the environment .
Perhaps they will gain a new appreciation of their burden on the broader world .
Similarly , if the scheme were to expand geographically to include India , China and , ultimately , the US , so too could the prospect be realised of such allowances becoming the reserve currency of the world , taking over that role held for most of the 20th century by gold .
So emissions trading could establish a new world order for a sustainable planet , one based on the sharing of the earth 's ability to absorb harmful emissions .
To allocate that ' resource ' fully and properly will , in turn , require resourcefulness and imagination across the globe .

He has enjoyed 25 years of privatisation and PPP experience with the Bank , leading that effort for the majority of that time .
For the last 10 years , Simon has been in dialogue with both UK and , more recently , EU administrations about the future evolution of emissions trading of which he has long been a proponent .
This paper represents his personal views only .
The two attacks by drone aircraft took place in South Waziristan , a Mehsud stronghold close to the Afghan border where Pakistani troops are gearing up for a military offensive , two officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media .
They took place as U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano met government officials in the Pakistani capital , Islamabad .
She discussed topics of " mutual interest " with them , a U.S. Embassy spokesman said .
The drone attacks were the latest in a string of more than 40 believed to have been be carried out by the United States against militant targets in the border area since last August .
Washington does not directly acknowledge being responsible for the attacks , which kill civilians as well as militants .
Most Pakistanis criticize the drone attacks , and Islamabad officially protests them as violations of its sovereignty .
Still , most experts believe the government secretly approves of them and likely provides the United States with intelligence .
In one attack Friday , two missiles struck an abandoned seminary in the village of Mantoi that was being used by militants from Mehsud 's group for training , the officials said .
In the other strike , one missile hit an insurgent communications center in the nearby village of Kokat Khel , they said .
In total , 17 people were killed and 27 others were wounded , they said .
However , Maulvi Noor Syed , an aide to Mehsud , told The Associated Press that three Taliban fighters died in the strikes .
" We lost only three mujahedeen ( holy warriors ) in today 's American missile attack , " Syed said .
" These attacks cannot cause any damage to us .
" Access to the rugged , dangerous region is strictly controlled , and the death toll could not be independently verified .
The drone attack came as U.S. Marines in neighboring Afghanistan pushed deeper in the southern Helmand province , a day after 4,000 Marines launched a major anti-Taliban offensive .
Pakistan said it moved troops to the stretch of its border opposite Helmand to stop militants fleeing the American assault .
The United States wants Pakistan to crack down on militants on its side of the border , believing it essential to stabilizing Afghanistan eight years after the invasion that ousted the Taliban there .
The Pakistani military launched an offensive in the Swat region close to the border in early May and is currently gearing up for operations in South Waziristan to eliminate Mehsud , who has been blamed for a string of deadly suicide attacks across the country that have killed more than 100 people in the past month .
In neighboring North Waziristan on Friday , Pakistani warplanes bombed suspected militant hide - outs , killing at least four insurgents and wounding seven others , two more intelligence officials said .
Those airstrikes hit targets where Taliban fighters killed 16 government troops in an ambush earlier this week , the officials said , also speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media .
The U.S. appears to be ramping up the pressure on Mehsud , who is viewed in Islamabad with growing alarm .
Last week , the Taliban leader narrowly escaped a strike on a funeral for militants killed in an earlier drone attack .
Eighty people died in the strike , although Mehsud escaped unharmed .
Ink Calendar by Oscar Diaz
Spanish designer Oscar Diaz has designed a calendar that uses the capillary action of ink spreading across paper to display the date .
It uses capillary action to suck ink across the numbers embossed on the page , one day at a time , gradually coloring itself in over the month .
Amazing idea , but I think it ’s accuracy would start to diminish towards the end of the month .
AMSTERDAM - De Zweedse downloadsite
The Pirate Bay moet zijn website binnen tien dagen ontoegankelijk maken voor internetgebruikers in Nederland .
Dat heeft de voorzieningenrechter bij de rechtbank in Amsterdam donderdag bepaald in een kort geding dat de auteursrechtenorganisatie Brein tegen de beheerders van de site had aangespannen .
Voor iedere dag dat de gedaagden niet aan het vonnis voldoen moeten zij een dwangsom van 30.000 euro betalen tot een maximum van 3 miljoen euro .
De stichting Brein , die strijdt tegen internetpiraterij , had een verbod voor The Pirate Bay in Nederland gevraagd omdat de site '' op grote schaal inbreuk op auteursrechten maakt ' ' .
Geld
Miljoenen internetgebruikers kunnen via de downloadsite gratis illegale film - en muziekbestanden uitwisselen .
Met deze activiteiten verdienen de eigenaren volgens de advocaten van Brein bovendien '' grof geld ' ' .
De gedaagden kwamen vorige week tijdens de behandeling van de zaak niet bij de rechtszitting opdagen .
Ook hadden zij geen advocaten gestuurd om zich te verdedigen tegen de aanklachten .
Wel hadden zij nog een brief gestuurd aan de rechtbank , waarin ze stelden dat ze niet van de zitting wisten .
Opgeroepen
Volgens de rechter zijn de Pirate Bay - mensen echter voldoende opgeroepen , onder meer per aangetekende post , en zelfs via moderne communicatiekanalen als e-mail , Twitter en Facebook .
De voorzieningenrechter oordeelde dat het geëiste verbod voor de piratensite dan ook ' niet onrechtmatig of ongegrond ' is .
Juichen
De stichting Brein is zeer tevreden met het vonnis .
'' Wij juichen toe dat de rechter de site in Nederland verbiedt , die is immers overduidelijk illegaal '' , zei Brein - directeur Tim Kuik in een reactie .
'' Het is goed dat de rechter erkent dat er van inbreuk op auteursrecht en naburige rechten sprake is .
Het is een duidelijk verhaal : wat illegaal is , is verboden , wie het ook doet . ''
Gevangenisstraffen
In april dit jaar veroordeelde een Zweedse rechtbank de mensen achter The Pirate Bay in een strafzaak al tot gevangenisstraffen van een jaar en geldboetes wegens schendingen van auteursrechten .
De beheerders tekenden hoger beroep aan tegen het vonnis en de Pirate Bay bleef gewoon in de lucht .
Ook in andere landen lopen nog rechtszaken tegen de omstreden downloadsite .

Exclusive : After four years of meticulous development riddled with setbacks , Apple is now racing toward an early 2010 launch of a device that may see the electronics maker redefine the portable computing market for the second time in twice as many years .
It seems like a long time coming .
Nearly two years have passed since AppleInsider exclusively reported in September of 2007 that Apple 's next big product initiative would be a modern day reincarnation of its beloved - but - defunct Newton MessagePad .
And it 's believed the device had been slowly evolving as an R&D project for at least a year prior .
The 10 - inch , 3G - enabled tablet , akin to a jumbo iPod touch , is the latest brainchild of chief executive Steve Jobs .
That distinction , as insiders will tell you , carries its share of baggage .
Under the critical eye of Jobs , contours must be precise , each pixel of the interface has to match a particular vision , and there can be no fault — no matter how slight — or it's back to the drawing board .
As such , AppleInsider has observed silently as the project was reset at least a half - dozen times over the past 24 months .
Each time , development was frozen and key aspects of the device rethought , retooled and repositioned .
At times , those close to the Apple co-founder had their doubts that it would ever see the light of day , just like a smaller PDA device he canned a few years after returning to the company .
However , the past six months have reportedly seen the critical pieces fall into place .
Jobs , who 's been overseeing the project from his home , office and hospital beds , has finally achieved that much - sought aura of satisfaction .
He 's since cemented the device in the company 's 2010 roadmap , where it 's being positioned for a first quarter launch , according to people well - respected by AppleInsider for their striking accuracy in Apple 's internal affairs .
That means that the device , which is expected to retail for somewhere between the cost of a high - end iPhone and Apple 's most affordable Mac notebook , is bound to turn up any time between January and March , should there be no last minute setbacks .
Analyst 's following the Cupertino - based company may consider factoring first full - quarter sales of the device into their models for calendar Q2 .
Although Apple maintains publicly that it 's thrilled with the relationship it has with exclusive U.S. wireless provider AT&T , the company has a bone or two to pick with the carrier behind closed doors .
It 's no secret AT&T 's lagging has delayed some vital aspects of the iPhone experience stateside , and as such , other people familiar with the matter say Apple is now in active talks with rival Verizon Wireless over the possibility of the carrier playing a key role in providing Internet access for its tablet device .
AppleInsider has also picked up in recent months that its initial artist 's rendition of the tablet device was off the mark proportionately and has since taken another stab at what the product may look like in respect to the iPhone , as can be seen below .
Much of the holdup in bringing the multi - touch tablet to market is thought to have revolved around a particular issue for which Apple struggled to find a solution , before ultimately settling on a brain transplant .
Upon conception , it 's believed the device was destined to be based around Intel 's first Atom processor , then dubbed Silverthorn .
Deborah Conrad , a vice president in charge of Intel 's Apple division , went on record in March of 2006 as saying that her colleagues were excited that Apple was " thinking different " about her company 's upcoming offerings and the possibility for future Apple gadgets using the chipmaker 's technology .
Though she ruled out the possibility of an Intel - based iPod , it was the prospect of other devices that reportedly got her team " very , very excited . "
Indeed , rumors would follow that Apple had signed on to adopt Atom in some of its products .
These products never materialized .
Though AppleInsider admittedly lacks hard evidence to this end , hints from insiders suggest that the company was dissatisfied with the battery life it was achieving from pre-production devices employing such chips .
It was around this time that the company moved forward with its $ 278 million buyout of fabless chip designer P.A. Semi .
Dissatisfied with existing system - on - a - chip solutions incapable of producing the results it sought , Apple 's objective was to create its own around ARM - based designs renowned for their superior power management characteristics .
This decision is believed to have led to considerable discontent on the part of Intel executives who — looking to jump - start their Atom platform — were less than thrilled over the loss of Apple 's business .
Sentiment over the matter appeared to come to a head a few months later when a pair of Intel executives had a field day badmouthing the iPhone and its embedded ARM processor at the company 's developer forum in Taipei .
That was the same forum where the chip maker was touting its upcoming Moorestown platform for next - generation mobile Internet devices ( MIDs ) that encompasses a future - generation Atom chip .
Intel vice president of mobility Shane Wall teamed with colleague Pankaj Kedia , the chipmaker 's ultra-mobility ecosystems director , in lambasting the iPhone as a device dependent on technology that was , so they claimed , a full two to three years behind that which Intel could offer .
" If you want to run full Internet , you 're going to have to run an Intel - based architecture , " Wall told a gathering of engineers , further asserting that the iPhone " struggles " when tasked with running " any sort of application that requires any horse power . "
" The shortcomings of the iPhone are not because of Apple , " added Kedia .
" The shortcomings of the iPhone have come from ARM . "
Wall then jumped back in and alleged that " even if they do have full capability , the performance will be so poor . "
To that , Kedia added : " I know what their roadmap is , I know where they 're going and I 'm not worried . "
AMEN !!
This includes calling these senators , Blue Dogs in the House , and let them KNOW that if they do n't pass this health care legislation , that their days will be NUMBERED in Washington , DC with their " cushy jobs " .
In a reflection of a legislative strategy that has left no stone unturned , President Barack Obama on Monday called on like - minded bloggers to help his administration keep the heat on lawmakers to pass health care reform .
" It is important just to keep the pressure on members of Congress because what happens is there is a default position of inertia here in Washington , " the president said during an invitation - only conference call .
" And pushing against that , making sure that people feel that the desperation that ordinary families are feeling all across the country , every single day , when they are worrying about whether they can pay their premiums or not ...
People have to feel that in a visceral way .
And you guys can help deliver that better than just about anybody . "
In a roughly 25 - minute session with a handful of prominent progressive bloggers , the president also asked for help combating disinformation about his health care plan .
" I know the blogs are best at debunking myths that can slip through a lot of the traditional media outlets , " he said .
" And that is why you are going to play such an important role in our success in the weeks to come . " read more here .....
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A Colorado meat company is expanding a recall of beef due to possible contamination by E.coli O157:H7 bacteria after an investigation found 18 illnesses may be linked to the meat , the company and the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Sunday .
Greeley , Colorado - based JBS - Swift Beef
Co is voluntarily expanding its June 24 recall to include about 380,000 lbs of assorted beef products , for a total recall of about 421,000 lbs , USDA and the company said .
The affected beef was produced on April 21 and was distributed nationally and internationally .
“ The contamination may have come from further processing by other companies , ” Chandler Keys , JBS spokesman , said on Sunday .
USDA said the recalled products are typically used for steaks and roasts rather than ground beef .
However , it said some of the beef may have been processed into ground products by other companies .
It is unlikely the recall will be expanded further , and JBS will be contacting customers that received the beef to learn how the product was distributed , said Keys .
The contamination was investigated by USDA ’s Food Safety and Inspection Service in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
E.coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacteria that can cause bloody diarrhea , dehydration , and , in severe cases , kidney failure .
The very young , seniors , and persons with weak immune systems are at the most risk .
Consumers with questions can call 1-800-685-6328 .

Reports of swine flu parties have been received by doctors Throwing " swine flu parties " in an attempt to get immunity against the virus while it is a fairly mild form is not a good idea , doctors say .
Reports have emerged of people intentionally mixing with friends who have flu .
Their reasoning is that it is best to be infected before the winter when the virus could become more deadly .
But public health expert Dr Richard Jarvis said such behaviour could undermine the fight against swine flu .
He also stressed while it was a mild flu , people would still be putting their health and the health of their children at risk .
Dr Jarvis , chairman of the British Medical Association 's public health committee , has been working for the Health Protection Agency in the north west to help test , diagnose and treat people who have got swine flu .
He said : " I have heard of reports of people throwing swine flu parties .
" I do n't think it is a good idea .
I would not want it myself .
" It is quite a mild virus , but people still get ill and there is a risk of mortality . "
Health service pressure Dr Jarvis , who was speaking in his BMA capacity at the union 's conference in Liverpool , admitted getting the virus now was likely to give people immunity even if it mutated slightly to become more virulent .
Going out to try to get the virus will just aid its spread
Dr Richard Jarvis , BMA
Is now a good time to get swine flu ?
But he added that if people actively sought to get flu , health services may not be able to act in the same way as they are doing now .
The approach to date - although it is changing in the areas such as Birmingham and London which have the largest outbreaks - has been based on containment .
This has involved close monitoring of flu patients and giving their close contacts drugs to try to prevent the virus developing .
Dr Jarvis said : " If we get to the point where containment is not possible we will not be able to monitor cases as closely or get anti-virals out as quickly .
Will we consider it a mild virus then ?
" The response so far has been superb .
We have contained better than we expected and that has given us time .
We are getting closer to a vaccine and we want that to continue .
" Going out to try to get the virus will just aid its spread . "
Burnout risk Dr Jarvis also warned that public health doctors like himself were risking burnout because of the long hours they were putting in on the front - line of the fight against flu .

More from Today programme Read Fergus Walsh 's blog " Tired doctors make poor decisions and chronically tired doctors become prone to a variety of health problems . "
Dr Vivienne Nathanson , the BMA 's head of science and ethics , praised the approach of the UK public since the first outbreak .
" People have not panicked .
They have handled it sensibly by following the official advice . "
But as the cases mount , Dr Nathanson said she was concerned about suggestions some business are buying in stocks of anti-viral drugs to treat their staff .
As well as having limited effectiveness , Dr Nathanson said businesses needed to be wary of buying fake medicines .
And she added : " There is also the issue of resistance .
If we overuse them and use them inappropriately we are more likely to get resistance .
" The best advice is good hand hygiene .
Use tissues when you sneeze , bin them and wash your hands . "
Sir Liam Donaldson , the chief medical officer for England , said : " It is seriously flawed thinking to allow the virus to spread unabated through ' swine flu parties ' .
" We do n't yet know enough about the risk profile of the virus , and whilst it has generally been mild in the UK , in some parts of the world young previously healthy adults have died . "

The unprecedented trial without jury of four men for armed robbery will begin in January .
John Twomey , Glen Cameron , Peter Blake and Barry Hibberd will be tried by a judge alone after the court of appeal ruled there was a danger of jury interference .
The four men appeared at the Old Bailey today for a preliminary hearing in the case , relating to a £ 1.75 m raid at a Heathrow warehouse in February 2004 .
Mr Justice Calvert - Smith is expected to preside over the trial , which is scheduled to start on 12 January at a court likely to be Kingston or Isleworth .
Campaigners said last month the landmark decision to hold a trial without a jury set a " dangerous precedent " .
Twomey , 61 , of New Milton , Hants , Blake , 57 , of Notting Hill , west London , Hibberd , 42 , of Shepherd 's Bush , west London , and Cameron , 49 , of New Milton , all deny a series of charges including conspiracy to rob and firearm possession .
All four remain on bail .

Former US vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin has formally resigned as Alaska governor , 18 months before the end of her term in office .
She announced her resignation abruptly on 3 July , leading to speculation of a bid for the presidency in 2012 .
She handed over to Alaska 's Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell at a picnic ceremony in Fairbanks , Alaska .
Mrs Palin , who is dogged by ethics probes and legal bills , gave few clues about her political future .
' Grizzly bear '
But she reiterated her commitment to " keep championing Alaska " .
" When I took the oath to serve you , I promised ... to steadfastly and doggedly guard the interests of this great state like that grizzly guards her cubs .
As a mother naturally guards her own , " she said .
" And I will keep that vow wherever the road may lead . "
" I cannot express enough there is no plan after July 26
Meghan Stapleton
Palin spokeswoman
In pictures : Palin 's highs and lows Mrs Palin also took aim at the media , who she has accused of treating her and her family unfairly .
" How about , in honour of the American soldier , you quit making things up ? " she said to the gathering of television camera crews and reporters at the event .
She added that her replacement , Mr Parnell , " has a very nice family too , so leave his kids alone ! "
Mr Parnell , 46 , has promised to pursue many of Mrs Palin 's initiatives , including a controversial natural gas pipeline .
" We share the same core values , " he told the crowd , saying the main focus for his administration would be the economy .
The BBC's Jane O'Brien in Washington says Mr Parnell is far more experienced and low - key than Mrs Palin .
This will come as a relief to Alaskan officials , as they can focus on the issues without the distraction of having a superstar running the show , she adds .
' No plan ' Although Mrs Palin 's next steps remain unclear , reports say she is working on an autobiography and could host a television chat show .
But a spokeswoman for the Palin family earlier dismissed the claims .
Sarah Palin has upset the applecart of expectations , to the chagrin of those who want her to stay out of the way
BBC News website reader Jim Wittstruck , Minnesota , USA
Readers react to Palin 's resignation " I can not express enough there is no plan after July 26 .
There is absolutely no plan , " Meghan Stapleton told the Associated Press news agency .
" [ On Monday ] we 'll sit down and say , ' OK , here are your options .
How do you now want to effect that positive change for Alaska from outside the role as governor ? ' , " Ms Stapleton added .
Mrs Palin , 45 , shot to fame as John McCain 's Republican running mate in the election of November 2008 , becoming a lightning rod for praise and criticism alike .
She said a major factor in her decision to quit as Alaska 's governor was the mounting legal cost she and the state faced in fighting nearly 20 ethics charges .
But she has insisted her opponents would not " find any dirt " .
However , an independent state investigator says her legal - defence fund - formed to help pay more than $ 500,000 ( £ 304,000 ) in lawyers ' fees - is itself an ethics violation because it uses her government job for personal financial benefit .
Her popularity rating has fallen to 40 % in the wake of her resignation , a Washington Post - ABC poll showed .
But her supporters defend her as an outstanding leader with a strong Christian faith and unwavering support for her family .

Do you ever wonder how the shape of digits were designed ?
What is logic behind numbers ?
The numbers we all use ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc. ) are known as " arabic " numbers to distinguish them from the " Roman Numerals " ( I , II , III , IV , V , VI , etc ) .
Actually the Arabs popularized these numbers but they were originally used by the early phonecian traders to count and keep track of their trading accounts .
Have you ever thought why ........ 1 means " one " , and 2 means " two " ?
The roman numerals are easy to understand but what was the logic behind the phonecian numbers ?
It 's all about angles !
It 's the number of angles .
If one writes the numbers down ( see below ) on a piece of paper in their older forms , one quickly sees why .
Angle are marked with " o "s .
No 1 has one angle .
No 2 has two angles .
No 3 has three angles .
etc .
and " O " has no angles
Amazing is n't it .
After getting so many abuses in comments and double checking on google .
I want to add that this might be imaginary stuff ( I got this in chain mail and thought it was interesting so I added to my blog ) .
So , please consider it as someone 's great imagination with little flaws .
Thanks

7 Ways to Say NO to Junk Food
– Eat full and balanced meals
If you eat whole and healthy meals , you will have less of an urge to snack on junk foods .
The average meal should contain items from each of the four main food groups – Fruits and Vegetables , Grains , Meats and alternatives , and dairy products .
Any meal which satisfies these groups will help you gain the nutrients and vitamins you need to prevent sudden hunger pains .
- Set your limits
It ’s no fun cutting junk food out of your diet completely … so set your limits .
Try to consume only one or two small junk food items a day .
– Make a stash
Make a stash or a section in your fridge filled with already prepared snacks like carrots and dip , trail mix , fruit salads , yogurt parfaits , or snack wraps .
Whenever you have the urge to snack , grab something from your healthy snack stash .
– Record your habits
Writing down any fast foods or junk foods that you eat may help you reduce your intake .
Sometimes having your bad habits put right before your eyes can stop them in their tracks .
But do n’t beat yourself up if you had a junk food day – nobody ’s perfect !
– Pop a mint
If you have a strong craving for junk food , grab a mint or brush your teeth .
The taste of mint in your mouth will prevent you from wanting to eat .
–
Do n’t buy junk food in the first place !
Avoid junk food isles at the grocery store by spending the majority of your shopping time in the produce section .
Pick up vegetables and fruits that appeal to you instead of chocolate and cookies .
Check the label before buying anything that may contain a lot of fat or calories .
– Keep yourself busy
When we are bored , we tend to snack , even if we are n’t hungry .
The solution is to make sure that we do not treat eating as a pastime , but as an act of fulfilling our body ’s real needs .
– Treat yourself
It ’s okay to treat yourself to a sweet snack every now and then , nobody expects you to be 100 % junk free !

Despite all the focus on alternative energy sources , nuclear fusion has barely rated a mention , as it has turned out to be very difficult to execute .
The construction of ITER , a very large scale fusion reactor , has become a divisive issue within physics because of its size and resultant cost : � 5 billion .
But a team of researchers has discovered what may be a workable configuration for a different kind of reactor , a reverse field pinch that operates on a much smaller scale .
Even with comparatively low energy and fields , calculations suggest it should be able to achieve fusion .
The most popular fusion reactor design has been the tokamak , a machine that produces a toroidal , or donut - shaped , magnetic field — this design is being used in ITER .
The tokamak exploits the " pinch effect , " a term that describes how passing a current through a gaseous plasma creates a magnetic field that can make the plasma unstable if it's not offset by a second magnetic field .
To manage these fields , ITER 's planned reactor chamber has to be about the size of a house .
A reversed field pinch works in a similar way to a tokamak , augmenting the magnetic field to take advantage of the way a current affects a plasma .
However , because of the way it operates , the external magnetic field needed for an RFP is an order of magnitude smaller than the tokamak and the total ambient magnetic field is mostly the result of the current flowing through the plasma .
These factors would allow the reactor to be much smaller than a tokamak .
The RFP was previously thought to be less viable because of instabilities that force different layers of the plasma to resonate , creating a large chaotic region that is difficult to confine ( confinement of the plasma that fuels reactors is crucial ) .
When an RFP plasma behaves this way , it is referred to as being in a " multiple - helicity state . "
The newly published research has shown that it is possible to encourage one of the resonant modes to become dominant while forcing secondary modes to have a smaller and finite amplitude that does n't interfere with the primary mode .
This results in a quasi - single - helicity state , which has no chaotic region and is highly confineable .
The higher the current that is passed through the plasma , the easier the QSH state is to achieve .
There is some residual magnetic chaos , but the configuration is able to maintain consistent temperature gradients , which are necessary for a reactor to sustain its activity .
The increased current also encourages the formation of " islands " of magnetic field .
Once the islands have appeared , it is possible for the primary mode magnetic island to merge into the main magnetic axis , causing both to disappear .
On a larger scale and over time , this field cancellation allows for the reactor to transition to a more stable equilibrium .
While researchers have not yet achieved an exact single - helicity state , the emergence of a QSH through the process described above provides theoretical support for the existence of a single - helicity state , which would be even more confineable and have less magnetic chaos .
Likewise , the experimental results show that a plasma in an RPF with an increasing current does evolve towards the desired single - helicity state .
Because an RPF is characteristically stable with low external fields , easily confined , and heated only by passing a current , it is technologically simple and has the potential to enable the production of a small - scale fusion reactor .
However , because the exact desired state has not been experimentally confirmed , fusion - powered cell phones and toasters are still a long way off .

Debate is really heating up on health care reform and at the center of that debate is Obama ’s proposal to create a public plan option to compete with private insurance companies .
Right now support is running high for the public option .
A recent CBS / New York Times poll showed 72 percent favoring “ the government offering everyone a government administered health insurance plan — something like the Medicare coverage that people 65 and older get — that would compete with private health insurance plans , ” compared to just 20 percent who were opposed .
Why is support for a public plan running so high ?
The chief reason is the public ’s overriding concern with health care costs .
Polls consistently show that people are most dissatisfied about health care costs , both for themselves and for the country as a whole .
This pattern is nicely illustrated by data from a March CNN poll showing 17 percent dissatisfied with the quality of the health care they receive , 26 percent dissatisfied with their health care coverage , 48 percent dissatisfied with their total health care costs , and 77 percent dissatisfied with the country ’s total health care costs .
So people are hugely concerned with health care costs — and they have little faith that private insurance companies , left to their own devices , can deal with this problem .
In fact , they believe by a wide 59 - 26 margin that the government — and not private insurance companies — can do a better job holding down health care costs .
That ’s why the public sees a public plan as critical to ensuring effective competition to lower prices in the health care marketplace .
In an April Kaiser Family Foundation survey , the public , by 57 - 39 , said the “ better way to encourage health insurance companies to provide the best product for the lowest price ” is to have private insurance companies and a public plan compete with one another instead of private insurance companies competing amongst themselves .
Thus the public is centrally concerned with high health care costs and sees a public plan as central to dealing effectively with that problem .
Including a public plan option as part of health care reform is therefore both good policy and good politics .

This is not my first time fantasizing about calling Austin Texas home .
Imagine the added element of water sports on top of the usual mental meanderings of furniture arrangements and dinner parties .
588 W. Lakecrest Drive , located on Shaw Island , this 3 br / 3 ba home is perched on Lake Buchanan in Austin Texas , with a selling price at $ 450,000 .
In reality , even the fantasy of this house is more home than I would ever want for myself .
Instead – how bout you buy it !!
We can be friends and you can invite me over for the weekend .
I ’ll leave my cute little early century bungalow in downtown Austin , to join you for afternoons of boating , fishing and sipping whiskey sours out of vintage tiki inspired mugs .
I ’ll bring my dog and my ipod but you ’ll emphatically insist we listen to nothing but bossa nova records all weekend .

And now a quick word from our sponsors !
SHOP OUR VIBES :
With its population ageing faster than any other country , Japan is faced with a dramatic rise in the number of suicidal and depressed elderly .
" Suicide has become a national epidemic , " the Japanese Government announced after the number of people taking their own lives reached an all time high of 30,000 in one year .
And the group most at risk is the elderly .
We do not want to be a burden on our families .
We have been through a lot , and we are not afraid of death
We do not want to be a burden on our families .
We have been through a lot , and we are not afraid of death
Satsu Takahashi
The birth rate is dropping sharply , and the population is ageing rapidly , leading to fears that the weak economy will not be able to bear the strain of a top heavy society .
Satsu Takahashi is in her 70s .
Her family are rice farmers in Akita , in northern Japan .
But rice growing is a declining industry .
Both Satsu 's brothers hanged themselves , and she has also attempted suicide .
" It was because of our financial problems , " Satsu Takahashi explains .
She had a rope in her hands but stopped herself in time .
A matter of honour
" It was because of pride , " she continues .
" We do not want to be a burden on our families .
We have been through a lot , and we are not afraid of death . "
Suicide in Japan is not only regarded as a way out of depression .
In a proud , stoical society it is also seen as matter of honour .
The history of the kamikaze pilots and the samurai warriors are illustrations of this in history .
Mrs Takahashi's generation survived the Second World War .
They were the ones who help re-build Japan out of the ashes .
And Japan became the envy of the industrial world .
But now Mrs Takahashi and others are bearing the brunt of Japan 's recession .
Too proud to talk
The town of Yuri in remote , snow - bound Akita is notorious for having the highest rate of suicide amongst the elderly .
Doctors and nurses in Japan are not trained to recognise depression

Naoki Watanabe , doctor
They do not talk to therapists or doctors about their problems .
" We like to keep it within the family , " Mrs Takahashi says .
One doctor , an expert in suicide and depression , Naoki Watanabe , commutes regularly from his university in Tokyo , to Akita , to try to help .
" Generally , doctors and nurses in Japan are not trained to recognise depression .
And old people feel shame talking about their problems , " he explains .
" Traditional family life in Japan is breaking down , so there is little support for them , " he continues .
" Their children are leaving the countryside and going to the cities to work and live . "
Loneliness
Echio Sato is 81 years - old .
She lives with her son and his family but they do not talk to her , or involve her in family life .
And she cannot afford to move to a retirement home .
She weeps every day .
" My food is left in the kitchen for me and I eat on my own ... I would like to be happy for just one hour a day . "
However , many of Japan 's old people do enjoy good health and wealth .
They hold half the country 's savings and private health care is booming .
A lucrative " silver market " offers goods specially suited to the elderly , such as extra - loud alarm clocks and tailor - made holidays .
And luxurious private nursing homes are making up for a shortfall in state care .
But in rural areas like Akita it is a different story .
There is poverty and a culture of silence .
Confronting the problem
The government - local , regional and national - has been shocked by the suicide statistics .
Some money is being put into raising awareness .
Telephone help lines are available and GPs are being taught how to treat depression .
I now know that we share the same problems
I now know that we share the same problems
Echio Sato
The elderly are also being encouraged out of their homes into new community centres , which hold special activities for the elderly .
Echio Sato , the 81 year - old great - grandmother , now attends a keep fit class in Yuri 's community centre once a week .
" I also do origami and love dancing ! "
She giggles .
She is happy when she sees her friends .
" I can talk to the other old people when we meet up .
I now know that we share the same problems . "
But Japan has a long way to go before it reduces its suicide rate .
It is a society going through a major upheaval , with lessons for all ageing , greying societies .
BBC Radio 4's Crossing Continents was broadcast on Thursday , 20 March , 2003 at 1102 GMT .
A man who partly severed his foot after tumbling into the well of a moving train car in Toronto 's west end was able to pull out his cellphone and call 911 as he was carried more than 5 kilometres .
Toronto police Sgt. Tim Burrows said three friends were drinking on a train parked in the Lambton rail yards .
When the train started to move , Burrows said , he tumbled into the well of a container car , where his leg slipped through an opening and was dragged along the ground .
" Trespassing , leading to misadventure , leading to ouch ! " Burrows said .
The man fell into the train car at the CP rail yards near Runnymede Ave. and Dundas .
St. W. , and was carried almost to Bathurst St .
When rescuers found the man , in his twenties , his right foot was partially severed .
That 's when he told police he had made the 911 call .
He was taken to St. Michael 's Hospital in serious but stable condition .
CHM files , known as Microsoft Compressed HTML
Help files , are a common format for eBooks and online documentation .
They are basically a collection of HTML files stored in a compressed archive with the added benefit of an index .
Under Linux , you can view a CHM file with the xchm viewer .
But sometimes that ’s not enough .
Suppose you want to edit , republish , or convert the CHM file into another format such as the Plucker eBook format for viewing on your Palm .
To do so , you first need to extract the original HTML files from the CHM archive .
This can be done with the CHMLIB ( CHM library ) and its included helper application extract_chmLib .
In Debian or Ubuntu :
$ sudo apt - get install libchm - bin $ extract_chmLib book.chm outdir
where book.chm is the path to your CHM file and outdir is a new directory that will be created to contain the HTML extracted from the CHM file .
In other Linuxes , you can install it from source .
First download the libchm source archive from the above website .
I could n’t get the extract_chmLib utility to compile under the latest version 0.38 , so I used version 0.35 instead .
$ tar xzf chmlib - 0.35.tgz $ cd chmlib - 0.35 / $ ./ configure $ make $ make install $ make examples
After doing the “ make examples “ , you will have an executable extract_chmLib in your current directory .
Here is an example of running the command with no arguments and the output it produces :
$ ./extract_chmLib usage : ./extract_chmLib < chmfile > < outdir >
After running the utility to extract the HTML files from your CHM file , the extracted files will appear in < outdir > .
There wo n’t be an “ index.html ” file , unfortunately .
So you ’ll have to inspect the filenames and / or their contents to find the appropriate main page or Table of Contents .
Now the HTML is yours to enjoy !

LONDON — In America , the health care debate is about to come to a boil .
President Barack Obama has put pressure on both houses of Congress to pass versions of his flagship domestic legislative program prior to their August recess .
Good luck .
Opponents are filling the airwaves with the usual litany of lies , damned lies and statistics about socialized medicine and the twin nightmare of bureaucratically rationed health care and high taxes amongst allies like Britain , France and Germany .
So here is a brief overview of health care in some of Europe 's biggest economies :
Britain's National Health Service is paid for out of a social security tax .
Services are free at the point of provision .
No co-pay , no reimbursement .
The budget last year was 90 billion pounds ( about $ 148 billion ) .
That makes the average cost per person about 1,500 pounds ( $ 2,463 ) .
The NHS is big — huge , in fact .
With 1.5 million employees it is one of the largest employers in the world .
Only China 's People 's Liberation Army , India 's state railways and good old Wal - Mart employ more folks .
Sixty percent of the NHS budget goes toward salaries .
The French system is run on a compulsory purchase of insurance through the workplace .
The insurance cost is based on how much a worker earns .
Low - income workers pay nothing .
The average contribution per person is about $ 4,000 .
The government sets fees for services and negotiates the price of drugs with pharmaceutical companies .
Service is not free at the point of provision .
But reimbursement for costs is swift and in the case of catastrophic illness all fees are waived .
People are free to purchase supplementary insurance from private companies .
With a compulsory insurance plan , as in France , German care is universal and equitable .
Germans pay approximately 14.3 percent of their earnings to buy this insurance .
As in France , people are free to buy supplementary private health insurance .
Each system is unique ( as are all the systems around Europe ) but they have two things in common that make them different from the United States : Coverage is universal and the cost of care as a percentage of GDP is significantly less .
For Europeans — even those who would label themselves conservatives — American attitudes to setting up a universal health care system with strong state participation and management seem bizarre .
The peace of mind that comes from knowing that in an emergency you will be taken care of and you wo n't be financially ruined has no price .
Why resist it ?
Beccy Ashton , policy adviser at health care think tank The King 's Fund , worked for more than half a decade in the U.S.
She explains the difference this way : " In Europe healthcare is regarded as a human right .
In America , people think of it as a commodity that you buy . "
If you look at how the Big Three 's health systems came into being you realize changing American attitudes may be difficult .
Britain and France created their systems out of the rubble of World War II .
Pushed from below , the leaders of both nations sought to bring greater social equality to their societies .
Social security systems were set up with equal access to health care given pride of place .
This was n't done without facing down doctors and insurance companies , but politicians are never so bold as when the public will for something is clear .
In 1945 in both Britain and France , there was no going back to the status quo before the war started .
Germany 's system has the weight of history behind it .
Its origins can be traced back to the first era of German unification when Chancellor Otto von Bismarck created the First Reich .
In the 1880s he set up a system of compulsory health insurance by workers and employers and other forms of social security .
He did not invent the system out of nothing .
There had been a tradition among the German guilds going back to the Middle Ages of members making compulsory contributions to help their brothers in old age or if a colleague had to stop working because of injury .
Clearly , America at this moment in time has not recently experienced an epoch - shattering historical event like a World War and despite Obama 's comparative popularity , he does n't have the clout of an Iron Chancellor to simply decree what he wants and know that Congress will rubber stamp it .
Beccy Ashton points out , " The President must be aware of the fine line he has to walk .
If he goes forward with a radical agenda , he knows you 've lost before you 've started . "
So people in Europe continue to watch with bemusement as American legislators grapple with reforming a system that basically needs to be junked .
Professionals like Ashton answer calls from reporters and try to refute right - wing misinformation that floats around the debate .
Those damned lies and statistics .
The only statistics on health care systems that really matter are life expectancy and infant mortality .
Both speak to accessability and affordability .
If you want to know how the U.S. , the wealthiest nation on earth , stacks up , here you go :
In life expectancy , the U.S. ranks 38th or 45th depending on whether one uses the United Nation 's statistics or those compiled by the CIA .
( In both cases , life expectancy in Cuba is higher ! )
According to the CIA World Factbook , the U.S. has many more infant deaths than its EU counterparts or northern socialist ( to right - wing ideologues ) neighbor , Canada .
While the U.S. has 6.26 deaths per live births , Canada had 5.04 .
Britain , France and Germany ?
4.85 , 3.33 and 3.99 , respectively .

Chinese state media confirmed Monday that a steel factory executive was beaten to death after thousands of workers gathered to protest the takeover of their company .
Chen Guojun , an executive at Jianlong Steel Holding Co. , died Friday after an angry mob in the northeastern rust belt city of Tonghua beat him and then blocked ambulances from reaching him , according to the China Daily .
The protesters worked at the state - owned Tonghua Iron and Steel Group , which was going to be sold to Chen ’s privately owned Jianlong Steel .
Chen sparked the riot by announcing 30,000 workers would be laid off , the newspaper said .
They dispersed later only after they were assured by authorities the sale would not go through .

More and more , I have come to believe that state regulation of anything not only destroys liberty but also is essentially irrational for those on the receiving end , which is frequently most of us and very often many of us .
Somebody always stands to gain , but the costs they impose on others are much larger .
Irrationality is not easy to define , but if a group of people or a society consistently choose ways to accomplish goals that do not accomplish the purposes efficiently or effectively , and if they continually spurn available methods that would , they are acting irrationally .
If a method is available and has been used in the past that works , I do not believe that we can attribute failure to use it and instead using a grossly ineffective method , to stupidity or ignorance .
I believe that the explanation lies elsewhere — within a societal arrangement , within the system that has been set up .
An organization is leading to the poor outcomes and irrationality .
The group or society has closed off , at least temporarily , the use of peaceful and reasonable methods and replaced them by the use of force .
The group has built unreasonable methods of force into its structure .
It has raised barriers to the use of anything but these methods of force .
Having done that , it has tied its own hands .
It can not escape the consequences , which will appear to be irrational and chaotic , of establishing an essentially irrational means of reaching its goals .
Why then do people adopt these methods of force and build up barriers against their removal so that they cannot easily return to rational means of dealing with their problems ?
Why do they create barriers to rationality and support for irrationality ?
I have in mind , of course , the state vs. the free market .
The state is the organization people turn to that uses force to solve problems and , I believe , necessarily results in irrational outcomes .
I could qualify this to — by and large creates irrational outcomes — but why quibble ?
It is hard to think of anything that the state does that is not irrational , so let us , for the sake of simplicity and clarity , simply say that everything it does is done by an irrational means ( force ) , thereby producing outcomes that are irrational .
View it as an hypothesis , if you will .
But in my mind it is actually an incontrovertible truth .
The use of force ( compulsion ) to solve most problems that the state is supposedly solving is , I believe , fundamentally irrational .
One might use force to handle invasions of one ’s rightful liberty , or to handle crime and war .
It is rational not to allow someone else to injure you , and force might be the best method to stop them ; but these standard uses of force are not what I have in mind .
I have in mind such matters as health care , where there is no case for using force at all and where instead the society chooses to use it to attain some end or ends rather than choosing that people solve their own problems in liberty , without force , which is to say in a free market .
And so the root question , which I have raised is this :
Why do people adopt government by force , that is , a state , when the results are irrational and do not conduce to their welfare ?
While there are many answers , the real problem with such a choice is that people who do not want a state are roped into the irrational arrangement and forced to comply with it and live by it .
State - mandated and regulated health care would be no burden on those of us who think it ’s irrational if we could go our merry ways without it , while all those who wanted it could have it to their heart ’s content .
The odds are that when the latter saw how dysfunctional their system was as compared with our free market system , they would abandon their loyalty to force and come over to our method .
I cannot help suspecting that those who build up a state system are anxious to corral everyone into it and quash the free market for this very reason , that if the free market remains as a living case study of liberty vs. compulsion , the victory will go to liberty and compulsion will go down for the count .
If this is the case , then I reach the conclusion that " people , " meaning all people , do not adopt government - by - force ( a state ) if they know what they are doing .
Some people manage to get going this form of government - by - force by hook or by crook , by all sorts of means that history shows us , or as such writers as Oppenheimer and Nock show us , have been used at one time or another ; and once that force is in place , once there is the beginning of prison walls , the state itself can build up those walls over time .
It definitely helps the case for liberty to understand how certain people who love the use of force and love the state go about their business of making liberty disappear .
It also helps the case for liberty to understand that the basic outcome , which is state control by compulsion over peaceful and innocent activities such as providing health care , is irrational .
Would it be rational to have a state control the production and distribution of pizza or shoes or computers or pets or movies or music by the use of compulsion and regulation ?
Would we observe pizza stores located where they now are located , open at the hours they are open , providing the variety they provide , at the prices they now charge ?
Would our pizza desires be satisfied via government - mandated pizzas ?
If our desires for pizza waned and were replaced by desires for submarine sandwiches , would the state respond quickly and effectively ?
Evidently not , for the state is not a business .
It does not respond to the profit incentive .
Health care , like it or not , is a business .
It takes resources to produce it .
It takes toil and sacrifice .
We cannot deny Adam Smith ’s wisdom .
A doctor is not doctoring us out of the goodness of his heart and generosity , even if he does possess the milk of human kindness .
He is responding to an economic problem wherein he , as much as the pizza baker , has to use limited resources to achieve his ends .
No better system — no more rational system — has ever been found for producing health care than a system of liberty in which the choices are left up to the patients who are the buyers and the doctors ( or other health care providers ) who are the sellers .
Profit signals are good .
State - controlled health care lacks these .
It is far inferior .
Bureaucrats and legislators are not doctors and not profit - oriented .
If they respond at all to what people want , it is in the most obtuse , roundabout , and counterproductive ways .
They seek to augment their own positions or those who pay them off .
They produce nothing .
Once power and force are used to reach ends , resources are wasted jockeying for a slice of the regulated and / or taxed pie .
These remarks are prompted both by the pending health care legislation in Congress and a few articles appearing this morning about health care in Massachusetts , but especially the latter because several years ago I wrote three articles heavily critical of the changes in the Massachusetts system brought about under Mitt Romney .
Of course I am critical of the entire system .
It is all irrational .
It is pure madness for a society to have the state construct a health care system that it controls by regulation .
This view is not widely appreciated .
But even to the extent that it is appreciated , many of those who view such state control with misgivings or even alarm do not understand that any state regulation and control in health care is bound to produce irrational outcomes .
There is no conceivable combination of regulations or changes that can " fix " the system .
As long as force is introduced as a method of handling the goal of creating and distributing health care , and a state necessarily uses force , the results are going to be irrational .
Three years after Massachusetts instituted its new health care system , the system is not working .
Costs are rising " by more than 8 percent annually . "
Year in and year out since Medicare was adopted in 1965 , I have regularly heard that medical costs were rising at 8 percent annually .
The needle seems to be stuck .
When I have n’t heard that , I have read instead that medical costs are rising at twice the rate of inflation .
You would think that after 45 years , the people would wake up .
Just the opposite .
The state will never wake up .
It , as I have said , can only act irrationally in providing services and reaching health care ends that satisfy consumers , and the inflation in medical care costs is evidence in support of that proposition .
But evidently the state is very effective in manipulating thought so that consumers continue to prefer its irrationality over a rational method of health care provision , which is liberty and a free market .
Massachusetts has an incredibly Byzantine system of commissions and boards to control health care in the state .
What made news is that one of these commissions is recommending a change in the way that doctors and hospitals are paid .
Previous compulsory mandates have produced excess demand and rising prices .
The article speaks of " heavy use of hospitals . "
The state is now looking for ways to ration health care .
This is it : price controls and rationing .
That is often the end - result of getting rid of free markets , wholly or partially .
None of this is really news .
We have seen it all before .
It is all predictable .
That is why we have to conclude that the system of state - compelled health care and regulation is fundamentally irrational .
Society is choosing means to achieve its ends that are not achieving those ends .
Society is getting the opposite — worse medical care and more problems than ever .
And I believe that this irrationality is a constant and necessary outcome whenever the state gets into the act of controlling and regulating goods that can be produced in liberty .
The commission proposes that payments will no longer be made one at a time for each service that is provided .
Instead doctors and hospitals would be given a fixed or budgeted amount and they would have to work within that budget during a year ’s time .
The economic result of this is that they would be forced into rationing health care services to patients .
There would no longer be negotiated fees between insurers and doctors .
The market , such as it is which is already defaced , would be entirely obliterated .
In this system , the individual demands of health care buyers no longer have any say .
Health care becomes entirely collective .
Taxes are collected by the state and insurers , and then they dole out the money to providers .
The person who obtains the service is left out in the cold , at the mercy of this system .
This is fascism with a vengeance .
Like all state - controlled methods of providing goods and services , fascism is fundamentally irrational .
So that you will know who your immediate enemies are , they include the insurers .
I quote the article :
" u2018 This is an historic moment , an extraordinary moment in healthcare in Massachusetts , ’ Andrew Dreyfus , senior vice president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts and a commission member , said after the panel ’s vote .
u2018I urge the Legislature and the administration to take this up quickly . ’ "
In an earlier article , I referred to the health care system as " Aetnacare . "
More fundamentally , we ourselves are our own worst enemy .
Our society and our system are committed to government - by - force — to compulsion .
Our society and our system not only allow fascism but want it .
If we want irrationality , we shall have it .
And we are getting it .

Futurama original voice cast changed , budget cuts
20th Century Fox TV has officially announced Futurama ‘s return for another season next year .
However , reports point towards a major change in the series : the original voice cast would have to be changed .
Fox TV had previously announced that Futurama , a TV series created by Matt Groening of The Simpsons , would be airing 26 new episodes come mid-2010 , with Comedy Central already signed in the works , and the show ’s original stars already on board .
However , reports also say that the studio , along with its major cast , has had discussions regarding their compensations , to which the studio could not afford to meet .
Billy West , Katey Sagal , John DiMaggio , among others , had formally expressed their interest in signing on for the next season of the show , but apparently , Fox TV cannot meet the salaries that the actors and actresses were asking for because of budget cuts .
The studio has subsequently put out audition / casting calls for certain parts in the series .

An underground youth culture in Japan which makes a rebellious fashion statement against traditional rules on eastern beauty , is taking hold on Britain 's youth .
Manba involves devotees wearing dark tans , white make - up around their eyes and hair that is often a combination of neon colours .
British teenagers like 18 - year - olds Eilish and Declan got caught up in manba after an interest in Japanese culture led them to start researching on the internet , where they came across the style .
Manba in Japan is also known as ganguro , gonguro , yamamba and mamba .
Yama - uba in Japanese is the name of a mountain hag in Japanese folklore whom the fashion is thought to resemble .
It has been around for nearly a decade and is an eye - catching statement against conformity .
When the practitioners began darkening their skin , widening their eyes and wearing blue contact lenses , they were making a rebellious statement against the traditions of fair - skinned beauty .
The rebellion has now , perhaps somewhat ironically , been taken up by Britain 's naturally fair - skinned youth .
I went to spend some time with Eilish and Declan to find out why the fashion appeals them to .
Glitter
When I met them early one morning , they had already started applying their make - up as they planned to meet other British members of their Japanese circle later that afternoon in London 's China Town .
I just think it looks good - nowadays it 's more popular to be tanned
Declan
They start their routine by applying self tan to their bodies .
Eilish rubs the self tan on her neck but her face is darkened much more heavily .
She smears the coffee - bean powder on her pale skin and tries to rub it in so that it does not look " patchy " .
Declan explains that he buys his foundation from Afro- Caribbean shops as normal shops do not sell powders that are dark enough .
They then use black eyeliner pencils and a white marker pens to create big eyes which look like they droop , framed by false eyelashes .
The look is finished off with glitter and white lipstick .
They tell me they learnt to apply the make - up through watching make - up tutorials on YouTube .
Declan and Eilish say they have been accused of racism for darkening their skin in this way , but they say this could not be further from the truth .
Eilish insists that she is " not mocking anybody " and Declan asks , " what black person looks like this ? "
Another member of the group says that she does not like her white skin and covers up if she is unable to get a spray tan .
" I just think it looks good - nowadays it 's more popular to be tanned , " Declan adds .
The British followers of this Japanese subculture are also into the music , which is called Eurobeat , and practise dance moves called Para - Para .
" It 's kind of like line dancing , " says Eilish .
" But it 's a group dance where everyone does the same thing and it just uses your hands . "
Group following Eilish 's mobile phone rings every time she receives a message on Facebook .
Her social networks are important as she has friends in Japan and the US who are also into the style .
We 're Western girls trying to be Japanese girls , trying to be Western - it seems like a funny circle to go around
Gabby , manba follower
" There 's a Japanese Facebook [ type of site ] called Mixi and there are a lot of manba on there and when they find out that you 're manba in the UK , they 're like , ' what ? ! ' "
" They all speak in Japanese so I have to use a translator to talk to them .
There are also some in America .
I 'm quite good friends with some of the girls who do it in America . "
Eilish 's father Peter thinks that his daughter might look a bit strange , but she is , he says , " learning about another culture "
Her mother insists that the style is about much more than just " dressing up " .
She tells me she thinks that this is more about creative expression and that she admires her daughter for her interest .
As we all walk out the house and down the street , people look .
Brightly coloured hair , clothes and unusual make - up sets them apart from the crowds who are travelling into London on the underground .
Eilish says that people often do n't want to sit next to them .
In China Town , Eilish and Declan meet some of their follow manba followers .
Gabby , 22 , with her bright pink hair and sunglasses , says she loves the style .
" I think it 's adorable , it looks really cute , it takes a lot of skill , " she says .
" Some people have the attitude that Western girls can't do it as well , but we 're doing our own thing . "
Toni , 21 , says she really likes to have make - up that creates really wide eyes .
She acknowledges though that it might " sound really silly " because what they are doing is trying to be like the girls in Japan who are trying to look like Western girls .
" We 're Western girls trying to be Japanese girls , trying to be Western - it seems like a funny circle to go around . "

If you do n’t own a launch PS3 chances are you wo n’t be able to use it to play PS2 games , because they ’re missing the PS2 ’s Emotion Engine chip and thus do n’t have the backwards compatibility .
However , that could all change , because Sony has developed and patented a way to translate instructions from an Emotion Engine chip into chunks that can be referenced by a different , but more powerful processor .
Whilst I ’m not up on the techniques used by emulators , it ’s worth mentioning that Sony appear to have this ready to go running in “ an example of a host system based on a cell processor that may be configured to emulate the target system . ” .
A PS3 , then .
If this means that we ’ll finally have a way to emulate PS2 games successfully in software ( as we ’ve been hinting at for years ) then this could pave the way for Store downloads of such titles .
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
Whether this is all purely conceptual or not is n’t clear either , but if anyone can do this it is the software engineers in the PS3 ’s firmware department , a tiny little shed behind Kaz ’s house filled with steaming potions , and lots of coloured wires .
Either this is planned for the rumoured PS3 Slim , or maybe , just maybe , firmware 3.0 will have something much , much bigger up its sleeve than just grief reporting .
We ’ll see .

Three is back for the last session of the Alpha Course .
I ask if she ’s been ok and she responds by telling me that she ’s fine and the reason why she missed last week ’s session was because of a family member ’s birthday party .
I ’m relieved that she ’s fit and well .
She ’s a nice lady , happy and bubbly , calm , well spoken , unassuming , and though I ’m fond of every member of the group I must say I ’m of the opinion that she ’s the best of the bunch .
I take to my seat and the pastor walks over to me and says , “ Here ’s a leaving present for you ” , and hands me a book that I seem to remember him mentioning last week .
It ’s called , “ Secret Believers ” , by Brother Andrew .
I take a look at the back cover and read the blurb , which says , “ Here are the terrifying true stories of the men and women – born Muslims and still living in strict Islamic states – who have chosen to convert to Christianity . ”
I thank the pastor and put the book on the table beside me .
For the next few minutes we talk about Muslims and Islam .
Lady
Three chips in to tell us that certain people , “ always used to have a go ” at her husband for being a Christian , and that these certain people never used to say anything of a similar derogatory nature about Muslims and Islam .
Lady
Three ’s husband was curious as to why this was so , that is until a friend of his , who “ was n’t of any particular faith ” , said “ I can tell you the reason why they have a go at you about your faith .
What you have has got them worried ”
Yes , that ’s right , non-believers poke fun at Christianity because they ’re deeply worried by its power and truth .
And , of course , no one pokes fun at other religions because they ’re just so obviously false that they ’re not even worthy of ridicule .
Yeah , that sounds like a convincing argument .
And no doubt a completely true story , too .
Or something like that .
The conversation continues about Muslims and Islam .
I stop to think why it is that the group are concentrating on Islam rather than any other faith .
Maybe the truth of Islam has them worried ?
No , maybe not .
Maybe that kind of argument is just silly .
Christians use it all the same , though .
As we ’re talking , my eye catches a glimpse of a heavy - looking cardboard folder which is positioned under Lady Three ’s chair .
I remember the pastor telling me that Lady Three had spent many hours on the Internet investigating these so - called “ sons of god ” that I had mentioned to her a couple of weeks ago .
Maybe she ’s prepared a dossier to counter my claims , as I joked she might .
Only a moment or two after I notice the folder , Lady Three turns to me and says , “ I ’ve got some things for you , Stephen ” .
She can barely contain her excitement as she reaches under her chair for the aforementioned folder , thuds the bulging beast on her lap , and proceeds to pull out a host of documents .
“ I ’ve spent quite a lot of time studying the names you gave me a couple of weeks ago ” , says Lady Three .
“ Yes , [ the pastor ] tells me you ’ve been hard at work on the Internet .
Four hours in one session alone , so I hear ” , I reply .
She hands me a document , about five or six pages thick , which turns out to be a printout of a Wikipedia entry regarding the question of Jesus ’ historicity .
I thank her kindly for going to such effort , but also tell her that I ’ve read the article previously .
I promise to take it home with me and read it once more , though .
She then delves some more into the folder and pulls out another computer printout .
“ You know the list of names you gave me ? ” , she rhetorically asks , referring to the “ sons of god ” list , “ Well , I ’ve looked them up and most of them were listed on a site by this fellow ” .
She hands me the document and at the top reads the name “ Kersey Graves ” .
To those of you who are not familiar with the name – Kersey Graves was a 19th century writer most famous for his book “ The World ’s Sixteen Crucified Saviors ” , which is a book that I own and have read .
Unfortunately for Graves he fails to cite sources for many of his claims and is therefore deemed by modern historians as “ unreliable and unscholarly ” .
Richard Carrier , a well - renowned speaker , writer , and atheist , who also holds a PhD in ancient history , says of Graves , “ [ Y ] ou will never be able to tell what he has right from what he has wrong without totally redoing all his research and beyond , which makes him utterly useless to historians as a source ”
It ’s fair to say , too , that Graves has been the target of heavy and prolonged criticism by Christian scholars , and the butt of many of their jokes .
He ’s been an easy target , and perhaps justifiably so .
I explain all of this to Lady Three .
“ Oh ” , she says , “ his was the website that I found all the names on , you see .
And he ’s not very credible . ”
I ’m curious , why would Lady Three ’s search for the names that I mentioned ( Perseus , Hercules , Mithras , and Dionysus – all well known characters in Greek and Roman mythology ) bring up the name “ Kersey Graves ” ?
A quick Google search for their names does n’t bring up an immediate link to his work , so I ’m thinking that Lady Three must have searched high and low for a website , most probably a pro-Christian one , that proclaims Jesus Christ to be the only true “ son of god ” in the history of mankind .
Graves , being the easy target that he is , was probably mentioned in such a website , and Lady Three had latched onto that with a vengeance .
Lady
Three looks a little flustered as she searches some more within the depths of her folder .
I ’m beginning to think that she was of the opinion coming into this evening ’s session that tonight was the night where she would deliver her winning hand against the pesky sceptic , a certain Mr Butterfield , who , in her eyes at least , has been attempting to poison the minds of the group for the last eleven weeks .
Sadly , for her , the royal flush that she thought she was holding has turned out to be a busted flush , much to her dismay .
She pulls out another thick printout , “ This is from a Christian website , admittedly , but it ’s about all the non-Christian sources that mention Jesus ” , she says .
Then sheepishly asks , “ You may have read it ? ” I take a quick look at the page headings , “ Josephus ” , “ Tacitus ” , “ Suetonius ” , “ Pliny the Younger ” , and so on .
Names we have discussed in previous sessions , none of whom were contemporaneous sources , which is what I ’d asked for , and the earliest , Josephus , is almost universally regarded as a much later interpolation ( most proabably from the 4th century A.D ) .
I explain this to Lady Three and ask if she managed to stumble upon any contemporaneous , extra-biblical sources that made mention of Jesus , his miracles , his crucifixion , and his resurrection .
“ I think Josephus wrote during that time .
I think someone told me that he wrote about Jesus in 40 AD ” , she says .
“ Josephus was n’t born until 37AD ” , I reply , and add that “ His Antiquities were written in 93 AD ” After all of Lady Three ’s hard work I do feel rather uncomfortable having to disregard it , but I thank her so very kindly for making the effort .
The pastor , like he did in a previous session , attempts to explain the contemporary silence about Jesus : Pastor : “ The wife of a friend of mine studies Church history .
I spoke to her about the fact that you ’d raised the question about the silence of contemporaneous sources .
She told me that they were such a small band of people , and that the people around Jesus would n’t have been able to write . ”
Me : “ It does say in the Bible that Jesus was attracting huge crowds wherever he went .
And that there were earthquakes , and that zombies popped out of their tombs in their multitudes , and that these zombies walked into the city to reveal themselves unto the crowds [ Matthew 27 : 51 - 53 ] .
Yet not a single account outside of the Bible can be found to support such a story ”
Pastor : [ Long pause ]
“ It ’s because they tried to deny it ”
Me : “ What do you mean ? ”
Pastor : [ Looking very uncomfortable ]
“ They obviously did n’t perceive it as significant ”
Me : “ I think zombies leaping out of their graves and marching into the nearest city would have been quite a significant event .
Do n’t you ? ”
Pastor : [ Very long pause ]
“ People are very sceptical about it all , are n’t they ”
Me : “ But no one even wrote about them being sceptical about such events .
There ’s absolutely no mention of them anywhere ”
Pastor : [ He shrugs his shoulders , sighs , leans back in his chair , then whispers ] “ Fascinating ”
At this point Lady Three offers her own viewpoint : Lady Three : “ There was talk about Christians later on , though .
To me , they would n’t be talking about someone who had n’t actually existed . ”
No one doubts the existence of Christians .
The fact that later sources mentioned Christians is not direct confirmation that there existed a historical Jesus .
Using her line of thinking I could confirm the existence of any God or indeed any fictional character , just by appealing to the people who wrote about them or believed in them .
Which , of course , is just silly .
Lady
Three continues in a similar vein : Lady
Three : “ He [ Jesus ] must have existed in order for them to be followers of him ”
Me : “ Would you take a similar view of Krishna , then ? ”
Lady Three : “ Krishna ? ”
Me : “ There have been followers of Krishna for 3,000 years .
Does the fact that people believe in him prove to you that he was a historical character ? ”
Lady Three : [ Avoiding the question altogether ]
“ If the people who wrote about Jesus did n’t believe he existed they would have written in their work , “ But there ’s no evidence that he actually existed ” .
If they were proper historians that ’s what they would have said . ”
This is a comment that barely deserves a response so I ’m thankful that the pastor intervenes at this point and jokes , “ Steve has kept [ Lady Three ] very busy for the last two weeks ! ” .
We all smile and Lady Three slides her humongous folder back under her chair .
“ It ’s definitely an interesting subject , though ” , she says .
She ’s right , it ’s a fascinating subject .
“ What ’s it about ? ” asks a bemused Lady Two , whose been sat glassy - eyed , staring into empty space for the last twenty - five minutes .
I like Lady Two a great deal , but she does n’t talk ( or listen ) until the time arises when she thinks it ’s a good opportunity to offer us her testimony .
It ’s just so bizarre .
The pastor switches on the DVD player , then inserts the last of Nicky Gumbel ’s presentations which is entitled , “ How Can I Make The Most Of The Rest Of My Life ? ” Gumbel starts by asking , “ How do we make the most of the rest of our lives ? ” .
To answer this question he gives us the words of the Apostle Paul : “ Therefore , I urge you , brothers , in view of God ’s mercy , to offer your bodies as living sacrifices , holy and pleasing to God — this is your spiritual act of worship .
Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind .
Then you will be able to test and approve what God ’s will is — his good , pleasing and perfect will . ”
[ Romans 12:1 - 2 ]
Gumbel then spends a couple of minutes dissecting that passage and explaining to the audience in simple terms what Saint Paul actually meant .
He then tells us that , as Christians , we should n’t give in to the temptation of taking off our “ Christian uniform ” and mingling in with the rest of the crowd .
“ What we ’re called to be is distinctive , to retain our Christian identity wherever we are and whatever the circumstance . ”
As Christians we should avoid backbiting and character assassination , and instead try to think of something positive to say about somebody .
This is , of course , an admirable approach .
Gumbel then touches on the subject of sexual immorality : “ We are called to demonstrate the blessing of keeping God ’s standards .
God LOVES us .
God loves YOU .
God is the creator of marriage .
God is the creator of sex .
It was God who INVENTED sex .
He came up with the idea of sex ! ”
He continues , “ God made us sexual beings .
And the Biblical context is lifelong commitment in marriage . ” and “ It ’s God ’s perfect plan that children should be brought up in an atmosphere of love and commitment and security . ”
I suppose drowning every baby in the world by sending a flood to kill them all demonstrates his “ love ” for his children .
And I suppose executing the innocent first - born children of the people of Egypt is another demonstration of his complete love .
Yes , God loves little children so much .
I sometimes wonder if Gumbel actually reads the Bible .
Gumbel then alludes to premarital sex and states , “ I ’ve never met anybody who has said to me , “ I really regret that I waited [ to have sex ] until my wedding day ” .
I ’ve met lots of people who said , “ I really wish I had waited because I made a mess of my life ” ” .
A mess ?
Gumbel recaps and tells us that in order to become fruitful Christians we should 1 ) Break with the past , and 2 ) Make a new start in life .
At this point we are given a story of when Gumbel , as a vicar , was taking a funeral service at his church .
The funeral was for a well - known , incredibly poor , homeless lady in the area who used to walk the streets begging for money .
Gumbel tells us that this lady was very aggressive and rude to people when she asked for money , and she had no friends at all .
However , oddly enough , her funeral was attended by lots of people .
Gumbel wondered why this was so , and was then told that “ Some years earlier she had inherited a HUGE fortune .
Millions of pounds ” and that ’s why all these people , obviously relatives , had crawled out of the woodwork .
Allegedly this lady had acquired an expensive flat in a trendy part of London as well as a number of expensive paintings .
“ Why would someone with all this money choose to live on the streets with all their rubbish ? ” , asks Gumbel .
Someone close to Gumbel answered , “ I think the problem was she did n’t want to leave behind the life she knew ” .
Gumbel tells us that he initially thought this to be absolutely absurd , but that was until he had a think and it dawned on him that , “ There are many people that are doing something even more absurd .
They ’re hanging on to the rubbish in their lives , and they ’re missing out not just on a flat – they ’re missing out on all the treasures that God has for us in our lives . ”
By this I suppose he means that non-Christians are the rude , aggressive street - urchins that waste their lives living amongst the rubbish , while the Christians of this world escape the flea - ridden hovels and choose instead to live in the palatial abodes of Christendom , where they bask ( and perhaps cower ) in the wonderful glory of the biggest bully in the universe : Yahweh .
Gumbel then tells us that even though Christians are lavished with all of God ’s treasures they should still be ambitious .
“ Jesus commands us to be ambitious ” , states Gumbel .
But we must make sure we ’re aiming for noble ambitions .
What is the point trying to earn lots of money , he asks .
“ Its pathetic ” , exclaims the wealthy Mr Gumbel .
“ What you should be saying is “ my priority is to seek God ’s kingdom and his righteousness . ” ”
Christians must remember to put God first in their lives because , as Gumbel says , “ If we live for ourselves we find ourselves in bondage , in slavery .
But if we present everything to God we find freedom ” Gumbel then turns up the heat , “ If you want an easy life , if you want a life of ease , please do n’t become a Christian because it ’s not easy being a Christian .
But if you want a GREAT life , a FULFILLING life – life at its BEST – then follow Jesus ! ” Great stuff .
Gumbel then tells us why it ’s not easy being a Christian : “ More people have died for their faith in Christ in the 20th century than in all the other centuries put together .
So it ’s not always easy being a Christian ” .
He then asks , “ So why should we do it ? ” “ First of all ” states Gumbel , “ for what God has planned for our lives ” .
But all of the hardship is worth it in the end , supposedly .
To the outsider this might sound absurd , but Gumbel tells us “ I had a totally false view of God before I was a Christian .
I thought God was a kind of spoilsport ;
God was a kind of person that if you gave your life to him he would destroy it ; he ’d take away all the things that were fun and good in our lives .
How absurd that is !
God LOVES us far more than we love our own children .
And the little sacrifices we have to make for him are NOTHING compared to the sacrifice that Jesus made for us on the cross ”
Does n’t this “ God loves us ” mantra get a little tiring after a while ?
Considering that all the evidence in the world suggests that , if he even exists , he could n’t care a jot about any of us .
To finish his presentation Gumbel offers us a tale about “ a wealthy English baron ” .
I ’ll let Gumbel take up the story : “ This man had one son who had left home .
When he was away from home he [ the son ] died .
This wealthy man never got over the loss of his son .
As his wealth increased he invested in valuable paintings .
When he died , his will called for all the paintings to be sold , and because he had such a great collection collectors and museums came from all over the world .
On the day of the auction the lawyer read from his will and what it said was this , “ The first painting to be sold in this auction is of my beloved son . ”
It was an unknown painting of poor quality , and the only person who bothered to bid for it was somebody who had worked for the family and who ’d known the boy and had loved him , and bought it for sentimental value and the memories it held .
Then the lawyer read the 2nd clause of the will : “ Whoever buys my son gets everything .
The auction is over . ” ”
This , of course , is to illustrate the point that whoever buys into Christianity ( to buy the son of God ) shall inherit all things .
Brilliant !
I ’m sure that if Baywatch star , David Hasselhoff , was asked to read aloud that story he would say , “ I ’m sorry buddy , I ca n’t read THAT .
It ’s too cheesy , even for me ! ”
For the last time the pastor ejects the DVD and switches on the lights .
My fellow sceptic gets up and goes to the toilet .
While he ’s away Lady
Two appears from the kitchen pushing the food trolley , which is stacked with all sorts of fancies .
I decide to break with tradition and actually eat something .
I plump for a chocolate bun .
“ YESSSSS !!!!! ” jokes the pastor , “ Steve ’s actually eating something ! ”
As we ’re eating , members of the group express how fond they are of Gumbel , and how great he is at his job .
Eventually my fellow sceptic returns from the toilet , sees that the room is peaceful , and jokes “ It has n’t got to loggerheads yet , then ? ” .
The pastor looks at my fellow sceptic , winks , then nods in my direction and says , “ Sssshhhhhh , he ’s eating his chocolate bun ! ” .
I look up , and also with a wink , joke , “ This should keep me quiet for the next forty minutes .
You should have offered me a chocolate bun in each of the previous ten sessions . ”
The group laugh .
When I first entered the room this evening I pictured the session ending with me delivering a rousing , Churchill - esque speech , in which I would point out the flaws and silliness of the arguments that I ’d heard during the last eleven weeks .
Now , though , I feel no desire to end it that way .
I ’ve now made a decision to sit quietly for the remainder of the session .
The group is in good spirits , and I ’ve decided that I ’d like to keep it that way .
I ’ll sit quietly for the remainder of the evening , shake hands at the end and wish everyone well for the future .
Nothing is going to get sorted tonight , that ’s for certain .
It ’s too late for that .
The group begin to speak about the supposed beauty of Christianity : Lady Two : “ It [ Christianity ] gives your life direction .
It gives it purpose .
You know where you ’re going .
You know what you ’re trying to aspire to and be .
You want to be filled with the fruits of the Holy Spirit and try to bring others into the fold .
That ’s your direction . ”
New Christian Male : “ It opens your eyes as well .
When you ’re filled with the Holy Spirit you just focus on that .
If previously you ’d been hitting wall after wall after wall , then after you ’ve been filled with the Holy Spirit those walls seem to break down .
That ’s one thing I ’ve learned from this course . ”
The pastor tells us about how he ’s always been honest in business , and how that ’s thanks to his firm Christian beliefs .
My fellow sceptic and the rest of the group discuss honesty in business .
It ’s an interesting discussion that lasts for about twenty minutes or so , and a number of different topics manage to find a way into the conversation , such as 1 ) how it ’s not easy to be a Christian , 2 ) the environment , 3 ) the lead singer of U2 , Bono , and 4 ) Cadbury ’s chocolate .
The Christians in the group then tell us of the challenges they face in daily life , and how their belief in God helps them overcome such challenges .
The next topic to crop up is that of heaven .
The pastor says that he ’d love to see a united Church where all races , ages and creeds came together as one .
“ Because that ’s what it ’s going to be like in heaven ” he says .
Lady
Two : “ Yes , everybody being loving and no backbiting .
Every one being kind and filled with the fruits of the Holy Spirit . ”
My fellow sceptic jokingly asks how they are all going to cope with no one to preach to ?
How will they get by without an insatiable thirst to convert people to their faith ?
What will these Christians find to do with their time if there are no heathens ?
“ We ’re all going to be concentrating on worshipping God ” , replies the pastor .
My fellow sceptic then wants to know how the pastor envisages heaven .
The pastor then tells us about how the Bible mentions God sitting on a throne , and how we ’ll all spend time praising his holy name .
He also mentions that it is unlikely that pets will be joining us in the hereafter .
So any of you reading this blog who are looking forward to seeing your favourite pet when you get to heaven , then forget it – as I have it on good authority that pets are n’t allowed in the heavenly realm .
God ’s orders .
I break my now thirty - minute silence by asking , “ How big is heaven ? ” Pastor : “ I do n’t know ”
Me : “ Is it bigger than the earth ? ”
Pastor : “ I guess so ”
Me : “ So there ’s going to be people separated by considerable distances , yes ? ”
Pastor : “ I do n’t know ” I ask that question because I ’m curious as to how we ’re going travel from A to B in heaven , particularly if the journey is of a considerable distance ( such as , say , from Britain to Australia ) .
Planes perhaps ?
Rockets ?
Jet packs ?
Star Trek style teleportation machines ?
Pastor : “ I think that ’s only an issue when we ’re bound by the body .
Once we ’re in spirit , once we ’re in our spiritual bodies , distance and time is just irrelevant . ”
I ’d love for him to explain exactly what he means by that , but the opportunity for me to ask does n’t present itself as my fellow sceptic jumps in wanting to know if we ’ll be able to recognise people in heaven .
The pastor is a bit vague in his response and basically admits that he has no idea [ again ? ] , but then says , “ That ’s like asking if someone dies when they ’re seven years old what age are they in heaven ? ”
I inform the pastor that British theologian , Alistair McGrath , believes we ’ll all be thirty years of age !
Here ’s a quote from one of his books : “ A final question that has greatly vexed Christian theologians concerns the age of those who are resurrected .
If someone dies at the age of 60 , will they appear in the streets of the New Jerusalem as an old person ?
And if someone dies at the age of 10 , will they appear as a child ?
This issue caused the spilling of much theological ink , especially during the Middle Ages .
By the end of the thirteenth century , an emerging consensus can be discerned .
As each person reaches their peak of perfection around the age of 30 , they will be resurrected as they would have appeared at that time – even if they never lived to reach that age …
The New Jerusalem will thus be populated by men and women as they would appear at the age of 30 ( the age , of course , at which Christ was crucified ) – but with every blemish removed . ”
Alistair McGrath , A Brief History of Heaven ( p.37 )
The long - standing male member picks up the topic and runs with it a little : Long - Standing Male Member : “ God talks about us reigning , but what we ’re going to reign over I do n’t know [ again ? ] .
Other planets , maybe , but I do n’t know .
If there ’s a new heaven and a new earth then what ’s to stop us going to other planets ? ”
My Fellow Sceptic :
“ So basically all of you are saying that you have no idea what it ’s going to be like , no idea where its going to be , no idea what ’s going to happen , no idea who ’ll be there , yet Christianity is all geared up towards “ Lets get to heaven ! ” ”
My fellow sceptic is on to something .
These people are obsessed with heaven , but , when asked to tell us about it , they know little ( or nothing ) at all .
Yet we non-believers must be absolutely certain of such a place , and long to go there , or be doomed to an eternity of torture in hell .
Strange ?
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Jesus loves us and he does n’t want us to end up in Hell ”
Me : “ I asked this to [ Lady Two ] last week , so I ’ll ask you too if you do n’t mind : Could you live an eternity of happiness in heaven knowing that people were being fried and tortured in hell ?
And that they were suffering these torments because of nothing more than them having had a different opinion on religion whilst on earth . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ This is how I understand it : I wo n’t know about what ’s happening to them .
That ’s something that God deals with as the Almighty .
When I get to heaven there will be no sadness , I wo n’t even be thinking about people in hell ”
Me : “ So you ’ll just forget about them ? ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ That part of my memory will be gone ”
Me : “ It all sounds rather sinister to me ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Sinister ? ” Lady
Two jumps in : Lady Two : “ I believe it ’s not the father ’s will to lose one child .
I think he wants to save everybody .
I think he ’s trying to save us by using Christians and the Holy Spirit , and things like that .
We as Christians are trying to witness , we ’re trying to get everyone saved .
We ’re trying to get everyone nice and peaceful with him [ God ] before they die , so that it ’s a safe passage through for them ”
Me : “ Well , I ’ve said this before but he could have created a system where everyone was peaceful with him from the beginning . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ But then we ’d have been robots , Stephen ” Oh dear , here we go again .
So much for me keeping quiet for the remainder of the evening …
Me : “ I do n’t understand your line of thinking at all , sorry .
Using that kind of reasoning we ’re all going to be robots in heaven , then . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ What God has done is this :
In the Old Testament he used one nation – Israel – to say , “ Look , here ’s the laws .
You try and live by them ” .
And they tried time and time again but failed time and time again .
They just could n’t do it ”
Me : “ But God knew that in advance ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Yes , he knew that ”
Me : “ So why bother ? ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ So that they could n’t come to him and say “ You never gave us a chance to come to you with our own free will .
You made us robots ” ”
Me : “ So why would he get upset with them if he knew exactly what they were going to do before he even created them ? ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Because as a father you know what you want your kids to do .
Are you a dad , Steve ? ”
Me : “ No , I do n’t have any children .
Not yet anyway . ”
[ EDIT : My first child , a beautiful baby boy , was born on the 23rd of January 2010 ]
Long -Standing Male Member : “ With my kids if there ’s something they should do and they do n’t do it , and they hurt themselves , I get very cross .
That ’s how I picture God .
He sees the nation of Israel the same way I see my kids .
If my kids are messing about at the top of the stairs I ’ll shout “ Do n’t do that , you might fall ! ” ”
Me : “ Your analogy might work if God was n’t omniscient .
But he is , so it does n’t .
You do n’t know every event – past , present and future .
God does .
You may have an inkling that your kids may hurt themselves , but then again they may not .
God knows precisely what each person will do before it even happens .
Would you place your kids at the top of a flight of very steep and hazardous steps knowing in advance that they would fall and kill themselves ?
You ’d get locked up for that , would n’t you ?
But this is what God has done .
He ’s put mankind on earth knowing in advance that they would fall .
Knowing in advance that millions of kids would be tortured and raped , that billions would starve to death , and so on ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ God is looking at the end game ”
Me : “ And if you knew that the “ end game ” would be that your kids fell to their deaths down the steep steps , would you place them there ? ”
Long -Standing Male Member : [ Long pause ]
“ It ’s like stopping your kids from putting their hands close to a coal fire .
You teach your kids not to go near the coal fire ”
Me : “ That ’s not what I ’m asking . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : [ Long pause ] “ Ask again ”
Me : “ If you knew in advance that by placing your kids at the top of some steep , hazardous steps they would fall to their deaths , would you place them there ? ”
Long -Standing Male Member : [ Long pause ]
“ It depends what my goal is . ”
Lady
Three : [ Turns to me ]
“ You ’re saying that what God has done to us is like him putting some kids at the top of some stairs knowing they would fall .
That ’s how you see it .
But I do n’t see it like that .
I see that God has made a perfect place and he ’s placed his ultimate creation – which is a man and a woman – in a perfect garden with just a guideline ”
Me : “ Yes , he placed them in the garden knowing in advance exactly what was going to happen ”
Lady
Three : “ Its not like he ’s left them at the top of some dangerous stairs .
He ’s left them in a safe environment with instructions that would keep them safe ”
Me : “ But it was n’t a safe environment .
He placed them in a garden with a tree bearing fruit that would ruin the future of mankind , if eaten .
This is a “ safe environment ” ?
Was a garden that contained Satan himself , who was on the prowl looking for a couple of human victims , a “ safe environment ” ?
God put them there knowing in advance what would happen . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ He did that because of love .
It was because of love .
Because he loves us he gives us free will .
You ’re struggling with the free will bit ”
Me : “ No , I ’m struggling with the fact that God could have created a system where pain , agony , torture and death were n’t necessary . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ If he did n’t give us free will he ’d always be controlling us .
If we did n’t have free will we could n’t do wrong even if we wanted to do wrong ”
Me : “ Supposedly we have free will in heaven , yet never do any wrong .
If this sort of free will is possible then God could have given us it in the first place .
No kids tortured , no innocent people murdered , no rapes , no muggings , no assaults , nothing like that need ever happen .
But God did n’t give us that sort of free will .
He gave us the kind where people WILL commit all the atrocities I just mentioned .
And , worst of all , he knew it all in advance .
And you honestly want us to believe that he loves and cares for us ? ”
Lady
Two : “ God wants us to do his will .
He wants a relationship with us .
That ’s the point .
He wants the relationship to be lovely and happy .
He knows that if we keep in his will we ’ll be happy and safe ”
The pastor joins in : Pastor : “ You ’re looking at this from a completely human point of view , Steve .
I gave you a scripture the other day about God ’s ways being higher than our ways .
The reason why God has done it is beyond our comprehension ”
Me : “ But that does n’t answer the question .
All you ’re saying , basically , is that you ’ve no idea [ again ? ] why God set it up the way he did , with him knowing that billions of people would live short , sad , tortuous lives , but that we should n’t question God because he knows best , so we should just leave it at that .
It ’s not good enough .
Sorry ”
Pastor : [ In a tone that suggests he ’s just about had enough ]
“ You ’re not satisfied with our answers .
Fine .
But we have an answer that satisfies us ”
Me : “ Throwing your hands up in the air and saying “ God knows best ” is hardly an answer likely to be deemed satisfactory by any non-Christian ” Lady
Three gets back in the mix : Lady Three : “ What you ’re saying is that God should have made us robots ”
Long -Standing Male Member : [ Turns to Lady Three ]
“ Yes , that ’s how I ’m seeing what Steve is saying , too . ”
Hammer and chisel anyone ?
Long -Standing Male Member : [ Turns to me ]
If you were God how would you do it ? ”
Me : “ I ’d create a paradise where people have the sort of free will that they will supposedly have in your idea of heaven .
Where the only things they want to do are good things .
No rape , murder , assault , and heartache .
Just a wondrous place where everyone shows immense love for one another , and where everyone gets along .
An eternity of peace , happiness and well - being .
That ’s how I ’d do it .
So what I ’m asking you is this : Could God create a system where people have a version of free will where the possibility of raping and abusing children is not there ?
If you say , “ Yes ” then I ’d like for you to explain to me why God did n’t create such a system in the first place . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Because God is after perfect holiness , perfect righteousness .
Not a watered down version ”
Me : “ So in order for a select few to achieve this state of holiness they must go through a system where the majority of God ’s creations are nothing more than collateral damage , as they starve to death , are raped , abused , tortured , and so on ? ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Yes ”
Me : “ I do n’t think there ’s anything further to add ” Lady
Three thinks she has a solution to the problem : Lady Three : “ The reason why kids are raped is because Satan has influenced people .
It ’s not because God created it like that . ”
Me : “ You ’re missing the point altogether .
God created Satan , knowing in advance what he would do .
God could have created a system without Satan , without pain and suffering , and without gratuitous evil .
But he did n’t .
Ultimately the buck stops with God ”
The discussion suddenly turns into a heated free - for - all .
Everyone in the group is trying to get their point across to me , and it becomes somewhat of an inaudible jumble .
I sit for a moment shaking my head .
Lady
Three can see that things are getting out of control and tries to shush the baying crowd .
The most vociferous of them all is the new Christian male , who ’s doing his best to shout over the top of everybody else .
As they say , there is none so passionate as a new convert .
Lady
Three manages to quieten everyone down and asks me to carry on with what I was saying .
I ’m thankful to Lady Three .
Once again she proves to me that she is the best of the bunch .
I ask the question once again : Me : “ God could have created a system where humans live in paradise from the very beginning , just like how you all believe you will live in heaven .
If God is so concerned for human welfare , and for us all to worship him , why did n’t he just do that in the first place ? ”
Pastor : “ Well , we ’ve answered that question .
That was God ’s choice and his ways are better than our ways . ”
I ’m beginning to think that someone should nominate me for the Queen ’s Honours List , for my sustained and dedicated services to patience , of course .
The pastor continues : Pastor : “ You just want to blame God .
You just want robots .
I ’m telling you that God did n’t want robots . ”
Me : “ You ’ve told me that heaven is going to be perfect .
We ’re all going to get along and we ’re all going to love each other ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Yeah ”
Me : “ But God could have made it that way from the off .
We do n’t need billions of innocent casualties in order to achieve complete happiness . ”
The new Christian male then goes into a tirade about how Satan ( in the guise of a “ smooth talking serpent ” ) deceived Eve into eating from the tree of knowledge .
Satan is to blame for all the world ’s ills .
“ And who created a garden with such a serpent in it ? ” asks my fellow sceptic .
Pastor : “ I understand your argument .
You want to blame God ”
Me : “ God created the system , did he not ? ”
Pastor : “ I can only give the answer that I ’ve given to you .
It does n’t satisfy you , and I ca n’t change that .
But I ’ve answered your question ”
Me : “ With respect , you have n’t really .
All you ’ve said is God knows best .
It does n’t answer anything ”
Pastor : “ I accept your argument that it would have been nice to get to heaven without all the raping and the killing .
I agree with you on that , but that ’s not the way God has chosen .
He ’s chosen it to be like this instead .
I do n’t know why . ”
Me : “ If God chooses it to be like this – a system where innocent people are victims – what , then , makes you so convinced that God is all good , and that he has even the slightest interest in our welfare ? ”
Pastor : “ The fact that God is holy .
And because he is so holy no other created being has the right , however good they may be , to be in his presence because that created being is not holy .
We are not worthy of being in his presence .
Until you perceive the holiness of God , and the miracle of anything else standing in his presence , you have no understanding of the miracle of grace .
Until you recognise the holiness and that God is God is God is God [ huh ? ] then human argument and reason can never understand why this dilemma has happened ”
Me : “ I admire your attempt to explain the situation , but , with respect , and try as I may , it does n’t make a great deal of sense to me , to be honest . ”
The long - standing male member is still keen to press the issue .
He tells me that God gave us free will because he wanted us to choose whether or not we loved him .
He continues : Long - Standing Male Member : “ The argument I could make is that we ’d be robots if it were any different .
If we HAD to love God then we would n’t be free . ”
Me : “ Are you free in heaven not to love him ? ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ I ’m choosing IN THIS LIFE to love God .
I make the choice HERE ”
Me : “ Oh , so there ’s no choice in heaven ?
I gather from that that we are n’t free in heaven , then ”
New Christian Male : “ I think if you did n’t love God he would kick you out of heaven until you said sorry to him ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ I ’m dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus .
I ’ve just got to make sure that I listen to Jesus and obey what God ’s word says .
It ’s living that Christian life .
I ’m preparing myself NOW for when I get to heaven .
So when you ask if I have the choice not to love God when I get to heaven the answer is no , because I ’m making the choice now . ”
Me : “ No choice in heaven ?
So you ’re a robot in heaven , then ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ No , because I ’ve made the choice here . ”
The words , “ This ” , “ Is ” , “ Like ” , “ Talking ” , “ To ” , “ A ” , “ Brick ” , and “ Wall ” spring to mind , possibly in that order , too .
Long - Standing Male Member : “ Would you murder someone ? ”
Me : “ No , of course not ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Not loving God is the same way , it ’s like murder .
So I ’m not going to do it . ”
Me : “ We ’re going round in circles ” .
Long -Standing Male Member : “ God does n’t want murder .
He does n’t even want white lies .
When you use the example of children being raped you ’re using a very emotional topic . ”
Me : “ Because it ’s probably the worst thing I can think of .
The simple fact of the matter is that God created a system where such atrocious things can and will occur .
And he knew all of this in advance . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ God wants relationships to be pure and holy ”
Me : “ As I keep saying , God could have made it so that we had pure and holy relationships without anyone ever raping a defenceless , innocent child .
But he did n’t . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Yeah , he did n’t ”
Me : “ Yet you cling to the belief that this God character is all - loving and wants no one to come to harm .
I do n’t know how you can reconcile that belief with the evidence we have around us in the world ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ The reason he did n’t make it without all those nasty things is because he ’s given us the free choice .
We surrender our lives to God. Being a Christian is not easy .
Some people do n’t want to be Christians because they do n’t want to change their lifestyle . ”
Me : “ I ’d be willing to change if I knew of some evidence in favour of what you ’ve had to say .
But genuinely I know of none . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ The only way to please God is by faith ” Brilliant this , is n’t it ?
As I ’m typing up this transcript I ’m sure I ’ve headbutted the wall at least twice , and sprouted a dozen or so more grey hairs .
Long - Standing Male Member : “ Faith comes by hearing the word , so you need to spend more time reading the Bible ” I sit back , take a sip from my glass of water and hope [ maybe I should pray ? ] that someone talks about something else .
The pastor looks at his watch .
It ’s 9 pm , time for the session to end .
The pastor explains that he has to leave immediately in order to make an important phone call .
He states that we are free to continue our discussion , though , and that we can stay over for as long as we want .
He may even manage to get back before we ’ve all gone home , he says .
He gets up out of his chair and thanks me for attending .
I joke , “ You ’re leaving ?
I was just on the brink of giving my life to Christ ! ”
The group laughs , and the pastor shakes my hand and tells me that he hopes that I ’ll stay in touch .
As the pastor exits the building Lady Two turns to me and says : Lady Two : “ God is just waiting .
The night that I found him [ here we go ] he was just waiting for me , too .
He was waiting for me to reach up to him , you see .
As soon as I reached up to him , as a child would , I was looking at him as a God who was white .
That ’s how I saw him .
I did n’t question it , I just thought , “ God , you are white .
If you ’re there , and you ’re the God of that Bible , then you ’re white and I want to be your child .
You know ? ”
Me : [ Trying to nip this in the bud ]
“ Like I ’ve said before quite a few times in the past , that ’s fair enough ”
Lady
Two : “ That ’s how I saw it .
He met me in ABSOLUTE LOVE .
It was … it was …
I ca n’t describe the ABSOLUTE LOVE that it was .
It was just ABSOLUTE LOVE being poured into me .
Because I ’d reached up to him , in a child - like way , and recognised that if he was there then I wanted to be right with him . ”
Me : “ Great ”
Lady
Two : “ That was all I needed to do .
It was as SIMPLE AS THAT .
And that is what he ’s waiting for , he ’s waiting for his children to say sorry for what they ’ve done wrong , that they recognise their sins , they recognise where they ’ve been out of line with him , and they ’re just saying sorry for it .
They ’re saying “ I want to be your child , I want you in my life and I want to follow your way ” .
And that ’s all he wants . ”
Me : [ Trying my best to just agree with her ] “ Ok ”
Lady Two : “ I ’M NOT A LIAR , I ’M NOT A LIAR .
It was simple .
All you need to do is go to your maker , go to that place in your mind and APPEAL to him .
It ’s as simple as that .
For me it was over in a space of two minutes , it was all done with .
He had ABSOLUTELY convinced me 100 % that it was all true . ”
Me : [ Doing my best to tread carefully here ]
“ I do n’t think for one moment that you ’re lying to me .
But you must remember that people can say things that are false without actually telling a lie .
A lie requires intent .
Lets say that [ the long - standing male member ] tells me that he used to live in Australia for twenty years .
He would be lying .
But I would n’t know that .
If I went and told you that he used to live in Australia for twenty years I would be spreading a falsehood , but I would n’t be lying .
He would be lying to me but I would n’t be lying to you .
Being led to believe a certain thing , which unbeknownst to you is false , does not mean that you ’re lying if you then go and tell someone about it .
You ’d just be mistaken .
There ’s a difference .
Like I say , I do n’t think you ’re lying to me at all .
I think you ’re completely convinced by all of this . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : [ Turns to me ]
“ I ’d like to ask you something , Steve .
Over the last eleven weeks how do you think we have shared the Gospel with you ?
In a way I ’m kinda asking for a review of how you ’ve viewed what we have had to say . ”
[ That ’s interesting , is n’t it ?
I wonder if this website might be of some assistance ? ]
Me : “ I think you ’re all incredibly sincere and passionate people .
I ’m quite fond of all of you . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Have we shared the Gospel with you ?
Have we communicated the Gospel to you as best we can ?
Have we communicated to you that Jesus is God , that he came down as a human being , gave up his divine powers , died on the cross for our sins and rose again ? ”
Me : “ Sure ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ There ’s something that ’s been hitting home to me this week and for some reason I ’ve felt the need to share it with you .
None of us , NONE OF US , deserve to go to heaven .
Ok ?
I deserve to go into heaven as much as the person who is raping a three year old kid .
Which is NIL .
Ok ?
None of us deserve to go into heaven .
It ’s purely God ’s choice to give us the opportunity to go into heaven .
That ’s what the Gospel is .
I believe what I believe , and that ’s how it is .
And when you tell me to look at another faith , and how they supposedly “ prove ” their arguments , my faith is strong enough not to be fazed by it .
Just like your faith is strong enough to make you think , “ No , there is no God ” ”
Me : [ Laughs ]
“ No , that ’s not my faith at all .
In fact I do n’t think I ’ve said such a thing in all of the eleven weeks that I ’ve been here . ”
Lady Two : [ Turns to me excitedly ]
“ You want to believe that there is a God !
You WANT to believe that there IS ! ”
Me : “ Well , not really .
I do n’t WANT to believe that there is a god .
I ’m just interested to know if there is a god or not .
But , as it stands at the moment , I have no reason for believing that there is a god .
Especially not the kind of god who is supposedly all - loving , and who supposedly has a vested interest in the welfare of human beings , yet for the entirety of human history has allowed kids to be raped in their millions . ”
Lady Two : “ But God HATES that .
It ’s not what he wanted ! ”
Me : [ Tongue in cheek ]
“ Well , I think it ’s best if I decline the opportunity to repeat myself for the 114th time ”
All of the group smile and take my comment as a lighthearted acceptance that we ’re not going to solve anything on this particular problem .
That is all of the group with the exception of the new Christian male , who looks at me and says : New Christian Male : “ Let ’s hope that you ’re not forced into believing in God when something bad happens to you . ”
Me : “ Well , let ’s not hope for that , hey ? ”
New Christian Male : “ That ’s the only way some people can come to understand God .
With my hand on my heart I hope it does n’t take that for you to believe in God .
But if it does then you know why . ”
This is nothing but a veiled threat .
I ’m sure anyone else with less patience than I would have told him where to go , and very promptly , and perhaps with an accompanying scuff of the earlobe for good measure .
I understand , though , that he ’s just keen to fit in with the group , he ’s trying his best to be “ one of them ” , and this often clouds his judgment .
I ’ll give him the benefit of the doubt on this one , and I choose not to respond in the way that many people might have .
A few moments later we are discussing charity , and the group tell me about how some Christians work tirelessly for charity .
I agree with them , yes , some Christians do work tirelessly for charity , as do some atheists and some Muslims , some Sikhs and some Hindus .
To which the new Christian male responds “ Yeah , but they ’re just jumping on the bandwagon ” I take the group back a few weeks , and take the opportunity to remind them of the session when the pastor laid hands on me .
He asked God to reveal himself to me but I ’ve heard nothing from God since .
There ’s been no sign of this God character anywhere .
I ask the group why they think God failed to show .
No one seems particularly keen to offer an explanation .
That is until the new Christian male chimes up with his own theory : New Christian Male : “ When you talk to Muslims do you talk about Allah with them ? ”
Me : “ Of course ”
New Christian Male : “ Then that is why God is saying , “ I wo n’t speak to you unless you come away from Allah ” ”
Me : “ Eh ? So I ’m not allowed to talk to Muslims ? ”
New Christian Male : “ Talk to Muslims , yes , but do n’t talk to them about their faith .
Because God thinks you ’re going to go to Allah ”
Me : “ I have to understand what it is that people believe .
To do that I have to talk to them about it ”
New Christian Male : “ You might go home at night and ask God to reveal himself to you but he might be thinking , “ Why should I reveal myself to Steve when he ’s talking to Muslims about Allah ? ”
God is saying “ If Steve wants to be with me then he cannot listen to Allah ” So if you do n’t talk to Allah then God will talk to you .
Then you ’ll hear God. Read the Old Testament .
When Hezekiah became king of Judah he did evil in the eyes of the Lord .
When he decided to talk to another god he was punished by the real God ” Amazing .
Absolutely amazing .
The long - standing male member has , what he thinks , a better explanation for why it is that God never revealed himself to me : Long - Standing Male Member : “ I think the more time you spend reading the Bible , especially the New Testament , at some stage the Holy Spirit will reveal himself .
That ’s why they call it the living word .
It ’s where the Holy Spirit can take the word and apply it to my life to make me more like Jesus .
The reason why God wants us to surrender our lives to him is so that we can become more like Jesus .
God wants us to be exactly like Jesus .
The two hours or so that you ’ve been spending here every week try to use that time in the future for reading the New Testament .
It ’s great that you ’re reading lots of other books .
I ’m not saying do n’t read other books .
But if you ’re REALLY seeking God then read the New Testament ”
Me : “ I ’ve read the New Testament several times ”
New Christian Male : “ Every night , every night , you must read it every night ”
Lady
Two : “ When I was a hoper , Stephen , I used to think “ Even if it ’s not true I want to support it in terms of the way I live my life and the way I treat other people ” .
Because it ’s the nicest ideology , it ’s the nicest story going .
You know , that a saviour had come to save me from my sins and to show me the way to live my life properly and everything .
When I was a hoper , like you , I used to analyse it too .
I used to think , “ Well , it ’s a fantastic story , and even if it ’s not true I ’m going to try and live my life largely as much as I can to follow it ” .
I tried to be kind and I tried to say nice things to people because I came to the conclusion that out of all the ways to live your life it was the best one to follow .
You know ?
The ideology was so nice , that God loved us so much that he ’d done his utmost to make us live a nice life and a happy life and everything , by following him and working for him .
It gave my life purpose , it gave my life direction , it made life fruitful because I would meet other people who were kind and who kept on the straight and narrow as well .
They treated each other with respect and everything .
Everything was nice about it .
So I was always that hoper following it .
You know ? ”
My fellow sceptic looks at me and , with a wink and a shake of the head , states , “ You must try harder , Steve ” .
Everyone laughs .
We ’ve over run the time by about 45 mins but we ’ve all enjoyed our chat and this seems as good a time as any to call a close to the evening .
I tell the group that I have really appreciated their time , and that I have enjoyed the course immensely .
They thank me for attending .
Lady
Three asks ,
“ We ’d like to say a final prayer if that ’s alright .
Is that alright ? ” .
My fellow sceptic and I reply with an “ Of course .
No problem ” Lady Three : “ Heavenly father , we thank you for this course .
It has given us the chance to get together and talk about you and to debate different ideas .
Lord , I just pray that it would be great if you did reveal yourself to them .
To show the truth and the reality of what you ’re about , Lord .
We ca n’t persuade them , Lord , it ’s got to be you , in a way that is tangible and real to them .
Lord , only you know the depth of their hearts and where they are .
Lord , thank you for the time we ’ve spent together and thank you for the friendships that have developed over the great evenings we ’ve had together .
Lord I pray that you watch over us and keep us safe , and we ask this in the name of Jesus our Lord . ”
The Group As A Whole : “ Amen ” Lady Two has a go : Lady Two : “ Thank you , God , that your Holy Spirit is evidently working in both their hearts , that they ’re searching for you as they are and that they come to the meetings every week like they do .
You are working in them and that ’s obvious , Lord .
I just earnestly ask , Lord , that you would not leave them alone .
Not let them have rest .
I do n’t want them to have rest , Lord , until they ’ve tussled it out and found you , Lord .
I just want them not to give up and to be wrestling with it , and to be searching for you , and for them not to be happy with the direction of their lives until they have made a commitment , Lord , and for you to reach down and make yourself real to them , Lord .
I just want that , Lord , because I know it means a lot to them and I know that to have come here for eleven weeks it is obvious that both of them are searching and both of them would love a direction in life which is so holy , so purposeful , and so lovely .
I just pray , Lord , that they will both find it in their own time and in their own way .
In Jesus ’ name .
Amen . “
The Group As A Whole : “ Amen ” The room remains silent for a moment or two , then gradually the Christians in the group open their eyes and look approvingly towards my fellow sceptic and I .
People start to move out of their seats and I help Lady Two clear the pots away .
On our walk to the kitchen we all chat about family life and such .
I approach my fellow sceptic and tell him that it was lovely to meet him .
Shame we did n’t really get to chat together all that much .
When everything is cleared away I put on my coat and say my goodbyes for the last time .
I wish everyone well then head for the door .
As I open the door to exit the church I bump into the pastor who is on his way back in .
We shake each other ’s hand and wish each other well for the future .
“ Stay in touch ” , he says .
I pat him on the shoulder ; thank him for his patience and then I slip him a little bit of money as my contribution towards the cheesecakes and fruit salads that have been on offer over the last eleven weeks .
“ That ’s very kind of you , Stephen ” says the pastor .
One last final handshake and then I open the church door and head back to my car for the journey home .
My time on the Alpha Course has come to an end .
WEEK 10 : “ What About The Church ? ”
The group is one person short this evening as Lady Three has failed to put in an appearance .
Maybe last week ’s prayers worked wonders on her injured knee , and subsequently a British cycling team has snapped her up to compete in the Tour De France ?
Yes , with God all things are possible .
Joking aside , none of the group has heard from her , so they are surprised that she ’s not in attendance .
I hope she ’s ok .
After a moment or two I dig into my jacket pocket , pull out a piece of paper and say , “ I ’ve brought the Bible verse that you asked for ” .
The pastor smiles and rubs his hands together , eager to see what I ’ve come up with .
“ Let ’s have a look then ” , he says eagerly .
“ Actually I found two verses of that nature , but I do n’t know if there ’s any more ” , I say as I hand the long - standing male member the piece of paper .
“ TWO ? ? ” , he shrieks in astonishment .
He reads carefully .
He looks to the pastor , who is sitting beside him , and reads aloud the verse location , “ Numbers 31:17 - 18 ” .
The pastor opens up his Bible and searches for the verses in question .
There ’s a quiet moment as the pastor reads them .
His face drops a little , and a few seconds later he looks up from the page and dejectedly admits , “ Yep , you ’re right ”
There ’s more silence before Lady Two gets out of her seat and walks towards the pastor .
She asks , “ What does it say ? ” .
The pastor reads aloud the offending verses : [ Numbers 31:17 - 18 ]
“ Now kill all the boys .
And kill every woman who has slept with a man , but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man ” [ NIV ] And … [ Judges 21:10 - 12 ]
“ So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there , including the women and children .
“ This is what you are to do , ” they said .
“ Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin . ”
They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man , and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan . ” [ NIV ]
My fellow sceptic , who is grinning from ear to ear , asks the group in his inimitable dry style , “ Are you guys trying to tell me you did n’t know about that ? ” .
No one answers .
“ If I may ask , what does everyone here think of verses like that ?
Do you think that they are examples of morally acceptable behaviour ? ” , I ask .
New Christian Male : “ No , I think it ’s wrong ”
Long -Standing Male Member : [ Turns to the new Christian male ]
“ Well , yeah , on face value … just by reading that sentence ”
He says that as if in the hope that there ’s some deeper meaning to it all , which we ’ve most probably overlooked , that will ultimately shed God in good light .
That ’s right , God comes out of it smelling of roses no matter what .
Like I ’ve said before , no amount of evidence will budge these people from believing that 1 ) God is perfectly good , and 2 ) The Bible is God ’s perfect love letter to his children .
Pastor : “ This is just my view but I think he was seeking to bring purity to the Israelites . ”
Purity ?
Is this guy serious ?
Pastor : “ You see , you judge that from a 21st century , western background .
And we ’d all say yes , in the 21st century , that would n’t be morally acceptable ”
Me : “ Would God have considered it morally acceptable behaviour back then ? ”
Pastor : “ Obviously , because he allowed it ”
So if God allows things to happen then he obviously considers them morally acceptable ?
Children being raped , old ladies mugged , innocent people tortured and killed ?
All these things happen today , so , according to the pastor ’s principle , God must consider them morally acceptable .
What kind of monster are they making God out to be ?
This is ludicrous .
The long - standing male member asks me if I ’d like to live in a world without Christian morals .
“ What do you mean by “ Christian morals ” ? ” , I ask .
He replies by reeling off a couple of the Ten Commandments , such as thou shalt not steal , and thou shalt not kill .
I state that I do n’t need knowledge of the Christian God or his Bible in order to know not to steal and not to kill .
Pastor : “ We have a moral absolute that stealing is wrong ”
Me : “ Do n’t you think there are occasions when it could be deemed “ good ” to steal ? ”
New Christian Male : [ Dumbfounded by my suggestion ] “ HOW ? ? ”
Me : “ Let ’s try this hypothetical example : A terrorist has hijacked a plane .
He has a loaded gun pointed at the pilot ’s head and he ’s commanding him to head for Manhattan .
Unbeknownst to everyone onboard the terrorist intends to have the plane slammed into a skyscraper , killing hundreds of passengers onboard and thousands of innocent people on the ground .
Suddenly a split - second opportunity arises where you are able to steal the terrorist ’s gun by snatching it out of his hand , thus saving the lives of thousands of innocent people .
Would stealing this man ’s gun be a “ good ” thing to do ? ”
Pastor : “ Yes , but I ’d hardly call it “ stealing ” , though ”
Me : “ To “ steal ” is to take someone ’s property without their consent . ”
New Christian Male : [ Struggling to think of a quick answer ]
“ But … but … it [ the gun ] is not his property ….
because he does n’t have a licence for it ”
What ??!!
I ’ve offered up a thought experiment about a terrorist that has hijacked an aeroplane , and the new Christian male somehow knows that my invented character has n’t been issued with a licence for his firearm ??
That has to be the craziest comment I ’ve heard in a long time .
Funny though ( albeit unintentionally ) .
Long -Standing Male Member : “ This is how I see it if Jesus was onboard : He [ Jesus ] would n’t go and steal the gun .
He ’d work in a far different realm , because Jesus said , “ Turn the other cheek ” . ”
Me : “ He would n’t have just turned the other cheek when confronted with a hijacker who was about to kill thousands of people , surely ? ”
The pastor intervenes , “ Anyway , shall we watch tonight ’s DVD ? ” Yeah , why not .
Gumbel starts by asking , “ Is it possible to be a Christian – to be a follower of Jesus – and not go to church ?
What does “ going to church ” mean ?
What is “ Church ? ” ”
He tells us of the time , before he was a Christian , of how whenever he heard the word “ church ” his heart used to sink .
Of course since becoming a Christian he views the church in a completely different light , “ At the heart of the church is something amazing , something wonderful , something beautiful ” .
Filled with pride he exclaims , “ I LOVE the Church ! ”
He has a number of reasons for feeling as he does .
First reason why he loves the church so much is because , “ The Church is the people of God . ”
He tells us that , “ We become a member of the Church not by birth but by new birth ” .
He then states that “ Jesus spoke about being born of water and the spirit ” , and that Jesus “ commanded his disciples to baptise ”
He continues , “ Becoming a Christian involves three things :
First of all , something WE do …
Repentance and faith .
Secondly , something GOD does …
He gives us the Holy Spirit .
Thirdly , something the CHURCH does … Baptism . ”
“ Baptism is a kind of visible mark of what it means to be a member of the Church ” , he adds .
Gumbel states that thousands of people become Christian ’s everyday , it ’s just that we ( Western Europeans ) do n’t recognise this fact .
“ We live in Western Europe , and the Church has been in decline for fifty to eighty years ” , admits Gumbel .
But he states , basically , that we’d be mistaken to conclude that such a decline is ubiquitous .
He used to look at it the same way , but that was because he had – as he puts it – a “ totally blinkered , narrow view of the world ” .
He then tells us how the Church in Africa is “ growing faster than ever ! ” .
This is an interesting fact that I hope to discuss with the pastor later on in the evening .
The second reason he loves the Church so much is , “ because it ’s a family ! ” .
He continues , “ It ’s a family of God .
When you come into a relationship with God you come into a family ” ” Gumbel has to regretfully admit that “ The history of the Church has been a sad one because it ’s been a story of disunity ” .
He then tells us that people look at the Church and think , “ If you guys cant even agree amongst yourselves what you believe in , why should I be interested ? ” .
He ’s absolutely right .
That ’s precisely what many people think .
But Gumbel is n’t without hope because , as he says , “ Jesus prayed .
Just before he died Jesus prayed that we would be one so that the world would believe . ” .
This speaks volumes about the supposed efficacy of prayer , does n’t it ?
Even Jesus himself is still waiting for his prayers to be answered !
The third reason why he loves the Church is because “ the way in which people see Jesus today .
It ’s the body of Christ ” Gumbel states that , as Christians , “ Each of you represents Jesus , wherever you go ” .
Let ’s hope that is n’t true , if history is anything to go by .
The Crusaders , the Inquisitors , the Witch burners , the abortion surgeon murderers … all of these cretins represent Jesus ?
My goodness .
The fourth reason why he loves the Church is , “ It ’s where we experience the presence of God in a special way ”
He then claims that “ There ’s a longing for God in every human heart , whether people admit it , acknowledge [ it ] , recognise [ it ] , or not , there ’s a longing for God ” .
I wonder how he would define “ God ” in this instance ?
The capitalised “ G ” of the Christian variety , or the generic god with the small “ g ” ?
It ’s an important distinction that needs to be made , and Christians are often guilty of blurring the two when it suits them .
And another thing , what are we to think of Christians who claim that it is true that everyone longs for their God whether they recognise it or not ?
How does that work ?
This brings to mind the story told by Nobel Prize winning physicist , Niels Bohr , who , when asked for the reason why he had a horseshoe stuck to his front door if he was so against superstitious thinking , replied ( with tongue in cheek ) that it was there because he ’d been told that it would bring good luck whether he believed in it or not .
Christians are offering us their own kind of horseshoe , and it goes by the name of Jesus .
The fifth reason why Gumbel loves the Church is because “ Jesus loves the Church .
It ’s his bride .
The Church is the bride of Christ . ”
A smiley - faced Gumbel then tells us how much he loves his job .
Yes , he wants us to know that the Church is great , God is great , and Christianity is great .
Talk about a hard sell !
Gumbel returns now to his opening question , “ So , is it possible to be a Christian and not go to church ? ”
Gumbel offers the simple answer , “ We do n’t GO to church , you ARE the Church ! ” Gumbel ends his presentation by stating “ There ’s only one way into the Church and that ’s to say , “ God , be merciful to me – a sinner . ”
And the moment we say that , God in his love says , “ YOU are part of my people .
You ’re my family .
You ’re my representative .
You ’re my body on earth .
You ’re a holy temple , my spirit lives within you .
You ’re my bride ” ” Roll the credits …
On go the lights and back go the curtains .
The long - standing male member asks me how I felt about this week ’s presentation .
I ’m determined not to be the focus of attention this evening because , believe it or not , I ’m not at all comfortable playing the bad guy role week in week out .
So I try to be as diplomatic as possible and tell him “ I quite enjoyed it , thank you ” .
With me being one of only two sceptics on the course , and the other one being quite a quiet individual , it makes it hard not to be the one who is asking all the questions .
The pastor turns to my fellow sceptic and asks , “ Anything strike you about that video tonight ? ” .
My fellow sceptic responds by saying that he was surprised to learn that the word “ Church ” does n’t necessarily apply to a building but to a group of people .
He remarks that to him the word “ Church ” brings up thoughts of a “ freezing building with very narrow and uncomfortable seating .
Somewhere you were made to go . ” .
He also says that the Church has done an excellent job over the years of fleecing people of their money and property .
“ Churches are always looking for money ” , he adds .
Generally , then , it would seem that my fellow sceptic has a negative view of the Church .
I take a back seat as my fellow sceptic vents his spleen .
It ’s nice to see him air his views like this .
I ’m quite happy to sit and listen .
For the time being at least .
He then reveals to the group that he was under the impression that the Alpha Course was supposed to be aimed at people like him ( and me ) – i.e. people who were sceptical about the truth claims of Christianity – but to his disappointment he found the course to be aimed more at the casual Christian , someone who is looking to have his or her faith boosted , someone in need of a spiritual enema .
I ’m in full agreement , as I certainly do n’t think that the course caters well enough for non-believers , and certainly not at all well enough for the informed sceptic .
The new Christian male tells us that he finds the course remarkable because “ every time I watch a presentation it answers the questions that I ’d been thinking about the week before !
I have a question one week and lo and behold the following week it ’s answered ! ”
My fellow sceptic points out that this is probably the case due to the fact that the new Christian male takes home the DVD ’s and watches them one week in advance .
A red -faced new Christian male has obviously forgotten that he told us this only a few weeks ago .
Tut tut .
Despite being a non-Christian , and totally unconvinced by the Christian claims , my fellow sceptic reveals that he occasionally takes trips with the long - standing male member ( his next - door neighbour ) to Christian festivals , mainly because he ’s keen on the outdoors and enjoys camping and such .
He tells us of the time he attended the “ Grapevine Festival “ , and how on that particular occasion , during a performance by a Christian rock group , the seating collapsed in the marquee , which housed 5,000 or so people at the time .
Fortunately no one was killed , but about a dozen or so were seriously injured .
“ How could this happen to people who were worshipping God ? ” , asks my fellow sceptic .
He then tells us how flabbergasted he was as the tragedy unfolded to see people praying to God rather than rushing to help the injured .
As my personal favourite writer , Robert G. Ingersoll , once famously said , “ The hands that help are better far than the lips that pray ” .
A quick Google search for the Grapevine incident reveals a few interesting remarks made by Christians on various websites .
One states , “ Most of all we want to thank God for being with us at Grapevine on this day and a very big thank you for all the emergency services and the volunteers involved in helping getting these people from under the seating ”
It ’s understandable that this person would offer thanks to the emergency services who actually did something to help .
But why would God get any of the thanks ?
Thanks for what ?
For allowing a dozen or so of his passionate followers to get crushed by a seating collapse ?
Another comment , on a different website , by someone who also attended Grapevine on that unfortunate day , states , “ It was terrifying but I trusted in the Lord , and no - one was killed – most people were able to walk out ” .
God gets the thanks even when innocent people are hurt !
If 25 kids had been crushed to death at that festival I could imagine Christians saying something like this , “ It was terrifying but I trusted in the Lord , it was a miracle that only 25 kids were killed – it should have been many more .
Thank God that most people were able to walk out ” .
Better still , the same guy who offered the above quote goes on to say , “ I think the devil is at work in lots of places … “ .
That ’s right , the devil is to blame for the seating collapse !
Like I ’ve said in a previous week , Christians have no difficulty believing that their God is pure goodness , even when he drowns the world ’s population , infants and all [ see Genesis ] .
They will not budge from the conviction that God is complete and utter love , even when he executes the dimpled - cheeked first - born babies of a certain people , all because he wants to punish the leader of their nation [ see Exodus ] .
Mind boggling , is n’t it ?
I ’m sure there ’s some similarity here between this kind of mentality and that of “ Battered Spouse Syndrome ” , where the abused will actually defend the abuser if someone happens to point the finger of accusation in their direction .
Sufferers of BSS will blame themselves for the abuse and hardship that is meted out to them , even though they are perfectly innocent and undeserving of the abuse they receive .
Is n’t this somewhat like Christians who look upon themselves as worthless , miserable sinners who are deserving of eternal torture from their supposedly “ loving ” and “ merciful ” God ?
It ’s worth thinking about .
Suddenly the door opens and in walks a lady who I have n’t seen before .
It turns out to be the pastor ’s wife .
She says hello and the pastor points to me and says , “ This is Stephen ” .
It strikes me as though she ’s come to see the strange doubter who asks too many questions .
She sits at the back and watches the proceedings .
Unfortunately she ’s picked the wrong night to come and hear what I have to say , as I ’m taking somewhat of a back seat this evening .
The long - standing male member looks to his friend and neighbour , my fellow sceptic , and states “ At the end of the day , when you stand before God and he asks you why you have n’t committed your life to the Lord , it wont be good enough to say “ I did n’t believe in you because you allowed paedophiles to rape children , and that you allowed the seating to collapse at the Grapevine festival ” .
That is no excuse ” My Fellow Sceptic : “ That wo n’t happen , because I wo n’t be stood there . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Yeah , but what IF ? ”
At this point I interject and ask the long - standing male member “ What IF it ’s a different God when you get there ? ” .
His response ?
“ Then I ’ll be the same as you , then ” , he says .
So what was the point he was trying to make exactly ?
Did he have a valid point ?
I do n’t think so .
Let ’s go a little further with this .
Who ’s to say that there is n’t a god up there that rewards people who reject religious dogma ?
Maybe the “ test ” in this life is to remain an atheist ?
Maybe religion is the devil ’s deception , the forbidden fruit ?
“ What IF ? ” indeed .
We can all dream things up and ask “ What IF ? ”
So what ?
My fellow sceptic goes on to talk about the sad , gloomy atmosphere of most churches that he ’s attended .
And how there ’s often a straight - faced , humourless old man stood at the front wearing a black dress , mumbling out a few drab words from an equally drab holy book .
Would n’t it be better , asks my fellow sceptic , if these places were more accommodating to young people , and if the churches were headed by smiley - faced , fun- loving , energetic priests , pastors and vicars ?
He mentions that people like Lady Two would be better suited to such positions .
“ What would you rather see portrayed as the face of your church ? ” he asks .
“ I ’m sure it would be [ Lady Two ’s ] beaming , smiling face ” , he adds .
My fellow sceptic then tells us , in a nice way , how after last week ’s session Lady Two had collared him .
“ She ’s obviously totally besotted [ with God and the Bible ] ” , he states .
I take from that that she ’d given him a full frontal attack with her famed testimony .
I wish I ’d have stayed to see that !
The pastor picks up on what Gumbel had said in his presentation – that the Church is growing rapidly in places like Africa .
“ Why are Church attendances dropping off in Western Europe ? ” asks my fellow sceptic .
I add to the question by asking if there ’s perhaps a correlation between levels of high education and the disbelief in God .
In Western Europe , where education levels are higher than in most parts of the world , church attendance and religious belief are on the decline .
Yet in areas where levels of education are poor , and where superstitious thinking is prevalent – such as parts of Africa and South America – church attendance and religious belief are on the increase .
And what about the surveys taken amongst top scientists , the crème de la crème of the National Academy of Sciences for instance ?
Of these highly educated people only 7 % profess the belief in a personal god , and 93 % of them do not .
Could it be argued that , on the whole , less educated people are more gullible and thus more susceptible to religious beliefs ?
Pastor : “ I think it ’s because we [ Western Europeans ] think we have become self - sufficient and we do n’t look beyond ourselves .
When you have a comfy home , a nice car , a good job , and nice holidays you feel that you are more self - reliant .
We must remember that Jesus came to a very uneducated place in Israel , and he chose lots of uneducated people as his disciples , such as fishermen . ”
At this point the pastor changes the subject altogether and says , “ Steve , I meant to bring you a book tonight but I forgot .
I ’ve been reading a book about the persecuted Church and I really felt that God told me to bring you it ” .
“ Who is the author ? ” I ask .
“ Brother Andrew ” , he replies .
Maybe he ’ll bring it next week .
I must say , though , it does n’t sound particularly appealing unfortunately .
“ Next week is the big , big finale ” , the pastor announces enthusiastically .
I jokingly ask if he has bottles of champagne on ice , and a fireworks display planned for the big occasion .
Tonight ’s session is then brought to a close as the pastor says a prayer thanking us all for attending .
He says a quick prayer for Lady Three , too , in the hope that she ’s safe and well .
I share his hopes and concerns , but I ’m sure there ’s nothing to worry about .
Speaking of Lady
Three he tells me that she ’s been on the Internet looking up the ‘ sons of god ’ that I wrote down for her last week .
“ Yesterday she was here [ using the Internet ] for about four hours ! ” exclaims the pastor .
Lady
Three is obviously a studious sort , and I admire her effort .
Maybe she ’s compiled a dossier for me for next week ?
I get the feeling that I ’m going to have to answer a lot of questions !
Excellent .
As people head for the door the pastor walks over to where I ’m sat and respectfully asks for me not to dismiss Christianity just because there are numerous other religions claiming very similar ( and perhaps identical ) “ proofs ” .
I respond , in an equally respectful manner , that that is not the only thing stopping me from accepting Christianity .
He then offers as an analogy my relatively recent purchase of a new car : Pastor : “ You chose a car to drive despite all the claims by other manufacturers .
The fact that there are lots of claims , by lots of different manufacturers , has n’t stopped you buying a car .
Similarly , I do n’t want the fact that there are lots of claims , by lots of different religions , to stop you from buying into Christianity and giving your life to Christ . ”
I do n’t doubt the existence of cars or their manufacturers .
But let ’s say that car manufacturers were making outlandish claims like for instance that their cars had a top speed exceeding the speed of light , or that they were invisible , or that they transcended time and space .
But yet such manufacturers had absolutely no data whatsoever to support any such claims , nor could they demonstrate that such cars even existed in the first place .
Then of course , yes , I ’d probably tar all those manufacturers with the same brush .
But what if one particular manufacturer invited sceptical members of the public to visit their head offices , where a group of employees promised to demonstrate the truth of their claims over a period of several weeks ?
And what if members of the public went along to such meetings , hoping that the employees could do just that – but discovered that in reality they could not ?
If I were one of the sceptical members of the public who had gone along to be shown that the car manufacturers claims were true , when in fact no evidence was presented to support such a thing , then I ’d hardly be in a position to open up my chequebook and commit to buying one of their cars .
Similarly I am in no position to commit my self to Christianity when I have n’t been offered any evidence whatever in support of the outlandish claims that it makes .
Pastor : “ You need to say , “ Christ , I want you to be my Lord and saviour .
I want you to forgive me for my past .
I want you to be Lord of my life , and I want you to come and fill me with your Holy Spirit .
And if you do it I ’ll live the rest of my life for you ” ”
Me : “ But like I ’ve said before , I will do that if I have good reason to do so .
But , as yet , I do n’t have any good reason for doing that ”
Pastor : “ A reason could be that you trust us as people that you ’ve known for the last ten weeks .
All I ’m saying to you is not to keep using the excuse , that there are lots of similar claims out there , to reject it [ Christianity ] . ”
Me : “ With respect , that ’s not what I ’m doing .
It ’s simply a case of me listening to , and reading about , certain claims that quite clearly do not add up .
And when I question certain people about these claims – which they say they can defend – it invariably ends with them being unable to answer simple questions , or them continually contradicting themselves , or them offering the exact same “ supporting evidences ” as someone of another religion could offer , and in which case they would then deem such “ supporting evidences ” to be wholly unsatisfactory .
In all honesty it could n’t get any weaker ”
The long - standing male member then tells me , “ Yes , but it ’s all about faith ! ” as if that somehow solves the problem altogether , when in fact all it does is support what I ’ve just said .
Anyone from any religion can say , “ Yes , but it ’s all about faith ! ” .
I think now is as good a time as any to bite my tongue and decline the temptation to respond .
It ’s for the best .
“ Anyway , Steve , thank you for finding those Bible verses and for proving us wrong ” , jokes the pastor .
We all laugh , and so the session ends , as ever , in good spirits .
It ’s been a relatively quiet get - together this evening .
But seeing as next week is the Grand Finale , perhaps tonight ’s session was merely the calm before the storm ?
We ’ll have to wait and see …
WEEK 9 : “ Does God Heal Today ? ”
The long - standing male member is back for this evening ’s session .
I ’m happy about that because we get along well and he ’s always good value for a quote or two .
As a group we sit chatting about our recent holidays .
Lady
Two serves me two glasses of cold water , which was very nice of her .
I never eat any of the food on offer , even though I ’m quite partial to the odd slice of cheesecake now and again , so perhaps Lady Two is making sure that I ’m well stocked up with at least something .
It ’s no secret that I find her views on God to be somewhat bizarre , but I do actually like Lady Two a great deal .
She ’s a nice lady .
We have three sessions left of the Alpha Course , but , says the pastor , “ we have potentially four talks to cover ” .
It would appear that one talk is going to have to bite the dust .
The pastor continues , “ So we need to decide which three we are going to do .
I personally suggest that the session entitled , “ Why And How Should I tell Others ? ” , is probably not relevant , so I recommend we do “ Does God Heal Today ? ” , “ What About The Church ? ” and finally “ How Can I make The Most Of The Rest Of My Life ? ” .
So if you ’re happy that those are the three that I suggest we do , then let ’s proceed . ”
We all nod in approval .
So , off we go with week 9 , with a presentation entitled , “ Does God Heal Today ? ”
Gumbel begins by telling us of the time , almost thirty years ago , when a charismatic evangelical preacher from the USA , by the name of John Wimber , came to visit his church .
Ever the sceptic ( of course ! ) , Gumbel tells us how he felt about this American gentleman : “ When I saw [ him ] I was deeply cynical about him ” , and “ I was deeply suspicious ” .
Gumbel continues , “ He came and spoke here on the subject of the Holy Spirit , and healing , and wonderful things .
But I still left deeply cynical ”
The next night Mr Wimber came to speak again , and Gumbel arrived still “ very , very cynical ” .
Wimber spoke primarily on the subject of healing that night , and during his speech he announced to the group , “ After a coffee break we ’re going to DO some healing ” Gumbel admits to being quite nervous at the prospect of such a thing happening in the church , and tells us that most of the congregation , in typifying the “ British reserve ” , were n’t too keen to get involved .
All that showbiz / razzmatazz kind of stuff might appeal to an American audience , but not for the shy , retiring , self - deprecating British equivalent , intimates Gumbel .
After the coffee break the preacher told the audience that he and his team had been praying , and that they had been granted a few “ words of knowledge ” .
Gumbel tells us that Mr Wimber then defined ‘ words of knowledge ’ as : “ A supernatural revelation of facts about a person or situation , which is not learned by the efforts of the natural mind but is made known by the Spirit of God .
This may be in the form of a picture , or words seen or heard in the mind , or a feeling experienced physically . ”
Gumbel tells us that no one in the room expected anything special to happen .
No one had high hopes for Mr Wimber ’s routine to succeed .
All of them were sceptical .
In fact , admits Gumbel , some of them wanted to see the flamboyant preacher fail miserably .
The preacher stood at the front , thought deeply about the ‘ words of knowledge ’ he ’d received from God during the coffee break , and then declared to the audience , “ The first person is a man who injured his back aged fourteen , chopping wood . ”
To Gumbel ’s surprise a gentleman from the audience stood up and identified himself as that very person .
Gumbel then tells us several more people came forward after Wimber mentioned “ back problems ” .
The preacher went through his divinely inspired list of personal information , and people came out of their seats “ one after another after another after another ” in response .
Gumbel beams as he states , “ we could feel the level of faith in the room rising ! ”
Gumbel then tells us that there was in fact ONE ‘ word of knowledge ’ that was n’t responded to by any of the audience members .
God had n’t got it wrong , though , nor had the preacher misinterpreted the information from God .
In fact the information was absolutely correct .
The problem was that the person in the audience did n’t respond to the call because the information was of a delicate nature .
It concerned a lady who was apparently barren .
Allegedly she was unable to have children , and was understandably embarrassed to bring attention to herself .
Gumbel sympathises with the lady in question by saying , “ We ’re British , we do n’t even talk about things like that , let alone come forward in response to a word like that ! ”
The preacher waited .
And he waited .
Eventually the lady got out of her seat and bravely came forward .
Gumbel tells us that the preacher “ had no idea that she ’d been trying for children for some time and that [ she was ] unable to conceive ” .
He also had no idea that the lady and her partner had been “ having various tests ” in the hope of identifying , and solving , the problem .
Gumbel states that the preacher then , “ prayed for her ” .
You may be wondering what happened to that lady .
I ’ll let Gumbel break the news , “ Nine months later she gave birth to a little baby boy ! ”
Even after the immensely successful healing and ‘ words of knowledge ’ demonstration , Gumbel says that for some reason he was still sceptical about the whole affair .
So when he got home that night he “ started to re-read the Bible , to see what it said on this whole subject of healing ”
He continues , “ Of course , God heals with the cooperation of doctors , nurses and the medical profession , but the more I look the more convinced I am that we should expect that God would also heal miraculously .
Today ! ”
What does “ God heals with the cooperation of doctors , nurses and the medical profession ” supposed to mean ?
This is something that was mentioned last week .
If doctors and nurses are trained to help people recover from illness and injury , and all this is done through natural means , then why the need to shoehorn a supernatural God into the equation ?
The simple fact of the matter is that “ God ” offers no explanatory power here at all .
“ If you look in the Old Testament God promises healing for his people .
It ’s [ in ] his character to heal .
He says , “ I am the Lord that heals you ”
It ’s part of his love for us ! ” exclaims Gumbel .
He then gives us an example of when a certain person was healed by God in the Bible .
This is quickly followed by Gumbel assuring us that , “ If God acted like that in the Old Testament , when there were only glimpses of the Kingdom of God and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit , we can confidently expect that he will do so even more now that Jesus has inaugurated the Kingdom of God .
And the fact that we live now in the Age of the Spirit ! ”
Yes , we know all too well how God acted in the Old Testament !
I ’d have thought that Gumbel would have wanted to have kept that quiet !
He then tells us of the alleged “ first recorded words of Jesus ” which can be found in Mark 1:15 , “ The time has come .
The Kingdom of God is near .
Repent and believe the good news ”
Gumbel then passionately enthuses , “ The first time Jesus came he came in weakness ” , but we should n’t worry about that because “ When he comes back he ’ll come with power and great glory .
History is moving towards this glorious climax ” I must say , if he were reading this straight from a comic book it would n’t sound any more childish .
Supposedly sometime soon a powerful , invisible , cloud - hopping sky - deity is going to materialise from the ether and wave his magic wand to make everything better .
I wonder if Mr Gumbel is willing to place a wager on that ?
If so , I ’ll gladly act as his bookmaker .
Gumbel continues , “ When Jesus returns it will be obvious to EVERYONE ” Let ’s hope so , because it was n’t so obvious to everyone the first time he put in an appearance on earth !
Remember this fact : NOT A SINGLE SOURCE OUTSIDE OF THE BIBLE MADE ANY MENTION OF HIM DURING HIS SUPPOSED LIFETIME .
That ’s right , not a single one .
So , like I say , let ’s hope Jesus does a better job of convincing people the second time around .
More comic - book style claims follow from Gumbel , “ There will be a new heaven and a new earth .
Jesus himself will be there together with all those who love and obey him .
It will be a place of intense happiness , which goes on forever .
And we will all have new resurrection bodies that will never die ! ”
Even as I ’m typing up this transcript I have to stop and make myself a cup of coffee .
I have to have a break while I think to myself how it can be possible for seemingly intelligent , educated and mature adults to believe such obvious nonsense .
Gumbel then assures that “ this future Kingdom is coming .
It ’s near ! ” .
He tells us that Jesus told his disciples to go and spread the word and to heal the sick .
“ Healing is one of the signs of the Kingdom ” , he adds .
Gumbel reveals more about the process of healing : “ It ’s God that heals , not us .
There ’s no technique involved .
We pray with love and simplicity ” .
Does
God heal people because we pray ?
Or would he have healed them anyway ?
If it ’s the former then he obviously wants us to beg before he acts .
If it ’s the latter then prayer achieves nothing , it ’s merely an exercise in futility .
Gumbel then turns his attention to ‘ words of knowledge ’ .
“ We have found that words of knowledge can be very helpful .
It ’s one of the ways in which God speaks ” he says .
He then tells us of the time he had knee - cartilage surgery about four years ago .
But the surgery was n’t a success , as his knee problems started again shortly afterwards .
One night at church someone had a ‘ word of knowledge ’ for “ a right knee ” and within no time three other people had received similar messages from God relating to a “ right knee ” .
Something tells me that perhaps the sight of Gumbel hobbling into church that evening may have had something to do with it .
Not to mention the fact that Gumbel is well known in church circles , and many would have been already aware of his knee surgery anyway .
Gumbel eventually came forward and told the group that he did indeed have an injured right knee ( much to their surprise ? ) , and that God must have been referring to him in these ‘ words of knowledge ’ .
The church group then prayed for his knee .
“ And I ’ve had no problems with it since then ” , boasts Gumbel , proudly .
Like I said last week , this talented bunch of churchgoers should pay a visit to their local children ’s hospital and set to work on curing some poor , pain - riddled , terminally ill youngsters .
Sadly , though , God does n’t seem keen for them to do their work in such places .
I often wonder , too , why such prayers never work on amputees ?
We always hear of people that are supposedly “ miraculously healed ” of headaches , sore throats , knee pains and back pains , but I do n’t know of anyone having an arm or leg grow back after a prayer to the omnipotent God .
That ’s something to think about .
“ It ’s important to persist ” with prayers , states Gumbel .
We must n’t “ get discouraged if we do n’t see immediate and dramatic results . ”
How long do amputees have to wait , I wonder ?
“ The reason I go on praying is not so much that I ’ve seen masses of people healed , but because Jesus commanded us to do it .
And that ’s why I would go on doing it even if NO ONE was healed ”
How incredibly revealing .
Gumbel then finishes his presentation with , “ God is a God that healed in the past and still heals today ! ”
The lights are switched on and the bowls of fruit salad are passed around .
As the group are eating , the pastor says , “ If anybody wants a prayer for healing , we can pray tonight ” Hopefully it will have more success than the last time they prayed for God to reveal himself to me .
Like those amputees , I ’m still waiting .
Lady
Three mentions that she ’s been having trouble with her knee recently , due to the fact that she ’s just taken up cycling .
The pastor says that he ’ll pray for a healing later on .
I ’m looking forward to that .
Hopefully she does n’t jump out of her seat and start tap - dancing or body - popping immediately afterwards .
I ’ve managed to keep a straight face for eight weeks , and I ’m hoping to keep it that way .
“ So , any questions , reflections , or thoughts about tonight ’s presentation before we pray for people ? ” asks the pastor .
Unsurprisingly I have a few questions for the group , but I keep quiet in the hope that someone else will offer something .
But no one else does .
The pastor shuffles his chair closer to the troubled knee of Lady Three .
He ’s warming up his hands and looks as though he ’s about to summon God into the offending area .
At this point the long - standing male member turns to me and says , “ Go on , ask your question , Stephen ” Well , I suppose it would be rude not to …
Me : [ I turn towards the pastor ]
“ I ’m just curious about this ‘ healing ’ thing .
I asked [ Lady Two ] a similar question last week , so I ’ll ask you something along the same lines .
If I were to now offer up a prayer to Lord Vishnu in the hope that he would heal her problematic knee [ the knee of Lady Three ] , what are you going to do if her knee gets better ?
Will I have offered you sufficient proof that Lord Vishnu answers prayers , or are you going to dismiss it out of hand ? ”
Pastor : [ Long pause ] “ Errr … ”
Lady
Two : “ It would just be coincidence ”
Pastor : [ In response to Lady Two ] “ Yeah , probably ”
Me : “ So why would you expect me to think any differently about the prayer you ’re about to offer ?
What good reason would I have for believing that your prayer made her knee better ?
Surely the best explanation would be that it was “ just a coincidence ” , yes ? ”
Pastor : [ Embarrassingly long pause ]
“ Because …. of …. continued experience … of … of… healing , and … the belief that …
Jesus told us to do that ”
The pastor looks completely flummoxed by my simple question .
His face is red and he looks noticeably uncomfortable .
Maybe he ’s just about had enough of my pesky questions …
The long - standing male member jumps in confidently , as if to rubbish my question : Long - Standing Male Member : “ Do you believe in any of those religions , Steve ? ”
Me : “ No , of course not ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ So if you say you ’re praying to Vishnu then you ’re not doing it in faith ”
Me : “ But the thing is I could do .
And if I did you ’d dismiss it , would n’t you ? ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ No ”
Me : [ Surprised ] “ Really ?
Then I ’ll offer a genuine prayer to Vishnu tonight .
Let ’s see what happens . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Look , the devil counterfeits .
When Nicky Gumbel talks about ‘ words of knowledge ’ and ‘ healing ’ , the devil does the same . ”
Me : “ So if [ Lady Three ’s ] knee gets better after your prayer could I say that the Christian God was n’t responsible because he is nothing but one of the devil ’s counterfeits ?
Could I say it was actually Vishnu who answered the prayer instead ? ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Nicky Gumbel pointed out that the motive for prayer has got to be love .
It ’s not how eloquent I am or how many big words I use .
It ’s none of that .
It ’s done in faith , and for the person we ’re praying for it ’s done with love .
I do n’t have to be a minister or a special person .
It ’s nothing to do with me .
I ’m just a channel that God uses . ”
Me : “ People of other religions pray in love and faith .
They ’re just as sincere as you are . ”
Long -Standing Male Member : “ Yeah ”
Me : “ But you would n’t accept their accounts of having prayers answered .
You ’d dismiss every single one of them ”
Pastor : “ Jesus never saw healing as a means to convincing people ”
Me : “ I ’m not saying that he did .
What I am saying , though , is that you would not be convinced by an identical account given by a Hindu , who claimed that his prayer was responsible for the healing of an individual ’s knee .
You would n’t see a causal link between that Hindu ’s prayer and the recovery of an injured knee . ”
Pastor : “ No , I would n’t ”
Me : “ So , with respect , why would you expect us to believe that there ’s a causal link between your prayer and [ Lady Three ’s ] knee getting better ? ”
There ’s another excruciatingly long pause as the pastor digs deep to think of an answer .
Lady
Three breaks the silence : Lady Three : “ The Christian faith works together with salvation .
The Bible says that Jesus took upon himself our infirmities , our sorrows , and our sins .
I ca n’t speak for the other faiths because I ‘ve not really studied them .
I do n’t know what these other gods say about themselves but , for me , Jesus is there .
He ’s the author of creation , the king of creation . ”
Me : “ I do n’t doubt that is what you believe , but , in all fairness , that ’s got nothing to do with the question I ’m asking . ”
Lady
Three : “ Well , I ca n’t answer for the other gods because I do n’t know enough about them .
I only know what Jesus says about himself ”
Me : “ That ’s all well and good .
And by the way I hope your knee does get better .
Now , we all know that I do n’t actually believe in Vishnu , but I could take that “ leap of faith ” and offer up a genuine prayer tonight in the hope that it will result in your knee getting better .
And , like I say , if it does get better have I proved that Vishnu answers prayers ?
If not , why would you expect me to believe that the pastor ’s prayers will result in a recovered knee ? ”
Lady
Three : “ I believe that if God wants us to receive a blessing from him then we should receive it .
It ’s in the Bible , you see .
[ She then looks at me sympathetically ]
You ’ve not got to that point yet where you ’re persuaded that any of this is true , have you ? ”
Me : “ I think the reason why I ’m not persuaded is because all of the “ evidence ” that has been offered here , and the arguments that have been given , are exactly the same sorts of “ evidence ” and arguments that people of other religions offer .
But you do n’t believe any of them .
You do n’t find those arguments in the least bit convincing , yet you use them yourself .
You use methods that you do n’t trust . ”
Out of the corner of my eye I can see that Lady Two is in a deep , contemplative mood .
She ’s looking at me , thinking deeply , trying to figure me out .
I ’m sure she ’s in the process of diagnosing the reason for my scepticism , again .
Suddenly she speaks , and so begins my therapy session .
She ’s going to get to the root of my problem through a process of elimination : Lady Two :
“ You know when you were a child at school , during morning assembly did you ever say the Lord ’s Prayer ? ”
Me : “ Yes .
Every morning , I think ”
Lady
Two : “ When you were in your bed at night did you ever used to say your prayers to God ? ”
Me : “ Yes .
In fact my mother had placed a crucifix on my bedroom wall , and many nights before I got into bed I would kneel
Four daring protestors
accomplished something today that no high ranking member in the Obama
administration involved in the recent mountaintop removal mining policy
decisions has ever bothered to do :
These four American patriots made an
actual visit to a mountaintop removal site .
They also went beyond the call of duty .
Scaling a towering 20 - story dragline ( those behemoth stripmining
machines that could rip up a Manhattan block in a New York minute ) and
then unfolding a 15 x 150 foot banner at the Twilight mountaintop
removal strip mine in Boone County , West Virginia , they also unveiled a
simple message on how the EPA , the Department of Interior and the
Council on Environmental Quality can best enforce the Clean Water Act
and other environmental laws :
JUST STOP MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL .
The action launches a dramatic weeklong series of protests at
mountaintop removal sites in the West Virginia coalfields that will
culminate on June 23rd with a special action in the Coal River Valley
area with local coalfield residents , NASA climate scientist James
Hansen , actress Daryl Hannah , and 94 - year - old former US Representative
Ken Hechler , and Rainforest Action Action executive director Michael
Brune , among many others .
" It 's way past time for civil disobedience to stop mountaintop
removal and move quickly toward clean , renewable energy sources , " said
Judy Bonds , Goldman Environmental Prize winner and co-director of Coal
River Mountain Watch of West Virginia .
" For over a century , Appalachian
communities have been crushed , flooded , and poisoned as a result of the
country 's dangerous and outdated reliance on coal .
How could the
country care so little about our American mountains , our culture and
our lives ? "

removal mine can be seen here :

Equipped with satellite phones and web cameras , the protestors plan
to stay on the enormous dragline until they are arrested .
Another group
of protestors on the ground have already been reached by the police .
" I 've written letters , attended hearings and called my congressman ,
so far they have done nothing to stop the disastrous and unnecessary
practice of mountaintop removal , " said Charles Suggs , a 25 - year old of
Rock Creek , WV , one of today 's participants .
" It has come to the point
when we must take direct action to abolish this practice that is
immorally robbing Appalachian communities of their culture , their
health and their future . "
Despite last week 's best - laid - plans by the Obama administration to
provide stronger reviews of mountaintop removal permits under current
laws -- notwithstanding the 42 out of the 48 mining permits cleared by
the EPA last month -- the protest today draws attention to the reality
that over 3.5 million pounds of ammonium nitrate / fuel oil explosives
are being detonated DAILY in mountaintop removal operations across the
West Virginia mountains alone , while hundreds of mountaintop removal
permits now stand ready to be reviewed and cleared .
In last week 's announcement , CEQ chief Nancy Sutley declared that
the Obama administration would do " all it can under existing laws and
regulations to curb the most environmentally destructive impacts of
mountaintop coal mining . "
Read that line again : " Curb the most environmentally destructive impacts of mountaintop coal mining . "
If Sutley joined the protestors at the Twilight site or any mountaintop
removal operation , she would witness firsthand , as well , that even the
LEAST " environmentally destructive impacts of mountaintop removal "
REQUIRE massive clear cutting of our nation 's most diverse and oldest
deciduous forests on the continent , setting ANFO explosives and
blasting the mountains to bits , showering the neighboring communities
with silica dust and dangerous fly rock , and then dumping the mine
waste and heavy metals into the valleys and streams and watersheds .

Account Services Corporation , one of two payment processors to have funds seized by the United States Department of Justice , is asking for its money back in Federal District Court .
In court documents filed on Friday in San Diego , the company said federal authorities had seized approximately $ 14 m from three of its California bank accounts in June .
Most of that money belonged to Internet poker players - around 13,800 of them .
Pursuant to a warrant , around $ 13 m was seized from one Wells Fargo account in Escondido on June 2 .
But the company said $ 1 m , held separately in two accounts with Union Bank in San Diego , had been seized without a warrant on June 12 .

The Helix Nebula , NGC 7293 , is not only one of the most interesting and beautiful planetary nebulae ; it is also one of the closest nebulae to Earth , at a distance of only 710 light years away .
A new image , taken with an infrared camera on the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii , shows tens of thousands of previously unseen comet - shaped knots inside the nebula .
The sheer number of knots -- more than have ever been seen before -- looks like a massive fireworks display in space .
The Helix Nebula was the first planetary nebula in which knots were seen , and their presence may provide clues to what planetary material may survive at the end of a star ’s life .
Planetary nebulae are the final stages in the lives of low - mass stars , such as our Sun .
As they reach the ends of their lives they throw off large amounts of material into space .
Although the nebula looks like a fireworks display , the process of developing a nebula is neither explosive nor instantaneous ; it takes place slowly , over a period of about 10,000 to 1,000,000 years .
This gradual process creates these nebulae by exposing their inner cores , where nuclear burning once took place and from which bright ultraviolet radiation illuminates the ejected material .
Astronomers from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan ( NAOJ ) , from London , Manchester and Kent universities in the UK and from a university in Missouri in the USA studied the emissions from hydrogen molecules in the infrared and found that knots are found throughout the entire nebula .
Although these molecules are often destroyed by ultraviolet radiation in space , they have survived in these knots , shielded by dust and gas that can be seen in optical images .
The comet - like shape of these knots results from the steady evaporation of gas from the knots , produced by the strong winds and ultraviolet radiation from the dying star in the center of the nebula .
Unlike previous optical images of the Helix Nebula knots , the infrared image shows thousands of clearly resolved knots , extending out from the central star at greater distances than previously observed .
The extent of the cometary tails varies with the distance from the central star , just as Solar System comets have larger tails when they are closer to the Sun and when wind and radiation are stronger .
“ This research shows how the central star slowly destroys the knots and highlights the places where molecular and atomic material can be found in space , ” says lead astronomer Dr. Mikako Matsuura , previously at NAOJ and now from University College London .
These images enable astronomers to estimate that there may be as many as 40,000 knots in the entire nebula , each of which are billions of kilometers / miles across .
Their total mass may be as much as 30,000 Earths , or one - tenth the mass of our Sun .
The origin of the knots is currently unknown .
Are they remnants of the star 's planetary system or are they material ejected from the star at some stage in its life ?
Either answer will help astronomers answer important questions about the lives of stars and planetary systems .
The innovative technology of the Subaru Telescope with its near - infrared camera , MOIRCS , enabled researchers to produce such impressive images .
Mounted on one of the largest infrared optical telescopes in the world , MOIRCS ( Multi- object Infrared Camera and Spectrograph ) has a large ( 4 arcmin by 7 arcmin ) field of view , allowing it to capture , with a single shot , such detailed features in a large PN .

TBILISI ( Reuters ) - Masked police beat dozens of opposition protesters in the Georgian capital on Monday in the latest flare - up during a weeks - long street campaign against President Mikheil Saakashvili , witnesses said .
A Georgian policeman ( L ) hits an opposition protester in Tbilisi , June 15 , 2009 .
Dozens of black - clad men armed with truncheons emerged from the main police station in Tbilisi to confront a protest of about 50 people demanding the release of several opposition activists detained last week .
Tensions were running high in the former Soviet republic , where President Mikheil Saakashvili has resisted more than two months of protests and roadblocks in Tbilisi .

Dozens of black - clad police officers armed with truncheons confronted a protest of about 50 people at Tbilisi ’s main police station demanding the release of six opposition activists detained since Friday , a Reuters photographer said .
He said several protesters and a photographer for the European Pressphoto Agency were severely beaten .
Senior opposition official Zurab Abashidze was admitted to hospital .
Police seized cameras from photographers and cameramen , including a Reuters photographer .
The cameras were later returned but the Reuters photographer ’s images had been erased .
Other photographers said their memory cards had been taken .
Tensions are running high in the former Soviet republic , after more than two months of opposition protests and roadblocks demanding Saakashvili quit over his record on democracy and last year ’s disastrous war with Russia .
The volatile country of 4.5 million people sits on Russia ’s southern border , at the heart of a transit region for oil and gas to the West .
“ This is absolutely unacceptable , ” protest leader and former Saakashvili ally Nino Burjanadze said of the violence .
“ We demand a response from our Western partners , to give their assessment of the situation . ”
Saakashvili said he was tolerating a state of “ lawlessness ” and accused his opponents of trying to provoke him .
“ They think Saakashvili is hot - headed , they insult ( parliament speaker David ) Bakradze and ( Prime Minister Nika ) Gilauri , and they try to make us crush them , ” he told a televised meeting of the parliamentary majority .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Police firing tear gas and rubber bullets dispersed the last mass demonstrations against Saakashvili in 2007 .
Watched closely by the West , authorities are wary of taking a hard line again , but analysts question how long the stalemate can continue .
“ CRIMINALS AND BANDITS ”
Both sides have traded blame for a spate of violent incidents , vying for the sympathy of Georgia ’s Western allies .
The opposition said that statements by several Western embassies on Friday , in which they criticized opposition protesters for throwing rocks and bottles at Bakradze ’s official car , had encouraged the government to take a hard line .
“ The statements made by the U.S. , French and Czech ambassadors clearly gave impetus to the authorities to act as criminals and bandits today , ” opposition leader David Gamkrelidze said .
The Interior Ministry said in a statement that protesters were hampering traffic and resisted police efforts “ to unblock the entrance to the police station and restore traffic movement . ”
It said 39 protesters were detained .
Deputy Interior Minister Eka Zguladze said police had acted inappropriately toward journalists .
“ It is our mistake .
We admit it and apologize , ” she told a news conference .
Pro-opposition television stations Maestro and Kavkasia said they would temporarily halt broadcasting in protest .
Turnout at the demonstrations has waned , but dozens of mock prison cells erected around parliament continue to block traffic through central Tbilisi .
Earlier on Monday , men in civilian clothes armed with knives broke up mock prison cells behind parliament .
The opposition accuse 41 - year - old Saakashvili of monopolizing power since the 2003 “ Rose Revolution ” that propelled him to the presidency .
He has faced renewed pressure since last August , when Russia crushed a Georgian assault on the breakaway pro-Russian region of South Ossetia .
But analysts question whether the opposition has the unity or the numbers to unseat him .
どうしてプログラマに・・・プログラムが書けないのか?を読んでいて出てきたので出展の一つを訳してみた。Separating Programming Sheep from Non-Programming Goatsの和訳。
プログラミングというものには向き不向きが強く出るということはわりと知られていると思うが、このエントリではプログラミングができるかできないかは比較的簡単なテストによって、プログラミングの訓練を始める前の段階で分かると主張している。どうしてプログラマに・・・プログラムが書けないのか?では、そもそもこの事前テストをパスしていないような人達までプログラマとして応募してくると言っており、その判定法として有名なFizzBuzz問題を挙げている。
訳出はじ め
実に多くの人がリンクしているこの論文( PDF )では、プログラムやプログラミング言語に触ったことがない学生達を対象に、「プログラミングのできる羊とできない山羊を区別する方法」を提案している。
私はプログラマーと非プログラマーの区別がこんなにも早い段階ではっきりとつくということに気付いていなかった。Dan Bricklinはその感動を彼のエッセ
イ
” Why Johnny Can't Program ” の中で述べている。しかしこの現象は計算機科学を教えている人々の間では明らかに一般常識であった。
電子計算 機が1950年代に発明されて以来、多くの変化が起こったが、頑として変わらないこともある。とりわけ次のことが言えるだろう。「かなり多くの人々がプログラミングを学ぶことができない」。すなわち、毎年計算機科学の学部1年生の30％から60％は最初のプログラミングのコースを落とすということだ。
経験豊富な教師にはこの事実が身に染みており、彼らはうんざりしている。
その一方で、目を輝かせている初心者の方では、この老人は何か間違った方法で人を教えてきたに違いないと信じており、自らの苦い経験を通してそれが真実であると知ることになる。このようにして1960年代から始まったこの問題は二世代に渡って残り続けている。
読者はプログラミング適性を判定する彼らの実験は複雑なものではないかと思うかもしれないが、それは違う。
第一の問いはこのようなものだ。
int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; a = b ;
aとbの新しい値は以下の組合せのうちどれか : a = 20 , b = 0
a = 20 , b = 20
a = 0 , b = 10
a = 10 , b = 10
a = 30 , b = 20
a = 30 , b = 0
a = 10 , b = 30
a = 0 , b = 30
a = 10 , b = 20
a = 20 , b = 10
このテストは職業プログラマにとっては自明なものだが、あくまでコードを一度も見たことのない学生にむけてのテストだということを思い起こして欲しい。他にも12問の同じような課題が出される。
この論文の著者は計算機科学における最初のハードルは以下のようなものになると仮定している。
代入と系列 再帰 / 繰り返し 同時並列 性
上から順にハードルは高くなっていく。従ってテストは新米プログラマに対する最初のハードルである代入から始めていく。このテストの結果は3つのグループに綺麗に分かれる。
学生の44％は代入がどのように働くかについて一貫したモデルを持つに至る（たとえ正しくなくとも）
39％の学生は代入のモデルとして一貫したものを形成できない。
8％の学生はふてくされて回答を空白のままにする。
このテストは2回実施された。最初の一回目を何の説明もなしに行い、3週間後にもう一度行った。印象的なことは、一回目と二回目では実質的にグループの変化がほとんど無かったことである。つまり、一回目のテストであなたが心の中に一貫したモデルを得られるかどうかが最初のハードルになっている。
著者はプログラミングができることと一貫したモデルを心に持てるかどうかの間には極めて高い相関があることに気付いた。
明らかに 、Dehnahdiのテストはプログラミングのできる羊とできない山羊を分離する方法として完全ではない。
にも関わらず、もしこのテストが入試の基準として用いられ、一貫性のあるモデルを持つことが出来た学生のみが入学していたとすれば、プログラミングのコースをパスする学生数の統計は変わってくるだろう。全体では61人中32人（52％）がコースを落としたが、最初のテストで一貫性があったグループ内では27人中6人（22％）がコースを落としたに過ぎなかった。我々はこのコースの可否についての事前知識を与える予測テストを行ったといえる。しかもその正確性はかなり高い。これは我々の知る限りでは予測に成功した最初の実験である。
この論文の原稿は、味気ない学術論文かと思いきや、実に楽しめるものだったので、皆さんにも通読されることを強くお勧めする。実際のところ、ブログのエントリのように読みやすかったのだ。これは例えば以下のような興味深い洞察で満たされている。
十分なデータ数がないので疑わしいままではあるが、最初のテストにおける3つのグループの違いは「無意味なもの」に対する姿勢の違いのように見える。
形式論理的な証明、つまりプログラム（プログラム言語と呼ばれる形式的なシステムで表現されている、特定の計算が可能である形式論理的証明）は、それ自体はまったくの無意味（meaningless）である。あなたがプログラムを書くためには、あなたがプログラムに意味して欲しいことがなんであれ、これを受け入れる必要がある。機械は盲目的にその無意味なルールに従い、何らかの無意味な結論に至るのだ。
この実験で一貫性を持つことができたグループはこの事実を事前に受け入れていたことを示した。すなわち、彼らは数学的計算の問題をルールの集まりという観点から見ることができ、それらが最終的にどこを目指しているにせよ、それを無視してルールに従うことができるということである。一方で一貫性を持てなかったグループはそこには無い意味を探した。空白で出したグループはそれが無意味であるとみて、それを扱うことを拒否した。
コンピュータの使い方は誰もが知るべきだが、誰もがプログラマになる必要はない。
しかし実際のプログラミングはどうやら計算機科学の新入生のかなりの部分集合に文字通り「教えられないもの」であるということは少し気掛りである。明らかに誰もが我々のように無意味なルールと無意味な結論に魅了されるわけではないのであるが、私には何故そのような違いが現われるのか想像できない。

The Irish singer Van Morrison was well into his set at a concert in his native isle before a crowd in high spirits .
Enthusiastic applause followed every song .
At one point in the excited hubbub as Van tried to signal the band to start a new song , a voice yelled out over the crowd , " We love you , Van ! " .
This moved the dour and laconic performer to make his only remark of the evening to his audience .
Said Van emphatically to his adoringly ebullient fan : " Fucking shut the fuck up . "
My friend Jim McCloskey , the Irish syntactician ( in both senses of that phrase ) told me this story .
He was present at the concert and reported the event .
He is a great Van Morrison fan , and I think he views the incident as just a disarmingly inappropriate verbal symptom of Van the Man 's well - known shyness and stage fright .
I like the story too , but on a less sympathetic basis : I happen to detest Van Morrison 's music .
His bare , strained voice appeals to me not at all , and I hate even his most popular recordings .
( I once offered to put five dollars in the tips jar at the Stevenson College Coffee House at UC Santa Cruz if they would stop playing the Van Morrison CD they had put on .
They did , and I did .
So his music has negative cash value for me : I have actually paid money to not hear it . )
For me the story is about a foul - mouthed verbal indication that the curmudgeonly Celtic soulster is as gratingly unpleasant to his public as his music is to my ears .
But no matter .
Never mind the man or his music .
We are here to try to learn what we can from the syntax of the interesting expression he used .
The main syntactic problem is to determine whether the fuck is being used as an pleonastic ( semantically empty ) direct object of shut or as a pre-head modifier of the preposition phrase ( PP ) headed by up .
( Yes , the up of shut up is a one - word PP .
It is not an adverb — all the traditional grammars are flat wrong on that .
The arguments are given in chapter 7 of The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language , or more tersely in A Student 's Introduction to English Grammar . )
And I think we can do this .
Note first that we also have examples like
Get the fuck up those stairs , where again the fuck is after a verb before a PP , and is semantically inert ( the utterance means " Get up those stairs " ) .
And in both these cases , the PP is obligatory : neither * Shut the fuck nor * Get the fuck are grammatical with the pleonastic reading of the fuck .
Second , the fuck can co-occur with a direct object NP :
I do n't know how a full - grown Burmese python got into this maternity ward , but get it the fuck out of here before it eats any babies .
Treatingas a direct object would give us two direct objects for one monotransitive verb in such a case .
Third , the expletive in question can also occur with intransitive verbs :
I was trapped in the crowd at a Van Morrison concert and I was wishing I had wings so that I could just soar the fuck out of there .
The verbdoes n't allow direct object NPs at all , sosimply can't be a direct object .
I conclude that in colloquial English the NP the fuck ( and it does indeed have the form of an NP ) can function as a pre-head modifier in a PP , including the light one - word PPs ( like up ) that are known as particles .
The fact that there can be such a modifier underlines the correctness of treating up as the head of a phrase , of course .
Van Morrison 's bracingly filthy put - down had the structure shown here in tree form :
The Adverb and the NP are both functioning as modifiers .
The Clause is of imperative clause type .
Shut is ( as usual in the shut up idiomatic construction ) intransitive .
I will leave the comments area open below , but fucking try to exhibit some fucking phraseological delicacy .
[ Addendum :
The distinction between intransitive uses of expletive NPs as in this case ( get the hell out of here ) and the transitive ones from which they may derive ( beat the hell out of him ) is drawn in a interesting — and not too technical — recent paper by Jack Hoeksema and Donna Jo Napoli on the syntax , semantics , and history of such idioms , " Just for the hell of it : A comparison of two taboo - term constructions " , published in Journal of Linguistics 44:2 ( 2008 ) , 347-378 . — GKP ]

In the summer of 1994 folk singer Bob Dylan sued Apple for trademark infringement .
The musician was seeking to bar the company from using his name in conjunction with any new software product .
Apple had in fact been developing a programming language derived from Scheme and Lisp and had called it ‘ Dylan ’ .
It was created in the early 1990s and was originally intended for use with the Newton platform .
Unfortunately the implementation did not reach sufficient maturity in time , and the development of the platform was instead done with a combination of C and NewtonScript , invented by Walter Smith .
The Dylan language internally was code - named Ralph and only later adopted its name , chosen by James Joaquin .
It supposedly stood for “ DYnamic LANguage ” .
After Bob Dylan took legal action Apple was forced to reach a confidential out - of - court settlement to obtain the rights to trademark Dylan .
The Cupertino company briefly released the language for 68 k - based Macs in the fall of 1995 , with a “ technology release ” version available ( “ Apple Dylan TR1 ” ) that included an advanced IDE .
The same year Apple promptly abandoned the effort .
Fortunately the language has survived and is actively maintained by a group of volunteers , the Gwydion Maintainers .
During the Nineties two other parties contributed to the design of Dylan and developed their implementations .
One was a commercial IDE for Microsoft Windows , done by Harlequin and the second was an open source compiler for Unix systems , done by Carnegie Mellon University .
Both of these implementations are now open source and available online - as Open Dylan and Gwydion Dylan - for a variety of platforms thanks to the aforementioned Gwydion Maintainers .

AURORA — Helicopters , ambulances and up to 500 people are participating in a mock emergency at Buckley Air Force Base in the Denver suburb of Aurora .
The exercise starts Friday afternoon and ends Saturday evening .
Aurora officials say the exercise could entail traffic delays and loud noises around Buckley , with helicopters landing at The Children ’s Hospital and the University of Colorado Hospital .
The exercise is called “ Vigilant Front Range . ”
With strawberry frosted doughnut in hand , I headed to the far left side of the Lars Anderson Auto Museum in Brookline last Friday , where several dozen auto writers and PR heads gathered for a drive of exotic proportions : a romp to Kennebunkport and back to test 2009 's latest convertibles .
There was nothing shabby about the middle and right sides — Corvette , Phantom Drophead , Viper , two Z4s , among others — but over here were three machines touted in $ 1,000 - per - day enthusiast drives , fender - to - fender : a $ 146,000 SL63 AMG , $ 200,000 Aston Martin DB9 Volante , and the knight - worthy $ 400,000 Bentley Azure T. I left the museum in a $ 50,000 Infiniti G37 Convertible — not a bad starter by any consideration .
Infiniti did a commendable job cutting the roof off the G37 ( and creating a new one ) .
Its rear haunches are appropriately flared , and the shoulder line stays low and tight like on the coupe .
Trunk space is limited to crushable items only ; a thin fabric flap separates the tiny cargo hold from the massive folding roof .
Day trippers wonât mind , and will like how pleasant the G37 is at a highway cruise , with minimal wind buffeting and surprising audio clarity from the Bose speakers ( with clever tweeters mounted on either side of both front headrests ) .
I didnât pay much else attention to the G37 as I did the matte white SL63 AMG trailing behind me .
At a rest stop near the New Hampshire border on I - 95 , I bolted toward the Benzâs driver to beg for the keys in exchange for mine .
Incredibly , he accepted .
Now the MSRP has nearly tripled .
Mercedes freshened up the SL for 2009 , tweaking the front end for a more sinister appearance and throwing in a brand new AMG - tuned 6.2 liter V - 8 good for 518 horsepower .
From the ducted carbon fiber valence under the bumper and subtle lip spoiler above , itâs clear this SL isnât content with boulevard cruiser status .
The steering wheel is squared - off at the bottom , just like on the Lamborghini Gallardo , and the cockpit is serious business with its dark chocolate leather , steering wheel paddles and several buttons and knobs for extracting maximum volume from the quad tailpipes .
My co-pilot Chris Naughton , Hondaâs Northeast PR manager , plugs in his iPod .
But Michael McDonald is soon drowned out by the AMGâs brutal torque as weâre followed by the DB9 and hairy - chested Viper .
As I merge to the far left lane , Iâm not sure whatâs crazier â being passed at 80 miles per hour by a Viper with cameras suctioned onto its windshield , or my accidental engaging of the cruise control stalk as Iâm reaching for the turn signals .
Itâs incredibly easy to reach incarcerating speeds in these cars , and soon weâve all settled down into a swift cruise .
The SL63 coddles but demands subtle inputs .
The steering rack is quick , and throaty downshifts in S+ mode send your head forward .
While the brake pedal was a touch soft in initial travel , the big rotors delivered linear , smooth performance .
After a jaunt in the SL63 , itâs plain frightening to think of the twin - turbo V - 12 SL65 AMG , and hard to justify that carâs equivalent premium of a G37 Convertible .
The SL63âs delicate balance , incredibly responsive 7 - speed automatic and muscle car soundtrack make it the marqueâs most desirable car , at least until the SLS arrives .
When we reach the Maine border at another rest stop , itâs time again to swap keys .
A group of young men walking from the bathrooms peep at us with point - and - shoot cameras , and donât move until weâve figured out how to start the Aston Martin and exit out of sight .
Itâs not the most intuitive push - button start .
After popping out several times , we realized the key fob needed to be pushed and held into its center dash slot for at least two seconds .
The fob , capped with a clear glass - like enclosure , blends into the dash so well that a few drivers , forgetting to take out the key , thought they had lost it altogether .
But once started and past the goofy P - R - N - D buttons spanning either side of the key slot ( our own John Paul likened it to a 1962 Chrysler ) , the Aston delivered butter - smooth shifts from its paddle - shifted 6 - speed automatic , no matter that the tachometer was spinning counter - clockwise .
The DB9âs mission is quick speed without making a scene , unlike the raucous SL63 .
That means a very hushed exhaust tone at city speeds , which caused me to press the â Nâ button to light up Kennebunkport with some proper noise from the 6.0 liter , 470 horsepower V - 12 .
On the highway , acceleration isnât as violent as in the Benz , nor as visceral as the half - price Jaguar XKR Convertible , but the speed comes along just as easily , along with a racket of wind noise .
The other exotics in our fleet , however , canât touch the DB9 on design .
The way the doors swivel upwards several degrees , uncovering even more hand - stitched leather along the dashboardâs hidden sides , is just one treat .
The arching single piece of wood ( endangered and from Africa , hopefully ) is stunning , as is the jewel - like design of the instrumentation and delectable 20 - spoke wheels accenting a clean - cut body profile .
Its performance is impressive , but as a whole the DB9 is too sedated .
For pure beauty , the Aston has no equal .
Itâs time to go ultra -snotty on the way back .
Automobile Magazineâs Ezra
Dyer has just left our surfside lunch spot , the Colony Hotel , in the back of the Rolls - Royce Phantom Drophead .
So I head to the back of the Bentley Azure T , which aside from the Phantom ( and perhaps the Continental GTC ) is the only convertible on the market that can actually fit four actual adults .
Legroom is generous , and the rear armrest easily holds small items like a digital camera snugly in place .
Red leather covers everything , a perfect contrast to the layers and layers of silver paint on this Old World convertible .
The incredulous stares from passersby are as intense as the sun as Keith Griffin of About.com takes the helm through Kennebunkport .
Sitting in the Azure unveils my inner New England snob , and before I know it my scalp is flat on the plush headrest , my right arm hanging off the Bentleyâs flanks , and all of a sudden Iâve welded an iPhone and a popped collar .
And Iâm yawning , because the Azure is the worldâs best mattress .
Soon Keith and I trade places , and heâs snoring in the front seat even in stop - and - go traffic on I - 95 south .
You canât feel anything from the Azureâs suspension â even the worst of ruts donât reach the cabin or upset its occupants .
Braking and accelerating are akin to slathering whipped butter on a bagel .
Passengers could assume the Azure isnât built to hustle â itâs nearly three tons and the tachometerâs 500 r.p.m increments look straight off a bus â  but when the driver leans on the gas , everyone gets thrown back by the V - 8âs colossal 738 pound - feet of torque , enough to rush the Azure to 60 miles per hour in 5.2 seconds .
Itâs an effortless endeavor , and a very warped take on physics .
But when youâre piloting a convertible worth the value of , say , a few dozen cars rushing past in the opposing highway lane , itâs entirely reasonable .
The dayâs winner was the Mercedes SL63 AMG .
It doesnât have the jaw - dropping presence of the Aston or Bentley , but offers the best combination of supermodel looks , supercar sound and speed , and a somewhat attainable price .
Even if most people canât tell the difference between SL trim levels , the AMGâs lucky driver wonât ever forget .

Much has been made of the situation the Astana team faces in this year 's Tour de France .
Allocating roles to four star riders – Alberto Contador , Lance Armstrong , Andreas Klöden and Levi Leipheimer – is n't an easy task for Johan Bruyneel .
Psychologist Matti Clement told Cyclingnews about the forces at play within the ' team to beat ' and how to handle this potential for disharmony .
Based in Adelaide , Australia , Matti Clement is a psychologist who specialises in performance enhancement within sports .
She works with the Australian Institute of Sport 's elite cycling and beach volleyball programmes , in addition to many high - profile sporting teams in the South Australian capital .
This includes players from the Adelaide United Football Club , Adelaide 36ers basketball squad , Adelaide Crows and Port Power AFL clubs and the state cricket team .
She operates the Mental Edge Consulting clinic and her experience in this role allows for a unique insight into the psyche of the sport 's elite .
A yellow jersey from the Tour de France , signed by Stuart O'Grady , is just one of the pieces of cycling memorabilia hanging on her office wall in addition to items from those in other sports who have benefited from her services .
She explains that her work includes helping athletes with performance anxiety , motivation after injury and sport - life balance .
She also works with the dynamics of various teams ; setting team goals and then setting individual goals that reflect those team goals .
This is particularly pertinent in relation to the Astana squad .
Knowing the roles
There was discussion leading up to the Tour de France about the possibility that the forces at play within Astana 's squad could result in a similar situation to that in which the former T - Mobile team found itself during the 2005 Tour .
It had three star riders – Jan Ullrich , Alexander Vinokourov and Andreas Klöden – but missed out on a yellow jersey when the race reached Paris , a large part of which was blamed on personal ambitions within the group .
Clement said this is possibly the most important aspect of managing the dynamics within a team .
" Every individual knows what their role is .
There are always going to be roles which are more appealing to the general public , but the understanding that everyone within the team plays a role for that one rider to cross the line as number one .
That rider did n't get there by himself ; he got there with a team approach . "
But what about the situation when two riders believe they could share the same role when that 's not really feasible ?
" It happens in all sports – if it 's between you and another person , why would you invest all your time focusing on that other person ?
If you invested that energy into what you needed to do , logically you 're putting yourself in a better position . "
This is exactly the approach Alberto Contador has adopted based on his comments to the media during this year 's Tour de France .
His statements from day one in Monaco have continually focused purely on what he is doing and what he has to do .
He has n't spoken about team leadership , the events of previous days or those too far beyond the next day 's racing .
Contador is just below Lance Armstrong on general classification ahead of the race 's first mountain stage .
Clement agrees that it's a smart tactic from the Spaniard .
" Focus on controllables versus uncontrollables – I think sometimes people can get confused about what is controllable and what is n't .
Your opponents are uncontrollable .
Selection for a particular role is uncontrollable , outcome is uncontrollable , the past is uncontrollable as is the future , " she said .
" If you spend time on the present , plus the processes , thought patterns , emotions and preparations ... all the things you can achieve the ' one percenters ' in , that 's energy well - invested . "
Although it may appear from the outside that Armstrong is trying to seize Contador 's power and control his momentum in the race , the opposite may be occurring .
Contador may be gaining a lot from the Armstrong 's presence which will aid in achieving the team 's goals .
" An experienced athlete who has been to multiple Olympics or the like has that knowledge .
There 's the physical experience of having been there and knowing what works and maybe knowing what does n't work .
" I spend a lot of time around athletes developing self - awareness – if you do n't have good self - awareness it 's really difficult to implement any psychological strategies because you 'll never know when to use them .
Experienced athletes develop that skill through making mistakes , having success . "
Clement added that young athletes who have exposure to experienced athletes with good self - awareness can develop those skills .
This is the crucial aspect of the Armstrong - Contador relationship within Astana and possibly the rationale Johan Bruyneel has employed .
Contador may be the ultimate beneficiary of the exchange – he's forced to implement psychological strategies to overcome the apparent threat to his position .
He is also learning from the seven - time Tour champion 's decade of experience .
There is also German Andreas Klöden and USA 's Levi Leipheimer , who have both been on the Tour podium in the past and are now riding as team helpers .
Is the transition from team leader to helper that difficult ?
" A good team leader or programme leader clearly delineates to the athlete : ' that was your role then , this is your role now and we value it just as much . '
The athlete has to be invested in it , " she said .
" If they 're not invested in it and just told it 's their role then they would n't buy into it .
It 's about having clear roles . "
Ego
All four of Astana 's riders have been successful and consequently they have the personality traits to match .
Some would say this is " ego " , although Clement warns of using that word .
" ' Ego ' is a very misused word .
Some people say ego is a good thing while other people say it 's a bad thing ...
It 's really important that people know where their heading and what they 're invested in .
" In a team environment that needs to be everyone heading towards the one team goal .
Everyone can have individual goals and they may differ , but it still needs to be within the bigger picture .
" In terms of ego , if one person 's goal does n't fit into the bigger scheme , then that 's obviously going to be a problem .
They 're not actually fitting into those team behaviours and values .
Those should always be established from the word go – not just in competition but as soon as the team 's formed . "
A sinister secret has been kept in the basement of an abandoned Los Angeles church for many years .
With the death of a priest belonging to a mysterious sect , another priest opens the door to the basement and discovers a vat containing a green liquid .
The priest contacts a group of physics graduate students to investigate it .
Unfortunately , they discover that the liquid contains the essence of Satan himself , and they also discover that he will release HIS father - an all - powerful Anti-God !
The liquid later comes to life itself , turning some of the students into zombies as the Devil comes forward to release his father .
Will these students be able to stop him ?

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is accused of masterminding the attacks on the World Trade Center and other US targets
Scenes of chaos have gripped a US military court in Guantanamo Bay where five alleged 9/11 plotters were due to appear together before a judge .
All five , including alleged mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , initially refused to attend the hearing .
The judge rejected prosecution calls for them to be compelled to attend but three did appear after a recess .
The hearing focuses on whether two of the accused are mentally competent to represent themselves .
The 11 September 2001 attacks , in which hijacked airliners were flown into buildings in New York and Washington , killed nearly 3,000 people .
Microphone cut off Walid Bin Attash , Ali Abd al - Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmad al - Hawsawi appeared in the courtroom after the recess .
Relatives of 9/11 victims were watching the hearing But Mr Hawsawi asked to leave again after he was refused the opportunity to speak .
He was escorted out by US military guards .
Mr Bin Attash asked the judge whether he could question a witness .
When told he could not , he asked : " Even if he told lies ? "
When the judge again insisted he could not question the witness , Mr Bin Attash replied : " This is good justice ! "
Thursday 's hearing was meant to focus on whether Mr Hawsawi and a fourth defendant , Ramzi Binalshibh , were mentally competent to represent themselves .
The US military lawyer representing Mr Binalshibh said he suffered from a delusional disorder .
When the lawyer went into detail about how he had been deprived of sleep , her microphone was cut off .
Trial questions
The fifth defendant , Mr Sheikh Mohammed , refused to attend the hearing .
Described by US intelligence as " one of history 's most infamous terrorists " , he earlier admitted being responsible " from A to Z " for 9/11 .
Believed to be the number three al - Qaeda leader before his capture in Pakistan in March 2003 , he told a pre-trial hearing at Guantanamo in December 2008 that he wanted to plead guilty to all charges against him .
The Obama administration has yet to announce how the five defendants will be tried or where they will be held if the camp at Guantanamo Bay is closed by January 2010 , as promised .
US President Barack Obama has ordered a halt to military commissions at Guantanamo Bay but preparations continue for military trials and prosecutors say they are ready to begin proceedings against 66 detainees .
Mr Obama has conceded that some will be tried in military courts once Congress passes legislation which puts in place a number of legal safeguards .

The UN Security Council is currently discussing a response to N Korea Russian officials have said North Korea is close to test - launching another ballistic missile , Russian media say .
Itar - Tass news agency quoted a military official saying he had information on the type of rocket but no launch date .
In recent weeks , North Korea has fired a long - range and several short - range missiles , and tested a nuclear device .
The Russian warning comes as diplomats at the UN said the Security Council was close to agreement on new sanctions against North Korea over the tests .
Fears of a new missile launch by North Korea have been stoked by warnings earlier this week to shipping to stay away from the waters off its east coast for the next three weeks .
Launch imminent ?
Itar - Tass quoted a source in the Russian foreign ministry as saying : " Judging by everything , a launch will take place .
There are signs that preparations for this are underway . "
US and South Korean officials have also said there are signs that the North may be preparing to test - fire a long - range missile .
The US has said it has ruled out military action against the North in favour of international diplomatic efforts .
US President Barack Obama 's special envoy for North Korea , Stephen Bosworth , told the Korea Society in New York that the US was not seeking to topple the North Korean government .
North Korea has stepped up its rhetoric against the US " North Korea 's recent actions to develop a nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile capacity require that we expand our consideration of new responses , " Mr Bosworth said .
" However , the North Korean claim to be responding to a ' threat ' or a ' hostile policy ' by the United States is simply groundless .
" Quite to the contrary , we have no intention to invade North Korea or change its regime through force , and this has been made clear to the DPRK repeatedly , " he added , using the acronym for the Democratic People 's Republic of North Korea .
Mr Bosworth supported the resumption of the six - party talks with the North aimed at ending its nuclear programme .
The parties include Russia , China , Japan , the US and both Koreas .
North Korea said on Tuesday that it would use nuclear weapons in a " merciless offensive " if provoked .
South Korea has informed the US of up to 20 North Korean bank accounts , in China and Switzerland , suspected of being involved in counterfeiting , money laundering and other illegal transactions , South Korea 's Chosun Ilbo newspaper said .
The US is expected to pursue financial sanctions against the North alongside international sanctions .
The US wants tougher inspections of ships carrying cargo to and from North Korea and wants to deny North Korea access to international banking services .
" We 're making progress but we are not done yet , " said Susan Rice , the US ambassador to the UN , on Tuesday .
" I 'm hopeful that this will be concluded soon . "

Bureau Report
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) -
An editor seen as close to Iran ’s leadership said on Saturday that opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi should go on trial , and a lawyer said other reformists had already been accused of acting against national security .
Two women walk past a reflection of a mural with pictures of Iran 's late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and a member of the Basij militia with a quote from Iran 's Supreme Leader that reads , " The breeding of Godly Basij youth is the victory of Imam ( Ayatollah Khomeini ) " , near a university during Tehran 's Friday prayers , July 3 , 2009 .
A newspaper editor seen as close to Iran 's top authority said Saturday defeated election candidate Mirhossein Mousavi and a former pro-reform president had committed " terrible crimes " which should be tried in court .
REUTERS / Morteza Nikoubazl
Mousavi and his supporters in last month ’s disputed presidential election had acted on the instructions of the United States in protesting against the results , said Hossein Shariatmadari , editor - in - chief of the hardline Kayhan daily .
“ An open court , in front of the people ’s eyes , must deal with all the terrible crimes and clear betrayal committed by the main elements behind the recent unrest , including Mousavi and ( former President Mohammad ) Khatami , ” he wrote in a commentary .
Another hardline newspaper , Javan , said 100 members of parliament had signed a letter to the judiciary calling for the leaders of “ post- election riots ” to face trial , pointing to Mousavi and fellow defeated moderate Mehdi Karoubi .
The authorities have portrayed mass pro-Mousavi protests , which erupted after official results of the June 12 vote showed hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had been re-elected by a landslide , as the work of local subversives and foreign powers .
Reformers have dismissed such accusations .
At least 20 people died in post-election violence .
“ All they did and said was in line with the instructions announced by American officials in the past , ” Shariatmadari , who is close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , wrote .
Ahmadinejad , in a speech in Tehran to mark Mines and Industry Day , said Western powers were whipping up controversy over the Iranian election to divert attention from their economic problems .
“ The countries suffering from the financial crisis have tried hard to divert the world public opinion from this huge crisis , ” he said .
In a separate meeting , he said the election result was “ a strong slap in their faces ” for “ domineering ” foreign powers who had tried to create conflict in Iran .
Security forces quelled the election protests , but Mousavi and allies who say the election was rigged have refused to back down .
Administration hardliners seem determined to stop them .
Former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who backed Mousavi , said post-election events had caused “ bitterness . ”
“ I do n’t think ( anybody with a ) vigilant conscience is satisfied with the current situation , ” Mehr News Agency quoted him as saying at a meeting with detainees ’ families , in apparent criticism of the authorities ’ handling of the protests .
“ I hope with good management and wisdom the issues would be settled in the next days , ” added the influential 75 - year - old , seen as a possible mediator .
PROMINENT FIGURES
Lawyer Saleh Nikbakht said he was representing prominent detainees including former vice president Mohammad Ali Abtahi , former deputy foreign minister Mohsen Aminzadeh and former government spokesman Abdollah Ramezanzadeh .
They held their positions under Khatami , who was in office in 1997 - 2005 and backed moderate candidates in the June vote .
“ I am the lawyer of about 12 journalists and political activists who were detained recently ... their general charge is acting against national security , ” Nikbakht told Reuters .
Other leading reformers he said he represented included Mostafa Tajzadeh , a former deputy interior minister , and Behzad Nabavi , also a former government minister .
“ If the charges are proven then the cases will be referred to revolutionary courts after the preliminary investigation , ” Nikbakht said , referring to a court handling security issues .
Karoubi ’s Etemad-e Melli website said he had visited families of some of the detainees , including Abtahi , who was part of his campaign and was arrested on June 16 .
“ The recent detainees were not opponents of the system .
They are members of the establishment who had some complaints against the result of the election , ” Karoubi said .
“ It is not correct to restrict the protesters instead of removing the doubts over the election irregularities .
Such actions will cause people ’s beliefs and trust to be destroyed and this is very dangerous , ” he said during his visits .
A senior pro-reform cleric urged the authorities not to violate people ’s rights and said many Iranians remained unconvinced about Ahmadinejad ’s re-election because of voting “ ambiguities .
“ I remind you that no instruction or command can be a permission or excuse to violate people ’s rights and this could be a great sin , ” Grand Ayatollah Yusof Saanei said on Friday .
People accused of acting against national security -- a common charge against dissenting voices in Iran -- could face jail , a ban on political activities and holding government positions , or even the death penalty .
The authorities say the vote was Iran ’s “ healthiest ” since the revolution .
Government spokesman Gholamhossein Elham said the next government enjoyed “ huge support . ”
“ A small group are moving in a wrong path which is not the path of the revolution .
The real winner of the election is 40 million voters , ” he said , adding that if activists or journalists committed crimes they should be punished .
Karoubi , who like Mousavi has called for the election to be annulled , vowed not to back down .
“ I do n’t know what will happen in the end .
But I have prepared myself for everything .
I will stand till the end to defend people ’s rights , ” he said .

One day I decided I wanted to try installing RabbitMQ on my iMac .
The most straightforward way seemed to be to use MacPorts .
I had not actually tried MacPorts before this week , so it was interesting to see how it worked out .
MacPorts an the equivalent of the APT system in Debian GNU / Linux ( there is at least one other , Fink ) .
It has a list of packages , and when you give it commands like
port install python26
it downloads the package and installs it .
Like APT it does dependency - checking : if the python26 package needs the gettext package installed to work , then it downloads that and installs it first , and so on recursively .
It is different from my experiences with Debian in two ways .
First , it downloads source packages and builds them itself — which is slightly surprising given how Mac hardware is relatively constrained compared with the plethora of platforms supported by binary packages on Debian .
Second , whereas Debian packages have been sliced and diced quite enthusiastically , after several attempts to subdivide packages without causing needless confusion , MacPorts seems to have settled on instead making packages install the same complete set of components you would get building it by hand .
Thus Python includes IDLE , and IDLE requires Tk , and Tk requires the X11 client libraries , which means that installing Python 2.6 on my PowerBook 12 " took an afternoon as it downloaded and compiled a sizeable fraction of the X window system !
So far this has been amusing rather than actually any sort of problem .
It ’s like being some mighty potentate , who expresses a vague desire for a strawberry only to have his faithful servant travel to distant lands at fabulous expense and return weeks later with a strawberry packed in ice acquired on a side journey to the frozen north .
You feel a little embarrassed but it is easier to let him get on with it than countermand the order .
The one thing that MacPorts depends on but does not install is Xcode , Apple ’s own development environment , which includes GCC and the like .
So it was that when I intoned the incantation
port install erlang
it chugged away for a longish time before suddenly complaining
On Mac OS X 10.5 , tiff 3.8.2 requires Xcode 3.1 or later but you have Xcode 3.0 .
It seems that some sequence of dependencies from the Erlang programming language leads tortuously to TIFF .
After downloading a fresher Xcode install ( a 900 MB download , mind you ) I finally have Erlang ready to compile the RabbitMQ server — I hope .
Hi to all , I decided to try once more at this blog thing .
I want to share my thoughts with the people out there but it seems that I am able to do so in bursts , and random ones unfortunately .
I decided to try once more , this time using WordPress .
I just finished my second draft of a literature review about Domain - Specific Embedded Languages ( DSELs or EDSL in short , depending where you come from ) .
For those of you who are unfamiliar with the notion , these are basically languages related to one particular domain ( often referred to as Domain - Specific Languages or DSLs ) which are embedded within another language .
More often the host language is a fully - fledged language which acts as a compiler or interpreter for the embedded language .
The embedded language itself usually consists of a data structure of the host language which adequately abstracts to the domain at hand and represents it completely .
By means of appropriate functions the data structure is given a number of semantics related to the domain .
A common example of a DSEL is one for creating circuits but the number of possible applications of the approach is dependent on the number of domains existent ( so more or less infinite ) .
There are DSELs for geometric region analysis , geometric constructions , images , animations , music composition , financial contracts , query languages , hardware description languages , testing , robotics , firewalls , business processes and so on .
( Let me know if you want a number of papers about these and I will provide references . )
Let us make use of a circuit - creating domain - specific language embedded in the functional language , Haskell .
Haskell has been used often for embedding due to many advantages it has which facilitate the embedding approach .
( A post for another time maybe ? )
We start off with the syntax of our DSEL which we create by making use of a Haskell data type that we are going to call Wire .
We shall make use of a high - valued wires , low - valued wires and two basic gates : a NOT gate and an AND gate , described in Haskell as follows :
data Wire = High | Low | Not Wire | And Wire Wire
Using this syntax we can describe circuits such as an OR gate as follows ( using DeMorgan ’s Theorem ) :
orGate wire0 wire1 = answer where not0 =
Not wire0 not1 =
Not wire1 and0 =
And not0 not1 answer = Not and0
This is pure Haskell code but which is now domain - focused on describing circuits .
But what can we do with this code ?
As it is , on its own , well … nothing , apart from maybe describing how a circuit is composed .
How can we render this code more useful ?
The answer is by means of functions which traverse the programs created using the above data type .
In this way we attach semantics to the syntax .
An example of this is a simulation function which when supplied with a circuit along with its input wires , gives us the result of the circuit :
simulate :: Wire ->
Wire simulate Low = Low simulate High =
High simulate ( Not w ) = case ( simulate w ) of Low -> High High ->
Low simulate ( And w1 w2 ) = case ( simulate w1 , simulate w2 ) of ( Low , _ ) ->
Low ( _ , Low ) ->
Low ( High , High ) ->
High
Calling simulate on orGate supplied with a Low and High input returns a High - valued wire :
> simulate ( orGate Low High ) High
( Note : you need to derive the type - class Show or provide an instance of said type - class to view this in GHCI or Hugs )
Another possible semantics is counting the gates in the circuit or translating it into VHDL or Verilog .
The possibilities are endless – one program may be interpretted in a million ways as long as the right function is supplied written in the host language .
I hope this blog post serves as a simplified starter to those who would like to know what a domain - specific embedded language is and how to create one quickly in Haskell .
I also hope that in the next few days I can introduce other related stuff .
Please feel free to comment on any mistakes , on what you think , or if you need any references to material on this .

GOP is the party of usury --
Why do they hate Jesus ?
Sanders said the card companies and banks were engaged in conduct that could get others hauled into court .
He said one - third of all credit card holders are paying interest above 20 percent and as high as 41 percent .
“ When banks are charging 30 percent interest rates , they are not making credit available , ” said Mr. Sanders , who noted credit unions are limited to 15 percent .
“ They are engaged in loan - sharking . ”
After the effort failed , Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut , the Democratic chairman of the banking committee , proposed that the Federal Reserve be asked to provide an analysis of how Congress could rein in interest rates .
Senators said they hoped to finish up the credit card bill as early as Thursday , coinciding with a town hall meeting by President Obama on credit card issues in New Mexico .
Last night the Senate continued debating H.R. 627 , Carolyn Maloney 's Truth In Lending Act , which already overwhelmingly passed the House and is being stalled in the Senate by a gaggle of corrupt senators who have been bought - off by the heavy spending banksters .
First up today was an idiotic amendment the banking industry wrote for David Diapers Vitter ( R - LA ) to present which only managed to draw 28 votes , all of them from corrupt banking industry shills like Mitch McConnell ( R- KY - $ 5,013,778 ) , Dick Shelby ( R - AL - $ 4,384,492 ) , John Cornyn ( R- TX - $ 4,314,592 ) , John McCain ( R - AZ - $ 32,423,813 ) , Richard Burr ( R-NC - $ 2,447,672 ) , Jon Kyl ( R - AZ - $ 3,708,608 ) , Chuck Grassley ( R- IA - $ 2,223,630 ) , Jim DeMint ( R- SC - $ 2,073,034 ) , and Johnny Isakson ( R - GA - $ 3,341,524 ) .
That was followed by an amendment offered by Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) -- with the backing of co-sponsors Tom Harkin ( D - IA ) , Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) , Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) , Carl Levin ( D - MI ) and Jesus Christ -- opposing usury .
The banksters have way too much power in the Senate , as Durbin pointed out last week when he actually said they " own this place , " and the amendment failed 60 - 33 , every single Republican ( except Grassley ) voting for usury and against God .
They were joined by loathsome Jesus - hating / bankster loving Democrats like Max Baucus ( D - MT - $ 4,633,243 ) , Evan Bayh ( D - IN - $ 3,987,896 ) , Arlen Specter ( D - PA - $ 5,753,310 ) , Tom Carper ( D - DE - $ 2,160,628 ) , Kay Hagan ( D - NC - $ 537,145 ) , Mark Warner ( D - VA - $ 2,431,066 ) , Mary Landrieu ( D - LA - $ 2,399,134 ) , Blanche Lincoln ( D - AR - $ 1,671,292 ) , Ben Nelson ( D - NE - $ 2,667,406 ) , and Mark Pryor ( D - AR - $ 1,321,948 ) , who only got as far as the talking snake part of the Bible .
Needless to say , the corrupt Democrats were joined by the corrupt independent , Joe Lieberman ( CT - $ 9,981,924 ) who is completely owned by the banksters .
Carl
Hulse put it another way in the , pointing out that consumers are increasingly pissed off how the credit card companies are gouging customers with impunity .
Sanders bill sought to cap rates at 15 % and even that modest reform failed .
With banksters getting billions and billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts and using significant portions of that to bribe and lobby members of Congress to allow them to continue their policies of usury these were the 33 members of the Senate willing to vote against them .
If your senator is n't on this list , you should demand to know why .

The Recession is Over ... Say What ?
“ The Recession Is Over , ” reads the headline of The Globe and Mail today .
The staff leaves the paper in front of our rooms here at that Fairmont Vancouver .
When we cracked the door open to retrieve the rag , the headline caught our eye … and we thought of just tossing it back in the hallway .
If there is any one single theme of this year ’s Investment Symposium , it ’s that despite the warm feelings and “ green shoots ” of summer , this contraction is far from over .
“ I think this is really serious , and it ’s just beginning , ” Doug Casey said during his presentation yesterday .
“ Forget about the green shoots .
They are weeds .
This is the biggest thing since the Industrial Revolution .
Stocks will be a good value when dividend yields are around 10 % .
“ Real estate ?
Way too early .
Bonds ?
The bond market is much bigger than the stock market .
Interest rates are being artificially depressed .
They have to go back up to higher levels to encourage people to save and get out of debt .
When interest rates assert themselves , the bond market will collapse , which is n’t good for the stock market , or real estate , either . ”
So what ’s Doug doing ?
Going long precious metals , shorting U.S. Treasuries and buying real estate in Thailand and Argentina .
“ We are looking for eight signs before we get bullish again , ” added Eric Roseman in his presentation :
1 ) Unemployment must stabilize
2 ) Home prices must stabilize
3 ) Domestic consumption must rise
4 ) Bank lending must grow
5 ) Toxic assets and bank balance sheets must be fixed
6 ) Auto sales must stabilize
7 ) Credit spreads must narrow
8 ) The dollar has to decline
“ Only the last two have occurred .
That gives us a very bearish outlook going forward . ”
By the way , what did the G&M mean in their “ recession is over ” headline ?
Heh , the Canadian central bank predicted that the economy would grow 1 % in the current quarter .
Forgive us , but our faith in central bank forecasts ran out a long time ago .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government plans to increase funding to battle obesity and views healthcare reform as an opportunity to encourage better eating habits , Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on Tuesday .

The Obama administration , as part of its economic stimulus package , will give states and local governments more money to control obesity , including investing in public transportation , Sebelius told an obesity conference in Washington .
She added that legislation in Congress to overhaul the $ 2.5 trillion healthcare industry could boost programs to get more fruits and vegetables into school lunches and encourage grocery stores to sell more fresh produce in poor communities .
“ We finally have a plan , ” Sebelius told the conference , which was sponsored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Washington .
She said most of $ 1 billion appropriated by Congress for disease prevention as part of the stimulus plan would go to a CDC - planned initiative to fight obesity , heart disease and other chronic conditions .
“ A significant amount of the money will go to help states and communities attack obesity and other public health challenges , ” Sebelius said .
A report released at the conference on Monday found that obesity costs the U.S. health system $ 147 billion a year .
“ The American Cancer Society estimates that all cancers combined cost our healthcare system $ 93 billion a year .
So , ending obesity would save our healthcare system 50 percent more dollars than curing cancer , ” Sebelius said .
She praised a 2006 initiative headed by former President Bill Clinton and the American Heart Association that persuaded soft - drink makers to limit some of the sugary drinks sold in school vending machines .
CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden , who has in the past supported a soft drink tax , told the meeting it may be difficult to get political support for such a move .
SERVE HEALTHFUL FOOD
Sebelius said the federal government could do more to encourage healthy habits , including serving better meals in schools , senior centers and government buildings and encouraging grocery stores to open in neglected , poor and rural neighborhoods .
She also called for more physical education classes for children and investments to encourage walking , biking and use of public transportation .
Without giving details , she said the government would fund new programs and praised one that buses girls to dance lessons in California .
A report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation released at the conference found that many school districts were inconsistent in promoting healthier eating .
Strong nutritional requirements often went hand - in - hand with weak restrictions for food sold a la carte or in vending machines .
Only 18 percent of elementary students were enrolled in a districts with strong policies requiring daily recess .
When the AT&T 4 chan episode hit the internet I had posted on HN that I would tell my contact there what is going on .
My contact sent me this today .
It is the email going around at AT&T HQ explaining what the 4 chan episode was all about .
I thought it was interesting to see the nature of articles that large corporations choose to send around .
--- begin--- AT&T : 4 Chan Blocked Over DDoS , Not Content Jordan Golson | Monday , July 27 , 2009 | 10:22 AM
PT | 3 comments AT&T has finally issued a statement about the company ’s unannounced blocking of certain parts of forum site 4 Chan .
A number of parties blamed AT&T for “ censoring ” the Internet , presuming that the company had blocked access because of the content on 4 Chan , which can range from classless to tasteless to everything in between .
In fact , AT&T said it blocked one section of the site to control a distributed - denial - of - service attack that was affecting an unnamed AT&T customer .
4 Chan is , for lack of a better term , the “ Wild West ” of the Internet .
It is an unedited , unmoderated message board that is surprisingly influential on the Net. 4 Chan users have been credited with starting lolcats and RickRolling .
Last year , a 4 Chan user allegedly hacked into Sarah Palin ’s Yahoo Mail account and posted the password on 4 Chan .
The site , especially its /b/ page , is an interesting place — very , very “ not safe for work . ”
According to a statement from the phone giant : Beginning Friday , an AT&T customer was impacted by a denial - of - service attack stemming from IP addresses connected to img.4chan.org .
To prevent this attack from disrupting service for the impacted AT&T customer , and to prevent the attack from spreading to impact our other customers , AT&T temporarily blocked access to the IP addresses in question for our customers .
This action was in no way related to the content at img.4chan.org ; our focus was on protecting our customers from malicious traffic .
Overnight Sunday , after we determined the denial - of - service threat no longer existed , AT&T removed the block on the IP addresses in question .
We will continue to monitor for denial - of - service activity and any malicious traffic to protect our customers .
The story got legs on Reddit , where many commentators scorched AT&T , saying the company “ censors the Internet , ” and 4 Chan fans formed bulletin boards to organize “ retaliation ” against AT&T .
TechCrunch wrote that blocking a web site without notification is an “ extreme breach of user trust . ”
Of course , the blocking evidently was n’t over 4 Chan ’s content , which AT&T assures me it would never do , but instead over network protocols that were affecting other customers .
Net neutrality is all well and good , but when one particular server is negatively impacting other users , AT&T is obligated to respond .
Not everyone jumped on the blame AT&T bandwagon , however .
Late last night , Shon Elliott from unWired Broadband wrote on the North American Network Operators Group mailing list :
There have been a lot of customers on our network who were complaining about ACK scan reports coming from 207.126.64.181 .
We had no choice but to block that single IP until the attacks let up .
It was a decision I made with the gentleman that owns the colo facility currently hosts 4 chan [ sic ] .
There was no other way around it .
I ’m sure AT&T is probably blocking it for the same reason .
4 chan has been under attack for over 3 weeks , the attacks filling up an entire GigE .
If you want to blame anyone , blame the script kiddies who pull this kind of stunt .
" The above newsclip is distributed to educate and inform .
This does not imply accuracy nor endorsement of the views by AT&T . "
---end---
My response : AT&T did a good thing ( stopping a DDoS attack ) , but they need to be more on top of their “ twitter relations , ” people claimed to have called in to AT&T and received the response that the site was blocked due to content .
Now that is may normally the case , so the support person on the phone was probably just hazarding a guess , but once the story caught on fire AT&T ’s twitter account should have tweeted that taking down 4 chan had nothing to do with content .
Or at LEAST that they could say they were investigating .
I know it was the weekend , but the story went pretty far , and AT&T is already getting blamed for Google Voice being blocked on the iPhone , so they do n't need anymore bad press .
If a corporation is taking down a website over the weekend they need to be ready to explain to the public why , otherwise they are just asking for disaster .

By Ilaina JonasNEW YORK , July 7 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. office market vacancy rate reached 15.9 percent in the second quarter , its highest in four years and rent fell by the largest amount in more than seven as demand from companies and other office renters remained weak , real estate research firm Reis said Inc .
"
It 's bad , " Reis director of research Victor Calanog said .
" It 's decaying and getting worse .
Given the depth and magnitude of the recession , you can argue that we are facing a storm of epic proportions and we 're only at the beginning .
The weak demand helped push up the average weighted U.S. office vacancy rate 0.70 percentage points during the quarter and 2.7 percentage points compared with a year ago , according to the report released on Tuesday .
Asking rent during the quarter fell 1.4 percent to $ 28.43 per square foot .
Factoring in rent - free months and improvement costs to landlords , effective rent -- the net amount of cash landlords take in -- fell 2.7 percent in the quarter to $ 23.42 per square foot .
The second - quarter drop was more severe than the first quarter 's 2.3 percent , dampening hopes the office market is bottoming out , Reis said .
Year over year , rent was down 6.7 percent , the largest one - quarter decline since the first quarter 2002 .
" This is really only the third quarter that we 've experienced negative effective rent growth , " Calanog said .
" Last time , the office sector had four years of negative effective rent growth .
" Although the sector has experienced downturns before , the current one may be lethal for lenders and investors who bought property during the boom years of 2005 from 2007 .
Many of them based the price and the loan on the belief that rents would continue to post strong growth and occupancy increases .
" It 's like taking on a lot of debt as an individual and now suddenly earning 10 percent 20 percent 30 percent less , " he said .
The dwindling cash flow resulting from higher vacancy and lower rent weakens the ability to repay financing and pushes a borrower closer to defaulting on a loan .
The weak second - quarter performance prompted Reis to maintain its February forecast calling for the U.S. office vacancy rate to top out at 18.2 percent in 2010 and for rent to continue to fall through 2011 .
It also sees the commercial real estate default rate to reach 4.2 percent by the end of the year and peak at 5.2 percent in 2011 .
The U.S. vacancy rate was at 12.5 percent in the third quarter of 2007 , but has since risen 3.4 percentage points , Reis said .
Of the 79 markets that Reis tracks , vacancy rose in 65 and effective rent fell in 72 , indicating the weakness is widespread .
Vacancy in the New York area , which includes all the New York City boroughs except Staten Island , rose 1.2 percentage points to 10.8 percent , the highest since 1996 , and effective rent slid 5.2 percent " As far as we can tell for New York , the next two years will be murder , " Calanog said .
Boston and Orange County and San Jose California saw rent fall more than 5 percent .
Those results do not bode well for office landlords Brookfield Properties Corp ( BPO.TO : Quote , Profile , Research , Stock Buzz ) , Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO.N : Quote , Profile , Research , Stock Buzz ) , Boston Properties Inc ( BXP.N : Quote , Profile , Research , Stock Buzz ) , SL Green Realty Corp ( SLG.N : Quote , Profile , Research , Stock Buzz ) and Maguire Properties Inc ( MPG.N : Quote , Profile , Research , Stock Buzz ) .
About 20 million square feet of office space came on the market than was rented during the quarter , slightly less than the 25.2 million square feet in the prior quarter .
Year - to - date , a net of 45.2 million more square feet of space put onto the market than was rented , on track with Reis ' earlier project of about 67.6 million square feet 2009 .
If the forecast holds true , 2009 will be the worst year for net absorption of office space since Reis began tracking it in 1980 .

Actors and crew working on the new Harry Potter films are picking the set apart to find suitable souvenirs to take home once the movie franchise wraps up .
Stars including Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson and Rupert Grint , are close to finishing work on the last two films in the series - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - which will be split into two movies .
And as 10 years of work on the wizard films draws to a close , the actors have reportedly joined production staff in scouring the set for keepsakes .
Production designer Stuart Craig , who has been working on the film series at the Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire , England , says , " The Great Hall ( featured in the movies ) is a bit like the Berlin Wall - you can see people standing in line waiting to get bits of it . "

" Thank you soooooooooooooooo much for these Gluten - Free Restaurant Cards --- they have been such a stree - reducer when eating out ... I still have some anxiety before actually eating the " gluten - free " prepared food .
These cards are the such a big help !
I really appreciate you sharing these with other Celiac Disease sufferers . "
- Linda Gibson , Work week manager , Pennsylvania .
" Just a quick note to say thank you very much for the language cards .
I was diagnosed in 1998 and having worked in human rights since then , have travelled widely , mostly without a problem although I 've certainly had the occasional unpleasant poisoning ( Egypt being particularly memorable working for days with stomach cramp ) .
However some cuisines are definitely harder than others when trying to avoid gluten and an experience in Turkey three weeks ago led me to your site and cards which I printed off and used to great effect for the reminder of my trip .
In the two weeks since I 've been to Czech Rep and Poland on business and printed cards for those trips too .
Fantastic !
I had absolutely no problems and could actually feel confident about what i was eating .
Sometimes it's not just the language barrier but seeing something written in their own language means it 's taken so much more seriously .
I 'm wondering why i never used these cards before .
So a massive thank you for making them so clear and easily available ! "

December 13 2000 – George Bush Elected as President
Who knew that a Yale and Harvard grad would turn out to be known as the dumbest president ever ?
The eldest son of the 41st president of the United States , George W. Bush was elected as the 43rdpresident in 2000 .
Early in his career , Bush was faced with the devastating 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Shortly after , he announced the ‘ War on Terror , ’ as well as the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq .
Bush is also credited with poor handling of hurricane Katrina , as well as the near doubling of the US National debt .
Sept 11 2001 â € “ The 9/11 Terrorist Attacks
Almost 3,000 were killed in the September 11 , 2001 attacks after hijacked airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center ’s Twin Towers , the Pentagon , and a grassland in Shanksville .
Â
After nineteen Al - Qaeda terrorists took over the aircraft by stabbing pilots and flight attendants , fearful passengers made their last attempts to phone loved ones .
The world watched , stupefied , as the mayhem and destruction unfolded on the news .
In the background of the on - site news coverage , viewers could see and hear bodies hitting the ground after jumping out of the upper levels of the burning towers .
War on Terror – USA invades Afghanistan and Iraq
The War in Afghanistan , which began on October 7 , 2001 as the U.S. military Operation Enduring Freedom , was launched in response to the September 11th attacks .
The stated purpose of the invasion was to capture Osama bin Laden , destroy al - Qaeda , and remove the Taliban regime that had supported al - Qaeda .
Â
On March 20 , 2003 troops from the US , UK , Australia and Poland invaded Iraq .
The stated reasons for the invasion were “ to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction , to end Saddam Hussein ’s support for terrorism , and to free the Iraqi people ” .
However , the invasion has also resulted in the devastation of Iraq and Afghanistan , and the deaths of countless civilians .
SARS
SARS , or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome is a respiratory disease affecting humans .
The only near pandemic of the disease to date occurred between the months of November 2002 and July 2003 , with 8,096 known infected cases and 774 deaths worldwide .
The epidemic appears to have started in Guangdong Province , China , and quickly traveled around the globe .
Hospitals were thrown into a state of panic , isolating anybody who showed flu - like symptoms .
Fortunately , SARS has been completely contained by the WHO as of 2006 .
Guantanamo Bay
The GuantÃ¡namo Bay Detention Camp is a prison operated by the United States government since 1987 in Cuba .
The detainees have been classified as “ enemy combatants ” .
Amnesty International calls the situation at Guantanamo “ a human rights scandal ” .
Â
Prisoners released from the camp have alleged abuse of religion including flushing the Qur’an down the toilet and denying detainees a copy of the Qur’an .
Red Cross inspectors have alleged acts of torture including sleep deprivation , waterboarding , beatings and locking in confined and cold cells .
April 2 2005 – Death of Pope John Paul II
On April 2 , 2005 , Pope John Paul II died at age 84 .
He was the only Polish Pope , and the first non-Italian Pope since the Dutch Pope Adrian VI in the 1520s .
He sent the first papal email from the laptop in his office ( November 22 , 2001 ) and Â was fluent in Polish as well as Italian , French , German , English , Spanish , Portuguese , Croatian , Ancient Greek and Latin . Â
He is credited as being instrumental in ending communism in Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe .
2008 – Sarah Palin Becomes the Laughing Stock of America
The 2008 American elections and preceding campaigns helped to empower visible minorities .
Elected president Barack Obama became the first black president .
Democratic candidate Hilary Clinton took a big step for women in the White House .
And then there was Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin , whose greatest achievement was in providing endless material for satirical Saturday Night Live sketches .
Her foreign policy – â€ œI can see Russia from my house ! ”
Enough said .
November 4 2008 – Barack Obama Elected as President of the United States
Barack Obama was elected president of the USA in November 2008 , becoming the first African American president .
After defeating Hilary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries , Obama went on to lead a campaign based on Change , and ultimately defeated Republican candidate John McCain .
Besides being an exceptional orator and exemplary family man , Obama has begun to fix economic , political , and environmental problems that were worsened by past governments ( cough cough Bush cough ) .
He is also credited with having stopped more pirates than any other president .
Current Dilemma – Recession
In the past year , the economy has taken a turn for the worst , affecting product , investments , and employment in numerous countries .
Reckless lending practices in the United States have contributed significantly to the problem .
The U.S. unemployment rate grew to 8.5 percent in March 2009 .
As share and housing prices declined many large and well established banks in the US and Europe suffered huge losses and even faced bankruptcy , resulting in massive public financial assistance , including the bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler .
Ongoing – Palestine Israel conflict
The ongoing Israel - Palestine conflict is a violent dispute between the two groups of people .
A number of summits and attempts at peacemaking have occurred in the past , yet the violence continues with the Gaza war which began December 2008 .
The Israeli government has begun construction of the controversial West - Bank barrier to be completed in 2010 .
Supporters argue that the barrier is necessary for protecting Israelis from Palestinian terrorism , while opponents argue that the barrier is an illegal attempt to annex Palestinian land . Â
In 2005 , British Stencil artist Banksy traveled to the wall to put 9 pieces on it .
An old man approached him and said that his paintings made the wall beautiful .
Banksy thanked the man , but he responded : â€ œWe donâ€™t want it to be beautiful , we hate this wall .
Go home.â€ 
Worsening â€ “ Obesity
The WHO projects that by 2015 at least 700 million will be obese .
Between 1970 and 2005 , the percentage of overweight children has grown from 15 % to over 35 % .
With this increase comes the rise of related health problems , including diabetes , cardiovascular disease , and cancer .
Once considered a problem only in high - income countries , obesity is now dramatically on the rise in low - and middle - income countries , particularly in urban settings .
Â
Contributing factors include calorie - dense foods commonly found in fast foods , as well as decreased physical activity , increasingly sedentary work , changing modes of transportation , and increasing urbanization .
Worsening – Child Abuse
Just one more problem that has grown over the course of the 21st century is child abuse ( including physical , psychological , sexual , and neglect cases ) .
Despite efforts to combat social and economic factors linked to high child abuse rates , statistics show steady increases in child abuse cases , which can be linked to failure of governments to place a sufficient priority on insuring adequate health care for children and support for parents .
Therefore , developing countries ( notably Cameroon , Zambia , the Congo and South Africa ) report the highest number of child abuse cases .
Worsening – Animal Abuse
Sadly , animal abuse rates are on the rise along with child abuse rates .
In the United States , the number of reported animal abuse cases grew from 410 in the year 2000 , to a whopping 2334 cases in 2006 .
Italian activists are raising awareness of a common problem : summer vacationers purchase a pet for the duration of the holidays , and then abandon it before returning home .
In Bangkok , elephants brought in from the villages to beg for money are dying of disease , malnutrition , and motor vehicle accidents .
Improving – Blood Diamonds
Blood diamonds , or conflict diamonds , are mined in war zones ( usually by slaves ) and sold to finance an invading army or warlord , generally in Africa ( specifically Angola , Liberia , CÃ´te d’Ivoire , The Democratic Republic of the Congo , the Republic of Congo , and Zimbabwe ) .
In 2003 , the United Nations introduced the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme , designed to certify the origin of conflict - free diamonds so that consumers can be sure they arenâ€™t financing war and human rights abuses .
Right Now – Web 2.0
The term Web 2.0 refers to a new generation of web development characterized by information sharing and collaboration .
In other words , it is the shift in the use of the Internet from a mass media , read - only communication device to an empowering tool for the masses .
Key 2.0 names include MySpace , Facebook , Youtube and Wikipedia .
Web 2.0 has re-introduced the public sphere to society , allowing any Internet user to write information and upload media to the World Wide Web .
By writing 2.0 names in the slums and third - world landscapes , Â Filippo Minelli‘s ‘ Contradictions ’ project aims to point out the gap between lived reality and the â€œephemeral world of technologiesâ€ .
Ongoing – Global Warming
A number of catastrophes have been attributed to global warming including tsunamis , hurricanes .
Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activity are largely responsible .
Scientists predict that if the current trend continues sea levels will rise , precipitation patterns will shift significantly , glaciers will retreat , forests will shrink , agricultural yields will change , and a great many species will suffer .
Â
Most governments are taking steps to prevent further crises .
The Kyoto Protocol , currently adopted and ratified by 183 nations , is a treaty intended to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations .
Ongoing â€ “ Poverty
There remains a great divide between developing nations , and third - world countries in which health is poor , education is minimal , and violence is rampant .
Africaâ€™s growing population is accompanied by growing poverty rates , and future projections expect the African quality of life to continue to decrease .
Â
The United Nations has developed eight Millennium Development Goals that 192 United Nations member states and at least 23 international organizations have agreed to achieve by the year 2015 which include reducing extreme poverty , reducing child mortality rates , and fighting disease epidemics such as AIDS .
Ongoing â€ “ Poverty in Colombia
Colombia has had a difficult political past .
In recent decades , it has been plagued by Â the drug trade , guerrilla insurgencies , and paramilitary groups , although the last few years has seenÂ Latin America experiencing economic growth , but no change in poverty rates .
Â
Every year since the 1960s , the campus at Universidad Nacional , Bogota , Colombia , gets hit by graffiti artists painting revolutionary heroes ( including Mao , Che Guevara , Marx , Allende , etc. ) in protest against capitalism .
Ongoing â€ “ Tibet / China Animosity
The plight of the Tibetan people since the Chinese invasion of 1950 has been compared to that of the Jews in the mid-1900s .
Hundreds of thousands of Tibetans have been massacred in the following rebellions as well as the famine instigated by Maoâ€™s catastrophic â€œgreat leap forwardâ€ plan .
Many attempts at negotiations have occurred , and although many citizens still call for full independence , the Dalai Lama has expressed a willingness to remain a part of the Republic of China provided it guarantees preservation of Tibetan culture .
Beijing has repeatedly rebuffed this offer , on the grounds that they believe the Dalai Lama is intent on complete independence .
2008 – Beijing Olympics
The 2008 Olympics in Beijing offered Tibetans an opportunity to draw attention to the Chinese occupation of Tibet .
Tibetans and supporters believe that the Chinese government has been using the Olympics to legitimize its occupation of Tibet through the use of publicized images of happy Tibetans .
They also assert that the Chinese government has been arresting and detaining thousands of citizens and Buddhist monks in order to avoid protests .
Ongoing – The Corporation
The 2003 documentary explored the â€œrise of the dominant institution of our timeâ€â€ ¦
The Corporation .
Beginning in the 1800s , a corporation is legally seen as a person , and we are all familiar with todayâ€™s corporate personalities : McDonalds , Goodyear , Shell , Fox , IBM , and the list goes on .
People around the world have come to rely on , and even adore the corporate entities that feed products to a hungry consumer culture , but corporations are also charged with responsibility for immense atrocities including illnesses , death , poverty , pollution , and exploitation .
thats is definatly AN EVIL KILLER cat .
just because he 's cute now , doesnt mean he wont grow up to be a serial killer ... this is how they all start off ...
Will “ Funny People ” be a sad clown at the box office ?
Whatever my reaction to it winds up being when I finally see “ Funny People , ” Judd Apatow has my respect .
As a producer , writer , and sometime director of mostly R- rated comedies , he ’s enjoyed a level of unusually consistent box office and artistic / critical success over a large number of movies that only Pixar , which takes much longer to make its very different brand of crowd - pleaser , can top right now .
Making good movies requires taking risks , and Apatow is taking one right now with a film that is being described as a tragicomedy and with his only hedge being a cast dominated by popular comic actors led by Adam Sandler .
That the film seems to be largely dividing critics and generating confused reactions would , if I were Apatow or Universal , make me a little nervous .
Actually , Universal may be more nervous than Apatow .
As Nikki Finke and everyone else is reporting tonight , the hyphenate comedy guy just inked a 3 - picture deal with them , so he ’s set for the time being .
Variety ‘s Dave McNary reports that box office predictions vary pretty widely for the film , from the low twenty millions to the mid-thirties .
No wonder .
A casual look around the wilds of Rotten Tomatoes indicates that the Apatow ’s third feature as a director after “ The 40 Year - Old Virgin ” and “ Knocked Up ” is far different piece of work and what you might call “ difficult . ”
As far as I can remember , this has almost never indicated an immediate box office success — better to have critics universally detest the movie , it seems , than be conflicted .
Movies that elicit this kind of reaction have more than once emerged years later as cult hits or even , as in the case of “ Blade Runner , ” legitimate classics .
On the other hand , Adam Sandler ’s name will count for something , and the presence of Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill , among others , certainly wo n’t hurt .
But , on the other other hand , we ’ve seen the power of stars amount to less than expected results more than once over the last year or so .
It ’s really anyone ’s guess .
As far as I know , no one ’s even touched the subject of the real life of comedians since 1988 ’s “ Punchline , ” which I caught up with recently as part of Bullz - Eye feature on Tom Hanks .
An intriguing but flawed drama , the film came in at # 47 in the yearly box office despite the presence of Hanks and Sally Field at the height of her popularity .
On the other hand , the one thing that film lacked almost entirely was laughs .
I gather that ’s not so much the problem here .
Apatow ’s penchant for making the world ’s longest comedies , however , might be .
My record for accuracy in predicting box office rivals Bill Kristol ’s accuracy in all matters , but I will say that one key variable may be how much the audience is prepared for a real departure with this film .
If they walk in expecting “ Billy Madison , ” the Twittering masses will render Apatow and Universal box office toast within 24 hours .
Despite being a solid and only slightly unusual comedy , 2006 ’s “ Stranger than Fiction , ” which deserved much better , suffered because audiences were expecting “ a Will Ferrell movie , ” not a quirky and surreal , if also rather low key and old school , comedy
There are two other major releases this week , but they wo n’t be competing for the same audiences as “ Funny People ” and both have been sequestered from critics .
No one I know of has seen “ Aliens in the Attic , ” a blend of live - action and animation that seeks to combine kid-friendly science fiction and action with slapstick comedy .
Despite the spectacle of Doris Roberts ( Ray Romano ’s TV mom and a really fine actress ) doing CGI kung - fu , even the trailer does n’t deliver on laughs or much of anything other than ugly character designs .
Expectations are suitably modest even though the film will be showing in a few more theaters ( 3,106 ) than “ Funny People ” ( 3,008 ) .
A couple of horror bloggers , who rather liked it , and two other writers , who did n’t , are the only critics who have discussed it as of this writing , but the week ’s other release seems targeted at very hard - core horror fans .
Not to be confused with John Fowles ’ novel or William Wyler ’s 1965 film version of the same , “ The Collector ” is being touted as coming from two of the writers of some of the more recent “ Saw ” films and has a completely star - free cast .
It ’s in a relatively small number of theaters ( 1,325 ) so this is clearly a case of a low budget flick being targeted at the primarily young and male audience that digs the kind of film unfairly or otherwise tagged as “ torture porn . ”
Other than that , the big news this week is increasing theater counts .
That includes 48 new screens ( mostly Imax and “ digital Imax , ” i.e. , “ liemax ” screens , I presume ) for “ Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince ” which might help that film ’s below expectations domestic take .
The sleeperish romantic comedy “ ( 500 ) Days of Summer ” more than triples its theater count this week and will be on 266 screens .
And the buzz - heavy “ In the Loop , ” which I noted earlier in the week , will now be on 35 screens .
However , the initially limited release flick that is likely to be the biggest deal by far is Kathryn Bigelow ’s “ The Hurt Locker . ”
This week our own David Medsker joins the general chorus of praise for this Iraq war bomb - disposal thriller ( unexploded munitions movies being a surprisingly robust sub - sub - genre over the decades ) , which has been generating very strong buzz for weeks and even some Oscar talk .
As of tomorrow , it will burst into a total of 523 theaters .

The strangest , easiest way to lose weight
You have a legacy brain .
We 've talked about that a lot on this blog , and in my presentations .
Your brain thinks you 're still living in a cave .
Although your mind knows you 're in the 21st centry , your brain never got the memo .
A big part of the learning theory we use in the Head First books is figuring out how to " trick " your brain into thinking that learning Java is as important as watching for tigers .
We pay a great deal of attention to what your brain cares about , especially when the concerns ( tigers - but - not - java ) are in direct conflict with what your mind cares about ( java - but - not - tigers ) .
Besides caring about tigers - and - not - java -- and the problems that creates when we 're trying to pay attention , learn , and remember -- our legacy brain does something else we all struggle with -- it thinks you wo n't get much to eat all winter , so it better store it up while it can .
Your brain thinks that food is scarce for you , so it better hang on to it .
In other words , for almost all adults ( especially in the US ) , our brain wants us to be weigh more than our conscious mind wants .
The brain never got the memo about how you probably are n't going to starve this winter .
Given how interested we are here into hacking and creating workarounds for the legacy brain issues , a new diet book that claims to take this approach got my attention .
The claims are outrageous , the " plan " is absurd and counter - intuitive , but when the publisher sent me a copy of the book I figured it would n't hurt to try it .
I say " would n't hurt " because it is ridiculously easy to try .
And since the Freakonomics guys were recommending it , I figured there had to be something interesting .
Plus ...
I loved the name : the Shangri -La Diet .
It 's been two weeks since I started and oh - my - god .
It is almost impossible to describe what this " diet " ( it 's not really a diet ) does .
( All links are at the end of this post ) A UC Berkeley professor named Seth Roberts claims to have found a way to trick the legacy brain into thinking it needs to weigh less .
( Which means " lower your set point " , for those who are familiar with that term )
It does not cause you to suddenly burn more calories .
It does not increase your metabolism .
It is not a drug .
It does not require counting calories .
It does not require changing what you eat ( although for many people , it will anyway )
It does not require exercise ( although I 'm always going to strongly recommend it ! )
[ Update :
It is based on quite a lot of different scientific research ( rat studies , especially ) that the author has managed to piece together into a theory and approach that works .
It is not simply a psychological trick . ]
It claims to do just one thing -- cause your body to want / need less food .
Period .
In other words , you know that feeling you have after you 've eaten a huge dinner and you think , " I 'll never eat another bite ever again " -- this so - called " diet " makes that feeling happen much earlier , after a much smaller meal .
Quite simply , it reduces your appetite , but in a really freakish way .
It is not an artificial appetite supressant ; it works by using your body 's natural appetite supressant -- the desire to keep you at a particular weight .
For me , in two weeks , it 's been working too well .
I do n't have a weight problem , so I was n't interested in losing weight .
I wanted to try it because it 's fascinating , seems impossible to believe , and MAINLY for the claim that by reducing cravings , it helps you make better eating choices .
My goal on this " diet " was that when it was time to eat , I wanted to find carrots and broccoli as viable an option as Ben and Jerry's .
That has n't completely happened ( although cravings have virtually disappeared ) , but within three days , I was actually forgetting to eat .
For the last ten days I 've had to remind myself -- as a purely cognitive activity -- that " this is probably a good time to eat something . "
Is there a danger that I 'll become too thin ?
Sure , if I 'm not paying attention .
But that 's easy enough to correct -- there 's basically a body - back guarantee .
If I just stop the program , I 'll get my old body back soon enough ...
I was worried that this loss of desire for food would mean a loss of pleasure when eating .
But this is not food aversion -- while nothing beckons you or even sounds particularly good , everything tastes just as wonderful as before .
And it is the weirdest damn feeling ... it 's a kind of " not hungry " that is unlike anything I 've ever experienced .
It seems too good to be true .
And maybe it is ...
I only have two weeks ' experience .
Maybe the effect will wear off ( although there 's little reason to think that ) .
And the research might turn out to be complete crap -- some believe it might even be some kind of elaborate hoax .
But I have two other friends on it now , and after five days , they 've noticed the effect as well .
So I 'm not so much recommending it ( since that would require more time ) as reporting my thoughts about it , my short - term experience , and why I find it so fascinating .
The downside :
* It does n't seem to work for everyone .
Some people claim it had no effect ( I have a suspicion that some of the folks for whom it does n't work were n't actually doing it with the kind of rigorous adherence to one simple rule that 's required ) .
* Some people take much longer to see an effect , although it seems that most people notice it in less than a week .
* You must MUST be able to find at least one two - hour time window each day where you have nothing but water .
Nothing with any flavor of any kind is allowed -- NO EXCEPTIONS -- during that period , including brushing your teeth .
For most people , two hours is no problem at all ... but you have to be extremely careful or you risk not just eliminating the positive effect , but potentially ruining your chance of using it correctly in the future .
* In the middle of that two hour window , you must ingest one of two things ... either a tablespoon of sugar dissolved in water , or a tablespoon of extra light olive oil .
If either of those are not do - able for you , you 're out of luck .
* The sugar water comes with the potential for a blood sugar reaction , so if you choose that instead of the olive oil , you can reduce or eliminate the effect by sipping slowly .
I heat up the water , dissolve the sugar , and sip it over a half hour like really weak , sweet tea .
I tried the olive oil and hated it .
* You must also ... well , no , there IS nothing else .
Seriously .
Nothing .
Eat whatever you want , do whatever you want , just take in the extra calories from either the sugar or the oil , and there 's nothing more .
THAT is the Shangri - La Diet .
Sugar , or oil .
End of story .
While I 've more or less revealed the diet here , the Shangri -La Diet book is needed if you 're going to try it , or you 're interested in the research / science behind it .
There are a lot of subtle variations and tweaks and tunes , and recommendations based on how much weight you want to lose , etc .
So , again , if you 're going to try it , I 'd definitely get the book despite finding most of the information about it on the internet .
Links :
Extensive article with comments on CalorieLab .
The original NY Times piece by the Freakonomics guys .
Shangri-La Diet book ( on Amazon ) .
Aaron Swartz blog post about it .
Disclaimer : I was given this book by the publisher .
However , it would have come to my attention because of the similarity of our approaches -- hacking the legacy brain .
Indeed , within a week of getting the book , I was sent a related link by fellow blogger Scott Reynen who thought I might be interested .
I do not use Amazon affiliate links , so I am not benefitting in any way from recommending the book here or elsewhere , and I have no relationship with the publisher or author .
In fact , I 'm buying my own extra copies now for others .
Also , I 'm not a dietician or nutritionist !
I have absolutely NO authority in this field -- this is simply my personal thoughts about it .
( However , I did major in exercise physiology , and spent ten years in the health / fitness industry , including a stint as the Training Director for The Sports Club Company , the group behind some of the largest and most exclusive health clubs in the world -- The Sports Club / LA , Sports Club Reebok / New York , etc .
But I specialized only in exercise , and had nothing to do with diets and nutrition . )
OK , now back to our regularly scheduled " creating passionate users " topics ; )

I 've been doing this on and off for years without the sugar / olive oil , although I can see how that might help .
I have a tendency to eat too much .
It is n't that the food I eat is generally really bad , I just eat more than I need .
However , with a little mental acrobatics I can noticably teach my body to want less food .
I feel hungry less often , have cravings less and even come to despise the taste of junk foods .
The biggest challenge I have is getting the collaboration of my partner .
It is really hard to keep this up if you have someone around you that is n't doing the same thing .

Kathy , this is the last thing I expected to find on this blog .

" OK , now back to our regularly scheduled " creating passionate users " topics ; ) "
Hey !
I 'm extremely passionate about wanting to regain the marathoning body I had prior to injury !
I eat good food , but too much of it for the non-marathoner that I 've become .
If this works , I 'll be extremely passionate about it too :-)

So basically some guy wrote a book on using control to lose weight , slapped a fancy name on the cover and promoted to influencers like yourself ?
Sounds like every other diet book our there to me .
Nothing really new here .
Sorry Kathy , looking forward to your next post on marketing .
I 'll stick to the nutrition sites for diet info .
thanks anyhow
Posted by : George Harris | May 1 , 2006 7:49:18 PM
Thanks for the positive comments about eating less , Kathy .
The reality is , there is simply too much food and not enough Java .
( And there may be something to this if someone thin is losing weight ... )

If you do n't eat for four hours , then put a raisin under your tongue and give yourself a sharp poke in the eye you 'll lose twice as much .
Posted by : Patrick Fitzgerald | May 1 , 2006 10:22:57 PM
I suspect the effectiveness of this diet has nothing to do with nutrition and everything to do with psychology .
People with a weight problem generally have a negative emotional relationship with food .
Often eating becomes a way of self - expression , possibly the only part of their lives they can control .
This book , by saying eat what you want , gives the dieter the permission to eat normally .
Permission is a very strong psychological factor in conformity experiments ( e.g. Millgram 's electric shock study ) .
By saying eat what you want the diet is giving the dieter permission to have a normal relationship with food .
The two hours a day abstention period is a device that allows the dieter to practice not eating .
Its only two hours and they can eat what they want at the end of it .
Most people can manage this and when they achieve it they feel good about ' sticking to the diet ' , reinforcing the behaviour of not eating .
During the two hours free of stimulants you are likely to become re-tuned to your body 's signals of hunger and thirst .
Promoting a heathly , eat when you are hungry , behaviour pattern .
The sugar / oil requirement is odd .
I think it serves two functions .
Firstly its a choice , giving the dieter control over what they consume .
There is a lot of research on how choice and control effects stress levels .
Secondly its a ritual .
A marker point that reminds the dieter about the diet and what they are hoping to do .
It also acts as a badge , or a t - shirt , for the brand .
e.g. being the one on the office who makes that strange drink once a day .
Behaviour can mark your allegiance to something just as much as a t - shirt or tribal scarring can .
Once you belong to a tribe , this reinforces your belief or ' buy - in ' to the tribe 's beliefs .
This is beneficial in this case because you will loose weight and be healthier but also because you will promote the book to your friends , the authors and publishers are happy as well .

I have some serious doubts about this diet , because it ignores the point of weight loss .
Why does one want to lose weight ?
To put it in Kathys terms , what is the " ? " in " It 's the [ ? ] , stupid ! " here ?
For me it is " health " .
" Looking good " would be nice , but I 'm not willing to sacrifice my health just to look good .
Does the Shangri - La diet help me here ?
I do n't think so .
( or only a little bit ) .
The main problem is not that we eat way too much , but that we eat crappy food and we eat it way fast .
We eat way too much processed foods filled with trans - fats and HFCS .
The Shangri-La diet basically says there is no problem with eating crappy food with little nutrional value .
That is just plain wrong .
My advice would be to stay away from hamburgers and chips .
Learn to cook , instead of eating microwave food , and eat more vegetables , fruits , whole grains , fish , .. Oh , and enjoy .
Take some time to actually taste your food , and relax .
You 'll also want to excersise offcourse .
Personally , I just do n't believe in quick diets , that promise lots of weight loss without any effort .
They usually sacrifice your health to get quick results .

Ohh I simply cant understand why dieting .
Just by doing it you can not stay fits .
So many factors are related with good health and if one does n't consider it dieting alone can't help .

Wow Kathy .
Lots of comments on this one .
I think I 'll give it a shot before I declare it Good or Bad .
I know that eating Bad food wo n't make one healthy , but I also know that eating too much Good food will still make you fat .
Seems like trying the experiment should n't be too hard and does n't seem like I 'd be risking my health .
So , sugar water or olive oil ?
Decisions , decisions ...
Posted by : Burk | May 2 , 2006 8:21:57 AM
Well ...
I did say it was absurd and that the claims were outrageous .
But , I think it 's still worth looking at the science behind it ( granted , mostly rat studies , but it 's the rat studies that have led to a great deal of what we now know about the brain ) .
The heart of it is tied to the brain registering calories without flavor , and the associations it makes .
Sugar has bizarre properties of its own ...
Again , I encourage ya'll to have an open mind until you 've at least looked at the research and his theories about the science behind it .
( Granted , he makes some big leaps here and there , but there 's evidence to suggest those leaps might be right .
He 's the first one to have put all the pieces together from some of the studies that date back 30 years or more , motivated to go down that path by his own self - experimentation - - a fun story on its own . )
George :
It 's not about control ; his whole point is about making control a non-issue .
You wo n't need control , because you wo n't be in a huge fight with your brain over just how much you need to weigh .
Patrick :
True on the whole poke - in - the - eye thing , but downing a little sugar water is somewhat less painful ; )
Chris :
You may be right , although I do n't think that can explain people like me who are n't overweight and for whom two hours without anything but water defines most of my day anyway -- my day has n't changed one bit other than that one drink .
But I think a lot of what you said is probably a big part of it , especially that you do n't have to do anything .
And while I HEARTILY agree with you about the effects of " tribe " , I would put drinking sugar water at the bottom of the list of things that have tribe characteristics .
It 's pretty much the opposite of things with community support and involvement like , say , Weight Watchers or Atkins .
Jan :
There 's nothing in here that asks you to sacrifice your health .
But I agree with your advice , and indeed the author makes the same claims in the book ( has a whole chapter on what 's wrong with processed food , etc. ) .
His notion ( which seems to be true for me , since eating healthier was my goal for this , not weight loss ) is this :
While you CAN eat anything you want , if you do this calories - without - flavor brain trick , you just ... wo n't .
Without really thinking much about it , it takes away the associations your brain makes with certain foods , and you quit wanting them .
In other words , it 's not a requirement that you make any changes , but the end result is that you will ... without having to try .
True , it has n't made broccoli as appealing to me as ice cream , but it 's probably closed 80 % of the gap .
I do n't believe in quick diets either , but this is n't technically a diet - - it 's a way to stop your brain from fighting you on the whole long - winter - in - the - cave thing .
Or at least that 's the claim .
This could , though , as you said -- lead people into unhealthfully quick results .
For some people it works so well that if they 're * greedy * about weight loss , they 'll lose muscle mass and end up in worse shape than before they started .
( But that 's why I 've never recommended diets , even as a fitness trainer .
Exercise is always the better way , especially combined with eating less processed food , etc .
Burk : I have no idea if it 's really good or bad , but it 's very strange , and for me -- as I said -- working TOO well .
There is another explanation ... that it 's simply a coincidence that I 've lost most of my appetite ( especially for the bad things ) .
I considered that , and that 's why I waited for two weeks to see if anything else turned out to be wrong with me ( even had another check - up just to be sure this was n't some new problem with MY brain ) .
I can't really believe I 'm defending this diet I know almost nothing about , but I think it 's the bizarre nobody - can - believe - it - could - possibly - work part that I like .
Almost nobody thought the Head First books could possibly work -- regardless of the research behind it -- and today they represent half of the O'Reilly bestseller list on their main page .
So , I encourage y'all to have an open mind ; )
Besides , we do n't seem to be doing all that well with any OTHER diet program , even the more traditional research ends up contradicting itself ...
" Fat is bad . "
" No , we were wrong ...
Fat is Good and Carbs are Evil . "
People can make the most progress by eating very sensibly and exercising , but if it were that easy -- the weight loss industry would n't be a multi-billion dollar one , and obesity would n't be a continually - rising health care crises in the US .
I say sugar water is at least as worth a try as anything else .
And if at least part of what Chris says is right , it 's an easy way to get people to make a positive change .

I know that eating Bad food wo n't make one healthy , but I also know that eating too much Good food will still make you fat .
That 's true , but good food tends to be less calorie dense than bad food .
So eating too much good food tends to be more difficult than eating too much bad food .
I 'm just saying , start with eating healthy , never skip breakfast , only eat healthy snacks and excersise three times a week .
If you still do n't feel a lot more healthier and slimmer after 2 months , then Shangri - La might be usefull .
I think that would be rather rare .
Posted by : Jan | May 2 , 2006 9:29:47 AM
Ah , so if I understand this correctly , it does talk about what food to avoid , and what food is good for you .
The sugar water is like a little trick to help you stick with it .
In that case it does look pretty interesting .
Posted by : Jan | May 2 , 2006 9:41:58 AM
You 're a remarkably interesting person . :o )
Posted by : JimDesu | May 2 , 2006 10:22:32 AM
I 'll try it .
I 'll try anything once .
It does sound outrageous , but I also know that a good deal of why we overeat is partly psychological .
It 's something they start discussing about parenting these days , that you do n't necessarily want to tell your children to clean everything off their plate .
Not like my generation where you were made to feel guilty if you did .
What happens when you go out to eat and have the typical American restaurant portions ?
So , yeah , I 'm dubious but I 'll try ( most ) anything once .

I read this last night , then woke up this morning thinking -- I know just how to describe this : supercalifragilisticexpialidocious !
" Just a spoon full of sugar helps the [ weight ] go down -- in a most delightful way ! "
Sorry -- I could n't resist . ;-)

Thanks for posting this , Kathy , I 'm really intrigued .
I 've been going up and down in weight for many years , cycling through various diets ( Atkins , South Beach , etc. ) generally I can lose weight in the summer when I can get out and walk / play a lot and somehow the emotional need for calories seems to wane .
But come winter I just gain it all back as my resolve to maintain a speciality diet cracks .
This year I 've been trying more excercise , which is good , but my weight has been constant -- presumably I just eat more as I burn more calories .
I 'm a pretty big believer in the Set Point , so if there 's a way to control that , that would be a major breakthrough .
Posted by : Charlie Evett | May 2 , 2006 1:30:31 PM
When I first read about this diet I thought it was rubbish , but now that I see smart people defending it , I am intrigued .
I found your comparison with the Head First books interesting .
While I love your blog , the Head First book I read ( Design Patterns ) did do not work for me at all .
On the other hand , I did not find losing weight all that hard ( I lost 100 pounds by eating healthier and exercising more ) .
I guess research can prove a lot of things , but in the end everybody is different .
I think the unhealthy part of this diet is that you 'll consume ( according to one of the links you posted ) 300 calories of nutrient - less food .
That 's 20 % of a 1500 calorie diet .
If you are eating a low calorie diet , you should make sure that all calories are full of vitamins and minerals .
If you 're following this diet , at least make sure to eat very healthy ( lots of vegetables and fruit ) and consider taking a multivitamin .

I do n't know very much about this " diet " , and , as a wellness and fitness coach , I really do n't want to know much .
It 's true that you can " forget " to eat , but it 's actually MUCH more healthful to REMEMBER to eat , and on - schedule .
It 's very hard to over - eat if you have smallnutritious meals 5 - 6 times a day .
This author 's sugar and olive oil supplements are easy to understand : the sugar is providing carbohydrate so your tissues do n't entirely each each other ( the body will cannibalize your tissues -- like muscle , etc -- first , so it can save the brain for last ) and the olive oil is a fat source , once again for the energy in the fat .
Any ' weight loss ' is temporary with this " diet " .
Only decreasing adipose tissue ( " fat " ) and increasing active tissue ( lean muscle , more blood vessels , capillaries = increased metabolism ) will you sustain a leaner body .
This can be done only by :
- decreasing food intake each meal ( but eating often )
-eating nutrient - dense foods and not garbage
- drinking water to flush & hydrate the system
- exercising ( and building lean muscle )
Everything beyond these details come down to mind - and habit- control .
It 's not as if you can ONLY 'eat clean ' , but you should eat nutritiously most of the time , and diet is 80 % of your fitness goals anyway .
As I said , I teach this to clients ( and on my website ) every day .
Best to you , be healthy ,
Lauren

Here 's an uber simple and effective way to lose weight : do n't eat meat .
You'd be surprised how effective this strategy is plus you get the bonus karma points for not causing suffering .
Posted by : g | May 2 , 2006 9:51:13 PM
For me , the explanation for this so called " diet " is quite obvious .
American people have such bad eating habits that they need to trick themselves not to eat ANYTHING FOR TWO HOURS .
Let 's be honest , in any other part of the world , not eating for two hours is just something you do everyday .
So off course , I strongly believe in the fact that forcing yourself not to eat for two hours , if you do n't do that naturally everyday , can help you reduce the feeling of hungriness and therefore help you get slim .
And concerning the oil OR sugar ( I could also recommend a nicely spiced glass of water ... ) , they are just here to make you believe there is indeed a concept behind this diet , kind of a placebo effect in fact .
So I 'd say it can be an effective diet ... for the people with really bad eating habits , but you should be careful with it because any kind of self conditionning can become dangerous when not well thought of ( you could really loose your appetite ... ) .

I think some of the people criticising the diet seem to forget that the most straight - forward diet ( eat less , eat healthy , exercise more ) simply does not work for everyone .
It seems that it does n't work even for the majority .
Sure , it works in theory , but in practice it does n't .
The overwhelming majority of overweight people just do n't have the willpower of sticking with such a diet .
There are exceptions , of course , but the fact is that the western world does a have HUGE ( sorry for the pun ) obesity problem .
Most of the overweight people do want to lose weight and are constantly trying to .
And failing .
Again and again .
In contrast , the Shangri - La diet , if it indeed works as advertised , makes losing weight pretty much automatic .
Say your weight is now 120 kilograms .
Soon after you start the Shangri - La diet , your body starts to think that your " target " weight is , say , 80 kilograms .
And it is damn hard to fight against your set point .
It is not as if you could consciously make yourself hungry .
If you do n't believe , ask those millions who have tried to lose weight but failed !
Shangri - La diet is , if you do n't mind computer programming terminology , somewhat orthogonal to aspects such as healthiness and exercise etc .
For millions and millions of people , too much weight itself is the most acute health problem .
Eliminate that , and you 've at least won one major problem .

I love how thin people assume that all overweight people are eating crappy food .
I eat a great , whole - foods diet with good veggies , meats , fruits , nuts , and some dairy .
I have n't had an item with HFCS in years !
YEARS !
I do n't do sugar , flour , or corn syrup .
And I do n't OD on red meat ( maybe once a week or week and a half ) .
I eat salmon twice a week .
I have flax every morning for breakfast .
AND I work out for an hour every single day .
I run , mostly , or I do an aerobics video with weights .
I have put on five pounds when I already needed to lose 10 .
Due to some female issues , I am simply unable to lose weight .
I 've been stuck at this weight for a long , long time .
Tell me : what harm could it possibly do to add a tablespoon of sugar or oil a day to my healthy diet ?
Even if it is snake oil or mind over matter or placebo , there 's still no harm in it .
Because if your brain thinks it 's going to work , then , by golly , it probably will .
Gotta love the mind / body interchange .
Thanks for posting this .

My goodness !
By people 's reactions , it sounds like this diet is asking people to eat poison .
Look , it 's not even a " diet " : it 's a way to suppress your appetite so that you eat less , and it does so by aiming at a brain mechanism that associates eating more with tasty food .
With this approach , it does n't mean that you 'll be anorexic either , or that the appetite will totally disappear ( i.e. , you starve to death , obliviously ) .
If your weight becomes less than what you think it should be , cut back on this olive oil / sugar water stuff and get your appetite up a bit more .
If you have n't been able to lose weight , it 's because your intake of calories has been equal to your expenditure .
Suppress the appetite this way and you 'll eat less , take in fewer calories and lose weight .
The proof of the pudding is in the eating .
Or in this case , the proof of the pudding is in not necessarily wanting to eat the whole thing .
Posted by : Ray | May 3 , 2006 8:26:50 AM
I 'll try it .
I 'm not overweight but I have a layer of " thick skin " I 'd like to trim .
More intriguing to me is the idea that it suppresses the hunger feeling .
I * always * feel hungry .
I often feel so hungry it feels like I 'm starving .
Even if I do n't lose weight , if I stop feeling hungry this will be worth it .
I drink a lot of water and certainly have more than a 2 hour window of not consuming anything but water .
