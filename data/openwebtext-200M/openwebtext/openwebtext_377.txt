Interpol ’s Creativity
Since 2002 , the Pentagon has been seeking
evidence that intimately relates President Chávez and his government
with the FARC .
Top secret documents from the Department of Defense
( that we have desclassified under FOIA ) evidence that the Pentagon has
been unable to find proof of a clandestine , subversive relationship
between the Venezuelan government and the FARC .
The sources used in
some Pentagon documents that attempt to show such a relationship are
completely unreliable , since they are mass media outlets from Venezuela
and Colombia , such as Globovisión , Caracol , El Universal and El
Nacional – all of whom are aligned with the opposition to Chávez .
When
the Colombian government bombed the FARC camp in Ecuador on March 1 ,
killing two dozen people in an illegal incursion onto Equatorian
territory that was condemned by the Organization of American States
( OEA ) and only supported by the United States ( suprise ! ) , it was all
they could do to produce evidence they had been seeking for six years .
Just hours after the illegal invasion and massacre ( during which 5
innocent Mexican visiting students were killed ) , the head of Colombia ’s
National Police , General Naranjo , was announcing they had “ found ” a
“ laptop ” that belonged to Raul Reyes , the FARC commander killed in the
bombing , and that the computer contained information that showed a link
between President Chávez and several members of his government , and the
handover ( or offering ) of weapons and money to the FARC .
( Now we would
have to ask how the Colombian police found that key information so
quickly amongst the more than 39,000 word files and several million
documents contained on the computers that the INTERPOL report says it
would take 1,000 years to read ) .
All of sudden , evidence was found that
not even the Pentagon ’s Defense Intelligence Agency or the world ’s top
spies could encounter during years of secret missions , agent recruiting
and handling and psychological operations ; that Chávez was going to
sell uranium to the FARC to make dirty bombs ; that Chávez promised
somewhere between $ 250 - $ 300 million to the FARC ; that he gave them
weapons ; and that together they sought to overthrow Uribe ’s government
and install a FARC marxist state .
That mysterious machine
contained anything the Empire could ever have dreamed up to bury the
Venezuelan government and declare it over and done with .
But ,
there was a big problem : since the machine had been in the hands of the
Colombian government – confessed adversary of its Venezuelan neighbor –
and the “ Documents ” that evidenced the relationship with President
Chávez were actually just texts written in Word , without signature or
seal , there was little faith in their credibility .
How easy it is to
just write a document in Word on some computer and say it was written
by someone else !
Word documents do n’t have original signature .
If they
had found – say – a diary or a journal written by the hand of Raul
Reyes , then the situation would be quite different , but a bunch of
texts in Word ?
Emails ?
In today ’s world , electronic information is
unreliable .
Computers can been manipulated from a remote source .
Any
decent hacker or computer techie can enter into a system and alter
whatever , without leaving fingerprints .
So , Colombia did the
intelligent thing .
They said – lets let an uninvolved third party
evaluate the computers to determine whether they have been manipulated
or not by us .
And that ’s when Interpol came along .
The Secretary
General of the International Police ( INTERPOL ) , Ronald Kenneth Noble ,
is an ex US Government employee , and he was First Undersecretary of the
Department of Treasury in charge of the Secret Service , the Bureau of
Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , the Center for Federal Law Enforcement
Training , the Network of Financial Crimes Control and the Office of
Foreign Assets Control ( which , by the way , is the entity in charge of
enforcing the blockade against Cuba and the prohibition of US citizens
to travel there ) .
Noble has been Secretary General of INTERPOL for 8
years ( two terms ) , and it was he who was in charge of supervising the
authentication of the “ evidence ” obtained by the Colombian government
in the FARC camp .
INTERPOL was charged with a pretty limited and
subjective mision , that was to “ Examine the user files on the eight
seized FARC computers and to determine whether any of the user files
had been newly created , modified or deleted on or after 1 March 2008 . ”
INTERPOL did not occupy itself with verifying the origin , accuracy or
source of those files or computers , which means that reasonable doubt
still remains regarding the true authorship of that data .
INTERPOL took
for granted that the machines and the evidence pertained to Raul Reyes
and the FARC , which in legal terms prejudices the entire investigation
because it shows that from the beginning , INTERPOL had already taken
the side of the Colombian government .
INTERPOL ’s report states
specifically that the scope of their forensic examination was limited
to a ) determining the actual data contained in the eight seized FARC
computer exhibits , b ) verifying whether the user files had been
modified in any way on or after 1 March 2008 , and c ) determining
whether Colombian law enforcement authorities had handled and examined
the eight seized FARC computer exhibits in conformity with
internationally recognized principles for handling electronic evidence
by law enforcement . ” [ Interpol Report , page 7 ] .
Subsequently ,
INTERPOL ’s report confirms that the “ verification of the eight seized
FARC computer exhibits by INTERPOL does not imply the validation of the
accuracy of the user files , the validation of any country ’s
interpretation of the user files or the validation of the source of the
user files . ” [ Interpol Report , page 9 ] .
So , INTERPOL only
examined and verified whether the data contained on the computers had
been created , modified or deleted after March 1 when it was publicly in
the hands of the Colombian government .
And although in their own
report , INTERPOL concludes that access to the machines between March 1
and March 3 by the Grupo Investigativo de Delitos Informáticos of the
Colombian Judicial Police ( DIJIN ) “ did not conform to internationally
recognized principles for handling electronic evidence by law
enforcement ” [ Page 31 ] , Secretary General Noble justifies that
violation and the modifications made by the DIJIN as part of the
difficulties encountered by those law enforcement who “ are first on the
scene ” .
INTERPOL says its role was “ exclusively technical ” yet
Secretary General Noble began his press conference on May 15 with a
very partialized political discourse in favor of the Colombian
government and condemning the FARC as drugtraffickers and terrorists .
When asked by a journalist from TELESUR whether he could confirm the
source of the evidence , Noble blurted our “ I can say with certainty
that the computers came from a FARC terrorist camp … ”
The journalist
asked if they belonged to any person in particular , and Noble responded
“ yes , the now dead Reyes … ”
If we return to page 9 of the
INTERPOL report we can clearly read the statement : “ the verification of
the eight seized FARC computer exhibits by INTERPOL does not imply the
validation of the accuracy of the user files , the validation of any
country ’s interpretation of the user files or the validation of the
source of the user files . ”
So , how did Mr. Noble know the computers belonged to Raul Reyes if INTERPOL did not analyze their origen ?
In
the end , INTERPOL can say that technically those computers were not
modified or altered after March 1 , but that tells us nothing concrete
that could serve as legal evidence in a court of law .
We do n’t know the
source of those machines .
We do n’t know who created the documents , text
and data on those computers .
There is no way whatsoever to authenticate
the information contained on the thousands of Word documents and emails
on those computers .
They could be stories , wishes , dreams , prayers or
fantasies .
What they are not is actual hard core proof of a crime .
And
as no surprise , the US government has expressed its “ concern ” over the
INTERPOL report and the “ ties between the Venezuelan government and the
FARC . ” ( The US government is always “ concerned ” when it comes to
Venezuela .
First , Ambassador Donna Hrinak expressed her “ concern ” over
President Chávez ’s statements criticizing the US bombing in Afghanistan
in October 2001 , and months later came the coup d’etat against Chávez .
Then it was Ambassador Charles Shapiro who expressed his “ concern ”
about the political crises and the divisions in the country and soon
after we had the economic sabotage of the oil industry in December
2002 .
Later we had Ambassador William Brownfield saying he was
“ concerned ” about the increase in drug transit and the threat to
freedom of expression , and we had street violence , an increase in
funding to the opposition , and the White House certified Venezuela as a
nation “ not cooperating ” with counterdrug measures and the war on
terror .
And now what ? )
First , the spokesperson for the
Department of State , Sean McCormack stated on May 16 that “ this is a
motive of concern for us .
It ’s a concern for the people of Colombia and
the government of Colombia … Right now our intelligence community is
analyzing the INTERPOL report …
You do n’t have to look far beyond the
many news reports that we have seen recently based on the information
found in those laptops and other information … ” ( Right , when the news
media says something in sync with Washington ’s foreign policy , it ’s
pointed to as a valid source , but when they criticize Bush ’s policies
on Irak or discover inconsistencies with the administration , then they
say the media are biased and unrealiable ) .
The next day , the
normally low profile ( for now ) US Ambassador in Venezuela , Patrick
Duddy , appeared on Globovisión declaring that “ elements of concern ”
exist in the documents found on Raul Reyes ’ laptop and that “ we respect
what Interpol has presented and we remind you that there is already a
ton of material that has come out in the press and there are elements
of conern , but also there is a lot of information and the agencies that
have access to it will analyze it . ”
Of course his statement is
identical to that of the Department of State , and that ’s no coincidence
– that ’s because the embassies all receive a “ Western Hemisphere Press
Guidance ” sheet telling them exactly what to say !
So , the next
step will be when the CIA , the Pentagon and other official Washington
representatives “ certify ” the information on the computers and launch
all kinds of additional accusations towards Venezuela – now with
“ proof ” , even if invented .
Was n’t the power point presentation that
Colin Powell so assuredly presented before the UN Security Council
regarding the weapons of mass destruction in Irak considered “ proof ” ?
So , now we have laptops with non-authenticatible documents that will be
used as “ evidence ” to place Venezuela on the state sponsors of terror
list or worse , justify some kind of military incursion onto Venezuela
territory to safeguard the world from terrorists .
The Fourth
Fleet of the Navy has already been activated , something not seen since
World War II , and will be patrolling and coordinating military activity
in the Latin American region .
Last month , SOUTHCOM launched Operation
Enduring Freedom – Caribbean and Central America – which deployed an
elite batallon of National Guard and navy ships into the region to
prepare strategies to detect and defend against terrorist threats in
the region .
In the end , INTERPOL achieved what Washington has n’t
been able to do for years : invent the way to “ validate ” some kind of
bogus evidence against Venezuela that will jusfity US aggressions and
possibly the next military intervention .
( CNN ) -- Carrying blankets and bed sheets on their heads , thousands of refugees fleeing fighting in Chad 's capital N'Djamena crossed a drought - stricken river to get to neighboring Cameroon Sunday , local officials and journalists said .
The violence in Chad has opened up a new conflict next to Sudan 's wartorn Darfur region , where more than 200,000 people have died since early 2003 and 2.5 million people have been forced into refugee camps .
Government forces , under the direction of Chad's President Idriss Deby , continued a bloody battle for power in N'Djamena against the rebels , according to a French military spokesman .
Between 2,000 and 3,000 rebel soldiers armed with rifles roamed N'Djamena 's streets in pickup trucks , the spokesman said .
The rebels entered the city on Saturday , local officials and journalists said .
Read about causes of the violence
Chadian Ambassador to the United States Mahamoud Adam Bechir said the rebels were mercenaries supported by the government in neighboring Sudan .
He said Sudan wanted to destabilize Chad 's government .
Watch why Sudan is being blamed »
Both the Sudanese and Chadian governments have previously accused one another of fomenting violence in the other 's country by giving support to rebel groups .
On Sunday , the Chadian refugees flooded the Cameroon town of Kousseri , which lies just across the border from N'Djamena , according to Helene Caux , a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva .
She said authorities in Kousseri have put the number of Chadian refugees in the thousands .
That was confirmed by Agnes Teile , a journalist for Cameroon television station Canal 2 , who witnessed a steady stream of people -- mostly women and children -- spilling into Kousseri .
Some of the refugees were able to cross into Cameroon over a bridge , which was reopened earlier Sunday .
Others had to wade through the river which was at low levels due to an ongoing drought .
Aid groups are struggling to reach the injured because of the ongoing fighting , according to the Chadian Red Cross which estimates about 200 have been wounded since Saturday .
Many of the injured are civilians caught in the crossfire , according to the aid group Doctors Without Borders -- known internationally by its French name , Medecins Sans Frontieres .
Some of those who fled to Cameroon also sustained injuries and are being treated by Cameroon 's military and Red Cross , Teile said .
Cameroon authorities have warned the United Nations they could face problems providing aid if the refugee numbers swell , Caux said .
In response , UNHCR is sending three of its staff to Kousseri to help the relief effort .
It has also been difficult to get an accurate idea of the casualty count as a result of the ongoing fighting .
The U.N. Security Council also met Sunday for emergency talks on the fighting , with Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon calling for an immediate cease - fire .
" The Secretary - General is profoundly alarmed by the dangerous situation in Chad , particularly in light of the heavy fighting in several parts of the capital city , N'Djamena , " according to a Sunday afternoon statement from Ban 's office .
" He appeals to all countries in the region to respect the inviolability of international borders and to prevent any incursions from being launched from within their territory , " the secretary - general 's office said .
There are unconfirmed reports of bodies littering the streets in western N'Djamena .
Watch CNN 's Nic Robertson 's report on latest violence »
" It is terrible in the west , a lot of bodies down .
A lot of civilians , " a hotel clerk at the Kempinski Hotel in eastern N'Djamena told CNN by phone .
The clerk said he had spoken to his brother who lives in the western part of the city .
The brother said he had seen the bodies of men in military uniform lying in the street and people were afraid to move outside and were staying indoors .
The clerk said he heard gunfire coming from the area around the presidential palace Sunday .
He said there was no fighting near the hotel but that on Saturday cars belonging to the rebels surrounded the government palace and his hotel .

Some 1,600 French forces are helping evacuate hundreds of foreign nationals from N'Djamena ; 400 foreign nationals left on Saturday and another 400 were slated to leave on Sunday .
Five evacuation centers were established around Chad 's capital for foreign nationals to gather so they can be escorted by the French troops in armored vehicles to the airport , French Foreign Affairs spokesman Mathiew Ly said .
Also on Sunday , 103 U.N. staff were evacuated from the Chadian capital to the west African country of Gabon .
A skeleton team of around 20 will remain in the city .

The U.S. Embassy , in a statement Saturday , said it was evacuating selected employees and their families from N'Djamena , and asked that any American citizens who want to leave should contact the embassy .
The U.S. State Department on Sunday updated its travel advice , warning against any travel to the country .
The State Department issued a statement saying it had ordered the evacuation of all family members of Americans working for the embassy as well as all non-emergency American staff .
It warned U.S. citizens still in N'Djamena to remain in safe locations indoors .

NEW HAVEN , Connecticut – Even as China dealt with the aftermath of deadly 7.9 - magnitude earthquake earlier this month that killed more than 55,000 people , the Chinese government 's internet censors were on the job .
" Reporters rushed to the scene , and there was general feeling that the government had lifted the restrictions on reporters , " said Robert Dietz , the Asia program coordinator for the U.S. - based Committee to Protect Journalists .
" But the central propaganda department never stopped handing down directives , never stopped telling people how much to report . "
When forum posters criticize the response to this month 's earthquake in China , Jing Jing and Cha Cha pop up to remind them to " advance harmony . "
Courtesy the Committee to Protect Journalists
That China 's response to a massive natural disaster included censorship is no surprise to Dietz , or other panelists speaking about the state of global internet freedom at the Computers , Freedom and Privacy conference here Friday .
China pioneered draconian internet controls with its " Golden Shield " program in 1998 – better known in the West as the " great firewall . "
What 's disturbing , they say , is how many countries have followed China 's lead in filtering the net .
In its latest survey of censorship in 195 nations , the nonprofit Freedom House found that 64 percent were " not free . "
As a percentage of the global population , " only 18 percent of the world live in a country with free media , " said Karin Karlekar , the report 's editor .
" In 2002 , China and Saudi Arabia were filtering the internet , " said Rob Faris , an economist with the Open Net Initiative .
" Here we are in the 2008 , not many years later , and we 're seeing dozens of countries around the world ( censoring ) .
We 're seeing concentrations in the Middle East , but we 're also seeing other countries where you would n't necessarily expect this . "
A bill under consideration in the U.S. House of Representatives would make it a crime for U.S. technology companies doing business overseas to turn over their customers ' personal information to repressive governments .
Many recent entrants into internet repression show signs of mission creep ; governments start with one purported motive for filtering the net , then stray into others .
In Vietnam , for example , censorship is allegedly aimed at blocking pornography .
" The fact is they 're blocking political material , and much of the pornography is still available there , " says Faris .
Following the May 12 earthquake in China 's Sichuan province , the news coverage was naturally empathetic , making the censorship regime redundant .
But as Chinese citizens began criticizing the response to the earthquake online , the government 's internet police made their presence known .
On one message board , posters started criticizing large China - based corporations for not contributing enough to the relief effort .
The thread grew heated this week , forcing an appearance from Jing Jing and Cha Cha – those two adorable animated characters that China began deploying on online forums last year , whenever the conversation strays too close to discouraged topics or sentiments .
" Do n't accept vulgar content , " advised the smiling cartoon cops overlaid on the post .
" Advance harmony . "

In this study by the Urban Institute , punks freshly graduated from college and paid about $ 30,000 per year were found to be more effective as schoolteachers than experienced union members who draw $ 80,000 of taxpayer blood for their 9 months of work each year .
Can it be that experience is worthless ?
I have taught classes from a pre-existing syllabus using a proven textbook .
The very first time that I did the class , I worked a bit harder than I would have in subsequent classes , but probably managed to be 85 percent as effective as I could possibly have been .
I have taught classes where I was one of the textbook authors and a designer of the syllabus .
In this case , experience teaching was hugely valuable and resulted in massive changes to the syllabus , course structure , and textbook ( fortunately online in HTML format and thus easily changed ) .
If public school teachers do n’t write or choose their textbooks , it might not make any sense to pay experienced teachers more than beginners .
http://www.cpsd.us/Web/HR/2008CTA_UnitA_Salary.pdf shows the salaries for the Cambridge Public Schools , some of the least effective in Massachusetts as measured by student achievement tests .
A 22 - year - old with a bachelor ’s earns $ 41,000 for 9 months .
A teacher with 11 years in the system would earn $ 69,000 .
That 11 - year veteran who picked up online master ’s and Ph.D. degrees in education would earn $ 81,500 ( presumably there is no evidence to support the theory that a degree from University of Phoenix makes someone a better teacher ) .
If we wanted to spend the same amount of money every year , maybe it would be smarter simply to pay all teachers the same salary , e.g. , $ 60,000 for 9 months of work .
We would thereby attract a more able class of young college graduates and if after 7 years they got sick of the job they would n’t be tempted to stay because their salary was due to go up so dramatically .
Searching on Google can be a magical experience once you find out how to make your search queries efficient .
By making efficient I mean using some tricks or the cheat sheet provided by Google itself to quickly find what you actually require .
Having being hooked onto Google for a long time now , I have come across some amazing search tricks which can change the way you look at Google today .
In this article I will list down the search tricks which I use quite frequently .
Be it finding time , meanings or watching the cricket score , searching PDF ’s , with Google as the search engine life cannot be more simpler .
Here are the 10 most amazing Google Search tricks :
1. Different Types of Files at your will
How many times would you have asked for materials ( PDF , PPT , DOC ) for a particular topic from a friend ?
Its almost everyday that we might have the necessity to ask them either for knowledge , preparing a presentation , white - paper or for case studies .
Such times it mostly difficult to look out what to exactly search for because most of the times you do n’t know about the topic at hand .
But this petty keyword unleashes its lethal power at such occasions .
Let ’s say I want to implement a case study on SOA which means I have to read a lot of information for SOA .
So I just have to find materials which might have already been uploaded on the web in the form of PDF ’s , DOC ’s or PPT’s .
These materials can be easily obtained by doing a search for :
2. Scholarly Search
If you want some authenticity of the materials then it would be better to find the materials from educational institutes or universities .
For this use the Google scholar search .
But suppose you do n’t like to switch to Google scholar search you can add the same query with an additional parameter to the normal Google search box ,
3 . Meanings of any word in an instant
Now you do not have to carry a dictionary or install a dictionary software just for the purpose of finding out a meaning of a word .
With the wealth of information in Google ’s hands , its a piece of cake to find out the meaning of the word .
Just use the define : keyword .
The meaning would of course be displayed but also a set of other links which might have an alternative definition are also given out with the link to read more about it .
You would argue here that , a dicitionary gives out more information than this .
But what about words that do n’t actually fall within the vocabulary .
Suppose you want to know what SOA ( Service Oriented Architecture ) is then you would have no choice .
Google Search comes to your rescue in this case ,
4 . Find the time of any location
Many of us might be probably working for client which are based at different locations .
And communication has to be carried out frequently carried out in such cases .
But before a communication you have to know which time zone the location is falling into otherwise you would be causing a disturbance .
I have seen people installing time zone software for showing the time of the location they would be calling to .
But with Google at your hands you do n’t have to install any software .
It would be just simple to use a query for finding the current time such as ,
psst ….look closely the time on the little clock graphic .
It also shows the perfect time !
5 . Weather at your fingertips
I had been to GOA for a Christmas vacation in the last week of December .
But I made a mistake of not finding out the temperature of GOA before leaving .
Had I known that it is hot even in the winter I would not have made the mistake of carrying additional luggage consisting of blankets and jackets .
If you are thinking to visit a place it is useful to know what the temperature of the place is before hand , it can make efficient packing .
Google helps you here too .
Just use this query without asking anybody or waiting for the news to make a weather report .
I wish I had thought of this !
6 . Google does live commentary too !
Indians are cricket fanatics .
But its amusing to see the organizations here trying to put together tactics to devoid cricket lovers from wasting time to watch the cricket scores instead of doing their work .
What I think they fail to understand is that by blocking the live cricket scoring sites they are actually making the employees more curios and provoking them to hunt for proxy networks or listen to the radio or chat with their friends elsewhere .
Jokes apart , you actually do n’t need proxy networks to view the live cricket scores if you at least have access to Google .
If you want to find the latest info about all the cricket matches then just type ,
But if you want to find out only about a particular match then use only the names of the two playing nations ,
Remember that the scorecard will come only when the play is going on .
7. Calculate with your browser
Every OS has a calculator inbuilt but when the browser is the thing which is constantly open whey bother to open up a calculator .
Open Google and straight away type your mathematical expression .
You can go all the way from basic arithmetic to trigonometrical expressions .
This is simply amazing stuff accomplished by Google .
8. Compare your currency with others
Now that the dollar is declining , the rest of the world must be busy trying to check the impact of the dollar on their currencies .
But first of all one must know how much a particular currency amounts to when cashed in another currency .
Google ’s inbuilt currency converter just does this .
9 . Keep track of the stocks
With the booming stock market it is very important to track the stocks on a day to day basis .
Putting a stock ticker in the search box is the most obvious thing you would think of .
But it is not always you would remember the stock ticker , you should add the keyword “ stocks : ” to the company name .
The best part of the obtained result is that it provides a chart which shows the trend in the company ’s stock along with important statistics .
Note : Currently the results are restricted to the companies listed in the US stock markets .
10 . Wanna find some faces ?
This is most interesting trick .
You might be needing images for various occasions and searching for images is the most difficult thing because what we expect might not be possibly mapped to a query .
But Google has a parameter in place for images in situations we need an image which describes a face .
Suppose I search for the term “ happy ” then the Google results page displays smileys .
But I would like to use images of happy people .
Even if I choose the term as “ happy face ” the results do n’t show images which contain people .
For this there is a parameter “ imgtype ” which you can use with the URL .
For this put in the URL as follows :
There are many more variations which can be bought about with the above tricks thus making your search experience not only enriching but also exciting .
If I have missed any tricks of common usage , feel free to mention it .

12,000 teenagers sitting their UK High School ( GCSE ) music exam last week had an advantage previous student did n’t have , all the answers were printed on the back .
Reuters reports that the error was only notice after the exam had been sat , but wo n’t be forcing students to resit the exam because less than 5 % of students noticed the answers .
According to a spokesman “ All exam papers have a copyright statement dealing with source material on the back page … This one in particular had more detail than is usual in a music paper . ”
So far there has only been 20 queries on the results from teachers , with officials noting that students may not have been able to recognize the answers .
We say the UK education system has failed if students ca n’t spot the answers to an exam sitting right in front of them .

Mayan apocalypse , 2012
If you observe the ancient Mayan calendar , then your time 's running out .
Dr Karl has been rummaging through ancient Mayan scribblings that are said to indicate an apocalyptic end by 2012 .
The driver was taking me from Melbourne airport into the city .
As we chatted , it came out that he was deeply worried .
He had a wife and child , and a new baby on the way - but what was the use of living , he cried , if the world would end in 2012 as predicted by the Mayan prophecies , when his new baby would be just four years old .
Prophecies about the end of the world ( or at the very least , civilisation as we know it ) have been around forever .
There was a flurry of them around 2000 AD , and another bunch for 5 May 2005 , when all the planets were supposed to line up .
( By the way , they did n't line up and yep , we 're still here . )
The Mayan civilisation covered the skinny bit of the Americas between North and South America , reaching from the southern states of Mexico down to western Honduras .
Its Classic Period was from 250 to 900 AD , so their best years were behind them by the time of the Spanish invasion .
At their peak , the Mayans had the only mature written language ever found in the Americas , spectacular and densely populated cities , and very sophisticated systems of mathematics , astronomy and calendars .
They were marvelous astronomers , showing what could be done with the naked eye .
Their measurements of the lunar month , the period of Venus and the year were more accurate than those of the Ancient Greeks .
Which brings us to the calendar that predicts the end of the world in 2012 .
The Mayans had many calendars , because they saw ' time ' as a meshing of sacred or spiritual cycles .
So while our Gregorian calendar organises days for social , administrative and commercial purposes , the Mayan calendars added a religious element .
For example , each day had a patron spirit , and so could be good for travel , but bad for business .
One of their several calendars was called the Long Count .
It was set up around 355 BCE , and had as its chosen starting date 0.0.0.0.0 , which corresponds to 11 August 3114 BCE .
And on 21 December 2012 , the Mayan Long Count calendar will read 13.0.0.0.0 .
Now here 's how it works .
Our numbering system is based on 10 .
But the Mayans had a counting system based on 20 , so most of the ' slots ' in their calendar had 20 potential numbers ( 0 to 19 ) .
The calendar read a little like the odometer in your car 's speedo ( which run from 0 to 9 ) .
The extreme right slot ( of five slots ) would count through the days , and when it got to 19 days ( 0.0.0.0.19 ) would reset to zero , and the next slot across to the left would increase by one ( to 0.0.0.1.0 ) .
So 0.0.0.0.1 was one day , and 0.0.0.1.0 was 20 days .
Then 0.0.1.0.0 was about one year , 0.1.0.0.0 was about 20 years and with 1.0.0.0.0 , you 've clocked up about 400 years .
And on 21 December 2012 , the Mayan Long Count calendar will read 13.0.0.0.0 .
By the way , the time between 0.0.0.0.0 and 13.0.0.0.0 is about 5126 years .
Now some Mayan archaeo - astronomers reckon that the calendar should reset back to zero and start again .
But others disagree and say it should continue to 20 , and then reset again .
We do n't have enough information to know who is correct - but if it does go up to 20 , then this completely destroys the End of Days Conspiracy Theory , as far as the year 2012 is concerned .
But let 's stick to the 13 Conspiracy for the time being .
The claims for 21 December 2012 cover a lot of ground .
They range from ' nuclear holocaust ' to ' Harmonic Convergence of cosmic energy flowing through the earth , cleansing it and raising it to a higher level of vibration ' , and along the way they include ' the death of two - thirds of humanity ' and ' the north and south poles will split ' - you get the picture .
But there are two problems with this .
First , when a calendar comes to the end of a cycle , it just rolls over into the next cycle .
In our Western society , every year 31 December is followed , not by the End of the World , but by 1 January .
So 13.0.0.0.0 in the Mayan calendar will be followed by 0.0.0.0.1 - or good - ol ' 22 December 2012 , with only a few shopping days left to Christmas .
And the second problem is that it is always remarkably difficult to make predictions , especially about the future , and things that have n't happened yet .

After Barack Obama ‘s brilliant , moving speech ( video ) on the issue of race in politics and America , I was interested to see what sort of coverage he’d be getting at the major news outlets .
Here ’s what the genius brigade at CNN decided to run with :
This headline was quickly retracted in favor of one that far more accurately captured the spirit of the speech :
Ah , sweet , sweet main stream media .
Good job .

Good news for college liberals everywhere .
There has been a recent spree of hate speech and hate crime hoaxes , leading experts to think that the figures for hate crimes in the past few years in colleges around America are exaggerated , sometimes greatly .
Here 's a few amusing incidents :
In the midst of an antirape rally in the University of Massachusetts , a woman cut herself with a knife , tossed it under a car , and claimed to have been sexually assaulted .
After a month of bluffing , she admitted she was making the whole thing up .
In the same school , one female student claimed to have fought off three male attackers after being hit with a pepper - like substance .
Doubts about her ability to run after being hit by mace forced her to confess .
It was the fourth incident that year .
What do you expect out of Massachusetts ?
In the University of Iowa , for three weeks black students were " terrorized " by bomb threats , emails , and piles of red noodles left at their doors , suggesting that those were the " brains " of the blacks .
After a bit of investigation , a black female , one Tarsha Michelle Claiborne , was arrested .
Two weeks after the murder of Matthew Sheppard ( a horrible tragedy , I admit ) , a lesbian in the University of Minnesota claimed that she was assaulted by two anti-gay men .
The outraged students raised rewards ( around $ 12,000 ) for their arrests , but it turned out she faked it .
Similar fakes were reported around the country , including New Mexico .
In North Carolina 's Guilford College , the president of the student senate , one Molly Martin , claimed that she was assaulted and then had " nigger lover " scrawled on her chest .
She then immediately demanded that the school install a full - time African - American Affairs director .
The police dropped the case , because she was a " reluctant " witness , in addition to refusing to disclose to them the details of the " attack " .
She then dropped out , apologizing for " inappropriate acts " , but refusing to explain what they were .
Not that it mattered , the school installed the position .
There are plenty more .
While it seems to be a new trend , college authorities were denying this .
In addition , convictions are extremely rare .
Two black students , accused of posting KKK fliers in the University of Ohio , despite having had their fingerprints on 42 of the 55 posters , were acquitted by " insufficent evidence " .
Even more amusing was the dismissive attitude the administrapo and the faculty had towards these hoaxes .
Most common excuses was " it does n't matter if they were true or not , the discrimination is very true and occurs regularly " .
They also praised the liars , for bringing attention to the racist and sexist issues in American colleges .
Good job for encouraging the trend they do n't claim to exist .
I wonder if the Cornell Progressive newspaper would choose to print this article .
I doubt it .
Oh well .
If I want to publish it , I would go to the Cornell Review , which is , in all facets , a superior piece of journalism .
Or perhaps it is n't such a new trend .
See Cornell ' 69 : Liberalism and the Crisis of the American University .
You might find it interesting because it was a true event .
Bah !
I can't even crack a joke on the overwhelmingly liberal population of Massachusetts ?
While it 's OK to bash China day and night , over whatever issue that comes to the minds of the liberal media ?
Fine .
I 'll make fun of NYC next time .
Or perhaps California .
OK ?

Short Changed
9/11 conspiracism is dragging activists away from the real issues
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 6th February 2007
There is a virus sweeping the world .
It infects opponents of the Bush government , sucks their brains out through their eyes and turns them into gibbering idiots .
First cultivated in a laboratory in the United States , the strain reached these shores a few months ago .
In the past fortnight it has become an epidemic .
Scarcely a day now passes without someone possessed by this sickness , eyes rolling , lips flecked with foam , trying to infect me .
The disease is called Loose Change .
It is a film made by three young men which airs most of the standard conspiracy theories about the attacks of September 11 2001 .
Unlike the other 9/11 conspiracy films , Loose Change is sharp and swift , with a thumping soundtrack , slick graphics and a calm and authoritative voiceover .
Its makers claim that it has now been watched by 100 million people .
The Pentagon , the film maintains , was not hit by a commercial airliner .
There was “ no discernable trace ” of a plane found in the wreckage , and the entrance and exit holes in the building were far too small .
It was hit by a Cruise missile .
The twin towers were brought down by means of “ a carefully planned controlled demolition ” .
You can see the small puffs of smoke caused by explosives just below the cascading sections .
All other hypotheses are implausible : the fire was not hot enough to melt steel and the towers fell too quickly .
Building 7 was destroyed by the same means a few hours later .
Flight 93 did not crash , but was redirected to Cleveland Airport , where the passengers were taken into a NASA building and never seen again .
Their voices had been cloned by the Los Alamos laboratories and used to make fake calls to their relatives .
The footage of Osama Bin Laden , claiming responsibility for the attacks , was faked .
The US government carried out this great crime for four reasons : to help Larry Silverstein , who leased the towers , to collect his insurance money ; to assist insider traders betting on falling airline stocks ; to steal the gold in the basement ; and to grant George Bush new executive powers , so that he could carry out his plans for world domination .
Even if you have seen or read no other accounts of 9/11 , and your brain has not yet been liquidised , a few problems must occur to you .
The first is the complete absence of scientific advice .
At one point the presenter asks “ So what brought down the Twin Towers ?
Let ’s ask the experts . ”
But they do n’t ask the experts .
The film makers take some old quotes , edit them to remove any contradictions , then denounce all subsequent retractions as further evidence of conspiracy .
The only people they interview are a janitor , a group of firemen and a flight instructor .
They let the janitor speak at length , but cut the firemen off in mid-sentence .
The flight instructor speaks in short clips , which give the impression that his pupil , the hijacker Hani Hanjour , was incapable of hitting the Pentagon .
Elsewhere he has said the opposite : he had “ no doubt ” that Hanjour could have done it ( 1 ) .
Where are the structural engineers , the materials scientists , the specialists in ballistics , explosives or fire ?
The film makers now say that the third edition of the film will be fact - checked by an expert , but he turns out to be “ a theology professor ” ( 2 ) .
They do n’t name him , but I would bet that it ’s David Ray Griffin , who also happens to be the high priest of the 9/11 conspiracists .
The next evident flaw is that the plot they propose must have involved tens of thousands of people .
It could not have been executed without the help of demolition experts , the security firms guarding the World Trade Centre , Mayor Giuliani ( who hastily disposed of the remains ) , much of the US Air Force , the Federal Aviation Administration and the North American Aerospace Defense Command , the relatives of the people “ killed ” in the plane crashes , the rest of the Pentagon ’s staff , the Los Alamos laboratories , the FBI , the CIA and the investigators who picked through the rubble .
If there is one universal American characteristic it is a confessional culture which permits no one with a good story to keep his mouth shut .
People appear on the Jerry Springer Show to admit to carnal relations with their tractors .
Yet none of the participants in this monumental crime has sought to blow the whistle – before , during or after the attacks .
No one has volunteered to tell the greatest story ever told .
Read some conflicting accounts , and Loose Change ’s case crumbles faster than the Twin Towers .
Hundreds of people saw a plane hit the Pentagon .
Because it collided with one of the world ’s best - defended buildings at full speed , the plane was pulverised : even so , both plane parts and body parts were in fact recovered .
The wings and tail disintegrated when they hit the wall , which is why the holes were n’t bigger ( 3 ) .
The failure of the Twin Towers has been exhaustively documented by the National Institute of Standards and Technology .
Far from being impossible , the collapse turns out to have been inevitable .
The planes cut some of the support columns and ignited fires sufficient to weaken ( but not melt ) the remaining steel structures .
As the perimeter columns buckled , the weight of the collapsing top stories generated a momentum the rest of the building could not arrest .
Puffs of smoke were blown out of the structure by compression as the building fell ( 4 ) .
Counterpunch , the radical leftwing magazine , commissioned its own expert – an aerospace and mechanical engineer – to test the official findings ( 5 ) .
He shows that the institute must have been right .
He also demonstrates how Building 7 collapsed .
Burning debris falling from the twin towers ruptured the oil pipes feeding its emergency generators .
The reduction in pressure triggered the automatic pumping system , which poured thousands of gallons of diesel onto the fire .
The support trusses weakened and buckled and the building imploded ( 6 ) .
Popular Mechanics magazine polled 300 experts and came to the same conclusions ( 7 ) .
So the critics – even Counterpunch – are labelled co-conspirators , and the plot expands until it comes to involve a substantial part of the world ’s population .
There is no reasoning with this madness .
People believe Loose Change because it proposes a closed world : comprehensible , controllable , small .
Despite the great evil which runs it , it is more companionable than the chaos which really governs our lives , a world without destination or purpose .
This neat story draws campaigners away from real issues – global warming , the Iraq war , nuclear weapons , privatisation , inequality – while permanently wrecking their credibility .
Bush did capitalise on the attacks , and he did follow a pre-existing agenda , spelt out , as Loose Change says , by the Project for a New American Century .
But by drowning this truth in an ocean of nonsense , the conspiracists ensure that it can never again be taken seriously .
The film ’s greatest flaw is this : the men who made it are still alive .
If the US government is running an all - knowing , all - encompassing conspiracy , why did it not snuff them out long ago ?
There is only one possible explanation .
They are in fact agents of the Bush regime , employed to distract people from its real abuses of power .
This , if you are inclined to believe such stories , is surely a more plausible theory than the one proposed in Loose Change .

Hillary calls for an Olympics boycott ?
April 7 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
rumor has it that this story is brewing :
EXCLUSIVE
4/7/08 11:22:13 ET : HILLARY CALLS ON BUSH TO BOYCOTT OLYMPICS OPENING ... DEVELOPING ...
really ? on the day before the San Francisco protests ?
right after the disruptive protests in London and Paris ?
and I thought the Clinton campaign pretended to ditch Penn for just this kind of divisive thing …
ABC News notes :
… Clinton ’s call for a boycott specifically cites China ’s reaction to recent violence in Tibet and inaction in Darfur .
“ The violent clashes in Tibet and the failure of the Chinese government to use its full leverage with Sudan to stop the genocide in Darfur are opportunities for Presidential leadership , ” Clinton said in a written statement .
“ These events underscore why I believe the Bush administration has been wrong to downplay human rights in its policy towards China .
At this time , and in light of recent events , I believe President Bush should not plan on attending the opening ceremonies in Beijing , absent major changes by the Chinese government . ”
… Clinton did not call for an outright boycott of the Olympics in general , targeting only the Opening Ceremony .

Federal judges in Massachusetts have begun ordering the release of prisoners convicted of crack cocaine offenses , responding to a government decision to retroactively reduce the harsh penalties for using and selling that particular form of the drug .
Up to 30 could be affected .
Since Feb. 6 , judges have reduced by 15 to 33 months the sentences of at least three Massachusetts inmates imprisoned for crack offenses .
As a result , two who have already exceeded the shortened sentences will be freed March 3 , the first day prisoners are eligible for lightened punishments for crack - related crimes .
A third is expected to be released in June .
In one case , US District Judge William G. Young criticized the US Sentencing Commission for failing to implement the new sentencing structure right away when it voted on Dec. 11 to make the lessened penalties retroactive for some 19,500 federal prisoners nationwide .
" The failure of the Commission immediately to implement its solution to the ' fundamental unfairness ' in the way crack cocaine offenders were treated under the previous version of the guidelines . . . virtually guarantees that some defendants . . . will spend more time in prison than they should have , " Young wrote Tuesday .
Young said one convicted crack dealer , Carlos Gagot , would be finished with his sentence as a result of a 33 - month reduction at the request of the defense and government .
But the judge said he was pow erless to free Gagot immediately .
Still , Gagot " ought not spend one more day in prison than necessary " and should be freed March 3 , Young wrote .
Miriam Conrad - head of the federal public defender agency in Boston , which represented the three defendants whose releases have been ordered - said her office has come up with a list of at least 27 other inmates who may be eligible for sentence reductions .
" I 'm getting letters from prisoners on a daily basis , " she said .
An analysis by the US Sentencing Commission , which voted unanimously Dec. 11 to lighten punishments retroactively for some crack offenses , said 91 prisoners convicted in federal courts in Massachusetts will be eligible through 2012 to seek reductions of sentences imposed for selling or possessing crack .
But Conrad said she believes the number could be much higher than 91 .
Christina DiIorio- Sterling - a spokeswoman for US Attorney Michael J. Sullivan , whose office agreed to all three sentence reductions - said many factors will determine how prosecutors treat such applications .
" In general , there will be some offenders for whom early release may be appropriate , given the reduction in sentencing as mandated by the changes in the guidelines , " she said .
Advocates for such offenders were buoyed by the first reductions in sentences to take place as a result of the government 's effort to reduce the stark disparity between punishments for crimes involving crack cocaine and those involving cocaine powder .

Contributors
The original Abella system was designed and implemented by Andrew Gacek , who also developed its logical foundations in collaboration with Dale Miller and Gopalan Nadathur .
The extension of Abella to include a richer specification logic starting from version 2.0.0 was carried out by Yuting Wang ( UMN ) and Kaustuv Chaudhuri ( INRIA ) .
A number of people have contributed to the design and the library of examples in Abella .
The following are some of the main contributors , listed in alphabetical order .
David Baelde ( ENS Cachan ) Dale Miller ( INRIA and LIX / Ecole Polytechnique ) Gopalan Nadathur ( UMN ) Alwen Tiu ( ANU ) Todd Wilson ( CSU Fresno )
History The Abella system represents a collaboration between a group at the University of Minnesota led by Gopalan Nadathur and the Parsifal team at INRIA Saclay – Île - de - France and LIX / Ecole Polytechnique led by Dale Miller .
Work on Abella began as part of an NSF - funded project at the University of Minnesota aimed at developing flexible frameworks for specifying , prototyping and reasoning about computational processes .
Gopalan Nadathur provided guidance in the design of that version of Abella and he and Dale Miller contributed to the specific logic that Abella is based on .
The recent extension of Abella to support a richer specification logic has been the result of a transatlantic collaboration supported by the Recent Advances in Proof Theory ( RAPT ) Associated Team , led by Kaustuv Chaudhuri ( INRIA , France ) ; international participants of this team include a group at McGill University ( Canada ) led by Brigitte Pientka and a group at the University of Minnesota ( USA ) led by Gopalan Nadathur .
Work on this extension at the University of Minnesota has been supported by the NSF under the grants CCF - 0917140 and OISE - 1045885 .
As a part of this effort , Yuting Wang designed and implemented the extension to higher - order hereditary Harrop formulas as the specification language .
Subsequent work , carried out by Gopalan Nadathur and Yuting Wang and supported by the NSF Grant CCF - 1617771 , has resulted in the addition of a form of schematic polymorphism to Abella .
The reasoning logic underlying Abella builds on the previous work of several people , most prominently Alwen Tiu , Dale Miller and Raymond McDowell .
Work on Abella has benefited from several comments and encouragement provided by Alwen Tiu and David Baelde who have also been amongst the first users of the system .
Todd Wilson has created several large developments in Abella and has incorporated its use into some of his graduate courses ; his resulting feedback has been invaluable for increasing the usability and robustness of the system .
Funding Work on Abella was funded in its early stages by a grant from Boston Scientific .
Subsequent funding has been provided by the National Science Foundation through the Grants CCR - 0429572 , CCF - 0917140 , OISE - 1045885 , and CCF - 1617771 .
The first two NSF grants also included supplementary funding from the OISE for Slimmer , an international collaborative project between the University of Minnesota and the Parsifal group at Ecole Polytechnique and INRIA , France .
Support for the French portion of this collaboration has been provided by a sequence of Associated Team grants from INRIA .

Cloud services for big data applications is certainly something that brings a number of impressive benefits to the table .
Choosing the right cloud services for your specific big data applications can be challenging , particularly if you are just beginning to work with big data applications , or if you are only now starting to explore the full potential offered through cloud services .
To be sure , choosing the right cloud services for your big data endeavors can be a difficult venture .
There are a couple of reasons as to why this is the case .
Nonetheless , there are still some basic factors that can help you to figure out the optimal services for what you want to accomplish .
Your considerations need to keep both short - term and long - term needs in mind , but that is really just the beginning .
The Challenges Of Choosing Cloud Services
One of the biggest problems with assessing Cloud Service Providers is the fact that we do n’t really have a common framework to guide us .
This makes things difficult enough , but this is compounded by a realization that no two providers are exactly alike .
Not to mention the fact that we have n’t seen many reviews of CSP options like you might find for other business services such as the top website builders or web hosts on a site like theblogstarter.com .
Picking one that ’s right for your company and goals can be difficult .
However , it certainly is n’t impossible .
We can take a look at some of your major options for a Cloud Service Provider .
We can also discuss a few essentials that should be kept in mind , as you consider the CSP options that are available to you .
Factors To Consider When Choosing Cloud Service Providers
Your business is defined by unique elements / characteristics , as well as a wide range of short - term and long - term objectives .
Keep those things in mind , as you consider some of the major factors that define the various CSPs out there .
Combine a deep understanding of your company , as well as what you need , with some of the general factors to remember , while searching for a CSP :
Security : Defining your security goals is one of the first , and perhaps most important , considerations with choosing a cloud service provider .
Put those goals against the measures that will be offered to you by each provider .
Add to all of this by researching the mechanisms that will be utilized to preserve your applications , data , and anything else .
Industry requirements and regulatory requirements should be kept in mind , as you consider the detailed , elaborate questions you should develop , in regards to whether or not a CSP will be able to protect your information on your terms .
Compliance :
What are the compliance standards relevant to your company and industry ?
The architecture platforms of cloud providers should be able to help you make sure those needs are being met .
Moving your information to a cloud service provider , whether that is public or private ( more on that later ) , means making sure your applications / data are in full compliance with the standards of your industry / business .
Architecture :
This is another crucial element to the decision - making process .
What you ultimately need to do is understand how the architecture of a provider needs to gel with the workflows that define your business .
This is something you must keep in mind for not only the present , but for the future , as well .
Manageability : Different cloud platforms are going to have different demands , in terms of what you are going to be expected to manage .
Orchestration features can vary from one provider to the next , and you will also want to understand how these tools integrate with other services that are being offered .
Do you work with services that are of particular significance to your organization ?
If the answer is yes , then make sure you are working with a provider that will allow for straightforward integration , when the time comes .
Barring that , make sure your company is willing and capable of working with an alternative that might be offered by a provider of interest .
Service levels :
If your business has very particular guidelines with regards to availability , response times , capacities , and support , then you will have to take this factor very seriously .
Most businesses need to take those things to heart , so it is vital that your company and the service provider is bound to contractual , legally - enforceable relationship .
In the event that something goes wrong , you want to be sure your legal standing is secure .
Customer support :
This is something that defines most of the professional relationships we seek out .
In the event of an emergency , a concern , or even just a question , are you going to get the customer support you need ?
Furthermore , are you going to receive that support in a timely fashion ?
If you need more than a chat feature , or a phone number that could keep you on the phone with a receptionist for far too long , then you will want to make sure you are trusting a company that will meet your support needs .
Costs :
The sticker price is obviously important , but make sure you are also aware of any associated costs that may come up .
If you have a small business , it stands to reason that you do not have a massive budget to fritter away on unexpected expenses .
Public Or Private Cloud Services ?
The choice between public and private cloud services is n’t going to be that difficult .
Unless you have a massive data center , private really is n’t an option that you need to worry about .
Furthermore , private cloud services represent a significant amount of work unto themselves .
We are talking about an addition to your business in which you will be wholly responsible for management , maintenance , and making sure the data centers are being properly updated on a consistent basis .
While private gives you perhaps the strongest element of security possible , and while it is unlikely you will ever have to share any resources with other groups , public is just more rational solution for most businesses out there .
Thankfully , when it comes to cloud service options , you wo n’t be disappointed by the possibilities available to you .
There are some excellent cloud service providers out there .
The challenge on your end will be to find one that fits your needs .
A Few Of Your Cloud Service Options
In terms of cloud service options , you certainly have a lot of providers to choose from .
While we ca n’t give you comprehensive looks at all of them , we can touch on a few of the major providers out there .
Obviously , you are going to want to do a great deal of research into any provider you come across :
Microsoft : For a number of reasons , Microsoft remains the best public cloud service provider to be found anywhere .
All three layers of the cloud are well - represented here , and you are also getting a provider with a powerhouse reputation for customer support and security .
Amazon : Another large name with an equally - impressive reputation .
Cloud services are one of the few areas in which Amazon is n’t the absolute biggest , but you are still talking about a name that offers customers a considerable range of software to work with .
IBM : Believe it or not , but IBM stands in the present as one of the biggest and most respected cloud providers in the world .
You can count on IBM to have all three layers of the cloud represented ( IaaS , PaaS , SaaS ) , and you can also expect a company that has proven it can delivery manageability and more to a wide range of customers .
Salesforce : While Salesforce struggles somewhat for relevancy with IaaS , this is still one of the top providers going today .
More often than not , they have been able to meet the needs of customers from all backgrounds .
SAP : Utilizing HANA technology , SAP has become a key figure in the battle of the cloud service providers .
SAP has also become a key figure in developing beneficial relationships with companies like Amazon .
They continue to impress tech experts and insiders the world over .
Which Cloud Service Provider Is Right For You ?
All of the above is not going to give you everything you need , as you search for the best possible cloud provider .
However , by keeping all of the above in mind , you will be in a much better position to research these providers and subjects further .
You are ultimately looking for a provider that will work with you to maintain your crucial data and applications .
A comprehensive analysis of your company ’s requirements is the next step you are going to take .
This is going to be the foundation that gives you the ability to understand what each provider is going to be to offer you .
You should also keep in mind that you are not just looking for short - term solutions in this arena .
You are looking for a provider that will be able to continue to meet your needs , even as your business continues to evolve .
Through a detailed analysis of your requirements , you may discover needs / considerations that were n’t even touched upon here .
We ca n’t stress enough that with cloud service providers , your needs can be wildly different from the needs of another company .
This can even hold true for companies that work within similar industries .
As you consider your needs from a cloud service provider , do n’t skimp on the details .
7 New Construction Technologies and How They ’re Transforming the Industry
Construction is still booming in the US , and it ’s predicted to keep growing for years to come .
As demand grows , construction industry experts look to technology to help them meet expectations .
What new construction technologies are changing the landscape ?
You might be surprised to learn everything from drones to AI are changing construction .
Check out these seven to see what ’s in store for the construction industry .
1. AI Lets Construction Companies Build Smarter
AI and machine learning are the most - talked about new technologies in construction .
There ’s good reason for that .
Construction companies are using the Internet of Things to collect more data .
This data can be used to teach machines and let them “ learn . ”
As machines collect more information , they learn more .
That lets them make better predictions and smarter decisions .
All self - driving vehicles work on AI and machine learning .
Autonomous vehicles are becoming more popular at construction sites .
They can reduce waste and the potential for error and injury .
As these machines become more sophisticated , they ’ll become more common on job sites .
2. Robot Workers and Drones Get the Job Done
We already talked about autonomous vehicles .
They ’re not the only new vehicular construction technologies .
Drones are popular for their ability to track worksites and send data .
Drones are faster and more accurate when surveying land or assessing structural damage .
What ’s more is that they can complete these tasks without a human setting foot on site .
This can reduce the risk of injury , as some sites may not be safe human workers .
Using drones can help keep people safer .
Robot workers may also be able to reduce worker injuries .
They can take on repetitive and strenuous tasks .
Although robots are only beginning to be tested , they show plenty of promise .
Already , they can help make building faster , smarter , and safer .
3. Many New Construction Technologies Are “ Smart ”
You ’ve probably heard about all kinds of smart technologies .
There are smart speakers and smart homes .
It should n’t come as any surprise that smart technologies are also appearing in the construction industry .
Their application is a little different though .
Smart bricks are one example .
Smart roads are another .
Using Internet of Things technology and sensors , smart roads make driving both greener and safer .
Some smart roads can even generate their own electricity to power lighting .
4. BIM and Software Make an Impact
Not all construction technology ends up at the job site .
In fact , plenty of technology is used behind the scenes , before workers even break ground on a project .
Construction software is always improving .
Better , more powerful software allows for better modeling and prototyping .
Newer programs also help speed up projects and streamline the project timeline .
Construction IT services are also key to completing projects on time .
Finally , building information modeling , or BIM , is more popular than ever .
BIM software includes actionable information within 3D models .
This allows for for improved field communication and more .
BIM goes beyond the construction phase of a project , though .
The information stored in the model can be used to help with ongoing maintenance .
It also makes it easier to complete renovations long after the build is complete .
With so much information at your fingertips , it ’s easier to build smarter .
5. 3D Printing Changes Prefabricated Buildings
Now let ’s look at the technologies for building itself .
Building technology has been embracing the idea of prefabrication more whole - heartedly .
Prefab is nothing new in the construction world .
What is new is the technologies that make it happen .
The advent of 3D printing has heralded an enormous change .
It ’s now possible to print entire pieces of buildings or even whole buildings .
Once these pieces or buildings are printed , they can be transported to the building site .
The pieces can be put together and the final project completed in short order .
Obviously , 3D printing streamlines the project schedule .
It can also reduce waste .
It also allows for modular construction .
Like prefabrication , modular construction is nothing new .
Modular constructions allow builders to swap out various pieces to construct new buildings .
The timelines are reduced and waste is streamlined using this method of construction .
6. New Materials Make Buildings Safer and Stronger
There ’s some fairly futuristic technology going into building materials themselves .
A great example is self - healing concrete .
This material can heal itself , which reduces the need for repairs and renovations .
Another example is transparent aluminum .
This material is much stronger than glass and wo n’t shatter .
In fact , it ’s bullet - proof .
This material could replace glass in windows and doors .
This is particularly important for buildings that need improved safety or durability .
Say goodbye to shattered windows and hello to sunshine .
Another innovation is aerogel insulation .
Despite being almost weightless , this fabric makes an amazing insulation material .
It ’s much more effective than fiberglass and foam insulation .
7. Virtual and Augmented Realities Are Changing Perspectives
Last but not least are virtual and augmented reality .
Over the past few years , both VR and AR have made quite the stir in the public eye .
They ’ve been quietly adopted by many industries .
Many business leaders are just starting to realize their amazing potential .
In the construction industry , AR can be used to enhance site surveys and more .
AR technology allows more information to be available to surveyors and workers .
Elevation details or information about current weather can be available in an instant .
Having this data in hand makes it easier to make decisions in real - time .
VR ’s applications allow for real - time comparison of models to current projects .
VR is also great for training .
If you ’re trying to impress stakeholders , a virtual walk - through of the building could be key to winning the bid or getting approval .
Tomorrow ’s Technology in Today ’s Buildings
These new construction technologies are completing transforming the world of construction .
As these technologies mature , you ’ll see them on more construction sites .

Researchers at McGill University and the McGill University Health Centre ( MUHC ) have performed the world 's first totally automated administration of an anesthetic .
Nicknamed " McSleepy , " the new system developed by the researchers administers drugs for general anesthesia and monitors their separate effects completely automatically , with no manual intervention .
" We have been working on closed - loop systems , where drugs are administered , their effects continuously monitored , and the doses are adjusted accordingly , for the last 5 years , " said Dr. Thomas M. Hemmerling of McGill 's Department of Anesthesia and the Montreal General Hospital , who heads ITAG ( Intelligent Technology in Anesthesia research group ) , a team of anesthesiologists , biomedical scientists and engineers .
" Think of " McSleepy " as a sort of humanoid anesthesiologist that thinks like an anesthesiologist , analyses biological information and constantly adapts its own behavior , even recognizing monitoring malfunction . "
The anesthetic technique was used on a patient who underwent a partial nephrectomy , a procedure that removes a kidney tumor while leaving the non-cancerous part of the kidney intact , over a period of 3 hours and 30 minutes .
To manipulate the various components of general anesthesia , the automated system measures three separate parameters displayed on a new Integrated monitor of anesthesia ( IMATM ) : depth of hypnosis via EEG analysis , pain via a new pain score , called AnalgoscoreTM , and muscle relaxation via phonomyographyTM , all developed by ITAG .
The system then administers the appropriate drugs using conventional infusion pumps , controlled by a laptop computer on which " McSleepy " is installed .
Using these three separate parameters and complex algorithms , the automated system calculates faster and more precisely than a human can the appropriate drug doses for any given moment of anesthesia .
" McSleepy " assists the anesthesiologist in the same way an automatic transmission assists people when driving .
As such , anesthesiologists can focus more on other aspects of direct patient care .
An additional feature is that the system can communicate with personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) , making distant monitoring and anesthetic control possible .
In addition , this technology can be easily incorporated into modern medical teaching programs such as simulation centers and web - based learning platforms .
Anesthesia care is characterized by many biological and pharmacological parameters to monitor record and analyze .
" It will probably take two years to perfect the system , " Dr. Hemmerling said .
" Many people are reluctant to rely on automated systems , especially when they are not visible -- it is not clear what they are actually doing or how - , the fear of a ' black box ' which suddenly takes over " .
In designing " McSleepy " , we put in considerable research on the design of an interface which is clear , easy to read , resembles displays of our everyday practice but still provides a detailed clinical picture of what is going on and what has happened .
Dr. Hemmerling hopes that a commercial system might be available within the next 5 years .
Anthropologists can spend a lot of time arguing over a single bone – and if that bone is one of the few known from an early ancestor , the arguments will be all the fiercer .
When a “ big question ” is at issue , such as when our ancestors evolved the upright stance that sets us apart from the knuckle - walking apes , the stakes get higher still .
The latest ding - dong in the anthropology world centres around the oldest thigh bone in the human lineage , that of the six - million - year - old Orrorin tugenensis .
Discovered in 2000 , initial reports claimed Orrorin was bipedal , but not surprisingly , many anthropologists were not convinced by an argument advanced on the basis of a single , incomplete bone .
Now Brian Richmond of George Washington University in Washington , DC and William Jungers of Stony Brook University in New York have gained access to the Orrorin fossils in Kenya , and measured the shape of the thigh bone , which reveals posture .
Comparisons with thigh bones of other fossils , and of modern great apes , suggest that Orrorin was bipedal , they say .
Advertisement
Its thigh bone strongly resembles those of ancestors of the Homo lineage , Australopithecus and Paranthropus , upright walkers which lived between about 4 and 2 million years ago , but differs from those of modern great apes and the genus Homo .
This contradicts earlier reports that said Orrorin was more closely related to Homo than to Australopithecus , but supports the idea that it was bipedal .
“ I had expected Orrorin to look more primitive , ” says Richmond .
Orrorin retained chimp - like arms and powerful fingers that let it climb easily into trees .
But its bipedal gait “ made possible a new way of living in the environment , not used by other apes , which might have led to the great success of our lineage , ” says Richmond .
He thinks Orrorin ‘s particular walking style remained dominant for 4 million years , until the genus Homo evolved a stride that was better for long - distance walking and running .
Lining up with Richmond , anthropologist Dan Lieberman , of Harvard University , agrees that Orrorin was bipedal .
“ This is a great paper , ” he says .
The discoverers of Orrorin had suggested it was ancestral to Homo , but not to the australopithecines , which were thought to have evolved from a separate lineage .
But Richmond puts Orrorin near the base of a single lineage that led first to the australopithecines and then Homo .
Yet Tim White , an anthropologist from the University of California , Berkeley , says that although Orrorin ‘s thigh bone is “ the best current evidence ” for bipedalism six million years ago , even the new study gives only a hazy picture of how Orrorin walked compared to what we know about its descendants from their more abundant fossils .

The war in Iraq has now cost Americans countless dollars and over 4,000 American lives .
I say over 4,000 because the death toll put out by the Bush administration does not include all the American contractors that have died in the war .
There are studies that estimate the long - term costs as being anywhere from one to six trillion dollars , and the general consensus now - even among the most optimistic Bush Believers - is that the least we will end up spending in Iraq will be more than one trillion dollars .
That 's if we start pulling troops out tomorrow .
Already , not counting such expenses as continued healthcare for wounded veterans , replacing worn - out equipment , or the increase in oil prices from $ 30 per barrel in 2003 to $ 120 per barrel in 2008 , the actual appropriations for the Iraq war are currently more than $ 513 billion .
Leaving all future costs aside , and not counting those that have already accrued but have been hidden away in secret intelligence budgets and executive side - deals , let 's talk about the $ 500 billion that is on the books , the undeniable dollars that can't be covered up or disputed by even the most thirsty of Bushie kool - aid drinkers .
Most normal folks like you and I really do n't comprehend just how much money $ 500 billion is .
When we hear experts tell us that the money we have spent in Iraq would be enough to ensure healthcare for millions of Americans , we get mad and shake our heads at the stupidity of preemptive war with a country that never posed a serious , credible threat to America .
But we still do n't fully understand the massiveness of such a huge amount of cash .
I will attempt to put it in terms that do n't require an advanced degree in economics to get a clear grasp on just how much dough we have wasted on this ill - advised foray into nation - building by force of arms .
Iraq has a population of about 27 million people .
If all 27 million Iraqis were to each rob an American bank of $ 19,000 -- that would add up to $ 513 billion .
Of course , most Iraqis have no desire to rob any bank -- especially one that they would have to cross an ocean to hold up .
What Mr. Bush has told us to fear is " al - Qaeda in Iraq " , a dubious term in that there was no al - Qaeda in Iraq until we invaded , and the group is actually a home - grown club of extremists who just decided to call themselves " al - Qaeda in Iraq " .
It was the biggest gift they could have given to the Bush Administration .
Nevertheless , when cornered , administration officials and military officers have reluctantly admitted that the number of terrorists belonging to " al - Qaeda in Iraq " or any of its affiliate groups has never been more than five or six thousand people .
The rest of the people killing each other are simply Iraqis of different religious persuasions waging jihad amongst themselves in a bloody civil war over long - held prejudices .
And then there are those Iraqis who have decided to kill Americans for the very compelling reason that one or more of their family members were killed by Americans .
Most in this category simply want the American occupiers to leave their country , and have no intention of " following us home . "
So just to make it fair , we will pretend that there are ten thousand " al - Qaeda " terrorists in Iraq , an exaggeration by any estimate .
All 10,000 terrorists could have each robbed an American bank of $ 28,100 -- every single day of all five years of the war -- and that would add up to $ 513 billion .
That 's 1825 days in a row , with 10,000 terrorists stealing a combined total of $ 281 million , every single day .

From Zittrain to Aristotle in 600 words
Tony Curzon Price
March 6th 2008
Here is a picture taken during Jonathan Zittrain 's LSE lecture yesterday on ``The Future of the Net ( and how to stop it ) ' ' .
In case you can't read it or guess it , the word tattoo - projected onto JZ 's forearm is not ``open is we '' or ``CC rules '' but ``Communitarian ' ' .
When I saw the word , the memory bells started to ring .
I 'll tell you why .
The Communitarian Corner
JZ 's thesis goes roughly that the Net is in danger : the openness that allowed it to flourish sows the seeds of its closure .
Pragmatic , expert - driven communities " got things done " on the Net , all the way from the protocol stack in the Internet 's innards to its Domain Name Server ( DNS ) system to Wikipedia .
But forces of organised interests that do not play by the rules , like malware peddlers , identity thieves and spammers are allowing another army of interests --- corporate protectionists , often --- to demand centralised , authoritarian solutions .
This is the future of the Net unless we stop it .
The lecture --- and forthcoming book , I presume --- are about how we navigate the perils ahead .
First JZ 's taxonomy of organisational forms .
is where the market lives .
Polyarchical in that competition means that there are many ways of achieving almost identical ends .
Top -Down in that the control structure within the firm is pretty centrally directed ... it is also the space of federalism , where may equal units of government , each of them moderately centralised , come together to coordinate joint problems .
Is the space of most our politics -- representative democracies establish a single structure of control , with , in reality , little choice between themis where the techno - libertarians and anarchists live : each individual -- or at most small ad hoc groups -- pursues projects and purposes frequently exercising the right ( and real option ) to secede and fragment .
Pirates , and some parts of FOSS live these lives .is the home of the communitarians .
Communities coalesce around projects -- like Wikipedia -- and follow strict rules that establish hierarchies and distinctions amongst participants .
The difference between the top - down and the bottom - up hierarchies is that the top - down ones make a claim to the total organisation of affairs .
The bottom - up hierarchies emerge as ad hoc , purposive , but not totalizing .
Wikipedia is only an encyclopedia , not a way of life ... The Hierarchical / Bottom - up is often monopolistic -- there is just one Wikipedia -- and often competes with all the other quadrants .
Wikipedia runs up against Britannica , it poaches energy from the cyber - anarchists who might become contributors and it provides the sense of meaning and belonging -- or a part of it -- that is the most powerful offering of the top - down hierarchies .
Next on to how the taxonomy informs cyber -policy .
JZ thinks that we tend always to look for solutions to the problems thrown up by technology by moving to the top - left quadrant .
Monopoly tendencies in the top right ( Microsoft , Google ) tend to get moved to regulatory fixes handed - down by authority ( top left ) .
When the pirates in the bottom right undermined the business models of the music industry , the industry 's response was to try to find legal , regulatory and ``social engineering '' solutions .
JZ flashes up one of the funniest of these attempts , this one from the UK's Department of Trade and Industry report on Intellectual Property : if you can't get DRM code to work in the hardware , wire it into the brains of tomorrow 's consumers :
When Software Engineering Fails , Try Social Engineering
The same happened with PGP and the Clipper Chip and , almost , with the Domain Name system .
Similarly in our space of news - making , many people are asking how the blogosphere can be controlled , can become more responsible .
Does libel have to be tightened ?
Does anonymity , for example of wikileaks , have to be curtailed ?
JZ 's impassioned cry in the face of all these attempts to move problems into the realm of authority is to ``give communities a chance ' ' .
JZ 's view of the future of the Internet is that it will continue to be assailed by ills of various sorts , from malware to business interests protecting their old way of making bacon .
If at every turn we acquiesce and allow the top - down ``solution '' , the Internet will have demonstrated its ``self - closing '' property : the open system that shut itself down .
So there 's a real weight on the shoulders of the communitarians !
The anarchy of the bottom right does not produce much order beyond the small - scale , and is largely parasitic on other orders .
Can communities really counter a whole - sale reversion to macro-authority ?
Well , that 's a question for another post .
For now , let me just leave you with this thought .
I was listening to Alain Finkielkraut 's weekly diatribe against modernity on France Culture -- this time about the nature of the surgeon 's profession -- and as usual , he had some very telling observations and asides .
``Communities '' he started , worrying about the myth of leaderlessness in the ``new surgery , '' ` `I call them institutions .
Indeed , in many ways , I would like to say that I want institutions and not communities , with all their overtones of egalitarian communes ...''
In a way , JZ is agreeing .
The Communities that underpin the Communitarian Internet are full of rules .
They are micro-institutions .
In that respect , JZ's ``communitarian ' ' view of cyberspace connects with the 1970's and 1980 's communitarianism of MacIntyre , Sandel and Walzer : the realization of these thinkers , who started to become hard to categorize into left or right , was that institutions made values and shaped people , and the details of those institutions made good lives possible .
This marked a return to virtue ethics as the groundwork for politics .
So which code is it that makes you good ?
Not actually open source computer code , but the normative codes of institutions .
In the cyber - world , each web - site with a community around it becomes its own polis , and it is life in the polis that makes virtue and fulfillment possible .
There we go , from Z to A , Zittrain to Aristotle in 600 words .

Greetings , Concerned Citizen !
Here ’s your chance to investigate earmarks –those spending measures inserted by members of Congress into bills that direct taxpayer dollars to their pet projects .
Are members using earmarks to meet pressing needs ?
Reward political supporters ?
Are they good public policy , or vehicles for pure pork ?
Every earmark is different , and we currently have over 3,000 of them online , ready and waiting for you to dig into .
The research framework we ’re providing asks you specific questions about the recipient of the earmark and the member who sponsored it , and provides links to the sources of information you can search for answers .
You will also have an opportunity to provide additional information from your own research .
We offer some suggestions and ideas for additional information you can find , but feel free to follow your own instincts .
Okay , so you ’ve got that amazing trip to the Cotton House , that lovely leopard - print one - piece ( or that delightful coral - print number ) and the gold - and - bronze accessories that come with it — but your skin ’s as pale as a sunbeam - challenged creature of the night .
( this is in no way a dis on the vampire industry , it ’s just that a majority of people who steer clear from the sun tend to be paler )
There are tons of ways to get that lovely bronzed goddess tan , but most of them involve getting baked in the sun / tanning salon , or getting one of those expensive tan sprays .
Fortunately for us , there ’s the cheaper alternative of getting a self - tanner to get our sun - baked - brown - goodness , without the UV damage .
Plus , most of them are easily washed off , you know , so you wo n’t stand out at the latest vampire union meeting .
Here ’s a review of some of the top self - tanners for that healthy bronzed goodness !
Remember , before going ga - ga over these products , look over the labels if you ’re allergic to any of the ingredients , plus , if you ’re not too sure about the desired effect , apply a small amount ( lest you want to be a ganguro girl ; p ) on your arm to gauge the result and the amount of product you ’ll need .
Also , these products are best applied on clean , dry skin , to improve their efficacy and staying power .
Model Co Bronze Airbrush Face / Beauty Fix Airbrush Face – ( my favorite ! )
Seven words .
A little will go a long way .
This ’ll make you an instant chocolate princess !
The cool thing though is that it washes off easy , and keeps your makeup on .
It also has a nice glisten finish .
Lancôme Flash Bronzer for the Face / Flash Bronzer Shimmering Instant Tan Body –
These products give out instantaneous tint / shimmering effects for the skin , plus , they smell like tropical flowers , evoking that “ island fresh ” feeling .
The Body Collection Fabulous Fake Tan Tanning Gel –
This one spreads easily and dries quick as well , leaving you with a sun-kissed glow within an hour of application .
Perfect for when you ’re just prepping for that afternoon swim over brunch !
It also smells like coconut , so try not taste your bronze skin !
Shiseido Daily Bronze Moisturizing Emulsion –
Not only will you get that delicious golden chocolate coat over your skin , it ’ll be moisturized as well !
Which saves up space when you ’re packing for the beach , instead of carrying a separate bottle of moisturizer .
Clarins Self Tanning Instant Gel – A little too … messy for my taste , though it leaves a nice coffee smell which supplements the brown - ish blush you ’ll be sporting after applying it .
Hit up your local beauty store if you ’d like to give self - tanning a try .
They ’ll most probably be carrying these products , giving you the choice of which one to try .
While there , look for some pale pink water resistant lipstick to complement your look .
Throw in some shimmery orange eyeshadow , a dash of chocolate and lots of mascara and you ’ll be the perfect bronzed goddess in the beach !
Click to viewApparently scientists ( and some of our readers , surely ) have known that we can grow oil for years , and not in the grow - corn - make - oil kind of way .
The Brazilian Copaifera langsdorfii can be tapped ( ala maple syrup ) for a natural diesel fuel that requires only simple filtering before being poured into a truck .
( This picture is of the tree 's cells . )
The catch ?
The diesel only has a shelf - life of about 3 months .

Some interesting metrics to think about .
On a worldwide scale , it does n't seem all that impossible to alleviate oil shortages with plants ... and the natural carbon offsets seem worthwhile .
It 's just too bad these trees take 15 - 20 years to mature ( by which time we plan on flying around in a hydrogen Jetsonmobile ) .

Developers who have found our cloud computing model attractive have been asking us to be a little bit more open about what we are planning to do in the future .
To date we ’ve simply announced new additions to the Amazon Web Services lineup , with immediate beta availability at the time of announcement .
Earlier this year we started to post specifications for new features along with requests for feedback .
We did this for the Amazon S3 Copy feature and for Amazon S3 Post Support .
We received a lot of helpful feedback in both cases .
Now it is time for the next step …
I am excited to be able to tell you about an entire new feature , a feature so new that it does n’t even have a proper name , and that you ca n’t use just yet .
But you can read about it and you can start thinking about the best way to incorporate it into your system architecture .
If you have taken a close look at Amazon EC2 , you know that the instances are ephemeral .
The instances have anywhere from 160 GB to 1.7 TB of attached storage .
The storage is there as long as the instance is running , but of course it disappears as soon as the instance is shut down .
Applications with a need for persistent storage could store data in Amazon S3 or in Amazon SimpleDB , but they could n’t readily access either one as if it was an actual file system .
As you can read in our forum post , we ’ve been working on addressing this .
In the same way that your running EC2 instances , your Elastic IP addresses , your S3 buckets and your SQS queues can be thought of as items contained within the scope of your AWS account , our forthcoming persistent storage feature will give you the ability to create reliable , persistent storage volumes for use with EC2 .
Once created , these volumes will be part of your account and will have a lifetime independent of any particular EC2 instance .
These volumes can be thought of as raw , unformatted disk drives which can be formatted and then used as desired ( or even used as raw storage if you ’d like ) .
Volumes can range in size from 1 GB on up to 1 TB ; you can create and attach several of them to each EC2 instance .
They are designed for low latency , high throughput access from Amazon EC2 .
Needless to say , you can use these volumes to host a relational database .
You will also be able to perform “ snapshot ” backups of your volumes to Amazon S3 .
You can use these snapshots to create new volumes or to roll back your stored data to an earlier point in time .
The volumes are accessible via a new set of APIs , with functions like CreateVolume , DeleteVolume , AttachVolume , and CreateSnapshot .
The same functionality is also available via the EC2 Command - Line tools .
I spent some time experimenting with this new feature on Saturday .
In a matter of minutes I was able to create a pair of 512 GB volumes , attach them to an EC2 instance , create file systems on them with mkfs , and then mount them .
When I was done I simply unmounted , detached , and then finally deleted them .
First I created the volumes from the command line of my Windows desktop :
ec2-create - volume -s 549755813888
VOLUME vol-4695702f 549755813888 creating 2008-04-13T22:17:35+0000 U:\USER\Jeff\Amazon>-s 549755813888VOLUME vol-4695702f 549755813888 creating 2008-04-13T22:17:35+0000 U:\USER\Jeff\Amazon > ec2-create-volume -s 549755813888
VOLUME vol-59957030 549755813888 creating ;2008-04-13T22:17:49+0000 U:\USER\Jeff\Amazon > ec2-describe-volumes

VOLUME vol-59957030 549755813888 available 2008-04-13T22:17:49+0000
Then I attached them to my EC2 instance :
ec2-attach - volume vol-4695702f - i i-6b3bfd02 -d /dev/sdb
ATTACHMENT vol-4695702f i-6b3bfd02 /dev/sdb attaching 2008-04-13T22:36:32+0000 U:\USER\Jeff\Amazon>vol-4695702f - i i-6b3bfd02 -d /dev/sdbATTACHMENT

ATTACHMENT vol -59957030 i-6b3bfd02 /dev/sdc attaching 2008-04-13T22:36:55+0000
Then I switched over to my instance , formatted and mounted them , and I was all set :
mkfs -t ext3 / dev/sdb
# yes | mkfs -t ext3 / dev/sdc # yes |-t ext3 / dev/sdb # yes |-t ext3 / dev/sdc # mkdir / space1 / space2 # mount / dev/sdb / space1
# mount / dev/sdc / space2 # df -h

/ dev/sdb 504G 201M 479G 1 % /space1
/ dev/sdc 504G 201M 479G 1 % /space2
Perhaps I am biased , but the ability to requisition this much storage on an as - needed basis seems pretty cool .
A few EC2 customers are already using these new volumes and we will be opening it up to a wider audience later this year .
You should sign up now if you are interested in gaining access to this cool new feature .
If you do n’t already have an Amazon Web Services account , get one today before you sign up for the waiting list .
We ’ll be releasing more information as soon as possible and I ’ll do my best to cover it here when we do .
Updated :
Here is some additional coverage :
— Jeff ;
Silence is golden , goes the aphorism .
But consider the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany .
Instead of walking away from the Olympics , which would have removed any tacit approval of Hitler , leaving him less emboldened – possibly even changing the course of history – the world was silent .
We stir up trouble by speaking out .
But I am speaking out .
Because the people inside China cannot speak out , and because thousands of brothers and sisters in prison need a voice .
I served five years as a political prisoner in China , from which I was released only last year .
I was tortured , both physically and psychologically , and put in solitary confinement for the first 14 months .
I was charged with " espionage , " a crime of which I was innocent , and one that can mean jail for life or result in the death sentence .
My family hired a prominent Chinese lawyer in February 2003 , after I had been detained .
But it was only after the US House and Senate adopted resolutions calling for my release in June 2003 that I was finally allowed to meet with this lawyer .
The pressure from the US eventually made a great difference in my prison experience – I was given more freedom within the prison , and no longer tortured .
The fact is that without the leadership of the US , I might never have been freed .
Even when I was finally released from prison , the Chinese government kept me in China , preventing me from uniting with my family in America .
If it were not for Congressman Barney Frank and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson working on my behalf , I would not have been able to come home in August 2007 .
I am just one man .
But I know I need to speak out for the thousands of political prisoners languishing in jail without hope and support , including dozens still serving time for the Tiananmen Square student democracy movement in 1989 ; for those lawyers seeking to gain human and civil rights for their clients , for those prohibited from practicing their religion , and for those who are afraid to speak out because of the grave consequences consistently doled out by the Chinese government .
I need to speak out for the invisible – the abducted , or those placed under house arrest for no other reason than for attempting to exercise their basic human rights .
So on May 4 , I began walking 500 miles .
It should take over 32 days to make my way from Boston to Washington , DC .
I am calling my walk GongMin , which means " Citizen " in Chinese .
I 'm walking for " citizen power " in China .
I 'll walk through Providence , New Haven , Bridgeport , New York , Philadelphia , Wilmington , and Baltimore .
My walk will conclude on June 4 , the 19th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre , where there will be a large gathering and remembrance in Washington .
I 'm walking 500 miles as a free man , to draw attention to the struggle for freedom and democracy of Han Chinese , Tibetans , Uighurs , Mongolians , and people of all ethnic groups .
And I 'm walking to call for the US to continue its moral leadership .
The best option is for the US to continue to pressure China to enter a dialogue with human rights advocates around the world .
Human rights are what this great country was founded upon – they cannot , and should not , be commodified or weighed on a scale of pros and cons .
Silence , in this case , is not golden .
Silence , as in the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany , is deadly .
• Dr. Yang Jianli is founder of Initiatives for China , dedicated to empowering the citizens of China by giving voice to their struggles for a peaceful transition to democratic China .
He is a former political prisoner in China .
Vladuz , the notorious hacker who repeatedly accessed off - limits parts of eBay 's network and then publicly bragged about it , has been arrested , the online auctioneer says .
The hacker was arrested by Romanian law enforcement officials with the help of the US Secret Service , the FBI and eBay 's global fraud investigation team , eBay said .
The company would n't discuss additional details , and representatives from the Secret Service and the FBI could n't be reached for comment .
According to Romanian news reports here and here , Vlad Constantin Duiculescu , 20 , was arrested in a communist - era housing project in Bucharest .
A court in that city remanded the suspect in custody for an initial 29 days .
Vladuz came to the public spotlight last year after acquiring credentials that allowed him to access employee - only sections of eBay 's network .
The breach allowed him to masquerade as an official eBay representative in user forums .
Although he never offered proof , the hacker claimed to have the ability to gain full access to restricted parts of eBay .
The company strongly disagreed , saying Vladuz penetrated only limited parts of the system and never accessed sections where it handled administrative functions of the storage of credit card numbers .
Whatever the case , the breaches were an embarrassment to a company founded on the trust and safety of its members and fueled speculation by a small but vocal number of users that the hacker had built a backdoor into the system .
According to news reports , eBay pegged the total amount of damage caused by Vladuz at $ 1 m .
Undercover eBay investigators closed in on Duiculescu by pretending to be interested in buying one of his applications .
He was arrested after he gave them his real address . ®
A longtime confidant of rapper Dr. Dre claims the Rev. Al Sharpton threatened to march on the hip - hop icon ’s recording studio unless he donated a half - million dollars to charity .
Bruce Williams , Dr. Dre ’s former right - hand man , said the alleged extortion attempt involved Sharpton ’s displeasure with vulgar lyrics as well as a nasty feud between rappers 50 Cent and The Game .
“ He said if we did n’t have [ $ 500,000 ] , we marching .
It ’s that easy , ” Williams said in an interview published on hiphopdx.com .
Sharpton insisted yesterday he never spoke to Dr. Dre and has no recollection of ever meeting Williams .
He called the accusation “ absurd . ”
Williams maintained that he and Sharpton helped orchestrate the 2005 public reconciliation between the two rappers – who had been battling over The Game ’s defection from 50 Cent ’s record label .
“ When that beef between 50 Cent and The Game went public , Al Sharpton called over and asked for half - a- million dollars , ” Williams wrote in his book “ Rollin ’ With Dre : The Unauthorized Account . ”
“ Otherwise he was going to bring the heat .
“ We gave him $ 250,000 .
Then we had The Game and 50 make up in public , ” he wrote .
At a press conference , the gangsta - rap stars announced a joint gift of $ 253,000 to the Boys Choir of Harlem .
Jimmy Rosemond , The Game ’s manager , disputed Williams ’ account .
“ I am 100 percent positive that The Game did not come to the conference in fear of Al Sharpton marching and Rev. Sharpton had nothing to do with that conference or donations affiliated with it , ” he said .
Sharpton last April railed against vulgar rap lyrics at his National Action Network ’s annual convention .
“ I had marched on those companies about the n-word , the h - word , b- word , ” he said .
“ Why would I do that if I had some deal with them about giving charity ? ”

Editor ’s note :
The Post does not tell us that the bombing was carried out by the Islamic Army of Aden , funded by Mohammed Jamal Khalifa , who was connected to the 1995 Bojinka plot .
Khalifa was a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood , long ago penetrated by U.S. and British intelligence , and ran the Muslim World League in Peshawar , Pakistan , that is to say he worked for the CIA and the ISI during the CIA ’s effort to kick the Soviets out of Afghanistan .
As well , Ramzi Yousef , said to be involved in the plot , was a known CIA operative , also involved in Bojinka .
ADEN , Yemen —
Almost eight years after al - Qaeda nearly sank the USS Cole with an explosives - stuffed motorboat , killing 17 sailors , all the defendants convicted in the attack have escaped from prison or been freed by Yemeni officials .
Jamal al - Badawi , a Yemeni who helped organize the plot to bomb the Cole as it refueled in this Yemeni port on Oct. 12 , 2000 , has broken out of prison twice .
He was recaptured both times , but then secretly released by the government last fall .
Yemeni authorities jailed him again after receiving complaints from Washington .
But U.S. officials have so little faith that he ’s still in his cell that they have demanded the right to perform random inspections .
Two suspects , described as the key organizers , were captured outside Yemen and are being held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , beyond the jurisdiction of U.S. courts .
Many details of their alleged involvement remain classified .
It is unclear when — or if — they will be tried by the military .
The collapse of the Cole investigation offers a revealing case study of the U.S. government ’s failure to bring al - Qaeda operatives and their leaders to justice for some of the most devastating attacks on American targets over the past decade .

A movie based game thats not horrendous , terrible or mediocre but actually good ?!
In my humble opinion Sega and Secret Level have pulled it off .
So what does the gameplay consist of ?
Beating , blowing , and destroying the hell out of anything thats a threat .
And to be perfectly honest thats about all you do in the game .
Does it get repetitive ?
Sure , ( what game does n't ? ) but it is a GOOD and FUN repetitive .
I mean , your Iron Man , what else would you really do ?!
Yes it has events from the movie while also adding comic book based story into the mix to give it more length .
I also have to mention that one of the most important aspects of the game ( the flying ) was handled tremendously well .
While the controls do take some time to get used to , once grasped you 'll make the transition from flying combat to ground combat and vice versa easily .
Overall i think it was really well done .
Great job Sega , now bring on the Incredible Hulk . …

Why Zappos Pays New Employees to Quit ―And You Should Too
米 Zappos 社では，新人研修を受けている最中の新入社員に対して，こんな提案をする。
「 今，辞めてくれたら特別 に $ 1,000 （約１０万円）あげるけど，辞めない？」
これは，新入社員の会社に対するコミットメントを試すための儀式。もし yes と言ったら，本当 に $ 1,000 と研修期間分の給料をあげて辞めてもらう 。
この程度の「エサ」で辞めてしまうというのは，会社と仕事に対するコミットメントの無さを表している。そのようなコミットメントの無い社員を雇ったとしても，会社にとって利益にならないし，どうせいずれ辞めてしまうだろう。だったら，今
$ 1,000 払ってでも辞めてもらった方がいい――それが Zappos 社の考え。いちおう，理に適っているよね 。
でも，たかだ か $ 1,000 を貰えるってだけで，せっかく入った会社をいきなり辞める人なんているんだろうか？ ……と思うのだけれど，なんでも，コールセンターに配属予定の社員のうち，約１割はお金を貰って辞めていくんだとか。これが本当だとすると，かなり効果的なフィルターとしてはたらいていることになる。
Zappos 社はオンラインでの靴の販売で急成長した会社で，徹底した顧客主義を社是としている。社員は配属される部署に関係なく４週間のカスタマー･ロイヤルティ講習を受けることを義務付けられている。また全社的に
Twitter が導入されていて，従業員が今何をしているのかを簡単に知ることができるようになっている。そんな独特の社風を持つ
Zappos 社だからこそ，そこへ新たに加わろうという人の選択には注意深くならなきゃならない。それが
「 $ 1,000 あげる 」の真意ということ 。

WASHINGTON , Pennsylvania ( Reuters ) - Presidential hopeful Barack Obama , accused of being elitist for remarks he made about small - town American voters , said on Tuesday the slap at his background is amusing and signals a nation in the midst of “ political silly season . ”
The Democratic senator , campaigning in Pennsylvania , dismissed the charges of being elitist and out of touch by fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton and by Republican John McCain as unfounded , given his background .
“ I am amused about this notion of elitist , given that when you ’re raised by a single mom , when you were on food stamps for a while when you were growing up , you went to school on scholarship , ” he told a town hall meeting of U.S. military veterans in western Pennsylvania .
Obama has come under fire by opponents after he told an audience in San Francisco last week that economic problems led voters in some small towns to become “ bitter ” and “ cling to guns or religion ” as an outlet for their frustrations .
Neither of his wife Michelle ’s parents attended college , and both he and his wife financed their educations with student loans , Obama said .
“ We lived for the first 13 years of our marriage up until three years ago in a three - bedroom condo without a garage so if you live in Chicago that means you ’re scraping ice every morning , ” he said in rejecting the elitist label .
“ When somebody makes that argument , particularly given that I ’ve spent my entire life working with workers in low - income communities to try to make people ’s lives a little bit better , that ’s when you know you ’re in political silly season , ” said Obama , who leads Clinton in the tight race for the Democratic presidential nomination .

“ This is what we do politically when we start getting behind in races , and we start going on the attack , ” he said .
The winner of the Democratic presidential nomination faces McCain , the Republican presumptive nominee , in the November general election .
Obama and his wife lived in a condominium they bought in 1993 for $ 277,500 , The Boston Globe reported .
They now live in a house for which they paid $ 1.95 million in 2005 .
Clinton has condemned Obama ’s remarks from last week in a political ad featuring a woman saying she was “ insulted , ” while McCain said the comments represented “ a certain out - of - touch elitism . ”
Obama ’s comments on Tuesday came in response to a man in the audience who said he felt the label of elitist was not far from the label of “ uppity , ” a racially insulting term used against blacks .
Obama said he did not think there were racial overtones to the criticism .

: So you write about Zen and punk rock ?
I never was that angry ; I vaguely understood punks significance , but I never got it .
Thats something thats certainly hamstrung me in the past . :
That youre not angry enough ? :
That Im not in touch with all of my emotions .
Whereas the thing about Buddhism is that to feel any of your emotions you have to feel all of them .
You cant feel just the good ones . :
So you were raised by Zen Buddhist parents ? : Yeah .
My parents live in a Zen temple in San Francisco . :
Im curious as to how that affected your career choice . :
The Zen background didnt affect my career choice at all .
When I was 10 they discovered Zazen .
When I was 13 my mom retired from her job and they became full - time Zen students .
My initial conditioning had already taken root ; I had issues with codependence and having narcissistic parents who were very wrapped up in their own suffering .
What I love about my parents is that they had no bad intentions . :
Thats good . :
But suffering makes you very short sighted and inner focused .
Throughout the 60s theyd been doing other kinds of therapy marriage counseling , biofeedback , body energetics .
They got into mescaline , tai chi , naked tai chi Then they discovered Zen because what they really wanted was to live a devotional life .
Theres no Jewish or Protestant monasteries so theres no place to retreat and study God. :
So this was part of your upbringing ? :
Oh sure .
In fact , I got to meet Suzuki Roshi a couple of times before he died so Ive been around it for 40 years .
But my career choice comes from the fact that Im queer .
After 25 years in the business , Ive realized Im a small a artist and sexuality is my subject matter .
My parents offered the idea of finding your own way [ and ] living an authentic life .
If I wasnt so exhibitionistic or if I wasnt deemed pretty enough to be paid to take my clothes of on camera , Id have been a nurse and been freaky on weekends .
As things transpired , I am both considered attractive enough and Im exhibitionistic enough to like cameras . :
Thats fortunate . :
But I have a message about sex .
The Dalai Lama said theres no greater wisdom than compassion .
So I realize in my life that kindness is a choice you make . :
What do you mean by that ? :
I take compassionate awareness and acceptance as far as I can take it without being an actual temple living , Zazen - sitting , observant Buddhist .
But it is a primary philosophy that I grew up with .
Zen , in terms of my daily life , in terms of compassion , infuses all of my work especially my interaction with my fans because a lot of people look at people who consume pornography as losers , wankers , just completely pathetic . :
We are ! : [ Laughs ]
I dont see it that way .
There are certainly many people in that world who could be considered pathetic losers but liking porn does not make you such a person .
As a stripper I realized that men and women are equally fucked over about sex , but in such different areas were blind to the others pain .
For certain kinds of guys , women are heartless bitches and cock teases and will bleed you dry before giving you a kiss .
And for some women , men are asshole jerks and want one thing .
Really , its the culture keeping them equally ignorant and then saying , Go off and get married !
Watching the men , just showing them my vulva , I realized how sad it was .
No woman in their life had ever said , Here it is , heres what I like , heres what you can do with it , try it this way .
Poor guys are supposed to know what to do . :
Thats true . :
And were supposed to not know what to do until he awakens us with his kiss , touch :
Whatever , yeah :
My early attempts at communicating my needs were quite clumsy and resulted in the guy running from the room .
I must have sounded like a drill sergeant , OK , to the left !!
[ Laughs ]
And porn , because you have to act a little bit , Ooh , ooh , more to the left .
Oh yeah , right there , oh yeah .
So talking dirty is just saying what you need using the vernacular . : I appreciate that kind of thing . :
Guys want to be good with a woman because its good for their ego and also because then shell have him back !
Theyre just clueless because our culture does not give us any good messages about sex .
I love that about porn , besides the fact its where the naked women were because its hard to get naked chicks to go home with you . : Yeah .
I know about that too . : I didnt know how to get with chicks either .
Its hard .
I wanted to be straight up .
I was like a gay man , So you wanna go home and have some fun ?
Then I tried saying , Oh baby , baby , I love you , I love you .
And later on theyre like , You lied to me !
Well , I tried to tell you the truth and you slapped me . :
My friend
Teddy says there are two genders : crazy and stupid . : I love that .
For me , sex has been my practice .
I try to be as honest as possible , as present as possible , as centered as possible , as kind as possible , as generous as possible .
I meet them on the set .
Its like , Hey were working together later .
I have ten seconds from touching them for their body , for their hindbrain , to know its going to be OK .
Adult entertainment stripped away everything that was difficult for me .
Intimacy was difficult .
But I dont want to have sex meeting strangers in a bar and going home with them drunk .
I dont like having sex when Im drunk .
I dont like having sex with people who are drunk , or high .
Or desperately lonely .
Or searching for the Are you it ?!
Are you it ?!
Areit ?!
Are you gonna be The One ? :
Thats just miserable . :
The majority of people who watch porn are un-partnered .
Id say , completely unscientifically , 35 % of the porn market is never going to be partnered .
It takes a certain skill set to be partnered .
You have the biological knowledge of the machine .
What are the parts , what do they do ?
Then there is your intellectual understanding about sex , what you believe about sex , what you were taught about sex .
Then theres your intra-personal skill . : Intra-personal ? :
Your relationship with yourself .
These are skills that develop at completely different times .
My father says there are feelings and then there are thoughts about feelings ; our family had thoughts and theories and concepts about feelings .
But feelings ?
Huh , fascinating .
Like Mr. Spock .
But your body cannot lie .
It contains everything that ever happened to you .
All of these feelings are here .
And if you can learn to sit still and stay with them .
Dont run , dont flee , dont fall asleep , dont eat .
Just stay , stay , stay .
Eventually all will be revealed .
If you can just stay with it . :
Well I agree with that , of course ! :
Sex works that way for me because
Im queer enough that I had to get settled with sex or I was never gonna be settled with anything else in life .
If I was more conventionally sexed , I wouldnt have had to put so much work into it because I would have been normal .
I wouldnt have had to delve deeply into it . : Sometimes I wonder if anybodys ever really normal though . : OK .
For lack of a better word , a heterosexually oriented monogamous person , which is as close to normal as were going to get .
But my orientation is multiple .
I liked sex work because when you stay in the body , your truth shows up .
Where are you scared ?
Where are you blocked ?
I got to my emotions through the body .
I have a girlfriend who is very monogamous .
I asked her a few years back , How do you do that ?
Ive never had a monogamous thought in my life .
She said , Well , when Im in love I dont want anybody else .
How does that work ?
Fascinating !
Because for me , being in love and wanting you are , experientially , completely different things .
Theres my love for my husband ; I love him and I want him all the time and I never get enough .
But youre someone different .
I have people who are straight all the time ask me , Doesnt it get confusing ?
Arent you afraid that if you let him sleep with other people hes going to fall in love ? : I would be , to be honest . : I never grew up with a Midwestern indoctrination ; I grew up in a climate of anything goes , find your own way .
You know , peace , love and flip - flops .
I never had any guilt or shame about being a bisexual exhibitionistic person .
I never ever felt shame about who I was sexually .
Which is why I can be in this business 25 years and still be sober .
The worst thing that religion does is instill shame and guilt about sex and the body . : I completely agree with that .
But in terms of polyamory , I come from the completely opposite direction .
Im more like your friend , the heterosexual monogamous one . :
It is my Buddha Nature to be omni-sexual .
If you pluck one string on a well - tuned guitar the one next to it will vibrate because its the nature of sound waves .
Well , my husband picks a certain chord .
Then you , you hit this string and you over there , this string .
You cant hit her string .
Your frequency is completely different .
Its not confusing to me .
You cant pluck my husbands string and he cant pluck yours . :
I can understand what youre saying but Im just not like that at all . :
Which is fine .
People say , Oh Nina , I could never be like you .
I dont even know whatmeans to them .
But everyone can be like me -- meaning , finding your truth and living it .
Your truth wont look like mine .
Your truth is going to be monogamous and heterosexual because thats true for you .
In that way youre like me .
My husband and I have a D/s relationship .
That was a new kind of sex for me .
I didnt know anything about bondage or sadomasochism .
Id never done actual , official power exchange .
But its his sexuality .
He doesnt have any vanilla .
His sexual orientation is kink .
I really loved him ; I wanted him so I had to learn his language .
So anybody can be , which is getting rid of guilt and shame about sex and your desires .
You can have whatever desires you want once you stop repressing , being stressed over and suppressing and all the things we do when we dont want to face the truth of our desires .
They are what they are .
With my other belief systems in place , are there any parts of these desires I can actually express ?
I know one person who would love to be a swinger and he loves his wife very much and shes not a swinger .
So theyre not swingers . :
He had to make a choice then ? :
You have to make a choice .
But its easier to make a choice when youre not fleeing from shame , fear and guilt .
I believe that what gets you off is what gets you off .
Thats biological .
On top of that is the cultural condemnation of what it is .
Youre not supposed to want someone of your own gender , youre not supposed to want someone out of your marriage , not supposed to want someone before marriage .
We spend all this time going , Whats wrong with me ?
Oh my God !
I beat myself up for years because I wasnt multi-orgasmic .
I read in a book women are multi-orgasmic and for years and years I tried .
I did all the masturbation workshops and all of that and I discovered that I am not a multi-orgasmic woman .
Once I realized that , a big load was taken off .
Quite frankly , I only need to come a few times a month . :
That means in some of those videos I was renting of yours in the 80s you werent actually : Shhhhhhh .
Im not lying to people .
The way I come on camera is the way I come at home .
More importantly , I dont do on camera what I wouldnt do at home for free anyway .
There are no royalties or residuals .
If you dont like what youre doing , the works gonna suck .
When your body is your job , when sex is your job , you really can not let work suck . :
Unless your work is sucking !:
Thats different !:
Is there a union ? : No .
And for lots of reasons there never will be a union .
Thirty - five years ago we tried to join SAG .
That was just shot out of the water .
Its been illegitimate entertainment ever since . :
What about forming PAG , the Porn Actors Guild ? :
It sounds great .
But its a very transient population of rebellious young people who have no notion of solidarity .
Theyre usually out in two years .
Without institutional memory theres no way to build a union .
Most women , when they quit the business , they go , they leave . :
Getting back to the Zen thing , its a little weird being here talking to you today because tomorrow Im going to go lead a three - day Zen retreat . : I love it ! :
Its my freaky dual life . :
But for me its not freaky dual .
Its very compatible .
Im glad that youre here . :
When I first started writing for SuicideGirls that became a really big issue among certain factions of the Buddhist community . :
Did those guys want you out of the sangha ? : Yeah .
One guy actually tried to get me booted out . :
Where is the compassion in that ?
You need to do a sesshin on that !
A seven - day one .
A one - day sittings not enough . :
The whole matter of sex and religion is fascinating stuff . :
We got married at Zen Center and Sojun Mel Weitsman , the head of the Berkeley Zen Center , married us . :
Oh , I know Mel. :
He was the first person who ever showed me compassion .
At the time my parents were very pre-occupied with other stuff .
Their marriage was in crisis , they had three other kids .
I was young ; they didnt want to leave me all alone .
By 12 I was interested in girls and boys .
This being Berkley , I understood there was a word for that Bisexual .
The books at the time , 1971 , said [ adopts exaggerated scholarly voice ] , Homosexual experimentation in adolescence is a normal part of growing up .
But at 14 I realized this wasnt going away .
I was a bisexual person .
Mel was the first person who ever looked me in the eye .
He was very direct , very there , relaxed , open , not expecting , not judging .
I recognized it as something
Id never had before , something I wanted more of , but something I could barely stand .
For 37 years I have been circling that moment , really trying to become centered in it . :
Thats really interesting . :
For me , sex work has done that because I have to do that for other people .
I can be centered because Ive accepted all this about myself so I can be solid while theyre freaking out .
Some of them clam down , but some of them flee because its just too much .
When you see the truth or you see acceptance , it can either be a drink of water in the desert or a flash of fire that scalds you because of where you are in your development .
Can you accept compassion or can you not ?
Mel was the first one to offer it to me .
Ten seconds max .
That was all I could take .
Im sure I blinked first .
I had to have .
Weve never really spoken about it . :
When I started writing for SuicideGirls I knew people were going to throw the whole objectification of women and stuff at me . :
When I was a dancer , I realized right away the fundamental flaw in the objectification argument .
Human females are ready to mate all the time .
Most animals are receptive for about two weeks out of the year and thats it .
Humans are unusual creatures .
So if I come up and talk to you because you look interesting , am I objectifying you ?
No .
Thats how I make my choice .
Most animal species , the males strut and the females choose .
Why do some birds have big tails ?
Because chicks dig it .
The feminists completely denounce the concept of female sexual agency , female self - awareness , female choice . :
Was 70s feminism anti-porn ? : Actually the initial 70s feminism was very pro-porn .
They were very pro-decriminalization of prostitution .
The NOW conference of 1973 has an amazing poster by Betty Dodson of a nude woman sitting in lotus position with one hand on her vulva .
That was when they were working for sex workers rights .
Back when the mainstream feminist movement thought women could think for themselves .
In the porn wars of the mid-80s created the current split in feminism between the pro and anti censorship forces .
Im a sex positive feminist .
The so - called Left in this country has been completely hijacked by the anti-sex fanatics .
There was a group trying to stop the war in Iraq .
Larry Flynt offered them 30 thousand dollars and they took it .
Then the anti-sex folks got so loud they ended up giving it back .
That organization is , of course , now defunct . :
Thats brilliant :
These women question a womans ability not right a womansto do informed sex work of any kind .
For them , dirty pictures is such an over - riding issue that the feminist left is completely silent on anything to do with womens sexual freedom because women are such victims and men are such pigs .
This group of people think that women are oppressed .
Women are a gender , not a class .
Its insulting .
Sex workers have been willing to talk to people for 35 years .
I used to go to NOW conferences and thered be a dozen sex workers of different kinds and they regarded like we were goblins or trolls or hobbits .
Wed be saying , As a woman , here is my experience in pornography and they didnt want to know .
If you say , Dirty pictures skeeve me out and bug me , then we can have a conversation .
On most other issues we agree , Im against the war in Iraq , Id like to see national health care , etc .
But I see men as human , I see men as equally victimized by the system .
Men are also victims of the patriarchy .
The anti-porn feminists are all about The Patriarchy .
Its like they think they get together every Tuesday to talk about how they can use porn to keep women down . : Oh !
They know about us ! : [ Laughs ]
Every country has its patriarchy .
Its the same 200 families whove run the country forever .
So youre no more a member of the patriarchy than I am .
Most people do jobs they dont like .
Most people work too hard for not enough money .
Most people are humiliated in their day - to - day work by their horrible bosses and , quite frankly , men have it worse than women . :
We do ? :
Yes , because at least women have the comfort of having girlfriends .
I can come to a girlfriend and unload my feelings and get some support and some fucking compassion .
You , if youre lucky , might have a partner you can talk to about things .
But the average guy cant go to his guy friends and say , Im hurt , Im scared , Im nervous , Im worried , frightened .
You can be angry , pissed off : Youre right .
But the repression of sex is a very old thing .
There may be legitimate reasons for that .
You dont want unwanted children , diseases , conflicts that jealousy ignites , so you try to regulate that area of human interaction in a way that society can exist .
You need agreed upon rules .
As a society develops , you can put aside some of the rules that really werent working anymore and throughout history thats been happening gradually .
I think our society is pretty advanced as far as sexuality .
When I lived in Japan I was amazed that their sexuality doesnt have any concept of sin. : Right !:
But there are still rules .
I think you can only push things so far .
What I see in a lot of pro-sex stuff is that sometimes youre trying to push it faster than society is ready to go . :
Its true !
For sure !
Of course there have to be rules about sexual behavior and expression .
You have to have consent .
Thats good .
But what the West does is take up the Greek notion of the body being base and the spirit being pure and the monotheistic religions were built on that . : Buddhism doesnt have that particular notion . : Right .
Im not like most Americans because I wasnt raised with that notion of sex as sinful .
Its something I read in a book .
What I dont like is artificial limits .
Like , you can only be married to one person at a time .
You may only have sex with one person at a time .
Which , if youre monogamous , is fine .
But what about the rest of us who might be : I think the problem is when you try to make a blanket rule for everybody . :
And this country does .
Frankly
Id like to see less sex in advertising and more freedom in private .
The idea that what you do over there harms me over here , I find very disturbing .
How is my happy marriage the way we have with our sexuality hurting your traditional marriage ?
How does the existence of gay marriage harm your traditional marriage ?
It doesnt make any sense .
Of course gays should marry ; they should be as unhappy as the rest of us , as one comedian put it .
A good marriage takes work .
This is what I dont get about certain feminists .
Actions hurt people .
Thoughts dont harm people .
Whatever youre thinking about me right now doesnt harm me . :
No , it doesnt . :
If I quit the business tomorrow and crawled over a football field of broken glass to kiss the foot of one of these anti-porn feminists , they might use me in one of their campaigns but Id never be redeemed in their eyes .
They have no compassion .
Theyre like Pol Pot or Stalin .
Im no fan of Andrea Dworkin , although I think she sometimes made some good points and address things that needed to be addressed .
But its not right for a lesbian to be telling heterosexual women how they should approach sex .
If youre a heterosexual woman you need a man .
Sixty - percent of women want to be married and have kids .
Im too bisexual to have been lesbian .
I like men .
I like fucking men .
I like most things about men .
Theyre cool .
I never could buy what she said .
Early feminists went to Arabia and said how nice the burkha was cause it took off the pressure of the male gaze .
For them , male desire was also desire to harm .
Youre conquesting us , penetrating us , conquering us !
I thought we were having fun .
It goes both ways .
I like it .
You like it .
I objectify women and I look at them and I desire them without having any desire to harm so I knew from my own experience that I could objectify and not wish to harm . :
You have a bit of a male perspective , I suppose . : I do !
Im not just bisexual .
Im very inter -gendered .
I like being a girl .
Yet I love women the way men love women .
And I take pride in my ability to be a satisfying and a good lover to women .
Besides , I liked having people look at me naked , even if they were guys .
Guys are fun !
And I found out that the more nudity there is , the better - behaved men are .
Absent beer . : Absent beer , yeah .
Im not a drinker myself . :
Its like , if you do this , the naked tits will stay .
OK .
I can do that !
Men are very rule oriented .
What are the rules for naked boobs being in the room ?
Ill follow those rules .
Let me know what they are and dont change in the middle .
Women do that sometimes .
That can be very annoying .
I realized that part of my power over men is in not hating him for wanting to look .
Hes a straight guy ; of course he wants to look at naked women !
Duh !
So instead of shaming him and taking his money , I was like [ smiles ] ,
Hey look !
I like to show off .
According to some feminists ,
Im reducing myself to a masturbatory object . : I wish I could be a masturbatory object . :
Im actually helping you with your next girlfriend .
Im showing you , heres what works for me , try it on her .
Men are hungry for information from an actual female wholl actually say something to them about it .
I had instant compassion for them right away as equal human beings , equally beaten down by the patriarchy and equally lost and wandering .
Men are shit out of luck if they need comfort or compassion or care .
That just pisses me off .
Im always very physical with my fans .
I hug them .
I touch them .
I squeeze their shoulders .
I have to let them know that I really do mean it .
House committee votes to compel Cheney 's chief of staff to testify about torture John Byrne

By a voice vote , the House Judiciary Committee voted Tuesday morning to compel Vice President Cheney 's chief of staff David Addington to testify about his role in approving harsh interrogation tactics at the US Guantanamo Bay prison .
The vote empowers House Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) to subpoena Addington at his discretion .
" This subpoena should not be controversial  as an institutional matter , all members should support our effort to learn the facts and to exercise responsible oversight in this area , " Conyers said in a written statement Tuesday .
" Furthermore , the proposed subpoena to Vice President Cheneys aide David Addington is being considered at the express request of the Counsel to the Vice President , " he continued .
" In view of the many reports that Mr. Addington played a key role in shaping interrogation policy , and in drafting legal memos on this subject , it is very important that we hear from him .
I urge all members to support this authorization , which again the Counsel to the Vice President has stated would be accepted 'as a matter of comity . ' "
It is the next step in a longstanding feud between Conyers and the Vice President 's office over whether Cheney or his aides fall within the purview of Congress ' ability to conduct oversight over Administration affairs .
RAW STORY printed a letter from Cheney 's personal lawyer Apr. 29 , in which she alleged that Congress " lacks the constitutional power " to directly review Cheney 's job .
John
Yoo , a former Justice Department lawyer who wrote a now - repudiated memo allowing harsh interrogations of military prisoners , has agreed to testify to the Committee after facing a vote today expected to compel his testimony , according to Committee officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the panel has not yet made the announcement .
Yoo is now a law professor at University of California - Berkeley .
He has agreed to testify voluntarily about the Bush administration 's interrogation practices after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
Former Attorney General John Ashcroft , former Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith , and former Assistant Attorney General Dan Levin have also agreed to give testimony at a future hearing .
Former CIA Director George Tenet is still in negotiations with the committee .
Excerpts from the Apr. 29 story detailing Cheney 's lawyer 's efforts to keep her clients out of Congress follow .
In what appears yet another effort to strengthen his position in the executive branch , the attorney for Vice President Dick Cheney said in a letter released by Congress Thursday that the Congress " lacks the constitutional power " to conduct oversight over his job .
The letter came in response to requests that Cheney 's chief of staff David Addington testify about the his role in approving harsh interrogation tactics -- which some see as torture -- at Guantanamo Bay .
Cheney has long battled Congress over oversight .
In particular , Congress has sought , and failed , to acquire information from his office regarding his meetings with oil company executives to discuss energy policy in 2001 .
Cheney was also the subject of a Washington Post series which detailed his attempts to strengthen the position of the vice presidency as a bulwark against inquiry .
" As the U.S. Supreme Court made clear in Barenblatt V. United States , 360 U.S. 109 ( 1959 ) , the power of Congress under the Constitution to inquire ( which Members of Congress and congressional employees often refer to by the term " oversight " ) is coextensive with its power to legislate , " Cheney lawyer Kathryn Wheelbarger wrote .
" The power of Congress to legislate is not limitless and therefore is neither the power to inquire .
" Congress lacks the constitutional power to regulate by a law what a Vice President communicates in the performance of the Vice President 's official duties , or what a Vice President recommends that a President communicate in the President 's performance of official duties , and therefore those matters are not within the Committee 's power of inquiry , " Wheelbarger added .
Wheelbarger cites Barenblatt V. United States , 360 U.S. 109 ( 1959 ) , as her justification .
House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers fired back in a letter Thursday .
Conyers notes in his reply that numerous White House officials have testified to committees of Congress , including White House counsels and chiefs of staff and the Chief of Staff to the Vice President .
" On October 17 , 1974 , I was present when President Ford himself testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee on issues relating to the Nixon pardon , " the Detroit Democrat writes .
" The invitation to appear is thus based on a long tradition of comity between the branches ...
These principles have served our nation well , and I trust you will not turn your back on them now . "
Wheelbarger 's letter is transcribed below .
It is available in PDF format here .
The letter of April 11 , 2008 from the Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives ( " Committee request " ) informed the Office of the Vice President that the Committee plans to hold a hearing on May 6 to explore : ( 1 ) " issues regarding the nature and scope of Presidential power in a time of war , " ( 2 ) " the Administration 's approach to these questions under US and international law ; " and ( 3 ) " United States policies regarding interrogation of persons in the custody of the nation 's intelligence services and armed forces . "
The letter invited the Chief of Staff to the Vice President to appear at the hearing .
The Committee request seeks authoritative representation on the three subjects identified in the Committee request .
The Chief of Staff to the Vice President is an employee of the Vice President , and not the President , and therefore is not in a position to speak on behalf of the President .
With respect to Presidential power in wartime and related issues under U.S. and international law , the Attorney General or his designee would be the appropriate witness .
Regarding interrogation of persons by US intelligence agencies or the armed forces , the Director of National Intelligence or his designee and Secretary of Defense or his designee , respectively , would be the appropriate witness .
You may wish to invite the appropriate subordinates of the President in lieu of your invitation to the Chief of Staff to the Vice President .
As the U.S. Supreme Court made clear in Barenblatt V. United States , 360 U.S. 109 ( 1959 ) , the power of Congress under the Constitution to inquire ( which Members of Congress and congressional employees often refer to by the term " oversight " ) is coextensive with its power to legislate .
The power of Congress to legislate is not limitless and therefore is neither the power to inquire .
For example , Congress lacks the constitutional power to regulate by a law what a Vice President communicates in the performance of the Vice President 's official duties , or what a Vice President recommends that a President communicate in the President 's performance of official duties , and therefore those matters are not within the Committee 's power of inquiry .
In addition to a constitutional basis for a House inquiry , a particularly committee of the House also needs jurisdiction assigned by the House for the inquiry .
It would be helpful to know from the Committee the scope of the Committee 's inquiry and the legal basis for it .
Finally , even if , separate from any question of immunity from testimony , a case were to arise in which a voluntary appearance might be appropriate under the law , questions of privilege may arise with respect to information sought by questions , such as respect to privileges protecting state secrets , attorney - client communications , deliberations , and communications among Presidents , Vice Presidents , and their advisers .
For example , the amount of useful information a Committee of Congress would be likely to receive from a person who served as Counsel to the Vice President and then Chief of Staff to the Vice President concerning official duties is quite limited , given that a principal function of such a person is engaging in privileged communications , such as the giving of privileged advice .
Also , inquiry by a House Committee concerning the Senate function of the Vice President would not , in any event , be appropriate .
The Committee may wish to hold the Committee request in abeyance while it exhausts other sources for the kinds of information the Committee seeks , or the Committee may wish to forgo the Committee request altogether .
If , however , the Committee wishes to pursue the Committee request , please advise of the time for which you have invited the Chief of Staff to the Vice President , and of the legal basis for the request under the Constitution and the House Rules .
We look forward to receiving such information from the Committee to enable us to further evaluate the request and communicate with you ...
This letter is provided as a matter of comity , with respect for the constitutional role of the House of Representatives , and reserving all legal authorities and privileges that may apply .
Sincerely , Kathryn L. Wheelbarger Counsel to the Vice President With AP .

Hi again to all of you friends and readers , The story today is about the most intense experience I had in this trip , and I find it hard to believe that anything will conquer that title from it .
It 's very hard to digest and comprehend , and even after a few days I find it hard to believe that I have actually witnessed such a thing .
I will tell the whole story , but I wo n't show all the pictures , because they are very hard to watch .
The story itself might be hard to read , and even though these are the easiest photos , they might be hard for some of you .
While we were walking around the streets of Litang we were approached by a local guy who speaks English .
This is not too rare , because if they do know English they really want to practice it .
He was a nice Tibetan who went to study in India for a while , and he showed us around and walked with us .
He was practicing his English pointing at things and saying them in English - " this is a shoe store , this is a bag shop , this is a horse ...
" We were n't interestedin the town itself , since we saw it the previous day , and we asked him about other things to do in the area .
We specifically asked him if he knows anything about the sky burial that we heard still takes place in Litang .
Sky burial , for those of you who do n't know , is a Tibetan tradition in which you leave the dead people for the vultures to be eaten .
He said he does n't know about it , but we went together to the monastery to ask the monks .
They told him where it takes place ( about 10 minutes walking out side of the town , on a hill ) , and they also said that somebody died and is being buried that same day !!!
We actually just thought that we will see the place , see some vultures there , and that it , and all of a sudden we discover that we might be witnessing a real burial .
In all the books it says that if there is a real burial you should n't come near , and you should n't take pictures .
We were standing on the opposite hill looking from a distance and taking pictures of the vultures , when our local friend told us to come withhim ... He approached the burial itself , and the family members there invited us to sit next to them , and even told us we could take pictures !
I really could n't believe it .
When we arrived the dead body was tied to a pole that was stuck in the ground .
The vultures were half way through the body , and it looked already like a human skeleton with some flesh on it .
More and more vultures were arriving from all around , and when they flew over me it sounded like a loud and scary " whooooooooooosh " .
It was hard watching all these big birds fighting over every piece of flesh , with the loud whistling and squeaking voices they made .
I can't imagine the beginning of it - a whole body being served to the vultures , and the big birds tearing it apart , eating it 's face and all .
It 's a good thing we missed it , because I think it might have been too hard to watch .
The family members were watching the whole thing , looking at their loved one disappearing .
You could see on their faces that they were sad .
When it was over and there was only a skeleton left , we thought it wasall over .
But then we saw that there is a second part to the burial .
A monk arrived , looking more like a butcher , and in his hand there was a big and heavy axe .
He sat next to the skeleton and started to crush the bones one after the other .
He was working there in the sun for almost an hour , crushing the skeleton to pieces .
He even crushed the skull , took out the brain , and added it to the big pile .
The sound of the axe hitting the bones and the rock will never leave me till my last day .
When he finished - he added flour , sugar , and butter , and mixed the whole thing together .
After that he swept the whole area to make sure that no pieces were lost ... During that entire time the vultures were just sitting there watching him and waiting for him to finish .
Just a hand reach away from us .
When his work was done - he stepped back , and the vultures bashed in .
Once again they were fighting over every available piece , and in a few minutes it was all over .
We went away from there , only to the next hill , wherewe sat down and tried to relax from what we have just seen .
It looked so brutal and barbaric , and yet this is their tradition , their religion ...
They have n't killed this poor dead body , they just buried it in a way that is very hard to comprehend .
Our local friend was as shocked as we were .
It was the first time he saw it , and he became physically sick .
He did n't show up for dinner later that day ... Well , I do n't want to add anything more this time , R .

East Sussex is the first of its kind to offer students a degree in juggling
The course leads to a foundation degree qualification .
Education campaigners last night called it a waste of taxpayers ' money .
Nick Seaton , of the Campaign For Real Education , said : Nick Seaton , of pressure group the Campaign For Real Education , insisted : " This is absolutely crazy .
" People have been learning these skills for thousands of years and they certainly do n't need an expensive new course like this .
" Taxpayers will be picking up most of the bill for this and I think it is a complete waste of taxpayers ' money .
" If younsters want to develop these sort of skills they would better off learning them on the job - or doing it at their own time and expense . "
The college insisted the course was worthwhile , adding : " This is a course for performing and visual artists who are seeking to work in the increasingly popular field of street arts which includes all types of outdoor performances such as carnivals , street theatre , installations and spectaculors . "
A college spokesman defended it saying : " Students will be developing their skills through working with practicioners in events such as Brighton Festival and Fringe Festival in a range of different capacities .

New course : Students at Bath Universtity can now study for a degree in funeral directing
" As well as the creative aspects of the work , students will also gain skills in relation to business and legal affairs and how to find a sustain employment opportunities . "
The College said fees for the two years would likely be set at £ 6,290 .
They will be funded through tax - payer subsidised student loans .
Meanwhile , Students at the University of Bath will learn how to embalm , transport corpses , and choose coffins , as well as burial at sea , funeral rituals and how to comfort grieving relatives .
The funeral directing course is also the first of its kind in the country and includes a placement with a funeral parlour .
Dr Glennys Howarth , director of the university 's Centre for Death and Society , says they have already received more applications than available places for the course , which was designed with the National Association of Funeral Directors .
She said : " So far there has been a huge amount of interest - applications are still coming in and we have already got far more than the 20 - 25 places we have to offer .
" We 're not teaching them how to handle bodies and carry coffins but we will have courses or arrangements with various funeral directors to teach them those skills if they do n't have them .
" But we will be equipping them with more understanding about grief and bereavement and how to deal with things like mass fatalities . "
Students can enrol on a two - year diploma or a three - year Foundation Degree in Funeral Services ( FDSc ) .
Experts hope the course will be a shot in the arm for the ailing industry .
John Harris , a partner in Thomas Cribb and Sons in London , has followed his father , grandfather and great grandfather into the trade .
He said : " From a professional point of view it 's great because it 's filling a gap and enabling people to have an academic qualification .
" In the long term I think this will drive up standards and help us be a more professional business with external verifications . "
UPDATED | 10:25 PM
Microsoft has posted an item on its Zune Insder blog related to this .
See the end of this post .
If you like to download the latest episodes of “ Heroes ” or other NBC shows from BitTorrent , maybe you should n’t buy a Microsoft Zune to watch them on .
A future update of the software for Microsoft ’s portable media player may well include a feature that will block unauthorized copies of copyrighted videos from being played on it .
Tuesday , Microsoft announced that it would start selling video programming for the Zune , mainly TV shows .
These include programs from NBC Universal , which has pulled its shows off Apple ’s iTunes Store .
Late Tuesday afternoon I reached J. B. Perrette , the president of digital distribution for NBC Universal , to ask why NBC found Microsoft ’s video store more appealing than Apple’s .
He explained that NBC , like most studios , would like the broadest distribution possible for its programming .
But it has two disputes with Apple .
First , Apple insists that all TV shows have an identical wholesale price so that it can sell all of them at $ 1.99 .
NBC wants to sell its programs for whatever price it chooses .
Second , Apple refused to cooperate with NBC on building filters into its iPod player to remove pirated movies and videos .
Microsoft , by contrast , will accept NBC ’s pricing scheme and will work with it to try to develop a copyright “ cop ” to be installed on its devices .
For now , both issues are rather theoretical .
NBC does have some variation in its wholesale price schedule , although Mr. Perrette declined to describe it .
Microsoft has chosen to absorb the differences and sell all shows for about $ 1.99 .
Nonetheless , Mr. Perrette said , NBC wants the flexibility to sell older shows at lower prices and hit shows at higher prices than the standard Apple has set .
It also wants to create various deals that would , for example , allow a discount for people buying a season or other group of episodes at one time .
“ That separation of the wholesale pricing flexibility and what the retailer decides to charge is core to us , ” Mr. Perrette said .
“ Zune was willing to provide that . ”
Similarly , the copyright filtering system is still in development and its exact form has not been set .
Mr. Perrette said the plan was to create “ filtering technology that allows for playback of legitimately purchased content versus non-legitimately purchased content . ”
He said this would be similar to systems being tested by Microsoft , Google and others that are meant to block pirated clips from video sharing sites .
NBC is also working with Internet service providers like AT&T to put similar filters right into the network .
Mr. Perrette added that NBC is trying to develop similar hardware technology with SanDisk , through whom NBC also sells its programming .
Adam Sohn , a spokesman for Microsoft , declined to discuss details of this effort other than to say that the software company is exploring anti-piracy measures with NBC .
He said Microsoft , which suffers from its own piracy problems , is sympathetic to Hollywood ’s concerns .
At the same time , it will be difficult for Microsoft to add features that consumers do n’t like to its Zune products , which already lag far behind Apple in the market .
Mr. Perrette said NBC understands the potential resistance .
“ In the short term , this will not win us a lot of friends , ” he said .
“ In the long term , the consumer wants there to be quality premium - produced content , and in order for that to continue to be a viable business , there needs to be significant protection around it . ”
UPDATE
In the Zune Insider Blog , Cesar Menendez , a member of Microsoft ’s Zune team , refers to this post , and the blog discussion it prompted .
He writes :
We have no plans or commitments to implement any new type of content filtering in the Zune devices as part of our content distribution deal with NBC .
It ’s worth noting that Mr. Perrette told me that Microsoft committed to explore filtering ; he did n’t say it committed to implementing those filters .
Here is what Mr. Sohn , the Microsoft spokesman , told me yesterday when I asked him about what Mr. Perrette said : “ I do n’t think they are wrong , but we are not going to characterize those discussions . ”
Later he added , “ We have agreed to work with NBC across a range of topics , and protection of copyrighted material is certainly one of them . ”
As energy prices soar , Frustrated owners try to unload their guzzlers .
Americans are turning away from the boxy , four - wheel - drive vehicles that have for years dominated the nation 's highways .
Sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks - symbols of Americans ' obsession with horsepower , size , and status - are falling out of favor as consumers rich and poor encounter sticker shock at the pump , paying upward of $ 80 to fill gas tanks .
The sale of new SUVs and pickup trucks has dropped precipitously in recent months amid soaring gas prices and a weakening economy : SUV sales for the month of April alone fell 32.3 percent from a year earlier and small car sales rose 18.6 percent .
This fundamental shift comes against a backdrop of relentless gas increases , and growing concerns over the environment and US oil consumption , according to auto analysts and car dealers .
" The SUV craze was a bubble and now it is bursting , " said George Hoffer , an economics professor at Virginia Commonwealth University whose research focuses on the automotive industry .
" It 's an irrational vehicle .
It 'll never come back . "
With stocks of unwanted new SUVs and pickups piling up at dealerships across the country , automakers are offering unprecedented promotions .
Incentives for large SUVs , including cash rebates , topped $ 4,000 in March , or more than double those offered in March 2002 , according to Edmunds.com , which monitors the motor industry .
Herb Chambers , who owns more than 40 dealerships across Massachusetts and Rhode Island , said the incentives offered on new SUVs are pushing down the value of the used vehicles , and increasingly , he is taking a loss on SUV trade - ins at his various dealerships , which include everything from Chevrolet to Jeep to Mini .
" The incentives have never been higher than they are today for the large SUVs and small pickup trucks , " Chambers said .
" I do n't know how factories can make any money for these cars . "
" Having SUVs as an everyday commuter car is largely going away , " Chambers said .
Jon McHugh , of Swampscott , is celebrating the last payment on his 2003 Acura MDX by putting the SUV up for sale .
" I do n't need this much space , " McHugh said of his SUV .
" It just seems ridiculous . "
Good Riddance
Sales of large SUVs plummeted 28 % in the first quarter this year , while subcompact sales rose 32 % , according to Autodata Corp .
Thriftier four - cylinder engines , once despised by Americans for their perceived lack of power , are selling in record numbers .
April sales results to be released on May 1 are likely to show an even more pronounced shift , predicted Jesse Toprak , chief industry analyst for the auto information site Edmunds.com .
" That 's simply a function of the dramatic increase in oil prices that we 've seen in the last few weeks . "
The trend away from SUVs started well before gas prices began climbing in 2005 , in part because of the introduction of " crossover " vehicles - those with SUV styling but built on the more nimble and fuel - efficient car chassis .
SUV sales peaked at 3 million in 2003 ; they 're expected to fall to half that number this year , and the change caught Detroit unprepared .
" It happened too rapidly for the American automakers to take sufficient action , " said Aaron Bragman , an auto analyst for the Waltham , Mass . - based consulting firm Global Insight .
For example , 74 % of the vehicles Chrysler sold in the U.S. last year were trucks and SUVs , compared to 42 % at Toyota Motor Corp .
My Comment
Now owners of SUVs and other gas guzzlers who 've seen the price of a fill - up climb sharply are getting a second shock when they try to trade in their behemoths .
Used car dealers do n't want the big vehicles on their lots anymore because hardly anyone is buying them .
Some wo n't take them at any price .
My Comment
CNNMoney is reporting Goodbye SUV , hello small cars :
Any change will catch GM or Ford off guard as both companies are always behind the curve and slow to adjust to trend changes even though this was easy to spot years ago . : SUVs are headed for the scrap heap of history and the scrap heap at the junk yard where they belong .
Demographics also play a role .
Baby boomers are trading in larger vehicles as their nests empty , and their children are now of car - buying age .
Half of the next generation will pick small cars for their first set of wheels , said George Pipas , Ford 's top sales analyst .
" Gas prices are important because they 've accelerated these shifts , but the shifts were going to happen anyway , " Pipas said .
" SUVs were not going to roam the Earth in this decade as they did in the 90s . "
My Comment
Shifts were going to happen anyway .
: " " Exactly .
Nonetheless this was too hard for GM to figure out even one month ago .
Menicocci , a resident of the upscale Miami suburb of Palmetto Bay , recently placed his 2003 Chevrolet Tahoe with leather seats and 39,000 miles for sale on Craigslist for $ 16,000 -- roughly $ 2,000 less than what his research determined was the Kelley Blue Book value .
He bought a 2003 Kia Spectra for $ 5,000 because he was tired of paying so much for gas with his heavy Tahoe .
" I was wasting $ 30 a day compared to $ 10 a day , " he said .
" Everybody is like , ` What is that ?
Is that the maid 's car ? " ' said Menicocci , who sells marble and granite for a living .
" But I do n't care .
At this point , I 'm way past looks and appearances . "
My Comment
I 'm way past looks and appearances
GM says still expects second - half U.S. recovery
General Motors Corp still expects the U.S. economy to recover in the second half of 2008 , pulling industry - wide auto sales higher , an executive said on Tuesday .
GM sales analyst Mike DiGiovanni , speaking to reporters and analysts on a conference call , said he saw " early signs " that the U.S. market was steadying .
My Comment :
Is this some kind of April Fool 's Joke ?
Separately , GM North American sales chief Mark LaNeve said GM 's inventory of full - size pickup trucks was " more than adequate " despite a five - week - old strike at supplier American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings
Inc that has idled 30 GM plants .
My Comment :
And it will be more than adequate if the strike lasts another 15 weeks .
Who wants full sized pickups ?
GM ought to be thankful for that strike or they would be ramping up for a nonexistent second half recovery .

Increased turbulence and storms first observed on Jupiter more than two years ago are still raging , according to astronomers from the University of California , Berkeley , and the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii , who snapped high - resolution pictures of the planet earlier this month .
Captured with NASA ’s Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) and the 10 - meter Keck II telescope , this so - called “ major upheaval ” on Jupiter involves stunning changes in the planet ’s atmosphere , said lead astronomer Imke de Pater , professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley .
The images are available on NASA ’s Web site , http://hubblesite.org/news/2008/23.
The upheaval was heralded in December 2005 by a color change from white to red of a large oval near the Great Red Spot , earning it the moniker Red Spot Jr .
This oval , formally known as Oval BA , formed six years earlier through a merger of three large white ovals just south of the Great Red Spot – storms that formed in the early 1930s and were prominent in the Voyager era .
The new images , the first since Jupiter emerged from its passage behind the Sun , may show that Jupiter indeed is undergoing a major climate change , as predicted four years ago .
“ One of the most notable changes we observe in both the Hubble and Keck images is the change from a rather bland , quiescent band surrounding the Great Red Spot just over a year ago to one that is incredibly turbulent at both sides of the spot , ” de Pater said .
“ During all previous HST observations and spacecraft encounters , starting with Voyager in 1979 , such turbulence was seen only on the west or left side of the spot . ”
The Great Red Spot is a persistent , high - pressure storm on Jupiter whose cloud head sticks some 8 kilometers ( 5 miles ) above the surrounding cloud deck .
Why the spots are red is a subject of great debate .
Moreover , the color of several bands on the planet has been changing since the upheaval began , said Christopher Go , an amateur astronomer in Cebu , the Philippines , who joined de Pater ’s team two years ago .
Go alerted the astronomical community in early 2006 about the color change of Red Spot Jr .
“ Lately , the red color of the Oval BA has faded a little bit , while the Great Red Spot may have turned dark red , ” Go said .
The UC Berkeley team will work with the amateur astronomy community to investigate the possible origin of this turbulence , which is not understood .
The Great Red Spot and Red Spot Jr. are squeezed between bands called shear flows , where the flow above each storm is moving westward and the flow below is moving eastward .
Since the shear flow in each band is slightly different , and the storms are different sizes , Red Spot Jr. drifts slowly eastward toward the Great Red Spot while the Great Red Spot drifts slightly westward toward Red Spot Jr . In late June , this storm will pass the Great Red Spot , as it does every two years .
Interestingly , a third red spot has appeared to the west of the Great Red Spot in the same latitude band .
“ Although much smaller in extent , the color is striking , ” said UC Berkeley team member Michael Wong .
“ ” Like the other two large red storm systems , this newest red spot is bright in near - infrared wavelengths and dark in the ultraviolet .
If this spot and the Great Red Spot continue on their courses , they will encounter each other in August , and the small oval will either be absorbed or repelled from the Great Red Spot . ”
According to Philip S. Marcus , a professor of fluid dynamics at UC Berkeley , analysis of the Hubble and Keck images may support his 2004 conjecture that Jupiter is in the midst of global climate change that will alter temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Celsius , getting warmer near the equator and cooler near the south pole .
He predicted that large changes would start in the southern hemisphere around 2006 , causing the jet streams to become unstable and spawn new vortices .
“ The appearance of the planet ’s cloud system from just north of the equator down to 34 degrees south latitude keeps surprising us with changes and , in particular , with new cloud features that have n’t been previously observed , ” Marcus said .
“ Whether or not Jupiter ’s climate has changed due to a predicted warming , the cloud activity over the last two and a half years shows dramatically that something unusual has happened . ”
“ A major goal in taking the Hubble images is to look for changes in the zonal wind profile since the Cassini encounter in 2000 , ” added team member Xylar Asay - Davis .
“ If we do find major changes , these could provide important supporting evidence for climate change on Jupiter . ”
The red coloration in the ovals may be generated as their swirling hazes rise to heights like the clouds of the Great Red Spot .
Detailed analysis of the Hubble ’s visible light data and the Keck images at near - infrared wavelengths will reveal the relative altitudes of the cloud tops of the three red ovals , de Pater said .
Since all three oval storms are bright at near - infrared wavelengths where methane gas is absorbing , the data already show that all three systems rise up well above the surrounding cloud deck .
The Hubble telescope imaged the entire planet on May 9 and 10 using the Wide - Field Planetary Camera 2 , while Keck II focused on the area around the Great Red Spot on May 11 using adaptive optics to sharpen the image .
Dr. Al Conrad , a support astronomer at the Keck Observatory , noted that the team used adaptive optics ( AO ) to obtain a spatial resolution comparable to that obtained at visible wavelengths with the Hubble telescope .
Adaptive optics can take the twinkle out of an object caused by turbulence in the atmosphere , but to do this well , the target must be near another bright object that can serve as a reference .
For some of the images , Jupiter ’s moon Europa was used as the reference “ star . ”
But until Europa was visible off the limb of Jupiter , a laser guide star was created near Jupiter to serve this purpose .
“ This was our second attempt using the laser to obtain AO - corrected images of Jupiter ’s surface , ” Conrad said .
“ Based on our past experience , we placed the laser beacon slightly farther from Jupiter ’s bright glow .
With this adjustment in place , AO revealed much finer detail on the surface than we saw during our previous observation .
By using the laser whenever there is no moon available as an AO reference , we will now have many more opportunities to observe Jupiter with Keck . ”
In addition to images at 1.2-1.65 microns , where Jupiter ’s reflected infrared light is measured , the team also obtained a close - up of the three spots at the somewhat longer infrared wavelength of 5 microns that samples thermal radiation from deeper in the atmosphere .
All three spots appear dark on the 5 - micron image because the clouds obscure heat emanating from lower elevations .
“ This image is spectacular , ” says de Pater .
“ There is an amazing amount of fine structure and numerous small ovals south of the spots .
This image reveals details in the cloud opacity not seen at the other wavelengths . ”

Mr Gray 's eye was damaged in a war time bombing attack A man who was blinded in one eye during the Blitz has had his sight restored by Scottish specialists , 66 years later .
John Gray , 87 , was badly injured during the Luftwaffe 's bombing raid on Clydeside and was told he would never again see through his right eye .
However , when he started to go blind in his left eye too , specialists decided to see if there was anything they could do about the wartime wound .
An eye surgeon at Glasgow 's Southern General replaced the scarred lens .
Mr Gray can now see through the eye he has not used in six decades and is sufficiently sighted to sit a driving test .
Drop landmines
In 1941 , he was on duty as a firewatcher when the air raid sirens sounded .
As the night drew on he watched as the German Luftwaffe flew overhead on their way to drop thousands of tonnes of explosives on Clydeside .
It was to be the most devastating bombing raid the Germans were to carry out in Glasgow .
And it was the last thing John remembered for several days .
The Luftwaffe 's two - day raid claimed 1,200 lives .
John was nearly one of them .
Part the German strategy was to drop landmines in order to stop the emergency services getting to the scene of destruction .
One of them landed right on top of the cold store John was in .
I 've got vision and I can read to a certain extent
John Gray
Eight hours later he was pulled from the rubble suffering from terrible injuries - the only survivor from that building .
He recalled : " We just heard some glass shattering and that was the last thing I heard until I came to in the Victoria Infirmary with my leg stretched out in plaster and a big bandage on my head .
" I had an injury to my head which took the sight away from my right eye . "
Doctors told him he'd never see through that eye again .
But John was stoical - after all , he had another eye .
As the years went by a friend 's son , Frank Munro , qualified as an optometrist and began to see John for check - ups .
Healthy eye
As optometry became more advanced , Frank was able to take a look at John 's old war wound .
He realised that John 's retina was healthy - all the damage was to the lens .
But it was too risky to attempt an operation - the part of John 's brain that ' sees ' through that eye had n't been used for decades and might have become redundant .
Frank told John it would be better to keep that eye as a ' spare ' - hopefully he'd never need to use it .
Then , in 2007 , a ' spare ' eye was exactly what John needed .
He developed a severe form of Macular Degeneration in his remaining healthy left eye .
There was little specialists could do and Frank had to break the news to him that he would gradually lose sight in his left eye until he was totally blind .
Frank decided to seek the help of a specialist to see if there was anything they could do to restore the sight that had been taken away during the Blitz .
Mr Gray 's sight is now good enough for him to sit a driving test The Southern General Hospital 's eye surgeon Dr Ian Bryce removed John 's scar tissue and inserted a new artificial lens - something not possible 60 years ago .
But the question remained - would John 's brain remember how to see through his right eye ?
It took a few weeks for John 's brain to adjust but to everyone 's relief John began to see again .
At first it was blurred but now John 's vision is good enough to read small print .
Frank has just issued John with his first set of bifocal spectacles with a lens in both the left and the right eye , and the 87 - year - old is delighted .
He says both his optometrist and his surgeon deserve a knighthood .
" I could n't be more pleased , " he declared .
" I 've got vision and I can read to a certain extent " .
Frank Munro and Dr Bryce are happy to have helped , and say this is lesson to other people .
They say it is always worth getting regular eye check - ups , and if your sight gets worse do n't suffer in silence - there 's usually something that can be done .
Although they admit it's not every day that they can restore sight to an eye that has n't been used since 1941 .

' Gas the jews ' vs. ' Marry the gays ' : ' SaveCalifornia ' get cold feet
by Jeremy Hooper
This is how Randy Thomasson 's " SaveCalifornia " site read yesterday ( this screen cap pulled from the now expired Google cache ) :
And this is how it reads today ( * update : this version of the text has now been pulled as well ) :
Oh , but Randy -- we know it was there .
We know you said it .
We know that you were likening the " tough " decision to marry gays to the mind - blowingly abominable order to murder humans .
And everyone else is going to know it too .
We 'll see to that .
California citizens , please wake up to this !
Our opposition has literally likened our love and the legal recognition thereof to some of the most cruel acts of all time .
Even if they try and hide it , whether through scrubbing their sites or using duplicitous code - wording , their antipathy for us is often at a greater level than many folks understand .
So please , we beg of you :
Get on the right side of history and support those who are being persecuted , not those who are throwing the unbelievably cruel stones !
Your thoughts
" Only the Legislature . . . can make laws with statewide application "
They seem to forget that the California Legislature did " make " this law - TWICE .
Oh how this opinion must rankle them !

Edit is too late .
They EXPOSED THEMSELFS for how they honestly felt .
Civil equality for gays is the same as MURDER to them .
Evil STRAIGHT SUPREMISTS .
They are not homophobes - they are SUPREMISTS .
They 100 % believe they we gay people are NOT GOOD AS THEM !

He also seems to miss the fact that the court did not impose a new law they upheld the constitution as it is and made it consistent with itself .
Posted by : Randy | May 23 , 2008 3:17:19 PM
I LOVE LOVE LOVE when the right wing mentions how disgusted they are with laws that made African - Americans non-persons .
Gives me my laugh of the day .
Because we all know that those people at the front of the picket lines and protest marches fighting for the civil rights of African - Americans were right - wing , evangelical , bible - thumping , fire - and - brimstone Christians !
In fact , our friend Tony Perkins and his sheeple at FRC ran an article last year celebrating - yes CELEBRATING - the Loving vs. Virginia ruling .
I guess having Alan Keyes and Star Parker on their side is n't enough , so they are trying to recruit more African - Americans who want judges whose interpretations are in line with the intent of our Founding Fathers - you know , how blacks were n't considered people .

Given their argument about this supreme court ruling did county clerks refuse to uphold the law when the California Supreme Court struck down the ban on inter-racial marriage in 1948 by refusing to issue marriage licenses to mixed race couples ?
Even more important , did any of those same county clerks issue marriage licenses to mixed race couples * before * the ban was struck down in 1948 ?
Clearly the law that created the ban was always immoral and unjust .
By their logic it would be fine for the gay , lesbian , bisexual , and pro-equality county clerks to refuse to issue marriage licenses to opposite sex couples as a protest until such time as everyone can marry .
I sure hope there are a lot of gay , lesbian , bisexual , and pro-equality county clerks out there thinking about this .

Someone probably pointed out to Thomasson that the Jews hold no monopoly on being gassed to death by the Nazis .
So he decided not to defend his apparent duplicity that gassing homosexuals to death is ok but not the gassing of Jews .
He also chose not to amend his statement to say “ gas the Jews and the Gays and other hated individuals , " probably because that could be construed to say that he does n’t support gassing gays to death ( but that is just a guess on my part . )
He did chose instead to completely change the basis of his argument by dropping the Nazi correlation , probably because the similarity to his brand of morality is just too close for comfort ( but again that is just a guess . )

No , what this guy knew is that a poorly - worded post would expose him to cheap demagoguery from ' net clowns .
So he corrected it .
Nice try , though .
Self - congratulatory rabble - rousing is always so satisfying , though .
Is n't it ?

Mister Snitch : A poorly - worded post would be using a term improperly or making a grammatical error .
Likening the issuing of gay marriages to the " gassing of the Jews " is WELL beyond the realm of , " oops , I made a typo ! "
For a more apt example of poorly - worded sentiment , I would turn readers to your comment , in which you use the term " demagoguery " to refer to those of us who protest against faith - based discrimination , rather than those who play to antiquated biases in order to rally their socially conservative troops .
Nice try , though .
Justifying the unjustifiable is always so satisfying .
Is n't it ?

They 're still comparing gay marriage to " crimes against humanity " like those prosecuted at Nuremberg .
And it 's a little unclear whether they consider the protesters at Tienanmen Square or the army that crushed them to be the criminals ...

Where 'd they get the idea that slavery is immoral ?
Certainly not from the Bible , supposedly the source of all morality .

To Gay Curmudgeon : " By their logic it would be fine for the gay , lesbian , bisexual , and pro-equality county clerks to refuse to issue marriage licenses to opposite sex couples as a protest until such time as everyone can marry . "
My partner read something about how people might be excused from performing same - sex marriages because it goes against their religious beliefs - which we think is bullsh*t because you know no one would be allowed to refuse to perform inter - faith or inter-racial civil marriages or marriages between ethnic groups the clerk did n't like .
If the California gov't allows this to happen , I believe all gay county clerks should refuse to perform opposite - sex marriages because it violates their belief systems .
I can't stand the " gay exception " to every friggin ' rule out there .
You start allowing people to not perform these services because it goes against their religious beliefs and you start setting some dangerous precedents .
People will start disobeying STATE LAWS regarding discrimination based on sexual - orientation with their logic being , " Hell , if the government allows discrimination against GLBT people in publicly funded services , why can't I discriminate in my private business ?
Same - sex marriage goes against your religious beliefs ?
Do n't enter into one .
Do n't welcome people into your home .
Do n't allow your church , temple or mosque to perform religious ceremonies .
Posted by : | May 26 , 2008 7:49:59 PM
Nazi Germany , slavery , Tienemen Square and marrying gays ....
Sorta like : Snickers , 3 Musketeers , Watchamacalit and Diesel Fuel ... one of these does not belong with the others .
If a clerk does not want to marry a couple of queers because of his religeous beliefs ; fax a few resumes and log into a few job sites .
Changing your job is a small sacrifice for your religeous beliefs , considering that Jesus himself was nailed to a cross for his .
What the " offended " clerks need to understand that a legal gay marriage ; like a straight marriage conducted in a court of law is not a marriage in the eyes of God .
It is a legal transaction , providing associated benefits and obligations .
It is people that apply meaning to it .
So if you clerks , really want to stick to your guns ; let me know .
I 'd love to move to California and get a nice cush govt job .
If watching 2 dudes or 2 ladies in flannel shirts kiss is the worst I have to put up with , then sign me up !
Posted by : Straight Christian Guy | Jul 8 , 2008 4:16:18 PM
A much more valid comparison would be between gassing jews and aborting babies .
The hypocritical left believes that while the Nazi's alleged gassing of Jews was evil , relentlessly murdering thousands of unborn children every day somehow constitutes a " human right " .
It beggers belief , murder is murder and dressing it up as a civil right does not alter that fact .
So whose the real Nazis ?
Certainly not those of us on the right that strongly oppose the liberals holocaust of America 's innocent and defenceless little unborn children .
Posted by : Chris | Aug 4 , 2008 3:23:37 AM
They just keep coming , do n't they ?
I keep thinking that it can't get any worse , that they can't screw themselves over any more , but then they make a mistake like this .
God , when are they going to figure out that sooner or later , their little supremist world is going to come crumbling down ?

Marijuana Patient Can't Get A Transplant Associated Press
Published : Saturday April 26 , 2008
|
Print This Email This ( AP ) Timothy Garon 's face and arms are hauntingly skeletal , but the fluid building up in his abdomen makes the 56 - year - old musician look eight months pregnant .
His liver , ravaged by hepatitis C , is failing .
Without a new one , his doctors tell him , he will be dead in days .
But Garon 's been refused a spot on the transplant list , largely because he has used marijuana , even though it was legally approved for medical reasons .
" I 'm not angry , I 'm not mad , I 'm just confused , " said Garon , lying in his hospital bed a few minutes after a doctor told him the hospital transplant committee 's decision Thursday .
With the scarcity of donated organs , transplant committees like the one at the University of Washington Medical Center use tough standards , including whether the candidate has other serious health problems or is likely to drink or do drugs .
And with cases like Garon's , they also have to consider _ as a dozen states now have medical marijuana laws _ if using dope with a doctor 's blessing should be held against a dying patient in need of a transplant .
Most transplant centers struggle with the how to deal with people who have used marijuana , said Dr. Robert Sade , director of the Institute of Human Values in Health Care at the Medical University of South Carolina .
" Marijuana , unlike alcohol , has no direct effect on the liver .
It is however a concern ... in that it 's a potential indicator of an addictive personality , " Sade said .
The Virginia - based United Network for Organ Sharing , which oversees the nation 's transplant system , leaves it to individual hospitals to develop criteria for transplant candidates .
I 'm not angry , I 'm not mad , I 'm just confused .
Timothy Garon , A Medical Marijuana Patient Who Was Refused A Liver Transplant
At some , people who use " illicit substances " _ including medical marijuana , even in states that allow it _ are automatically rejected .
At others , such as the UCLA Medical Center , patients are given a chance to reapply if they stay clean for six months .
Marijuana is illegal under federal law .
Garon believes he got hepatitis by sharing needles with " speed freaks " as a teenager .
In recent years , he said , pot has been the only drug he 's used .
In December , he was arrested for growing marijuana .
Garon , who has been hospitalized or in hospice care for two months straight , said he turned to the university hospital after Seattle 's Harborview Medical Center told him he needed six months of abstinence .
The university also denied him , but said it would reconsider if he enrolled in a 60 - day drug - treatment program .
This week , at the urging of Garon 's lawyer , the university 's transplant team reconsidered anyway , but it stuck to its decision .
Dr. Brad Roter , the Seattle physician who authorized Garon 's pot use for nausea , abdominal pain and to stimulate his appetite , said he did not know it would be such a hurdle if Garon were to need a transplant .
That 's typically the case , said Peggy Stewart , a clinical social worker on the liver transplant team at UCLA who has researched the issue .
" There needs to be some kind of national eligibility criteria , " she said .
The patients " are trusting their physician to do the right thing .
The physician prescribes marijuana , they take the marijuana , and they are shocked that this is now the end result , " she said .
No one tracks how many patients are denied transplants over medical marijuana use .
Pro-marijuana groups have cited a handful of cases , including at least two patient deaths , in Oregon and California , since the mid-to - late 1990s , when states began adopting medical marijuana laws .
Many doctors agree that using marijuana _ smoking it , especially _ is out of the question post - transplant .
The drugs patients take to help their bodies accept a new organ increase the risk of aspergillosis , a frequently fatal infection caused by a common mold found in marijuana and tobacco .
But there 's little information on whether using marijuana is a problem before the transplant , said Dr. Emily Blumbrg , an infectious disease specialist who works with transplant patients at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital .
Further complicating matters , Blumberg said , is that some insurers require proof of abstinence , such as drug tests , before they 'll agree to pay for transplants .
Dr. Jorge Reyes , a liver transplant surgeon at the UW Medical Center , said that while medical marijuana use is n't in itself a sign of substance abuse , it must be evaluated in the context of each patient .
" The concern is that patients who have been using it will not be able to stop , " Reyes said .
Dale Gieringer , state coordinator for the California chapter of NORML , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , scoffed at that notion .
" Everyone agrees that marijuana is the least habit - forming of all the recreational drugs , including alcohol , " Gieringer said .
" And unlike a lot of prescription medications , it 's nontoxic to the liver . "
Reyes and other UW officials declined to discuss Garon 's case .
But Reyes said that in addition to medical concerns , transplant committees _ which often include surgeons , social workers , and nutritionists _ must evaluate whether patients have the support and psychiatric health to cope with a complex post - operative regimen for the rest of their lives .
Garon , the lead singer for Nearly Dan , a Steely Dan cover - band , remains charged with manufacturing weed .
He insists he was following the state law , which limits patients to a " 60 - day supply " but does n't define that amount .
" He 's just a fantastic musician , and he 's a great guy , " said his girlfriend , Liesa Bueno .
" I wish there was something we could do legally .
... I 'm going to miss him terribly if he passes . "

Electronic papers to replace Traditional papers very soon
Epson unveiled a 13.4 - inch ( A4 - size ) electronic paper at SID 2008 , in Los Angeles , the US .
Its pixel count is 3104 × 4128 and definition is as high as 385 p pi .
Before this the company ’s largest electronic paper was a 7.1 - inch type .
The new electronic paper was developed by combining electrophoretic electronic ink of E Ink Corp and a low - temperature polycrystal Si-TFT of Seiko Epson .
The TFT was formed on a glass substrate .
Its contrast ratio is 10:1 and reflectance is 40 % .
With this prototype , Seiko Epson considers that the company entered the final stage of replacing traditional papers with electronic papers .
Epson plans to conduct a market research , aiming at commercializing the new electronic paper and is also considering selling electronic papers in the future .
International Lawyer Alfred Lambremont Webre , JD , MEd , who is a Judge on the Kuala Lumpur International War Crimes Tribunal , will make a public call for an International Citizen ’s 9/11 War Crimes Tribunal .
He will speak at Ready for Mainstream , a 9/11 Anniversary Conference ( Sept.8 -9 , 2007 ) at Cooper Union , 7th St and 4th Avenue , New York .
Information : http://www.ready4mainstream.ny911truth.org/index.html
According to Independent Scientist Leuren Moret and Alfred Webre , 9/11 was a False Flag Operation to provide a pretext to engage in Genocidal & Ecocidal Depleted Uranium ( DU ) bombing of Central Asia ( Afghanistan and Iraq ) in order to secure vast oil and uranium reserves ; to roll out a Terror - based National Security state - system world - wide ; to implement the final stages of a world Depopulation policy ; and to trigger a World War III conflagration .
Since 1945 , under the Nuremberg Principles , causing aggressive war constitutes the most serious of War Crimes .
The International Citizen ’s 9/11 War Crimes Tribunal would be convened under the jurisdiction of the Kuala Lumpur International War Crimes Tribunal , established in February 2007 as a permanent citizen ’s Tribunal by The Perdana Global Peace Organization , chaired by Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad , former Prime Minister of Malaysia , who is the first prominent world leader to take up the depleted uranium ( DU ) radiation issue as an instrumentality of the Depopulation policy .
As a matter of law , there is a sufficient quantum of evidence for the appointment of an independent prosecutor under Article III ( 3 ) of the U.S. Constitution to prosecute treason against President GW Bush ; Vice President Richard B. Cheney ; and the Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld for the armed attack upon the United States on September 11 , 2001 , in the guise of a False Flag Operation .
U.S. Congress fails to Act
The establishment of an International Citizen ’s 9/11 War Crimes Tribunal is justified , given that official institutions in the U.S. have failed to assign legal accountability for the False Flag Operation of 9/11 .
Representative John Conyers , Jr. , Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee and his senior staff personally reviewed the 9/11 Independent Prosecutor Act and Congressional Memorandum following the 2006 U.S. Mid-term Election and Senior Staff met twice with representatives of the 9/11 Independent Prosecutor Act .
The Chairman refused to introduce the Act , despite support for the Act by his Senior Staff .
The 9/11 Commission failed to take testimony under oath from Bush and Cheney , and reached fraudulent conclusions .
9/11 As A War Crime
The False Flag Operation of 9/11 was the pretext for , and an integral part of the planning and execution of the illegal War of Aggression in 2001 against Afghanistan and of War Crimes committed by the United States in Afghanistan , as found by the Final Judgment , International Criminal Tribunal for Afghanistan at Tokyo .
The Court found the use of Depleted Uranium ( DU ) weapons in Afghanistan to constitute War Crimes , Genocide , Crimes Against Humanity , and Omnicide .
The False Flag Operation of 9/11 is a legal component of these War Crimes , and the perpetrators of 9/11 are guilty Aggressive War , Genocide , Crimes Against Humanity , and War Crimes .

The pollsters are now telling us John McCain could pull it off , with match - ups pitting him against both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton showing the War Party ’s favorite son neck - and - neck with the Dems .
Aside from the nearly complete meaninglessness of such data at this time , what these polls fail to take into account is one factor likely to have a large  and possibly decisive  impact on the presidential race : I ’m talking about the Barr Factor .
Yes , that Barr : the former Georgia Republican congressman who led the Clinton impeachment effort in the House , then later dissented from the red-state fascist tendencies manifested in the PATRIOT Act , the Military Commissions Act , and the Bush White House ’s obsession with increasing presidential power , allying with the American Civil Liberties Union to fight the growing power of centralized state authority over our lives .
It looks like Bob Barr has let himself get talked into seeking the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party : according to my sources , he does so with the full support of Ron Paul .
Which means it looks like the Paulian Revolution is not only alive and kicking , it ’s also in the best possible position .
With conservatives openly disdainful of McCain for all sorts of reasons , most of them conducive to a libertarian spin , the Barr Factor could very well play a major role in accomplishing the two major electoral goals not only of libertarians , but of all the War Party ‘s most dedicated opponents .
One , it will deny McCain the White House .
This alone fully justifies the effort and expense , as far as the antiwar movement is concerned .
Obama ’s spokesman backed off calling McCain a " warmonger , " but that lefty radio host is right .
How else can one describe someone who longs for a 100 - year war in the Middle East ?
They ’re trying to get him off his " war , war , war " mantra , but time and again the man condemns himself out of his own mouth .
Quite aside from his foreign policy views , however , McCain ’s " national greatness " brand of conservatism is openly hostile to the old - fashioned Goldwaterite limited - government ideology currently undergoing an intellectual revival in conservative circles .
It remains to be seen whether great swaths of the Republican electorate are ready to defect to a third party on the Right , but if ever there was a time to test this proposition , then surely it is now .
The groundwork has already been laid by the Paulistas .
If the Barr campaign seizes this political moment , the fields plowed by Ron Paul and tended by his activist followers can blossom into a harvest of votes such as the Libertarians have never seen .
After decades of being perpetually on the brink of a breakthrough that never seemed to occur , this may be it for the LP  that is , if the party ’s afflictions , a weird conjuncture of cultural sectarianism and political opportunism , fail to cripple the campaign before it is launched .
The antiwar movement has a stake in this , on account of Barr ’s strong endorsement of a non-interventionist foreign policy in principle .
As his Web site puts it :
" Our National Defense policy must renew a commitment to non-intervention .
We are not the world ’s police force and our long , yet recently tarnished , tradition of respecting the sovereignty of other nations is necessary , not from only a moral standpoint , but to regain the respect of the world as a principled and peaceful nation .
The proper use of force is clear .
If attacked , the aggressor will experience firsthand the skillful wrath of the American fighting man .
However , invading or initiation force against another nation based upon perceived threats and speculative intelligence is simply un-American .
We are better than the policy of preemptive warfare . "
It remains to be seen whether Barr will emphasize foreign policy issues to the degree Paul did and still does .
Ron is quite popular even with antiwar leftists precisely because he always somehow manages to get in references to " our empire , " even while speaking on what are normally considered purely economic questions .
So Paul will surely be a hard act to follow , and professional nit-pickers and sectarians ( of which the LP has a superabundance ) are sure to jump on any number of alleged " deviations . "
Furthermore , the neocon crowd and their " leftist " enablers are already waiting in the wings with Barr ’s equivalent of the Ron Paul newsletter non-scandal .
In spite of Dave Weigel ’s conceit that he and his confreres at Reason magazine had any impact on the campaign ’s vote totals , the effect of the smear campaign probably increased the Paul vote marginally , if anything , to the degree it angered and energized Paul ’s supporters , causing them to redouble their efforts .
The pattern is all too familiar by now : a candidate arises with " out of the mainstream " views when it comes to the vital issue of war and peace .
Since the " mainstream " is synonymous with support for our current foreign policy of global interventionism , i.e. , a candidate fully owned - and - operated by the War Party , anyone who wanders outside the very narrow bounds of " Right " and " Left " interventionism is , by these lights , an " extremist . "
If the candidate ’s views ca n’t be dismissed out of hand as " extremist " on their face , then that ’s when the character assassins come out of the woodwork , professionals at the " art " of guilt - by - association , what John T. Flynn and other Old Right activists used to call the Smear Bund .
They pulled it with Paul , and they did the same with Obama .
You can bet they wo n’t spare Barr .
Barr is no newcomer to libertarian politics : he joined the LP in 2006 and was seated on the National Committee .
More than that , he has been a leader among those " movement " conservatives who have dissented from the Bush administration ’s trampling of civil liberties , denounced the rising surveillance state , and taken the lead in forging alliances between libertarians and conservatives who take the Constitution seriously .
In short , he is a man who suits the moment  the one candidate , other than Ron Paul , who can fulfill the promise of the Ron Paul Revolution and build a popular alternative to the War Party on the right side of the political spectrum .
As far as the left side of the political terrain is concerned , the main battle is , of course , Obama ’s campaign for the Democratic nomination .
While not a consistent opponent of interventionism , Obama has pledged to get us out of Iraq and criticized the " mindset " that got us into " a war that should never have been started in the first place . "
He has trenchantly criticized Hillary for " saber - rattling " at Iran , and he has raised the controversial proposition that we ought to at least try talking to our alleged enemies , such as Hugo Chavez and the Cubans , as well as the Syrians and the Iranians .
This latter is his real heresy , of course , and the Lobby is n’t going to let him get away with it .
If necessary , they ’ll pull out all the stops in an effort to defeat him , and the Democratic Party ’s big donors are now putting pressure on party leaders , such as Nancy Pelosi , to play the " super - delegate " card on Hillary ’s behalf .
If the Clintonites steal the nomination from Obama , the prospects of a Barr campaign will be practically unlimited .
We ’re talking about millions of embittered antiwar voters , a great number of whom might be attracted to Barr ’s libertarian and staunchly anti-interventionist message .
In the year of the maverick , the establishment of both major parties will have succeeded in quashing voter insurgencies within their ranks .
All that energy will be available for the Barr campaign to harness .
There is , however , another important element that will be missing from the contention between the two major party candidates if Hillary succeeds in her scheme to snatch the crown from Obama ’s brow , and that is populism .
This , of course , is the element in the Paul campaign that most alienated the more " cosmopolitan " elements of the libertarian movement , and in large part motivated their campaign to vilify the good doctor .
This time , they ’ll doubtless either latch on to something similar , or else focus on two areas of special interest to left - libertarians : immigration and gay marriage .
There is no appeasing them : if you oppose either , you ’re highly suspect , in spite of credible libertarian arguments to the contrary .
Such minor matters as the Iraq war , or the possible invasion of Iran , pale in significance .
Who cares about mass murder by the state if two gay guys can’t file a joint tax return ?
No doubt the libertarian movement ’s self - appointed guardians of political correctness will try to cram candidate Barr into their Procrustean bed , but I do n’t think it ’s a fit .
Yet these pretentious sideliners will only underscore their own irrelevance as the twin rivers of antiwar sentiment and populism propel the Barr campaign into history - making territory  that is , if the Barr people play their cards right .
The left - populism of Obama ’s appeal can be easily served by the right - populism of , say , a Ron Paul , whose views on the Federal Reserve have some resonance with the foreclosed and the unemployed , as well as with small - business owners and the beleaguered middle classes .
If Barr replicates Paulian populism , he could appeal to those voters who yearn for a slightly more radical change than Obama promised .
A Barr campaign could , in short , do for the antiwar movement and the libertarian movement what their hearts most desire : defeat the War Party and create an electoral alternative to the defeated , worn - out , sold - out husk of the GOP .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Absent Obama , the prospects for an electoral alternative on the left side of the spectrum are much dimmer than they are on the right side .
Ralph Nader is unlikely to create a credible alternative to complement Barr .
That conclusion seems counterintuitive , at first , because a seasoned candidate like Nader , articulate and fearless , is a natural to play this role  but , unfortunately , no .
This is on account of the candidate ’s strange electoral strategy , which consists of pushing away the Green Party organization and mounting an " independent " campaign instead .
This , in turn , necessitates an expensive and incredibly complicated ballot access drive , likely to eat up the entire Nader campaign treasury , such as it is .
Why is Nader doing this ?
Darned if I know , and , frankly , the whole thing sounds more than a little crack - brained , which makes me even less inclined to investigate the ostensible rationale .
If the Left ca n’t get together an independent antiwar ticket in lieu of an Obama - less ballot , then what good are they , even to themselves ?
I ’ve been accused of " shunning " Nader and of having " fallen into the clutches of the Obama - zombies , " but Nader has n’t exactly inspired confidence .
My problem with him , however , is n’t ideological  it ’s strategic and tactical .
He has done everything possible to marginalize both himself and his campaign , and I ’m hardly to blame for that .

DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES 2008 Click for Republican primaries and caucuses
News from the Votemaster
In case you missed the news yesterday , Democrat Bill Foster beat Republican Jim Oberweis for Dennis Hastert 's seat in a very special election in IL - 14 west of Chicago .
The NRCC spent $ 1.3 million of the $ 6,4 million it has in the bank to hold a seat they have owned for more than 20 years in a district that is strongly Republican ( PVI R+5 ) and lost to a nuclear physicist who has never run for public office before .
Now Foster is a very smart guy , no doubt about that , but he is a newbie to politics .
Obama helped Foster and McCain helped Oberweis but this race was in Illinois not Arizona so it is not really Obama vs. McCain , the prequel .
Still , many GOP congressmen may be starting to think carefully if this might not be a good time retire voluntarily , rather than involuntarily .
( As an aside , it you do n't know what PVI is , click here . )
There is discussion going on about a caucus in Michigan and a mail - in primary in Florida so delegations from those states can be seated .
That would resolve a huge problem and might determine the Democratic nominee .
The Texas results are still murky ,
The sleeping girl in Hillary Clinton 's 3 a.m. phone ad is now 18 and supports Obama .
Oops .
Who knew ?
Ideas and suggestions for additional features , data , tables , whatnot to add to this site for the general election are welcome .
For example , new information could be added to the Data galore page , but all ideas are welcome .
Tomorrow is the primary in Mississippi .
Polls are showing a big Obama win there , largely due to the substantial black population that is about 90 % behind him .
What is noteworthy is that black women support him as much as black men .
Race trumps gender apparently .
Is an Experienced President a Good President ?
How good Are experienced presidents , anyway ?
Suppose you had to choose between two Presidential candidates , one of whom had spent 20 years in Congress plus had considerable other relevant experience and the other of whom had about half a dozen years in the Illinois state legislature and 2 years in Congress .
Which one do you think would make a better President ?
If you chose # 1 , congratulations , you picked James Buchanan over Abraham Lincoln .
Your pick disagrees with that of most historians , who see Lincoln as the greatest President ever and Buchanan as the second worst ever , better only than Warren " Teapot Dome " Harding .
Both served in what was probably the most difficult period in American history , where slavery and secession tore the nation asunder .
Before becoming President , Buchanan had served 6 years in the Pennsylvania state legislature , 10 years in the U.S. House of Representatives , 4 years as ambassador to Russia , 10 years in the Senate , 4 years as Secretary of State , and 4 years as Ambassador to England .
Talk about experience , Buchanan did just about everything except serve on the Supreme Court , a job he was offered by President Polk and refused .
Yet by any measure , he was n't up to the job as President .
In contrast , Abraham Lincoln served 8 years in the Illinois legislature and one term in the U.S. House ( 1847-1849 ) , a decade before becoming President .
The rest of the time he was a lawyer in private practice , a bit thin one might say .
Of course , these are only two data points .
What about all the other Presidents ?
Were n't the experienced ones the better Presidents ?
Fortunately , there have been a number of surveys of presidential greatness , some by professional historians and some by the general public .
Many of these are given in the Wikipedia page on Historical rankings of U.S. Presidents .
The amount of experience each President had before taking office is well known since the lives of all Presidents have been extremely well documented .
Thus the basic data -- years of experience and ranking -- are available making a statistical analysis of experience vs. greatness possible .
David A. Levine of New York has collected the data from Wikipedia and done some analysis of it .
Let 's start with a table of the Presidents listed in order of their consensus rank in the 12 surveys given in the above Wikipedia page .

As practically everyone knows , the current President is often called Bush 43 ( to distinguish him from his father , Bush 41 ) .
But there have only been 42 Presidents .
Stephen Cleveland ( commonly known as Grover ) won the popular vote three times , in 1884 , 1888 , and 1892 , but lost the electoral college to Benjamin Harrison in 1888 .
Having actually won two consecutive elections , he ran again ( with Adlai E. Stevenson , grandfather of the 1952 and 1956 Democratic candidate , as his running mate ) in 1892 and won , making him the 22nd President and also the 24th President .
In the table above , the top quartile ( actually 11 ) are colored deep green , 2nd quartile ( actually 10 ) is colored light green , the 3rd quartile ( actually 11 ) is colored light red , and the bottom quartile ( actually 10 ) is colored deep red .
Recent Presidents have not been included in all the historical surveys , so their rankings should be taken with a grain ( or better yet , a metric ton ) of sodium chloride .
Bush 43 , for example , was rated only twice and one of the ratings was by the Wall St. Journal .
Rankings of recent Presidents will no doubt change in future years when the wisdom of their decisions ( or lack thereof ) becomes more apparent .
All experience is not the same .
How do you compare being governor of a small state with being governor of a big state ?
Is being Vice President worth a pitcher of warm beer or any other fluid ?
Is being a state senator more or less relevant to being president than being Secretary of Commerce ?
Impossible to say for sure , so I have justed added up the total number of years of experience as a proxy for experience .
If you want to weight the columns differently , the data are available in both Excel format and .csv format so you can slice and dice them as you wish .
Before becoming a data analyst though , you should a first read the Notes on presidential experience document David wrote .
Now for the test .
In the table below , the Presidents are sorted on experience .
The most experienced President was James Buchanan , with Lyndon Johnson and Jerry Ford getting the silver and bronze medals , respectively .
Chester A. Arthur had a mere 1.5 years experience before he was elevated to the Presidency upon the asassination of President Garfield .
If experience and greatness correlate , one would expect the top half of the table ( the most experienced Presidents ) to be mostly green ( good ) and the bottom half ( inexperienced ) to be mostly red ( bad ) .
If there is no correlation , the red and green should be random .
Indeed , the latter seems to be the case .
The top half in terms of experience ( above the gray bar ) has 10 bad Presidents and 11 good ones , essentially no correlation between greatness and experience .
If you do n't like this result and want to try for a better one , just get the spreadsheet and start weighting the columns .
Undoubtedly you will be able to get a different result if you try hard enough .
But the point remains , the Presidents with a lot of experience have not been more outstanding than those with little experience .

Here is a scatterplot of rank vs. experience .
If more experience makes you a better President , the dots , each of which is one President , should fall somewhere along the blue theoretical curve -- more experience gives you a higher rank ( 1 being the highest rank ) .
The two Bushes and Clinton are not shown since it is much too early to draw historical judgments on them .
One needs a very vivid imagination to perceive the data points falling along the blue line .
There does not appear to be any relation between experience and greatness .
Here is the same scatterplot , but now with the Presidents labeled .
The Presidents ( way ) under the line might be regarded as overperformers .
They did n't have much experience going into office , but did pretty well once there .
The ones ( way ) above the line had lots of experience but were not good Presidents .
This analysis can be found on the Data galore page below the map in case you want to show it to your friends later in the year .
No new polls today .
The polling results for all states are available as a Web page and in .csv format .
Here are the delegate totals from various news sources rounded to integers ( Democrats Abroad has 22 delegates , each with 1/2 vote ) .
Not everyone has processed Wyoming yet .
The sources differ because in most caucus states , no delegates to the national conventions have been chosen yet , just delegates to the district , county , or state convention .
Also , all sources try to count the PLEOs ( Party Leaders and Elected Officials ) and unpledged delegates , who also get to vote at the convention .
When different reporters call a PLEO and hear " Well , I like Hillary , but Barack has his charms too " they may score it differently .

By many important measures , the U.S. military has reason to feel better about Iraq .
Violence has declined , casualties are down , the president is touting the current strategy and the public ’s anguish has ebbed .
But inside the Pentagon , turmoil over the war has increased .
Top levels of the military leadership remain divided over war strategy and the pace of troop cuts .
Tension has risen along with concern over the strain of unending cycles of deployments .
In one camp are the ground commanders , including Gen. David H. Petraeus , who have pushed to keep a large troop presence in Iraq , worried that withdrawing too quickly will allow violence to flare .
In the other are the military service chiefs who fear that long tours and high troop levels will drive away mid-level service members , leaving the Army and Marine Corps hollowed out and weakened .
President Bush , in marking the fifth anniversary of the Iraq invasion Wednesday , said he would not approve any U.S. troop withdrawals that could jeopardize security gains already made there .
Indeed , top leaders at the Pentagon emphasize that any withdrawals must be done with that in mind , and few are pushing for a complete pullout .
Advertisement
Still , there are sharp differences that carry broad implications for the U.S. involvement in Iraq .
In the short run , supporters of Petraeus would like to see about 140,000 troops , including 15 combat brigades , remain in Iraq through the end of the Bush administration .
Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and their advisors favor a faster drawdown .
Some are pushing for a reduction to 12 brigades or fewer by January 2009 , which would amount to approximately 120,000 troops , depending on the configuration of forces .
The discord deepened with last week ’s announcement that Adm.
William J. Fallon , who served as the top U.S. commander in the Middle East , would retire .
Fallon was seen as a key ally of the Joint Chiefs and at odds with Bush because of his support for a speedier drawdown in Iraq .
Advertisement
“ Fallon wanted to withdraw forces from Iraq much faster than Gen. Petraeus , ” said one former Defense official who remains involved in Iraq policy .
“ Fallon was in sync with what the Joint Chiefs ’ desires were .
And that enhanced the Joint Chiefs ’ position , because Fallon was a real war fighter , like Petraeus . ”
The officer , like others , spoke on the condition of anonymity because neither the Joint Chiefs nor Petraeus have made their Iraq recommendations public .
Next month , Petraeus and other military leaders will present their advice for the next phase of the war .
The U.S. troop buildup is scheduled to wind down by July .
The upcoming recommendations will determine whether troop reductions continue , as the Joint Chiefs would prefer , or “ pause , ” as Petraeus has advocated .
If withdrawals are halted , military leaders must decide how long that pause should last .
In part , the disagreements between Petraeus and the Joint Chiefs -- and in particular their chairman , Navy Adm. Michael G. Mullen -- are a function of their differing responsibilities .
Petraeus ’ main task is to win the war in Iraq .
Mullen and the Joint Chiefs have the primary responsibility of ensuring the long - term strength of the military and preparing for contingencies .
Advertisement
But the differences are exacerbated by the circumstances under which the men were chosen for their jobs .
Bush picked Petraeus because he had new strategies for Iraq .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates tapped Mullen because of his deep concern for the health of the military .
Mullen , an experienced Pentagon hand , holds a key position in the debate as the nation ’s top uniformed officer .
Of late , the Joint Chiefs chairman has rarely made a public speech without mentioning the need to reduce the strain on the Army .
Military officers note that the Joint Chiefs do not advocate pulling all troops out of Iraq .
The Joint Chiefs agree with Petraeus on the importance of maintaining security gains .
But Mullen thinks that the threat of violence in Baghdad must be weighed against the risk of damaging the Army through repeat deployments that lead mid-level personnel to quit .
“ The chairman is wrestling very hard with the issues of sustaining success in Iraq versus recognizing the strain on the force , ” a military officer said .
“ There is a balance . ”
Advertisement
The Joint Chiefs continue to have doubts about the troop buildup strategy , some officers said , citing the disparity between security improvements in Iraq and the absence of any meaningful political progress by the government of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki .
“ We injected positive things at the tactical level by putting 30,000 more troops on the ground , ” said an officer who has advised the Joint Chiefs .
“ But how does 30,000 more people make the Maliki government more competent and promote reconciliation between the factions ?. . .
We can have success on the ground , but it does n’t translate to success with the government . ”
The turmoil at the Pentagon is not new , but it has been inflamed by the next phase of troop deployments .
Last fall , Petraeus and the Joint Chiefs agreed to a plan to wind down the “ surge ” but quelled debate over further troop cuts by putting off that discussion until this spring .
Some military officers think that compromise was upended when Petraeus proposed a temporary halt in further troop cuts in the second half of this year .
Those officers believe the command in Iraq did an end run around the process , effectively cutting the Joint Chiefs out of this spring ’s debate .
Advertisement
Supporters of Petraeus , on the other hand , argue that the Joint Chiefs are putting pressure on Gates to resume troop withdrawals after a short break later this year .
Officials in Washington have spoken of a pause of about six weeks .
But in Iraq some want to see a much longer delay before more troops are pulled out .
“ I think it is unfortunate we put a timeline on it .
I am not sure we can get much of an answer in six weeks , ” the former Defense official said .
“ I think an appropriate timeline would be four to six months to make the proper assessment . ”
Petraeus and other officers in Baghdad downplay the difference of opinion .
A senior military official in Iraq said that Petraeus had begun to make inroads with skeptics .
Over the course of the last year , Petraeus has worked to convince Fallon of the merits of his strategy , the senior officer said .
And in a brief interview last week , Petraeus dismissed the idea that the two “ did n’t see the world the same way , or something like that . ”
Advertisement
“ You know , we had different jobs and it ’s understandable that we might come at an issue a little bit differently , but it was always a constructive relationship , ” Petraeus said .
But some current and former officers said they would be surprised if Petraeus agreed to more than a token drawdown in the second half of 2008 .
These officers think pulling out too quickly could lead to a repeat of mistakes the U.S. made in 2005 and 2006 , when military leaders planned for sharp reductions despite rising violence .
“ We have to remember these are the very areas where we have made mistakes in the past , ” the former official said .
“ We underestimated the enemy and overestimated the Iraqis ’ capacity to hold without us .
Those two mistakes led to a failed strategy . ”
But officers skeptical of the surge think putting off cuts for too long is misguided .
Advertisement
“ If the surge has been as successful as it purports to be , this is an ideal time to start the drawdown , ” said the officer who has advised the Joint Chiefs .
“ Violence is at an all - time low .
We have turned the corner at the tactical level , so now is the time to redeploy those forces .
So people are saying , ‘ Why wait four months ? ’ ”

Since Nils Anders Danielsson showed me how to use Induction .
WellFounded in Agda ’s Standard Library , I have been studying issues related to well - founded recursion .
In dependently typed programming , we would like to ensure that proof terms are terminating .
Apart from the type checker , Agda employs a separate termination checker .
How it exactly works is still at times mysterious to me , but basically it recognises a program as terminating if some of its arguments become “ structurally ” smaller after each recursive call .
This is already far more expressive than I thought — quite a number of programs can be written by structural recursion .
Still , we occasionally need some more flexibility .
One of such occasion was when I wished to express terminating unfolds in AoPA .
For another example , consider this function mentioned in the paper Terminating General Recursion by Bengt Nordström :
f ( n , k ) = if k ≤ n then n else f(f ( n + 1 , k ) , k )
It is a variation of McCarthy ’s 91 function , used as a popular example due to its non-trivial recursion pattern .
Can we express this function in Agda while informing the termination checker that it does terminate ?
Given a relation < that has been shown to be well - founded , we know that a recursively defined function is terminating if its arguments becomes “ smaller ” with respect to < at each recursive call .
We can encode such well - founded recursion in Agda ’s style of structural recusion .
The earliest paper I could find about such encoding is Terminating General Recursion by Bengt Nordström .
It may have appeared in other forms , however .
Accessibility
Given a binary relation _<_ : a -> a ->
Set , an element x is in the well - founded subset of < if there is no infinite chain of x₁ , x₂ , x₃ ... such that x > x₁ > x₂ > x₃ > ... .
The relation is well - founded if all elements of a are in its well - founded subset .
The less - than ordering on natural number is well - founded , while the greater - than ordering is not .
A more constructive way to talk about well - foundedness is via accessibility .
Given a relation _ a ->
Set , the proposition Acc _ states that x is accessible under relation < .
An element x : a is accessible if all y : a " smaller " than x are accessible :
data Acc {a : Set} ( _ a -> Set ) : a ->
Set where
acc : ( x : a ) -> ( forall y -> y < x ->

A relation _ a ->
Set is well - founded if all elements in a are accessible :
well - found : {a : Set} -> ( a -> a -> Set ) ->
Set
well - found _ Acc _
For an example , consider the less - than - or - equal - to ordering on natural numbers .
It is usually modelled by a datatype stating that 0 ≤ n for all n and that 1 + m ≤ 1+n follows from m ≤ n .
The strictly - less - than ordering is defined by m < n = 1 + m ≤ n .
For well - foundedness proofs , however , the following definitions turn out to be more convenient :
data _≤′_ : ℕ -> ℕ ->
Set where
≤′ -refl : forall {n} -> n ≤′ n
≤′ -step : forall {m n} -> m ≤′ n -> m ≤′ suc n _ ℕ ->
Set
m
Let 's prove that is well - founded :
ℕ ( m : ℕ ) -> m <′ n ->
Acc _< ′_ m
access zero m ()
access ( suc n ) .n ≤′ - refl = acc n ( access n )
access ( suc n ) m ( ≤′- step m < n ) = access n m m<n
An operational intuition for access : knowing that m <′ n , access demonstrates that it is possible to reach m from n in a finite number of steps .
Well - Founded Recursion
As an inductively defined datatype , Acc naturally induces a fold operator :
acc-fold : {a : Set} ( _ a -> Set ) { P : a ->
Set} ->
(( x : a ) -> ( forall y -> y < x -> P y ) -> P x ) ->
( z : a ) ->
Acc _ P z
acc - fold _ acc - fold _
Its type says that if we can provide a function Φ that proves some property P x for all x provided that P y has been proved for all y < x , then P holds for all accessible elements in a .
Recall strong induction .
When < is well - founded , all elements are accessible .
Therefore we can define :
rec -wf : {a : Set} {_ a ->
Set} {P : a ->
Set} ->
well - found _
((x : a ) -> ( (y : a ) -> y < x -> P y ) -> P x ) ->
( x : a ) ->
P x
rec - wf {a}{_
For an example , consider the function div : ℕ -> ℕ ->
ℕ performing integral division ( but letting div zero zero be zero ) :
div : ℕ -> ℕ -> ℕ
div zero n = zero
div ( suc m ) zero = suc m
div ( suc m ) ( suc n ) = suc ( div ( suc m ∸ suc n ) ( suc n ) )
If we define div by well - founded recursion with explicit fixed - point , it looks like :
div -wf : ℕ -> ℕ -> ℕ
div - wf m n = rec-wf ℕ ( m : ℕ ) -> ((k : ℕ ) -> k <′ m -> ℕ ) -> ℕ
body n zero rec = zero
body zero ( suc m ) rec = suc m
body ( suc n ) ( suc m ) rec =
suc ( rec ( suc m ∸ suc n ) ( sm-sn < sm m n ) )
where sm - sn < sm : forall m n -> ( m ∸ n ) <′ suc m .
Notice how rec-wf ℕ behaves like a fixed - point operator taking the " fixed - point " of body .
The recursive call is replaced by a function rec , having type ( m : ℕ ) -> m ℕ .
To call rec , the programmer has to provide a proof that the argument is indeed getting smaller with respect to the relation _< _ .
The function could also be written without explicit fixed - point , but with explicit pattern matching with the accessibility proof :
div-wf ' : forall m -> ℕ -> Acc _< ′_ m -> ℕ
div - wf ' zero n _ = zero
div - wf ' ( suc m ) zero _ = suc m
div - wf ' ( suc m ) ( suc n ) ( acc .( suc m ) h ) =
suc ( div - wf ' ( suc m ∸ suc n ) ( suc n )
( h ( suc m ∸ suc n ) ( sm- sn < sm m n ) ) )
Upper-Bounded Reverse Ordering
As a practice , let us consider another ordering .
For a given natural number k , define n ◁ m = m < n ≤ k .
That is , for m and n upper - bounded by k , the one closer to k is considered smaller .
Apparently ◁ is well - founded .
I tried to encode it in Agda by :
_ ℕ -> ℕ ->
Set
m < n ≤ k = ( m ℕ -> ℕ ->
Set
(◁ k ) m n = n < m ≤ k
However , the accessibility proof became very difficult to construct .
I ended up defining yet another variation of the less - than - or - equal - to ordering :
data _≤′′_ : ℕ -> ℕ ->
Set where
≤′′ -refl : forall {n} -> n ≤′′ n
≤′′ -step : forall {m n} -> suc m ≤′′ n -> m ≤′′ n
and defined m < n ≤ k = ( m .
A number of properties can be proved about ≤′ :
m≤n⇒m ≤1+n : forall {m n} -> m ≤′′ n -> m ≤′′ ( suc n )
m <n⇒¬n≤m : forall {m n} -> m ¬ ( n ≤′′ m )
¬ [m< n∧n≤m ] : forall {m n} -> ¬ ( m m ≤′′ n -> n ≤′′ k -> m ≤′′ k
≤′′ -antisym : forall {m n} -> m ≤′′ n -> n ≤′′ m -> m ≡ n
Some of the properties above depends on the following :
¬ 1+n≤n : forall {n} -> ¬ ( suc n ≤′′ n )
which I have not yet proved .
Now let us show that ◁ k is well - founded .
ℕ◁ -wf : forall k -> well - found ( ◁ k )
ℕ◁ - wf k m = acc m access
where
access : forall n -> ( m < n ≤ k ) -> Acc ( ◁ k) n
access n ( m<n , n≤k ) =
◁ -access k m n ( ≤′′ - trans m< n n≤k ) ( m<n , n≤k )
The function ◁- access needs , apart from proofs of m < n and n ≤ k , a proof of m < k , which can be established by transitivity of ≤′ .
The definition is shown below :
◁-access : forall k m n ->
( m ( m < n ≤ k ) -> Acc ( ◁ k) n
◁-access .( suc m ) m .( suc m ) ≤′′-refl ( ≤′′-refl , 1+m ≤ 1 + m ) =
acc ( suc m )
( \y 1+m < y∧y ≤ 1+ m -> ⊥-elim ( ¬[m<n∧n≤m ] 1+m<y∧y ≤ 1+m ) )
◁-access k m .( suc m ) ( ≤′′-step 1+m < k ) ( ≤′′-refl , 1+m≤k ) =
acc ( suc m ) ( \y -> ◁-access k ( suc m ) y 1+m < k )
◁-access .( suc m ) m n ≤′′ - refl ( ≤′′-step 1+m < n , n ≤ 1+ m ) =
acc n ( ⊥ - elim ( m< n⇒¬n≤m 1+m < n n ≤ 1+ m ) )
◁-access k m n ( ≤′′ - step 1+m < k ) ( ≤′′ -step 1+m < n , n≤k ) =
◁-access k ( suc m ) n 1+m < k ( 1+m < n , n≤k )
It is perhaps quite hard to understand unless you try to construct it yourself .
The reader only needs to notice that in the two recursive calls to ◁-access ( in the second and the last clause ) , the argument m is incremented to suc m .
That is why we need to include a proof term of m as an argument , which becomes structurally smaller in the recursive calls .
This is how we inform the termination checker that , although m increases , the distance between m and k shrinks .
The proof of n ≤ k , on the other hand , is used to establish the contradictions in the first and the third clause .
A Variation of McCarthy's 91 Function
Back to the function f mentioned in the beginning , whose native Agda translation :
f k n with k ≤ ? n
... | yes _ = n
... | no _ = f k ( f k ( suc n ) )
certainly does not pass the termination check .
In fact , the second argument ( n ) to f becomes smaller with respect to ◁ k .
This is obvious for the inner recursive call ( f k ( suc n ) ) since k ≰ n implies n < 1 + n ≤ k .
To prove the termination of the outer recursive call , we have to show that f k n actually computes the maximum of k and n .
Since k ≰ n , we have f k ( suc n ) = k .
Therefore , f k ( suc n ) is smaller than n with respect to ◁ k .
To prove the termination of f we have to prove something about its result .
One of the possible ways to do so is to define :
P : ℕ -> ℕ ->
Set
P k n = ∃ ℕ ( \fn -> n ≤′′ k -> fn ≡ k )
and extend the type of f to :
f : ( k : ℕ ) -> ( n : ℕ ) ->
P k n
Now that f returns an existential type , we have to pattern math its result .
A definition of f may look like :
f k = rec -wf ( ℕ◁ - wf k ) body
where
body : ( i : ℕ ) -> (( j : ℕ ) -> i < j ≤ k -> P k j ) ->
P k i
body n rec with ( k ≤′′ ? n)
... | inj₁ k≤n = exists n (
≤k -> ≤′′-antisym n≤k k≤n )
... | inj₂ n<k with rec ( 1 + n ) ( ≤′′-refl , n< k )
... | exists m 1+n≤ k⇒m≡k with rec m ( n < m , m≤k )
... | exists h m≤k⇒h≡k = exists h ( \_ -> h≡k )
where
m≡k = 1+n≤k⇒m≡k n<k
n<m = ≡- subst ( \i -> n m ≤′′ i ) m≡k ≤′′-ref
h≡k = m≤k⇒h≡k m≤k
However , Agda 's scoping rule with the presence of both with and where still confuses me .
Eventually I had to inline the subordinate proofs , which gives me :
f : ( k : ℕ ) -> ( n : ℕ ) ->
P k n
f k = rec -wf ( ℕ◁ - wf k ) body
where
body : ( i : ℕ ) -> (( j : ℕ ) -> i < j ≤ k -> P k j ) ->
P k i
body n rec with ( k ≤′′ ? n)
... | inj₁ k≤n = exists n (
≤k -> ≤′′-antisym n≤k k≤n )
... | inj₂ n<k with rec ( 1 + n ) ( ≤′′-refl , n< k )
... | exists m 1+n≤ k⇒m≡k with 1+n≤k⇒m≡k n<k
... | m≡k with rec m ( ≡ - subst ( \i -> n m ≤′′ i ) m≡k ≤′′- refl )
... | exists h m≤k⇒h≡k =
exists h ( \_ -> m≤k⇒h≡k ( ≡- subst ( \i -> m ≤′′ i ) m≡k ≤′′ - refl ) )
Unfortunately it looks quite remote from the original f .
Nevertheless , it does pass the termination checker of Agda .

Welcome to Danteworlds ,
an integrated multimedia journey - - combining artistic images , textual commentary , and audio recordings -- through the three realms of the afterlife ( Inferno , Purgatory , Paradise ) presented in Dante 's The site is structured around a visual representation of Dante 's worlds : it shows who and what appear where .
Click on regions within each realm ( circles of Hell , terraces of Purgatory , spheres of Paradise ) to open new pages featuring people and creatures whom the character Dante meets during his journey .
Click on individual figures in the regions to view larger images in pop -up windows .
Available for each region are explanatory notes , a gallery of artistic images , recordings of significant Italian verses , and study questions -- all aimed at enriching the experience of reading Dante 's poetic vision of a voyage literally out of this world .
Danteworlds is conceived as a complement to -- not replacement of -- the experience of reading and discussing Dante's .
It is therefore recommended that you first read the cantos describing a particular region ( click here for links to the text in electronic form ) and then visit that region in Danteworlds .

N - back is a memory test where n refers on how many previous stimuli must be remembered .
Dual means that verbal auditory stimulus and spatial visual stimulus are presented at the same time .
Two memory tests are ran simultaneously and n previous auditory and spatial targets must be remembered separately .
For example , in 2 - back series , target sounds are marked red in the following sequence :
s -d- f- d -s-g- g -d- g -t-d-s-g- s
Visual stimuli are green boxes in one of eight positions around the center box .
Here are shown a sample sequence and target stimuli are colored red :
You can play the game yourself .
Try first single 1 - back , spatial or auditory .
The main task , which is claimed to raise IQ , is dual 2 - back .
For most people it is quite a difficult , so try easy ones first .
Do simple task until you get continuously over 90 % scores and then move on to harder ones .

More in foreclosure choose to walk away
Standing is a living room full of packed boxes , Army Sgt. first class , Nicklaus Skaggs , his daughter , Madisyn Skaggs , 6 months , is debating a voluntary foreclosure on his home of 3 years Vacaville , Calif. , on Thursday , Mar. 13 , 2008 .
The Skagg family bought their for home for $ 455,000 .
Now faced with rising mortgage payments , they figure their property is worth $ 160,000 less than they paid for it .
As their other debts grow they are ready to walk away in order to save themselves from complete financial disaster .

More in foreclosure choose to walk away 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Foreclosure used to be a last resort , something that hard - pressed homeowners would scrimp and plead to avoid .
But as the subprime lending crisis sweeps up millions of borrowers nationwide , some are deliberately choosing foreclosure as an early option .
As their home values tumble and their mortgages rise , these " walk away homeowners " decide to cede their houses to their lenders .
" It 's throwing good money away after bad " to pay an escalating mortgage on a home that 's plunging in value , said Army Sgt. 1st Class Nicklaus Skaggs of Vacaville .
He and his wife , Tishara , stopped paying their mortgage in February .
They signed up with a new company called You Walk Away to help guide them through the multi- month foreclosure process .
The couple paid $ 455,000 for their Vacaville home almost three years ago , shortly after Nicklaus Skaggs returned from a year in Iraq .
Now the home 's value has dropped to $ 290,000 .
Their adjustable - rate mortgage , which started at about $ 3,000 a month , has reset twice , climbing to about $ 4,000 .
They have no regrets about their decision .
" I feel like the pressure has lifted off my shoulders ; before I was trapped , " said Nicklaus Skaggs , 40 , an earnest man who plans to retire from the Army in two years , after completing 20 years of service .
" If we keep paying the mortgage , we would really sink ourselves , " added Tishara Skaggs , 35 , who was an Army specialist driving heavy - wheel trucks until her lupus led to a medical discharge in 2002 .
The Skaggses have two daughters , Tabitha , 7 , and Madisyn , 6 months .
No skin in the game
Walk - aways represent a profound shift in American attitudes toward homeownership - a shift that may have begun with the no-money - down subprime loans .
People who do n't have " skin in the game " - their own cash on the line - feel less attachment to their homes .
People who bought homes expecting rapid appreciation may be quicker to dump them when they do n't perform as expected .
The walk - away phenomenon is common enough that mailing in one 's keys to the lender has earned its own nickname : jingle mail .
In California , purchase mortgages on residences are " nonrecourse , " which means lenders cannot pursue foreclosed homeowners for additional money .
It is clear that many borrowers cede their homes without asking their lender for a break .
More than half of foreclosures involve people who never spoke to their bank , studies show .
Housing counseling agencies said they would never advise clients to surrender to foreclosure without exploring other options .
" It never makes sense to literally just walk away , " said Martin Eichner , director of the HUD program at Project Sentinel in Sunnyvale .
" Even if you 're hopelessly underwater , you should at least try to negotiate a short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure where you give it back voluntarily .
The worst thing to do is to let it go to foreclosure because it goes on your credit report as a black mark that follows you for years to come . "
But some financial experts , such as " mad man of Wall Street " Jim Cramer , say walking away makes economic sense .
" When your house drops 20 percent in value ... it 's better to walk away , even if you 're wealthy , " he said on TheStreet.com TV last summer .
" Because you do n't want to lose your credit card and you do n't want to lose your car .
Your house is the one thing that 's fungible .
It 's smart to walk away . "
New company offers help
You Walk Away ( youwalkaway.com ) , based in San Diego , began in January to assist homeowners who want to let their homes go into foreclosure .
" What if you could live payment free for up to 8 months or more and walk away without owing a penny ? " its
Web site asks prospective customers .
" Unshackle yourself today from a losing investment and use our proven method to Walk Away . "
While going into foreclosure is free - you just stop paying your mortgage - Jon Maddox , co-founder and senior advocate at You Walk Away , said the company provides emotional , practical and legal advice that makes the process more palatable .
Customers pay $ 995 for an advocate to answer questions via phone and e-mail , a letter to their lender to stop dunning phone calls , consultations with a real estate attorney and a CPA , and assistance cleaning up their credit after foreclosure .
You Walk Away has served slightly more than 500 people in its 2 1/2 months of operation , Maddox said .
Maddox said 70 percent of his customers are financially floundering , while 30 percent made an economic decision to walk away .
" They do n't care about their house anymore , " he said .
" It 's a big weight around their neck .
They 're trying to get out of it and get their heads above water again .
They 're paying too much for the title of homeowner . "
You Walk Away operates in California , Nevada , Arizona , Washington , Oregon , Colorado and Florida and is working to set up services for six other states .
Maddox said the 13 - employee staff will triple within a few months .
What about downsides ?
Foreclosure carries a range of financial negatives , but some are not as drastic as people imagine .
Homeowners do not have to declare bankruptcy in a foreclosure ( although some people do so because it temporarily halts the process , giving them more time in their homes ) .
An oft - cited fact is that a foreclosure stays on one 's credit report for seven years .
Many people assume they could not buy another house during that time .
But even the company that crunches numbers to produce credit scores says a foreclosure is not that devastating .
Jennifer Crawford , senior director of product support for Fair Isaac Corp. in San Rafael , said she would tell a homeowner being foreclosed upon : " All is not lost for the long term .
Do not panic .
You can absolutely take a structured approach to getting back in good credit standing .
All other things being equal , in one or two years you can quickly build back up your credit standing . "
The three major credit bureaus all use Fair Isaac 's algorithms to calculate credit scores .
While a foreclosure does stay on a credit report for seven years , its impact declines over time , Crawford said .
" Let 's take a scenario where you have a foreclosure but every other aspect of your credit profile is current - you 've made all payments and have no other derogatories , " she said .
" If that is the situation , probably within a couple of years , you could be back in the high 600s or low 700s " - considered good credit scores .
Crawford said the impact of other steps short of foreclosure - missing payments , arranging a short sale , or returning the house as a deed in lieu of foreclosure - all depends on whether and how the lender reports them to the credit bureaus .
Tax consequences are another downside .
Ordinarily , " canceled debt " such as a foreclosed mortgage is taxed as income .
However , a law passed late last year mitigates this at the federal level until 2009 .
Playing hardball with the bank
Some homeowners are sufficiently savvy - and brash - to try to turn the housing meltdown to their advantage .
A Discovery Bay man who asked not to be identified said he is " upside down " on his house by about $ 260,000 .
Instead of bemoaning the situation , he plans to capitalize on it .
" I refinanced a couple of years ago and pulled out $ 100,000 and put in a fabulous pool , " he said .
" Now I 've got this fabulous pool and fabulous house , but it 's not worth anything .
Why should n't I be building equity over the next four to five years instead of playing catch - up ? "
The man said he has not made a mortgage payment for five months .
" I 'm playing the bank game , " he said .
" I 'm playing chicken with them .
I already got them to agree to put ( the unpaid ) payments on the tail end of the loan .
What I 'm really pushing them to do is to ( adjust my mortgage ) for the current market value and write off the rest .
I 'd love ( to have it ) lopped down to a $ 450,000 basis rather than $ 710,000 . "
If the bank wo n't negotiate , he 'll walk away , the man said .
That kind of story sends chills down bankers ' spines .
To date , most loan modifications have involved freezing interest rates or repayment plans for arrears .
But no less an authority than Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , is now urging lenders to reduce mortgage principals so homeowners wo n't walk away .
" Principal reductions that restore some equity for the homeowner may be a relatively more effective means of avoiding delinquency and foreclosure , " he said in a speech this month .
Not deadbeats
From their online research , the Skaggses know that bloggers have a lot of vitriol for walk - away borrowers , calling them irresponsible and worse .
The couple say they have always paid their bills on time and feel they were given poor advice about both their mortgage and the housing market .
Now they are in limbo , living among unpacked boxes .
They returned a few months ago from a temporary posting to Fort Bliss , Texas , and stopped unpacking when they realized how high their mortgage would soar .
They tried to contact their lender for a loan modification , but found the experience frustrating and their lender unresponsive .
Nicklaus Skaggs will be redeployed this summer , possibly to Iraq again .
After he retires from the Army , they hope to buy a house in his hometown of Louisville , Ky .
In preparation for that shift , he 's studying for a bachelor 's degree via correspondence school and then plans to pursue an MBA .
With no housing expenses during the eight - month - plus foreclosure process , they can save for a down payment , they said .
Since so many people are now swept up in foreclosures , they hope that lenders will extend some grace to people like them , they said .
" In the long run , I think this is the best financial solution , " Nicklaus Skaggs said .
" I have to do what 's right for my family .
I do n't care if someone judges me .
I certainly would n't put my family in a position to lose $ 150,000 if I can help it . "
Battlestar Galactica fans who space out during the show 's end credits are in danger of missing five seconds of bloody good fun .
At the end of each episode , animated versions of the show 's creators hack and slash each other in new and creative ways .
Blood spurts , faces melt , bones dissolve – over the years , Ronald D. Moore and David Eick have been eaten by sharks , beheaded by knights , shot by Cylons and mutilated by many other crazy methods .
The brutally funny black - and - white bits are made by self - taught animator Jerry Hultsch , a high school buddy of Eick 's who has been cooking them up since the series ' inception .
Working alone for the first three seasons , Hultsch used imaginative methods to spoof sci-fi and horror flicks and poke fun at the Galactica brain trust 's creative process .
" I would take hammers to watermelons to make blood splatter , " laughs Hultsch .
Many couch potatoes might miss the clips , known as end - credit logos in industry jargon , if they 're busy switching channels or shutting off their TVs before the final credits roll .
But die - hard Galactica fans who sit through to the bitter end are rewarded each week with a gory glimpse behind the scenes at R&D TV , Moore and Eick 's production company .
The cartoony clips deliver a refreshing blast of B - movie humor that 's a perfect foil for the space opera 's somber themes .
While every TV show has a show - closing production logo , they 're usually not as creative as Galactica's .
In one minisode , Moore squishes Eick into a ball and shoots him into the office basketball hoop .
Other than a few things made in 2 - D animation , all elements in Hultsch 's clips are real .
Actual people model for Eick's and Moore 's bodies in front of a green screen .
Then the actors ' heads are erased frame by frame in Photoshop and After Effects , and cylindrical necks are pasted onto the headless bodies .
Photographs of Eick's and Moore 's heads are slapped onto the necks and their expressions are painted .
The whole process takes as long as cel animation .
" Everyone who sees these logos thinks they 're [ computer generated ] because the precision is so exact , " said Eick in an e-mail interview .
" But the truth is they 're better than CG – more personalized , more human , more artful than CG can ever be . "
Over the past three seasons , Hultsch has played every role in the production of 50 skits , including writer , designer , animator , voice actor and Foley artist .
" I 'm pushing 40 and I was staying up several nights in a row to make deadlines , " says Hultsch .
" It 's an unbelievable amount of work for one person . "
For season four , Hultsch started an animation studio in Arizona and hired a team of 20 interns to work on the clips .
What used to take him up to four weeks now takes the studio five days .
As a result , this season 's end - credit logos will be a bit more elaborate than previous efforts , riffing on movies from different genres and paying homage to great directors like Alfred Hitchcock , Ridley Scott and Stanley Kubrick .
A special guest appearance by the Galactica cast is planned for an upcoming animation .
The idea for the over - the - top logos came after Eick saw a stop- motion short made by Hultsch that featured Star Wars action figures .
Eick was so impressed he asked the former actor to make a logo for R&D TV .
Originally Eick wanted his and Moore 's 2 - D selves to arm - wrestle and break off each others ' appendages each week , but Hultsch thought it would be more interesting if they offed one another in different ways after every episode .
" I thought about what would happen if we had cartoon avatars who could metaphorically ' kill ' each other the way Ron and I would respectfully strangle each other during a story debate or edit room wrestle , " Eick said .
" When the time came for us to decide what the show 's company logo would be , I called Jerry and we started talking about the insanity of a concept where not only would you have this violent , irreverent ' story ' that must be told in no more than five seconds , but that it would change every week .
I still can't believe he pulled it off and the truth is he 's the one bleeding and dying to make it happen .
But hey .
It sure is funny . "
The big cheeses at the Sci-Fi Channel have been so impressed with the logos that they 're now negotiating with Hultsch to make webisodes for the channel 's website .
Beyond the novelty of seeing a new animated bit each week , there 's another bonus for Galactica fans : Hultsch embeds easter eggs in the animated closers .
The names of directors and writers of movies being spoofed can be seen on binders atop file cabinets in the office scenes .
Hultsch drives any cars that appear in the background , is pictured in a photo on the execs ' office wall and plays a nerdy thug who appears in animations from seasons one and four .
While Hultsch likes making cameos , he said what he enjoys most is " robbing David Eick of his masculinity any time I can . "
Senator Barack Obama won a commanding victory in the North Carolina primary on Tuesday and lost narrowly to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in Indiana , an outcome that injected a boost of momentum to Mr. Obama ’s candidacy as the Democratic nominating contest entered its final month .
The results from the two primaries , the largest remaining Democratic ones , assured that Mr. Obama would widen his lead in pledged delegates over Mrs. Clinton , providing him with new ammunition as he seeks to persuade Democratic leaders to coalesce around his campaign .
He also increased his lead in the popular vote in winning North Carolina by more than 200,000 votes .
“ Do n’t ever forget that we have a choice in this country , ” Mr. Obama said in an address in Raleigh , N.C. , that carried the unity themes of a convention speech .
“ We can choose not to be divided ; that we can choose not to be afraid ; that we can still choose this moment to finally come together and solve the problems we ’ve talked about all those other years in all those other elections . ”
In winning North Carolina by 14 percentage points , Mr. Obama  whose campaign had been embattled by controversy over the incendiary remarks of his former pastor  recorded his first primary victory in nearly two months .
His campaign was preparing to open a new front in his battle with Mrs. Clinton , intensifying the argument to uncommitted Democratic superdelegates that he weathered a storm and that the time was dawning for the party to concentrate on the general election .

The bomber jacket comes complete with fur collar and detailed bomber nose art on the back of the " Millennium Falcon " .
The figure comes with a gun , the German Mauser , which was actually the base for the prop used in the Star Wars movies .
Chewbacca
The Chewbacca figure continues the look of the bomber crew .
Chewbacca 's uniforms shows the rebel insignia and his name on his chest .
His machine gun is a modified Thompson made to be reminiscent of Chewie 's crossbow .
Luke Skywalker ( Rebel Pilot )
The Luke Skywalker figure has a slightly more stylized look .
The figure bares the resemblance of actor Mark Hamill .
His removable helmet displays the rebel logo and removable goggles that can be lowered and raised .
The orange leather is reminiscent of the classic orange jumpsuit from the films .
The figure comes with a parachute and chest pouch that is suggestive of the control panel on Luke 's jumpsuit .
Although not very accurate to the WWII era , you can not have Luke with out the lightsaber .
The lightsaber looks like an older flashlight , has a removable blade and is connected to a battery worn on the belt .
Imperial Snowtrooper
The Imperial Snowtrooper is based on the look of WWII soldiers during the siege of Stalingrad .
The troopers face still obscured , but by a scarf this time not by a face plate .
The goggles have the look of the classic helmet 's visor and the helmet has the classic Nazi flared edges .
The long coat that juts out is suggestive of the skirt worn by the film 's version and the hard ammo pouches are like those of the film as well .
Imperial Biker Scout
The Imperial Biker Scout is a blend of a Nazi motorcycle soldier and the film 's Biker Scout .
The chest armor and pouches are suggestive of the classic look .
He wears a German Luger on his boot , like his movie counterpart .
The bike is of classic WWII design but has the same color scheme as the speederbike and the saddlebags which are suggestive of the rear of the speederbike .
Darth Vader
The main idea behind this figure was to ' devolve ' the suit into something that resembles 40's technology .
The helmet is basically a glorified gas mask , and the chest box is intended to look like an old - fashioned guage .
The uniform is n't 100 % Nazi , but I wanted to have the armband with an imperial symbol instead of a swastika .
The base figure is a LOTR prologue elf .
Stormtrooper
This was the first concept that solidified in my mind when Sillof approached me about this concept .
This was perhaps the most literal fusion of Star Wars and WWII aesthetics , and I am quite pleased with the result .
The base figure is a ML Longshot , with Gambit hands .
Boba Fett
I wanted Fett to look like he was wearing chunks of damaged , modified tank armor .
The missing hand was an afterthought , but I thought it would be an extreme and amusing divergence from the character 's usual appearance .
He 's the least successful in terms of capturing the intended period , but he makes for a menacing Mandalorian .
Base figure is a ML Bullseye , with ML Punisher boots .

Whores no more .
On the job , the key for many of us is adapting by adopting — an alternate personality , that is .
But some jobs arouse emotions and sensations that are too overwhelming for the conscious mind .
In the process called splitting , we shunt those off to a kind of branch line of our consciousness .
Sex work is such a job .
Its laborers often find the only way to survive is by putting as much distance as possible between their real and work selves .
The lack of self - respect inherent in these evasion tactics is magnified by the need to hide the nature of their work from loved ones .
If only because of the contortions into which many are forced to twist their psyches , sex workers deserve as much respect as those tilling any field .
Granting them the legal right to organize and providing them with protection under labor and employment laws would be a start .
Is that likely to happen anytime soon ?
It ’s tough to say .
But , due to its prevalence on the Internet , porn has begun to gain acceptance with segments of society hitherto unacquainted with it .
Such as teenage girls , some of whom not only dress , but undress , like porn stars , after which they seem to have no qualms about being videotaped .
Others , less bold , avoid condemning porn out of fear that boys will think a girl is a buzzkill .
It ’s the reverse of the way girls were slimed as sluts in previous generations .
But the effect is the same .
Second , we all know how the opportunity to make big money confers status on any enterprise .
If gangster rap , spawned , in part , by the crack culture , can find a home on MTV , why ca n’t porn break through ?
In a May 15 Rolling Stone article , “ The Sex Queen of L.A. ” ( not available online ) , Vanessa Gregoriadis chronicles how a California madam named Michelle “ Nici ” Braun was sought out by Turkish billionaire Hakan Uzan .
“ The money and word - of - mouth business that Nici received from Uzan enabled her to do what no madam had done before : create a new high end of the escort industry .
. . .
Prominent athletes , TV stars and Fortune 500 CEOs .
. . flocked to Nici for access to her elite clientele .
. . the pinnacle of L.A. beauty .
. . models for Maxim and FHM , big - name porn stars and Playmates . . . a Survivor : China contestant and [ a ] WWE star . ”
The magazine models and Survivor contestant may have had no other immediate prospects .
Along with the WWE star , though , the porn stars had careers , however short - term .
But it seems a porn career is n’t what it was .
“ There is no real money to be made anymore , ” Gregoriadis writes .
There are too many “ girls willing to show the world their nakedness , no matter how hot they are .
. . . willing to be ogled [ on the Web ] for next to nothing . ”
They ’ve been replaced at the strip clubs they used to tour for extra money by women at least as attractive willing to work for less money .
“ For Playmates and porn stars , ” Georgiadis writes , “ there ’s only one way left to supplement their income : meeting fans in private settings . ”
In fact , porn- industry journalist Luke Ford told Georgiadis , “ Almost every porn star is an escort now . ”
It ’s not just in pornography where the stars are doing the mountain - comes - to - Mohammed act .
In the music industry , file - sharing is not only eviscerating the sales of CDs , but cutting into those of MP3 files as well .
Except for top acts , recorded music is now viewed as a promotional tool to draw fans to performances , where the real money is made .
Both fields are also paralleled by the lecture circuit , where people are making more money speaking than on whatever made them famous in the first place .
It ’s true that the Internet has depressed the music and sex industries .
But at least it ’s yielded a nugget of irony .
Musicians spending more time on the road than ever and porn stars making social calls runs counter to the Internet ’s reputation for facilitating isolation , whether it ’s in the form of cocooning or agoraphobia .
Consumers and providers are face to face again .
Meanwhile , will escort services every be unconditionally accepted in the mainstream of American life ?
Give a madam her own reality show and we ’ll see what shakes out .
Bush Family ties to funding the Nazis during WWII

Abbreviated Parody of Paul Graham's ' Boss '
People are n't meant to have a spouse .
I saw some married people in the cafe the other day and something seemed wrong .
They were n't passionate .
I have a unique perspective on human relations , having been an eligible bachelor and active user of various dating websites since the category 's inception over 10 years ago .
Long term monogamous relationships are especially hard on people .
Relationships are passionate early on , so why bother having one for longer than that ?
Structurally , long term relationships often lead to kids .
Kids are complex .
And difficult to fund .
Funding them with credit cards is stupid .
For both reasons long term relationships should be avoided .
Now , it 's not your partner 's fault .
I saw lions and monkeys in Africa one time .
Monkeys do n't get married , and neither do lions .
They 're both happy , so people should n't either .
Also , nonmonogamy is definitely something that can be learned .
At AshleyMadison.com , we help married people come out of their shells and find other people willing to overcome the straight - jacket of the married / long term monogamous life .
Having seen that happen so many times is one of the things that convinces me that being non-monogamous , at least in a small group , is the natural way for people to live .
Watching previously faithful , married , and , frankly dull people get transformed into passion - filled ' players ' makes it clear that the difference between the two is due mostly to environment — and in particular that the environment in long - term relationships is toxic to people .
In the first couple weeks of working on their first affair they seem to come to life , because finally they 're living hedonistically the way people are meant to .
THE END Sorry , I could n't resist .

Tens of thousands of children have been orphaned by the HIV pandemic
The US is set to spend $ 50 bn to battle HIV / Aids in the next five years .
The US House of Representatives has passed a bill to more than triple government spending in Africa and other badly affected parts of the world .
The bipartisan measure , which is backed by the White House , was passed by 308 votes to 116 .
The bill marks a huge increase from the $ 15bn authorised during the first five years of an initiative launched by President Bush in 2003 .
" There is a moral imperative to combat this epidemic , " said Nancy Pelosi , the House 's Democratic speaker .
The initiative would be the largest US investment ever against a single disease .
Last May , Mr Bush asked Congress to set aside $ 30bn for the plan , aimed at providing treatment for 2.5 million people and preventing more than 12 million new infections .
The programme currently supports life - saving treatment for nearly 1.5 million people , the White House said .
Initially focused on Vietnam , Guyana , Haiti and 12 African nations , the programme will be expanded to include Malawi , Swaziland and Lesotho as well as some Caribbean nations .
Opponents of the bill argued that it was too expensive , and that more pressing needs closer to home needed to be addressed .
The UN estimates that two - thirds of the 33 million people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - the virus that causes Aids - live in sub-Saharan Africa .
We ’re entering into dangerous territory with one of our presidential candidates .
And I do n’t mean dangerous in the sense Hillary claims – that she “ risked her life ” during multiple secret agent missions while she was juggling planning the White House Christmas party and solving world peace ( if she ’d only been First Lady during the Cold War think of the billions we could have saved by her single - handedly bringing down the Soviet Union ) .
We ’re entering the “ just because she says it does n’t make it true ” territory .
It ’s a category we traditionally reserve for George Bush and Republicans .
As we are all very well aware , Hillary Clinton is touting her foreign policy credentials .
When asked to name them , she provides some examples :
You know , I was involved for 15 years in , you know , foreign policy and security policy .
You know , I helped to bring peace to Northern Ireland .
I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo .
I ’ve been standing up against , you know , the Chinese government over women ’s rights and standing up for human rights in many different places .
I ’ve served on the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Noticeably , no mention of her votes on Iraq and Iran .
But , let ’s look at what she said .
Let ’s see if it ’s true .
NORTHERN IRELAND
On Northern Ireland , via Ben Smith , Clinton ’s claim is harshly disabused and called “ silly ” by the Nobel laureate who actually brought peace to Northern Ireland :
Hillary Clinton had no direct role in bringing peace to Northern Ireland and is a “ wee bit silly ” for exaggerating the part she played , according to Lord Trimble of Lisnagarvey , the Nobel Peace Prize winner and former First Minister of the province .
“ I do n’t know there was much she did apart from accompanying Bill [ Clinton ] going around , ” he said .
Her recent statements about being deeply involved were merely “ the sort of thing people put in their canvassing leaflets ” during elections .
“ She visited when things were happening , saw what was going on , she can certainly say it was part of her experience .
I do n’t want to rain on the thing for her but being a cheerleader for something is slightly different from being a principal player . ”
Cross Northern Ireland off .
KOSOVO
On Kosovo , CNN actually fact - checked :
In May of 1999 , she was in Macedonia visiting refugee camps near the Kosovo border and meeting with Macedonia ’s president and prime minister .
Sources with knowledge of her visit say she discussed the refugees ’ plight with those leaders .
It ’s not clear how much she helped since CNN reported at the time that Macedonia reopened its border to Kosovar refugees before Clinton ’s visit .
More on her dare - devil mission to Kosovo :
The dictum around the Oval Office in the ’90s , she added , was : “ If a place was too dangerous , too poor or too small , send the first lady . ”
It turns out that Clinton was n’t quite flying solo into harm ’s way that day .
She was , in fact , leading a goodwill entourage that included baggy - pants funnyman Sinbad , singer Sheryl Crow and Clinton ’s daughter , Chelsea , then 15 .
So , if a place was “ too dangerous , ” Hillary took her 15 year old kid , Sinbad and Sheryl Crow with ?
Oops .
Cross that one off , too .
So , based on the examples Clinton provided , it looks like her foreign policy experience actually is based on one speech she made in 1995 .
How ironic .
I do n’t mean to belittle Hillary here , but she has developed a recent history of inflating her resume in a way that will lead to some pretty laughable and damaging GOP ads come the fall general election .
It ’s “ Al Gore created the Internet ” all over again .
That was never what Gore actually claimed , but the right wing pushed it so hard that the media adopted it .
Hillary does have some strong experience .
But , most Americans are n’t going to believe that the First Lady , when not reading to children , was actually knee - capping terrorists a la Jack Bauer .
Clinton loaned $ 6.4 million to campaign last month John Byrne
Published : Wednesday May 7 , 2008

Print This Email This Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) loaned $ 6.4 million to her presidential campaign last month , according to her campaign .
Clinton 's communications director Howard Wolfson told MSNBC that she 's " invested " in the race and may funnel more of her own money into the campaign down the road .
" She certainly does n't rule it out , " Wolfson remarked .
An adviser also told Wednesday 's New York Times that her campaign was " essentially broke . "
According to AP , " That brings to $ 11.4 million the amount of personal funds Clinton has put toward her campaign to date , though aides said donors had subsequently chipped in to cover the $ 5 million loan she made herself earlier this year .
Barack Obama 's fund - raising advantage left Clinton with little choice but to give herself money .
The $ 6.4 million is likely to have helped her fund a rush of TV ads in Indiana and North Carolina in the closing days before yesterday 's primaries . "
" Clinton advisers acknowledged that the results of the primaries were far less than they had hoped , and said they were likely to face new pleas even from some of their own supporters for her to quit the race , " the Times reported .
" They said they expected fund - raising to become even harder ; one adviser said the campaign was essentially broke , and several others refused to say whether Mrs. Clinton had lent the campaign money from her personal account to keep it afloat . "
" The advisers said they were dispirited over the loss in North Carolina , after her campaign  now working off a shoestring budget as spending outpaces fund - raising  decided to allocate millions of dollars and full days of the candidate and her husband in the state .
Even with her investment , Mr. Obama outspent Mrs. Clinton in both states . "
Strategist says only winners are cable news shows Democratic strategist Tim McKay from On Point Communications in Raleigh , NC told RAW STORY : " I 've said all along that Hillary is n't going to give up and if the only source of money is hers than she 'll keep on fighting .
We 've all seen their tax returns , they are n't hurting as much as the middle class is . "
" I do n't know what it accomplishes to continue fighting a battle that is unwinnable , " McKay added , " but that does n't seem to be what it 's about for her .
She 'll keep going as long as she can and ... unless the superdelegates take a position .
What will turn the tide is the superdelegates .
It looks more and more like the Clintons are looking toward Michigan and Florida and if everything else stays the same , she 'll keep slamming her foot in the door and looking to pry loose the delegates .
It 's up to the superdelegates who are uncommitted [ to commit ] and end this thing . "
McKay went on to say that the big winners in keeping this race alive are the cable news shows .
" Their ratings have soared and they do n't want them to go down , " he said .
" The superdelegates can end this .
They have to begin to take a position that Obama is the right candidate , no matter how much money she puts into her campaign . "

Alternative boondoggles
The direct cost to the US government of the war and occupation of Iraq — counting only funds appropriated by Congress — so far runs to roughly $ 523 Bn .
However , that 's the direct cost — money directly spent on the project .
There are indirect costs , too : Joseph Stiglitz estimates the true cost of the war to be $ 3Tn to the United States , and $ 3Tn to the rest of the global economy .
These are indirect costs , and factor in the long - term additional expenses that the war has accrued — everything from caring for brain - damaged soldiers for the next 50 years through to loss of economic productivity attributable to instabilities in the supply of oil from Iraq .
We can tap - dance around the indirect costs , but the direct costs ( that headline figure of $ 523 Bn ) are inarguable .
So .
What fun boondoggles could we have bought with either $ 523 Bn ( at the low end ) or $ 6Tn ( at the high end ) ?
NASA have plans for a manned Mars expedition based on the Ares spacecraft they 're developing as a replacement for the Space Shuttle .
Price estimates vary from $ 20 Bn ( presumably for a single round - trip ) to $ 450 Bn ( presumably for a single round trip plus all the externalities , like developing the spacecraft and equipment and conducting a thorough prior reconnaissance using unmanned landers ) .
Either way , the direct costs of the Iraq war exceed the maximum cost estimate for a manned Mars expedition , infrastructure and all , by 20 % .
If we take $ 20 Bn as the cost per mission and $ 450 Bn as the cost to develop the technology to go there , the direct cost of the Iraq war would be sufficient to develop a gold - plated Mars expeditionary capability and send six crews of astronauts to Mars ( and bring them back afterwards ) .
Going by Stiglitz 's indirect estimates , the picture is even more ludicrous ; for $ 3Tn , assuming a crew of four per expedition , $ 20 Bn per flight , and a basic $ 450 start - up price , you could send 510 astronauts to Mars .
That 's not a Mars exploration program , that 's a battalion !
It 's a small colony !
Regular readers will be familiar with my opinion of plans to colonize Mars ... but if you throw enough money at a scheme you can probably get something out of it , even if it 's only another Darien Scheme .
Or perhaps we could tackle global warming by building nuclear reactors .
Westinghouse AP1000 PWRs cost roughly $ 2 Bn a pop and have a net output of 1117 Mw ( 1.12 Gw ) .
For $ 513
Bn we could probably negotiate a bulk discount of , say , 20 % , in which case we 're good for 320 reactors , or about 375 Gw of output .
Our entire planetary civilization consumes about 16Tw , but the USA accounts for about 40 % of that , so we could buy , outright , the equivalent of 6 % of the US 's energy budget .
But this stuff pays for itself ( it 's producing electricity , a fungible commodity ) and in actual fact , 50 % of the USA 's energy budget is coal , burned for juice .
So we could cut 12 % of the USA 's coal - sourced carbon emissions , enabling the USA to not only meet but exceed the Kyoto protocol requirements using a single , fiendishly expensive gambit ( and treating it not as capital investment but as expenditure ) .
For $ 6Tn we could buy a lot of juice — a quarter of our global civilization 's energy budget would go carbon - neutral at a stroke .
( Yes , we just solved our carbon dioxide emissions problem by switching to a nuclear economy . )
This probably is n't the ideal way of dealing with our environmental problems , and it's a naive treatment of the costs ( has anyone done a proper treatment of the economic implications of shifting the planet over to a nuclear economy , say to the same extent as France ? ) but it 's thought - provoking .
Finally , there 's all the other little stuff we could solve by pointing $ 513 Bn at it , never mind $ 6000 Bn .
Eliminating childhood diseases in South - East Asia ?
Piffle — Bill and Melinda Gates are trying to do that out of their pocket lint .
Build first - world grade housing in shiny new cities for 600 million Chinese peasants , nearly a tenth of the planetary population ?
Yes , this budget will cover that .
What else ?
Yes , I 'm asking you : what would you do with the cost of the Iraq war ( take your pick : $ 513 Bn or $ 6000 Bn ) in your budget ?
Colonise Mars ?
Solve our carbon emission problem and fix global warming ?
House half a billion people ?
Or something else ...?
( And what is n't going to happen now , because we pissed it all away on the desert sands ? )

A major study published in Nature Nanotechnology suggests some forms of carbon nanotubes -- a poster child for the " nanotechnology revolution " -- could be as harmful as asbestos if inhaled in sufficient quantities .
The study used established methods to see if specific types of nanotubes have the potential to cause mesothelioma -- a cancer of the lung lining that can take 30 - 40 years to appear following exposure .
The results show that long , thin multi- walled carbon nanotubes that look like asbestos fibers , behave like asbestos fibers .
Discovered nearly 20 years ago , carbon nanotubes have been described as the wonder material of the 21st Century .
Light as plastic and stronger that steel , they are being developed for use in new drugs , energy - efficient batteries and futuristic electronics .
But since their discovery , questions have been raised about whether some of these nanoscale materials may cause harm and undermine a nascent market for all types of carbon nanotubes , including multi- and single - walled carbon nanotubes .
Leading forecasting firms say sales of all nanotubes could reach $ 2 billion annually within the next four to seven years , according to an article in the U.S. publication Chemical & Engineering News .
" This study is exactly the kind of strategic , highly focused research needed to ensure the safe and responsible development of nanotechnology , " says Andrew Maynard , Chief Science Advisor to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies and a co-author on the paper .
" It looks at a specific nanoscale material expected to have widespread commercial applications and asks specific questions about a specific health hazard .
Even though scientists have been raising concerns about the safety of long , thin carbon nanotubes for over a decade , none of the research needs in the current U.S. federal nanotechnology environment , health and safety risk research strategy address this question . "
Widespread exposure to asbestos has been described as the worst occupational health disaster in U.S. history and the cost of asbestos - related disease is expected to exceed $ 200 billion , according to major U.S. think tank RAND Corporation .
Anthony Seaton , MD , a co-author on the paper and a professor emeritus at the University of Aberdeen in the United Kingdom , says , " The toll of asbestos - related cancer , first noticed in the 1950s and 1960s , is likely to continue for several more decades even though usage reduced rapidly some 25 years ago .
While there are reasons to suppose that nanotubes can be used safely , this will depend on appropriate steps being taken to prevent them from being inhaled in the places they are manufactured , used and ultimately disposed of .
Such steps should be based on research into exposure and risk prevention , leading to regulation of their use .
Following this study , the results of which were foreseen by the Royal Society in the U.K. in 2004 , we can no longer delay investing in such research . "
Researchers , led by Professor Kenneth Donaldson at the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom , examined the potential for long and short carbon nanotubes , long and short asbestos fibers , and carbon black to cause pathological responses known to be precursors of mesothelioma .
Material was injected into the abdominal cavity of mice -- a sensitive predictor of long fiber response in the lung lining .

" The results were clear , " says Donaldson .
" Long , thin carbon nanotubes showed the same effects as long , thin asbestos fibers . "
Asbestos fibers are harmful because they are thin enough to penetrate deep into the lungs , but sufficiently long to confound the lungs ' built - in clearance mechanisms for getting rid of particles .
Donaldson stresses there are still pieces of the puzzle to fill in .
" We still do n't know whether carbon nanotubes will become airborne and be inhaled , or whether , if they do reach the lungs , they can work their way to the sensitive outer lining .
But if they do get there in sufficient quantity , there is a chance that some people will develop cancer -- perhaps decades after breathing the stuff , " states Donaldson .
There is a silver lining to this research .
According to Donaldson , " Short or curly carbon nanotubes did not behave like asbestos , and by knowing the possible dangers of long , thin carbon nanotubes , we can work to control them .
It 's a good news story , not a bad one .
It shows that carbon nanotubes and their products could be made to be safe . "
But Donaldson added that the present study only tested for fiber - like behavior and did not exonerate carbon nanotubes from damaging the lungs in other ways .
" More research is still needed if we are to understand how to use these materials as safely as possible , " he notes .
Carbon nanotubes are atom - thick sheets of graphite formed into cylinders .
They may be formed from a single layer of graphite or they may consist of multiple concentric layers of graphite , resulting in multi- walled carbon nanotubes .
While the diameter of a nanotube can vary from a few nanometers up to tens of nanometers , they can be hundreds or even thousands of nanometers long .
Carbon nanotubes come in many forms , with different shapes , different atomic arrangements , and varying amounts and types of added chemicals -- all of which affect their properties and might influence their impact on human health and the environment .
" This is a wakeup call for nanotechnology in general and carbon nanotubes in particular , " says Maynard .
" As a society , we cannot afford not to exploit this incredible material , but neither can we afford to get it wrong -- as we did with asbestos . "
" FXRuby : Create Lean and Mean GUIs with Ruby " is a new book by Lyle Johnson about FXRuby , a Ruby GUI library built on the FOX Toolkit .
The publisher , The Pragmatic Programmers , made an exclusive sample chapter available to InfoQ 's readers : " Chapter 8 : Building Simple Widgets " ( PDF ) .

FOX toolkit
implementation
each
We talked to , author of the book and maintainer of FXRuby , about theand FXRuby 's design and : FXRuby is built on the FOX Toolkit .
Could you give a quick overview of its characteristics - i.e. native widgets vs. emulated widgets and supported platforms .
Does it have any particular features / concepts / strengths that make it stick out from the sea of GUI toolkits ? : FOX is a fast and lightweight GUI toolkit , implemented in C ++.
It is cross-platform and works well not only the more popular operating systems ( such as Windows , Mac OS X and Linux ) but also on a number of other more obscure Unix - ish operating systems .
FOX uses lightweight ( non-native ) widgets , which means that FOX relies on only the basic drawing capabilities of the host platform instead of providing wrappers around existing ( native ) widgets .
This approach offers a lot of advantages , including consistent behavior across platforms and more opportunities for extensibility .
FOX offers some really innovative and unique solutions to problems like event handling and layout , and I think that 's a big part of what distinguishes it from other GUI toolkits .
FOX 's developer has spent a lot of time in the trenches , working with a lot of different kinds of GUI toolkits , and he was able to draw from that experience in building FOX .
He was especially influenced by NeXT , and the API and approach reflect that in a number of ways .
On a little bit higher level , FOX has especially strong support for 3 - D visualization ( using OpenGL ) , and that draws a lot of people to FOX as well . :
Who 's behind the FOX Toolkit - are there notable apps built with it ( not necessarily Ruby apps ) ? : FOX is developed by Jeroen van der Zijp , an old friend and former co-worker of mine .
Jeroen originally developed FOX while we were both working for a company that developed commercial modeling , simulation and analysis software for engineering applications .
Given its origins , it is perhaps not a surprise that FOX is used in a lot of commercial and open source software in that application domain .
For example , commercial companies like ESI Group Simulia and CAE are using FOX for their 3 - D modeling and visualization products .
But we also see FOX and FXRuby used in a number of other sorts of applications , including development tools like FreeRIDE and the Arachno Ruby IDE ; audiovisual tools like the ReZound and Goggles DVD player ; and who knows what else .
It 's sort of difficult to keep track . :
What 's the story behind the FXRuby project ?
What 's your motivation to work on it ? :
When I started working with Ruby in late 2000 , there were n't a lot of options in terms of mature , well - supported cross- platform GUI toolkits for Ruby .
I already had a good bit of experience working with FOX , and with developing a Python binding for FOX , and so it was a really natural thing for me to try to bring FOX to the Ruby community .
I do n't get to use it much in my current " day job " , but I know that a lot of people in the Ruby community do find it useful and that drives me to continue to develop it and make it better . :
How is FXRuby implemented - how much C or C++ code is involved .
How do you map the FOX components into Ruby constructs ?
Is FXRuby capable of using arbitrary FOX components or do you have to map them to Ruby using C/ C++ code ?
What do you use to connect Ruby to Fox - regular C extensions or some C++ bindings ? :
A lot of C++ code is involved , but I use SWIG to automatically generate most of the wrapper code that implements the binding between FOX and Ruby .
FXRuby is n't currently capable of using arbitrary FOX components in a sort of dynamic , plug - and - play type arrangement ; you need to use SWIG to wrap those as well , and follow some of the conventions that I use internally in FXRuby for things like interacting with Ruby 's garbage collector .
A small but growing part of FXRuby is actually implemented in Ruby , however , and I 'd like to move in that direction where it makes sense and does n't seriously impact performance . :
Looking at the FOX toolkit , there seem to be many utilities included as well ( timers , asynchronous I/O , etc ) .
Do you support any of them in FXRuby - if not , which would be interesting to support ? :
I 'm implementing all of the FOX " utility " functionality that I think makes sense at this point : things like handling chores , timeout events and asynchronous I/ O events , as well as services like the registry .
FOX does provide a lot of other really useful classes for things like collections , threads , and regular expressions , but they 're redundant with classes already provided by Ruby 's standard library , so I 'm not exposing those in FXRuby . : How Ruby - fied is FXRuby ?
e.g. does it take blocks where that makes sense ( event handling , etc ) .
Is it possible to use Builder - style GUI definitions ? :
I 've made a lot of effort to make the API " Ruby - fied " .
You can pass blocks as event handlers instead of having to write separate instance methods and hook widgets to those methods .
We use blocks in most other places where you 'd expect to be able to use them as well .
For example , any time you 're dealing with a collection of objects ( like the items in a list widget ) , the widget provides anmethod that you can pass a block to .
You can construct GUIs in a nested fashion , to some extent , since each widget 's constructor takes a block into which it passes a reference to the widget being constructed .
So , in other words , you 're not having to pollute the local namespace with variables for all of those widgets , and the nested appearance of the code reflects the parent - child relationships between the widgets .
But it 's not a DSL like Builder ; you 're still explicitly constructing objects . :
How does FXRuby and it's event handling interact with Ruby 1.8.x threading ?
Eg. if a Ruby thread issues a blocking , long running syscall - is the FXRuby GUI blocked too ?
In the other direction : how 's the event queue of FXRuby implemented ?
If no GUI event come into the FXRuby queue - are other Ruby threads blocked ( ie. does FXRuby block on event fetching ) . :
Dealing with threads in FXRuby has always been somewhat of a problem , due to Ruby 's threads implementation .
What I never want to do is require the user to use a patched version of FOX or Ruby , so we have to find ways to work around the two systems ' event loops .
Basically , what we do is set up a chore in FXRuby that yields a small slice of time to Ruby 's thread scheduler whenever we get some idle time in the GUI .
So yes , if a Ruby thread issues a blocking call , FXRuby 's going to get blocked too .
Now , on the flip side , Ruby threads should n't ever be blocked by FXRuby in practice .
It could happen in theory , if the event loop stays so busy that there is no idle time to give up , but that tends to indicate a problem in the application code that needs to be addressed . : Does Ruby 1.9's threading system ( native threads + Big VM Lock ) require any changes or does it offer opportunities ( for FXRuby ) that were n't possible before ? :
The changes for threads in Ruby 1.9 required only minimal changes for FXRuby to maintain the same basic approach as we use for Ruby 1.8 .
I think Ruby 1.9's threading system might offer some opportunities that were n't possible before , however .
I 'm still trying to get a handle on exactly how threads are implemented in 1.9 before I start making any changes , keeping in mind that I need to at least make it appear backwards - compatible with the Ruby 1.8 implementation ( i.e. it 's OK that an FXRuby application runs faster under Ruby 1.9 , but it's not OK if it exhibits fundamentally different behavior ) . :
What 's FXRuby 's or the FOX Toolkit 's strategy for layout management ?
Can you compare its layout management to other toolkits ( not so much about whether Fox is better / worse , but mostly so readers can get an idea what kind of layout managers to expect ) .
Do you have or know of any ways of making layout management ( with FXRuby or FOX ) easier - e.g. using Builder notation or something like Profligacy 's LEL : FOX provides a number of different kinds of layout managers , covering both the basic needs to arrange widgets side by side in a form as well as some more complicated layout situations ( like split panes and scrolling windows ) .
A significant difference between FOX's and some other toolkits ' approaches to layout management is that in FOX , the layout managers are widgets just like any other widget .
You create widgets as children of a particular parent widget ( a container ) and then set layout hints on those child widgets that indicate to the parent how those widgets should be laid out ( e.g. this widget should stretch to take up as much horizontal space as possible , but this widget over here should maintain a fixed width ) .
For people who like interactive GUI layout tools , there 's Meinrad Recheis ' foxGUIb .
There have been a number of attempts to provide a sort of DSL for GUI layout , but as best I can tell , none of those has really taken off .
Lance Carlson 's Anvil project ( which sort - of addresses this issue ) looks promising but it 's still in an early stage . :
Have you tried out FXRuby with other Ruby versions beside Ruby 1.8.x ?
What about Ruby 1.9 or systems like Rubinius , maybe MacRuby ?
Do these systems have features that would help you - in any way - to make FXRuby even better ? : FXRuby already works with Ruby 1.9 , although I do n't know how many people are really taking advantage of that yet .
I have only just started looking into what it will take to support for Rubinius , but that is definitely the next platform that I 'm planning on targeting .
MacRuby 's not out of the question , but I just do n't know what the technical issues are or , for that matter , how much sense it would even make to try run on that platform ( given that it 's Mac OS X only ) .
And of course there are some platforms , like JRuby and IronRuby , that will probably never be supported due to the implementation approach .

I ’m just trying to figure out how being First Lady or First Gentleman ( Sir Dennis Thatcher comes to mind ) somehow prepares you for being Commander in Chief of our entire armed forces during war time .
( Or as one of our readers put it : “ Would anyone let a brain surgeon ’s husband operate on them ? ” )
No one wants to ask the forbidden question , but since Hillary is now saying , repeatedly , that John McCain has more experience to be president than Barack Obama , maybe it ’s time that Hillary tell us how Laura Bush is qualified to take the country into war .
The half - dozen activists - Twyman , a former Miss Washington DC , the owner of a small construction company and two volunteers at a local soup kitchen - joined hands , bowed their heads and intoned a heartfelt prayer .
" Lord , come down in a mighty way and strengthen us so that we can bring down these high gas prices , " Twyman said to a chorus of " amens " .
" Prayer is the answer to every problem in life .
We call on God to intervene in the lives of the selfish , greedy people who are keeping these prices high , " Twyman said on the forecourt of the petrol station in a neighbourhood of Washington that , like many of its residents , has seen better days .
" Lord , the prices at this pump have gone up since last week .
We know that you are able , that you have all the power in the world , " he prayed , before former beauty queen Rashida Jolley led the group in a modified version of the spiritual , We Shall Overcome .
" We 'll have lower gas prices , we 'll have lower gas prices , " they sang .
At the weekend , Twyman had led a group of around 200 people in prayer at pumps in San Francisco , where petrol is nearing $ US4 a gallon ( 3.8 litres ) .
Last week , US lawmakers and experts at a congressional hearing on Capitol Hill painted a grim picture of how Americans are being hammered by record fuel costs and the steepest food price spikes in 17 years .
" We pay more to drive to the supermarket , and then get hit with higher prices when we get there , " Senator Charles Schumer told the hearing .
Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney said Americans have been forced by soaring prices to go on a " recession diet " .
" In some areas of the country , people are paying four dollars for both a gallon of milk and a gallon of gas , " and are substituting meats , fish and vegetables with cheaper pasta and canned foods , Maloney said .
On the forecourt of the Washington Shell station , retiree Rufus Simpkin was feeling the pain at the pump and praying for relief .
" I 'm having to spend much more on gas , and I am retired , " he said .
" It is really hitting me and my family hard . "
Marcia Frazier - Foster was filling up her car for the long drive home to Laurel , a suburb from which she commutes 53 kilometres , four days a week to work in a Washington soup kitchen , serving hot meals to scores of men who have fallen on tough times .
" The cost of food has gone up , quantities we get from the food bank have gone down .
The cost at the gas station has gone up and that means I spend more money to get here , " she said after joining the prayer for fuel prices to come down .
" Yet I do n't see anyone in power really concerned about the high gas prices - President Bush does n't even think we 're in a recession , " she lamented .
Americans have turned to prayer because the earthly powers - that - be do n't seem to give a hoot , said Judy Dugan , a research director at Consumer Watchdog , a non-profit group based in California .
She described Prayer at the Pump as " the ultimate Hail Mary " .
" It 's what you do when you feel you have no one on your side , and they certainly do n't have the US government on their side on this , " Dugan said .
At the Shell station , Twyman had dire words of warning for those who are raking in profits from high fuel prices .
" Woe be unto those people that are really greedy and taking advantage of American families , " he proclaimed from his pump pulpit .
" These prices will come down , just like the walls of Jericho came down in the Bible , " he said , as another chorus of amens punctuated the sound of cash flowing out of the pumps .

The cultural stereotype of infidelity is well entrenched :
The lousy , cheating husband who destroys his family makes frequent appearances in the advice columns of women 's magazines and is a stock character ( usually played opposite a vulnerable Valerie Bertinelli - type ) in made - for - TV movies .
Yet the problem of female infidelity is equally serious , particularly when it results in the birth of a child .
When a woman strays , how can a man know if the child is really his ?
Maury Povich has made paternity testing a staple of his TV ...
[ Note : I ask that people not bug the person mentioned in the code as he is retired and is not often in his office .
We do n't want to bombard him with inquiries about this code !
Thanks for understanding . ]
A little over a year ago , the Fermilab Office of Public Affairs received a curious letter in code ( see the image to the right ) .
It has been sitting in our files all that time and we have n't had much of a chance to look into breaking the code , nor are we particularly expert at this !
If you have a cryptological bent , perhaps you 'd take a crack at this code and email us anything you find at letters@symmetrymagazine.org .
Note that this scan is from a fax of the original .
The holes punched in it were not in the original and a tiny sliver has been cut off the top of the page where the fax information was printed .
I 'm hoping that the precise positioning on the page is n't relevant !
Update ( May 16 , 2008 ) : A few people have been asking for more information about the physical letter that arrived as it could contain clues .
Here are answers to some of your questions and any other information that might be relevant .
The letter came delivered by USPS on Mar 5 , 2007 , addressed to :
Fermilab
Kirk Rd. & Pine
Batavia , IL 60510
It was hand addressed but came in an envelope where you pull on the ends for it to come apart .
It was postmarked in Chicago but I can't read any more details on the faxed version I have .
( I shall try to get the original . )
The image here is now lower resolution than I had posted originally as it seems there probably is n't anything encoded in the finest details .
You can still download a ( > 4MB ) version here .
Further update ( May 20 , 2008 ) : We are close to a solution and suspect we know the sender of the letter !
An emailer " Mike " came close to deciphering the message but , soon after , Daniel Stephens came through with a full decryption of the top and bottom sections of the text .
You can read the partial solutions of the top and bottom sections by a number of people in the comments .
However , I 'm not convinced that the middle section is solved yet .
Any further ideas ?
The spreading word :
This story has spread like wildfire around the Web , even leading to requests to do news stories on network TV news but I had n't expected this to be turned into a cartoon !
Check it out at userfriendly.org .
July 11 , 2008 : The Chicago Tribune wrote about the code today .
July 25 , 2008 : A new clue has emerged !
See the post that just went up , in which Fermilab PR director Judy Jackson writes :
Fermilab assigns employee numbers sequentially .
Robert Wilson , the laboratory ’s legendary first director , was employee number 1 .
Ned Goldwasser , Wilson ’s deputy director , was 007 .
The latest Fermilab hire , as of last Monday , was number 15026 .
According to Fermilab ’s records , Frank Shoemaker was employee number 102 .
In base 16 , I am told , 102 = 66 .
Just announced at the MySQL Partner meeting as part of the MySQL Conference and Expo in Santa Clara , CA :
MySQL will start offering some features ( specifically ones related to online backups ) only in MySQL Enterprise .
This represents a substantive change to their development model — previously they have been developing features in both MySQL Community and MySQL Enterprise .
However , with a shift to offering some features only in MySQL Enterprise , this means a shift to development of those features occurring ( and thus code being tested ) only in MySQL Enterprise .
As I ’ve discussed before , the size of the user base for MySQL Enterprise is much smaller than for MySQL Community .
That means these critical features will be tested by only a few of their customers .
So , in effect , they will be giving their paying customers real , true , untested code .
How is this supposed to work ?
In addition , this means that they are changing their internal development model , splitting the relationship between the two trees , and overall going even further down the path of getting the RHEL / Fedora model backwards .
What do you think about this ?
Leave a comment , I ’m really curious as to everyone ’s feeling on this .
UPDATE : Marten Mickos has just acknowledge that I understood the slide quite correctly , and they will indeed develop new features in MySQL Enterprise ( in 6.0 ) , without making them available in MySQL Community .
Hmm !
I ’ve been looking around , trying to see what the great and the good — or at least those who play such on TV — are starting to say about what should be done .
And I was particularly eager to read this piece , by a top guy from Pimco .
Pimco is a smart outfit , with a deserved reputation for talking frankly about stuff .
So what would Mr. El - Erian say ?
I read it ; and read it again ; and again .
It took me the third reading before I got it .
Why is it so incomprehensible ?
Because what he ’s basically saying is , bail out the investors , do nothing for the homeowners :
Policymakers now face the unpleasant reality of having to cross at least one of two lines in the sand : altering contracts so that stressed mortgage holders can avoid default and foreclosures ; and / or explicitly using the government ’s balance sheet to support the housing market .
…
Crossing the first line critically undermines the sanctity of contracts and , at the very minimum , leads to a persistent increase in the risk premiums that lenders impose on all borrowers .
In addition , there may be unintended consequences that erode the integrity of the market system .
The other line , which involves the authorities ’ balance sheet , amplifies inflationary pressures and weakens public finances .
Yet these costs are less persistent and , as such , lower than those associated with the alternatives .
Indeed , the real cost of the second regime shift is more nuanced .
The incomprehensibility is not , I think , because El - Erian is a bad writer .
It ’s because he understands , perhaps unconsciously , that saying this clearly would outrage people .
But it ’s not going to work .
The financial industry is not going to get away with a covert bailout , snuck past voters with obscure wording .

It is inherently implausible , if you think about it , that the state could be an effective administrator of justice , for which there is a supply and demand like any other good .
Shortages , inefficiencies , arbitrariness , and high costs will be main features of such a system .
And because we are dealing here with the meting out of coercion , we can add the presence of inhumane treatment and outright cruelty .
Even so , nothing had prepared me for what I witnessed in the courtroom the other day .
Like a fool , I thought I might be able to beat a traffic ticket I received a block from my home .
The policeman says I slowed almost to a stop rather than completely stopping at a three - way stop where there were no cars in any case .
So my prize was a ticket .
The officer assures me that I 'm not declaring guilt , but I have to sign this form anyway .
I can challenge it on my court date .
So , again foolishly , I decide not to go the route of everyone else — admit guilt and cough up — but instead to exercise my citizen 's right to make a challenge .
I show up at court .
Except that on my appointed date , the judge was n't there .
Why ?
They would n't say .
Is he sleeping in ?
No .
Taking a family vacation ?
Outrageous that I should even ask !
OK , then , how about I see the substitute judge ?
There is no such thing .
But if I had n't shown up I would go to jail for " failure to appear . "
How is it that he can fail to show up and everyone acts like this is normal ?
The clerk rolled her eyes .
Silly me .
This is the state .
Different rules apply to it as versus me .
So I am given a new court day , 6 weeks later .
I show up again , and tell the clerk that I plan to say that I am not guilty .
This moved my papers to the bottom of the stack , which is a very bad omen .
I would end up sitting in the court room all morning , listening to some 40 cases of people who are not so foolish as to protest the judgment of the officer of the law .
But then again , it was n't so bad .
I got an education .
It turns out that in a courtroom packed with purported criminals , not even one of the people who appeared before the judge was a danger to society .
Nearly all were in for victimless crimes .
The two who had perpetrated actual crimes — petty theft from Wal - Mart and the local mall — could have easily been dealt with without involving the state .
So far as I could tell , the place could have been emptied out completely and our little community would have been no worse off , and massive human suffering could have been avoided .
But that 's not the way it works .
These people , overwhelmingly black and poor but dressed very nicely in the hope of impressing the master , found themselves entangled in the web and thereby elicited the glare and killer instinct of the spider .
How painful it was to watch and not be able to do anything about it .
The first case turned out to be typical .
This was a person picked up for " public intoxication , " which amounted to overcelebrating following a football victory and daring to walk on the government 's sidewalks under the influence of one too many .
Arrested , jailed , bailed out .
Now was the time to face the judge .
What is your plea ?
Guilty , your honor .
What do you have to say for yourself ?
I 'm so sorry that I did this and I wo n't do it again .
The judge then decides to be lenient .
He gives the minimum fine plus court costs .
I could n't find any consistency in this pricing scheme , but generally it amounted to between $ 400 and $ 1,500 .
The judge asks the person to pay it now .
When he says that he does n't have the money , the judge considers a payment plan , contingent on the guilty declaring his income to the courtroom ; it averages $ 400 per month .
How about you pay $ 100 per month ?
Fine .
Oh , and there 's one more thing .
The criminal 's driver 's license is suspended for six months .
How can he get to work ?
That 's his problem .
It is a very special problem since the court has decided to loot the person of a quarter of his income during this very period .
How can you keep your job ?
Hard to say .
Life is tough .
And that 's the price you pay for drinking a few beers and daring to walk on the sidewalk .
So on it went for person after person .
Tragedy all around .
Pointless suffering .
There were other victimless crimes .
There were a few people who smoked pot — and one who carried a joint clip or some other drug paraphernalia in his car .
There was a person who made a " false report , " which seems to be lying to the policeman .
He was dragged off to jail on the spot .
Another victimless crime of which these people tended to run afoul : " resisting arrest . "
I 'd never thought about this charge much , since it is a rather stupid thing to be disobedient to the police .
Still , we must ask questions .
To protect oneself from danger , threat , and capture is the most basic of all human instincts .
We resist criminals .
We duck when someone tries to hit us .
Maybe we fight back if we think we can win .
We lock our doors to deter invasion to protect our property and person .
The right to resist being captured is the very heart of the idea of security .
Why is it that we are expected to utterly gut our instinct for self protection when the cops , for any reason they happen to manufacture on the spot , say we must ?
It does n't matter if we are guilty or innocent , whether the cop is wonderful and wholly corrupt , or whether the crime was tiny or big : we must immediately turn into human rag dolls and obey our masters .
And if we do not , and instead we walk away or run , we can be tasered and shot unto death .
( The highly disturbing video of the Utah cop tasering the fellow who did n't want to sign a ticket provides fundamental insight here )
Think what it means to criminalize what they call resistence .
It means what we believe to be our rights and our freedom are really grants of privilege by the state and they can be instantly revoked on the whim of anyone with a badge .
These poor souls in the courtroom were all under the illusion that they were free agents ; they therefore ran and resisted when confronted with danger to themselves .
Now they are learning otherwise .
But what about the actual crimes in the courtroom that day ?
A lady had stuffed a package of sliced ham or something into her purse while shopping at Wal - Mart .
She was fined $ 800 and had her license taken away .
What do you have to say for yourself , asked the judge .
" I 'm very sorry .
I need to find other ways to deal with my lack of money , " she answered .
Yes , you do , because " we will not tolerate theft in this town , " unless , he might have added , it is done by the judge under the cover of the law .
Oh , one more thing .
This lady was banned from Wal - Mart for life .
Now , this sounds extreme , but it was the only decision taken that day that had the feel of something potentially reasonable .
Might Wal - Mart have handed down this penalty itself ?
Is n't this a good principle , keeping the thieves away from its store ?
Makes sense , perhaps not for a lifetime but perhaps for a year or two .
But there is one problem .
Wal - Mart can't do that .
Its shopping space is considered under federal law to be a " public space , " even though it is entirely privately owned .
You can't decide who you are going to let in or out so long as you charge no membership fee .
You have to accept all comers .
Only the state can ban people from public property .
And so Wal - Mart must use the state 's services .
It is coerced like everyone else .
A compassionate and reasonable private solution is against the law .
But keep in mind that this was a case of theft .
The others , they had done no harm to anyone .
The machine continued to operate .
The judge hardly looked up , not even to notice how well these nice but exceedingly poor people dressed in an attempt to impress him .
They and their lives meant nothing .
It was all about keeping the machine working .
Finally 11 AM rolls around .
The court had already raised for itself some $ 20,000 , from my calculation .
The judge says that there will be a short recess before he hears the not - guilty cases , mine among them .
He will then assign public defenders to those whose income is low enough and then schedule jury hearings .
In other words , I would have to wait and then return at some later date .
I realized that there was more involved in beating tickets than I knew .
I would need to make it my vocation — and perhaps not prevail .
My kids , who came with me , persuaded me that this was hopeless and ridiculous and very costly .
I should declare my guilt and pay the $ 200 and be free .
They did n't want their dad entangled anymore in this system .
This is what I did , and I was free to go and join the multitudes who put up with this system of blackmail and money extraction every hour and know better than to attempt to use the system to challenge it .
Most people in my position would have never gone to court , and they will never seen just how cruel this system is for the poor , for minorities , and for everyone who gets tangled up in this web of coercion and legalized plunder .
But now I understand something more fully that I once only understood abstractly .
I see how utterly ridiculous it is to think that the state can be the right means to help those who are poor or living at the margins of society .
The state is their enemy , as it is for everyone else .
I was pleased to see the recent news about alien images appearing on a wall in Canada .
If you have n't seen the story , the upshot is that some reflected light shows up every non-overcast day on someone 's house in Calgary , and the resulting image looks something like a cross between Gollum and the Reddit mascot .
Thus , aliens .

This is nonsense , unfortunately .
I would love for even one of the completely wall - slappingly insane phenomena that bubble up these days to be true .
If even one funnel - shaped cloud or particularly reflective seagull ended up being an actual alien craft , if even one person 's Pomeranian really did house the mind of an ancient Egyptian emperor , if even one winged hominid got run over by a meth - infused trucker and examined by reputable scientists , then I could be happy in a world that 's even weirder than it initially appears to be .
Tragically , though , none of them pan out in the long run .
And yet , people keep devising theories .
Some , not content to come up with explanations for unexplained phenomena , instead go to great lengths to come up with bizarre takes on explained phenomena .
Exhibit One : Rods
On some videos and photos , you can see odd smudges made up of a straight line with a sort of twirly fuzz around it .
What are these things ?
Well , one theory is that they are creatures living in the atmosphere , invisible to the naked eye but for some reason able to be caught on videotape .
This theory is wrong .
While I love the idea that your basic handheld Panasonic camera has mystical - vision powers , the fact is that you can capture " rod " video of your own by pointing a camera set to a slow shutter speed at a bunch of insects .
The paranormal response ?
Yeah , those rods are insects , but there are other rods that are visually identical to the insects , but which are actually rods !
Exhibit Two : Orbs
If rods are too interesting for you , check out orbs .
Where rods take the form of moving blurs , orbs manifest themselves as roughly circular blobs .
Spine - chillingly circular !
Here 's how it works .
You take a photo of something with your cheapie digital camera , and the picture has a translucent gray dot on it .
Clearly there 's no explicable way for weird little visual artifacts to end up on digital photos , so they must be the spirits of the departed .
This one 's just sad .
It 's like you want to see Bigfoot , but you hate camping , so you just classify the dust bunnies under the couch as cryptids and call it a day .
Exhibit Three : Crowd Demons
I 'm being a bit unfair here , because crowd demons are n't really a well - known phenomenon among the desperately wacky crowd , but the idea is so deliciously stupid I 'm highlighting it here in hopes it will catch on .
On the GhostStudy.com website , you 'll find a photo that purportedly shows two demons sitting next to each other at a musical recital .
The site suggests that if you look long enough you 'll see a shadow ghost .
It also says it shows " a dinosaur attacking a man ( however , this is most likely an illusion ) . "
Yeah , most likely .
There is less than a 50 percent chance that the photo actually shows a demon dinosaur eating a guy 's head .
Another guy found a bunch of crowd demons at a Republican rally .
I 'm not actually seeing most of those , but maybe I just do n't have the patience to play a proper game of Where 's Weirdo ?
As obvious as the rational explanations for all these phenomena are , I 'm a bit sad .
I 'd enjoy living in a world filled with normally invisible creatures that only show their true , blurry forms on discount audiovisual equipment .
Kind of like YouTube , only with more flying and fewer anime clips .

Would it mean that we should ignore the whole issue ?
No , because :
NSPD51 was passed without Congressional input
Indeed , implementation of COG on 9/11 was kept hidden from Congress
Even the New York Times wrote in an editorial :
Given the above , even under a best - case scenario -- that is , assuming that COG plans are not still in effect -- it is urgent to pay attention to this issue .
Congress , the Courts , and the American people must demand that COG plans be rescidned which
(1 ) allow the plans to be unilaterally implemented on a whim by the White House ;
( 2 ) may be continued past the time they are absolutely necessary for the survival of our country ; or
(3 ) unnecessarily destroy Constitutional protections , when our country could still be protected if such protections were respected .
If We Are Not Currently under Martial Law , it Is Even More Urgent to Fight for 9/11 Truth
If we are not currently under martial law , it is even more important to fight for 9/11 truth .
Why ?
Because the state of emergency declared by the Bush administration on 9/11 and continued until the present was based on the 9/11 attacks .
It is the declaration of a state of emergency which has put the country on hair - trigger alert , and given Bush and Cheney the opportunity to declare martial law at the slightest excuse .
If we can prove that the government aided and abetted the 9/11 attacks , maybe that state of emergency can finally be rescinded , with the realization that the danger from rogue elements of our own government is greater than that from abroad .
The History And Development Of Secret Societies In The Western Tradition
- A paper by Frater Choronzon first presented on Monday 22nd October 1990 to Philos - O- Forum at Bullfrog 's Cafe Bar , Greenwich
It has been said that " The history of the world is the history of the warfare between Secret Societies " ( Robert (s ) Shea & Anton Wilson purportedly quoting one Ishmael Reed on the flyleaf of their tri-lateral masterpiece Illuminatus ! ) ; it has also been said , attributably by Socrates , that " The Gods give us paranoia so that we may occasionally glimpse something of the truth " .
My experience is that one is rarely closer to a subjective appreciation of the axiom that " There can be no ultimate truth " than when attempting to research the origins of Secret Societies .
The reality today is that these organizations can range from a handful of people performing magic rituals in a bricked - up railway arch , to an annual get - together of the cream of the worlds financiers and statespersons mapping out the economic and political destiny of the planet .
The first of these groups style themselves the Bilderberg Conference , named after the block of council flats where they first met ; the second group are a shadowy intercontinental organization known as the Illuminates of Thanateros .
This is precisely the sort of misinformation which a serious researcher has to contend with .
If the misinformation is recent , the inconsistencies are easy to spot , but , after fifty , a hundred or a thousand years , it is more difficult .
It is unusual to find objective material about Secret Societies .
Most researchers are either endeavouring to demonstrate that a particular group ( or groups ) is ( are ) no more than an innocuous charitable benevolent club who like to maintain a level of anonymity to cloak their good works , or , on the other hand , to demonstrate that the same group (s ) are responsible for every bloody revolution and heinous conspiratorial plot which has ever been perpetrated .
Both objectives can be well served by producing evidence that the existence of the Secret Society or Societies in question can be traced back into antiquity .
In order to try and introduce an element of objectivity into this exercise , I propose to isolate certain essential features which can be found across a spectrum of secret and / or secretive societies today .
I shall then to attempt to trace manifestations of those features in various historical groups and / or orders in as far as reasonably reliable information appears to exist in the historical record .
Organizational Characteristics Of Secret Societies
One feature shared in common between many of today 's Secret Societies , of both ritual / charitable and occult flavour is that of a membership structure consisting of graded or hierarchical degrees .
The number of degrees can vary widely , even within different branches of the same society , as can the direction of numbering .
For example , the Ordo Templi Orientis , on the evidence provided in Francis King 's book Secret Rituals of the OTO , appears to be structured into eleven principal degrees , headed by an individual described as the Outer Head of the Order ( OHO ) holding the eleventh degree .
The OTO is not a homogeneous body , and there are at present at least two separate organizations purposing to represent the original tradition ; each of these has its own OHO .
Some degrees in the OTO have distinctive names , for example , according to the same source , the designation of new entrants to the organization is to a zero degree named Minerval .
By contrast , the Illuminates of Thanateros , a Chaos Magic " Pact " , on the basis of an article published in ' Chaos International ' Issue 3 , appear to be headed by a Supreme Magus who holds the designation 0 Degree , while new entrants or Neophytes are admitted to the 4th Degree .
One feature which both of these occult groups have in common is that they admit members of both sexes , and claim to have no policy of sexual preferment in regard to promotion within the group .
For all that , there is no evidence to suggest that either group has ever been headed by a female .
The Order of the Golden Dawn , a magical group which flourished in this country for some 40 years prior to 1920 , also admitted both male and female members with equal status .
Though apparently dormant in the UK at this time , the Golden Dawn is known to be active in North America and there is evidence to suggest that a significant proportion of it 's senior officers are female .
[ Note ( 1997 ) : There is now understood to be a chartered Order of Golden Dawn Temple in London ]
Of the contemporary charitable / ritual societies , the most important ones in numerical terms , such as the United Grand Lodge Freemasons , are exclusively male oriented , although females may be admitted to subsidiary branch organizations .
There is some cross-fertilization of traditions between masonic orders who may not be directly affiliated to the United Grand Lodge in Great Queen Street and some of the occult orders mentioned above .
In his much denigrated book The Brotherhood , the late Stephen Knight provided some detailed information about the existence of higher masonic degrees , admittance to which is purportedly in the gift of a body described as the Supreme Council of the 33rd Degree .
In support of this assertion , Knight points out that there is an entry for just such a body in the London telephone directory , and he was correct , at least as regards the old S - Z phone book ; indeed the entry was still there in 1988 , some four years after Knight 's book was published , with an address in Duke Street .
It seems to have disappeared now since the London telephone directories have been reorganized , and is not obviously to be found either in the ' residential ' or ' business ' sections .
Not that much can be read into that ; Lewisham Council , the United States Embassy and the British Library are equally difficult to track down under the new schema .
A curious feature of Knight 's listing of the Higher Masonic Degrees is that some of the titles are identical to those of some of the higher OTO degrees .
For example ' Prince of Jerusalem ' is given as the 16th Degree in Masonry , about half way up the hierarchy , while the same title is accorded to a 4th degree OTO officer , rather less than half way up the structure .
This may of course be a co-incidence , but there are said to be links of tradition between the two organizations through a mysterious body , or system of observance , called the Rite of Memphis and Misraim .
The right to award degrees within that structure having been bestowed on the OTO in the early part of this century through a charter issued by a high ranking Mason named Yarker , who may have held dual membership .
Whether a ' Prince of Jerusalem ' in the OTO would necessarily be acknowledged by the Supreme Council of the 33rd Degree ( or vice - versa ) is not known , but it may be suspected that there might be difficulties if the OTO officer seeking masonic recognition was female !
This may seem to be a trivial detail , but it is through exactly this sort of link that the threads of the history and development of these organizations can be traced .
Another feature which some of the societies , particularly the more overtly occult ones , have in common is the assumption by members of a pseudonym or ' magical ' name or motto for use within the organization .
Origins
Secrecy was widely practiced by the priesthoods of the ancient Mediterranean cultures .
The Egyptians were particularly notorious in that respect , and the same practices were carried over into Pythagorean tradition .
In the latter case , though , it may have assumed an additional importance because some of their mathematical discoveries involved concepts , such as the irrational nature of mathematical ratios like PI , which overstepped the boundaries of what was considered admissible within their concepts of number theory .
If something seemed to threaten the fundamental numerical basis on which the universe was thought to be constructed , then it was best to keep it quiet - the sums might be wrong after all !
Egypt retained it 's status as a centre of learning throughout the latter days of the Roman Empire , despite the destruction of the Library of Alexandria and Diocletian 's wholesale burning of proto- scientific and alchemical texts .
After that country 's assimilation into the expanding Islamic empire , the Fatimid Caliphs sponsored the establishment of what was effectively a University in Cairo .
This institution was known as The Abode of Learning ; it awarded degrees , but these were accompanied by initiations of a mystical or esoteric character .
It seems probable that the Grand Lodge of Cairo , founded in 872 AD by adherents of the Ismaili Sect of Islam , adopted from the Abode of Learning the concept of a sequence of academic degrees marked by mystical or quasi-occult initiations .
The Grand Lodge of Cairo had seven degrees and variants existed during the following two centuries within various splinters of the Ismaili sect .
The most influential of these were the Nizari Ismailis , and in 1090 , by stratagem or deception , their leader Hasan-e Sabah took possession of a fortress named Alamut ( meaning Eagle 's Nest ) which dominated a valley of the same name in the Elburz Mountains to the north of modem Teheran .
Within this fortress under the motto " Nothing is true and all is allowed " , Hasan instituted the Order of the Hashishim or Assassins .
In many respects these people might be regarded as a highly efficient bunch of terrorists .
The aspects of secrecy inherent in the graded degree structure , borrowed from the Grand Lodge of Cairo , were used to mislead the lower echelons of the Order about the actual nature and objectives of the organization as a whole .
According to Nesta Webster , an admittedly unreliable source , the Assassins were structured in the following manner :
lst Degree Grand Master " The Old Man of the Mountains " , Hasan-e Sabah 2nd Degree Grand Prior 3rd Degree Dais Political Emissaries 4th Degree Rafiqs Associates in training for Higher Degrees 5th Degree Fadais " The Devoted Men " - Undertook to deliver the Secret Blow on orders from above 6th Degree Lasiqus Lay brothers 7th Degree The " common people " " simply blind instruments " ( sic )
In trying to explain how the Assassins operated , it would be difficult to better Nesta Webster 's florid prose ; the following passage might well have earned her a place on the shortlist to script " Reefer Madness " ; it comes from her book Secret Societies and Subversive Movements published in 1924 :
“ To stimulate the energies of the Fadais who were to carry out the crimes , the superiors of the Order had recourse to an ingenious system of delusion .
Throughout the territories occupied by the Assassins were gardens with fruit trees , bowers of roses and sparkling streams .
Here were arranged luxurious resting places with Persian carpets and soft divans around which hovered black - eyed " houris " bearing wine in gold and silver drinking vessels , whilst soft music mingled with murmuring water and the song of birds .
The young man whom the Assassins wished to train for a life of crime was introduced to the Grand Master of the Order and intoxicated with Hashish .
Under the brief spell of unconsciousness induced by the drug , the prospective Fadai was carried into the garden , where , on awaking , he believed himself to be in Paradise .
After enjoying all it's delights , he was given a fresh dose and transposed back to the presence of the Grand Master , who assured him that he had never left his side , but had merely experienced a foretaste of the Paradise that awaited him if he obeyed the orders of his chiefs . ”
A rather more gruesome deception perpetrated at Alamut is recorded in an ancient text , the " Art of Imposture " by Abdel - Rahman of Damascus .
The following extract is quoted from Arkon Daraul 's book Secret Societies Yesterday and Today :
“ Hasan had a deep narrow pit sunk into the floor of his audience chamber .
One of his disciples stood in this in such a way that his head and neck alone were visible above the floor .
Around the neck was placed a circular disk in two pieces which fitted together , with a hole in the middle .
This gave the impression that there was a severed head on a metal plate standing on the floor .
In order to make the scene more plausible ( if that is the word ) Hasan had some fresh blood poured around the head , on the plate .
Now certain recruits were brought in .
" Tell them " commanded the chief , " what thou hast seen " .
The disciple then described the delights of Paradise .
" You have seen the head of a man who died whom you all knew .
I have reanimated him to speak with his own tongue " .
Later , the head was treacherously severed in real earnest and stuck for some time somewhere that the faithful would see it .
The effect of this conjuring trick plus murder increased the enthusiasm for martyrdom to the required degree . ”
A ruthless deception indeed , but , whether apocryphal or not , it would appear to have been passably successful as a recruiting tactic .
By the time the area was over - run by the " Mongol hordes " of Mangu Khan in 1296 , there were no fewer than 60 Assassin castles in an area of 3 miles wide by 30 long in the Alamut Valley itself , and the Order 's influence extended throughout every town and city in the Middle East .
There is little doubt that they were a pervasive organization , and there is much evidence to suggest that their motivations were towards the benefit of the Order rather than that of the prevailing Islamic establishment ; except of course where those two interests coincided .
The Knights Templar
Almost in parallel with the rise of the Assassins , but on the other side of the formal spiritual divide in the Middle East , there came into being another militarily oriented Order , that of the Knights Templar .
In the wake of the success of the First Crusade in capturing Jerusalem , Hugh de Payens petitioned that city 's King Baldwin II for permission for himself and eight other Knights to establish a new Order , ostensibly to protect pilgrims travelling to the sacred sites .
Approval was given in 1118 , and confirmed by the Pope .
Subsequently at the Council of Troyes the Knights were given a monastic ' rule ' or constitution .
They took their name from the quarters allocated to them adjunct to the ancient site of Solomon 's Temple in Jerusalem .
The relationship between the Templars and the Assassins was by no means amicable , although it 's inception appears to have been in the negotiation of a treaty of convenience between Baldwin II and the Assassin Grand Master against the influence of Baghdad .
In subsequent years , like the Assassins , the Templars ' motivations appear to have been towards the advantage of their own order , rather than necessarily towards the overall Christian cause , unless , of course those objectives happened to coincide .
For example , in 1149 the Templars appear to have had a relationship with insiders in the Islamic garrison defending Damascus which led to the Crusader Emperor Conrad 's failure to take that city ; and in 1166 Amaury , King of Jerusalem is said to have hanged twelve Templars for betraying a fortress to the Saracens .
The accurate picture is perhaps of factions within the Templars becoming very closely allied with the Assassins , possibly at the relatively senior 3rd Degree ' Political Emissary ' level .
The source quoted by both Nesta Webster and Arkon Daraul for the assimilation of Assassin observances and rituals by the Templars is the early 19th Century Austrian orientalist Joseph von Hammer - Purgstall , but the work which supposedly establishes this link , " History of the Assassins " , is not listed in the British Library catalogue , and it is possible that Daraul may have echoed it 's existence from Webster 's writings .
Whatever the link may have been , the Templars built up a veritable banking and property empire throughout Europe , they had their own fleet , and they were highly secretive about their internal affairs .
After the purge of Friday 13th October 1307 , about which some of them may have been tipped off , there were consistent confessions under torture to secret ceremonies involving an entity called Baphomet , and prostration before a bearded male head , which apparently spoke to them and conferred magical powers .
Though there appears to be little documentary evidence of ' Baphomet ' having predated the Templars , the Talking Head is reminiscent of the Assassin anecdote quoted above .
The persecution of the Templars was most strenuous in France , but , nonetheless , many of them appear to have made an escape with the Order 's fleet of ships from La Rochelle , and there is evidence presented by Baigent and Leigh to suggest that they may have established settlements in Scotland and Ireland dating from this period .
Robinson , in a recent work on masonic history , presents evidence that the English ' Poor Knights of Christ ' went underground and , among other things , credits them with having provided the organizational impetus for the Peasants Revolt of 1381 - though there is no specific record of any banner reading " Templars Against the Poll Tax " .
The Knights in Scotland are said to have been influential at the Battle of Bannockbum , and subsequently to have formed a ' Praetorian Guard ' for the Scottish Royal Family .
Links with " operative masonry " ( the modern Freemason 's term for the working stone - masons tradition ) are also traceable through some interesting ornamentation in churches and private chapels associated with aristocratic Scottish families , such as the Sinclairs , where construction dates from a period in the 15th Century which is consistent with the hypothesis .
The balance of evidence suggests direct and probably continuous links from the disbanded Templars , both to the English Lodges which were in existence at the time of the formation of the Grand Lodge of England on 24th June 1717 , and also to the ' Strict Observance ' and Grand Orient branches of Freemasonry which migrated to continental Europe with the exiled Jacobites .
Illuminism And The Rosicrucian Tradition
An intriguing thesis is presented by Baigent , Leigh and Lincoln in their book Holy Blood , Holy Grail .
In a nutshell , this postulates the existence of an organization named the Ordre ( or Prieure ) de Sion whose members are able to claim a direct blood lineage from the family of the Christian Messiah , via the ancient Merovingian dynasty of France through to the Cathar communities which flourished in Languedoc and Provence , and thence forward to the present day .
The suggestion is that these people sponsored the various revivals of the Manichean heresy until it was so viciously suppressed by the Vatican in the Albigensian Crusade of the 13th Century .
They are also said to have been the provenance of the Rosicrucian Manifestos which appeared in 1614 and of other allegorical documents such as " The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz " which date from the same period .
There is no suggestion that members of this tradition either worshipped Baphomet , indulged in discourse with Talking Heads , or defiled Christian sacred symbols , but their story does , in some particulars , seem to be intertwined with that of the Templars and of organizations deriving from that provenance .
It is claimed , for example that the Alchemists Nicholas Flamel and Robert Fludd were Grand Masters of the Prieure de Sion , that the latter was succeeded in the post by Sir Isaac Newton , who was also a Freemason , and that both organizations had been instrumental in establishing the Royal Society in 1660 .
A major divergence in the masonic tradition occurred in the wake of the so - called ' Glorious Revolution ' of 1688 .
The Scottish lodges were firmly committed by tradition to the Jacobite cause and followed the deposed King James II into exile in France , subsequently favouring the claim of Charles Edward Stuart ( Bonny Prince Charlie ) to the throne of the United Kingdom .
The United Grand Lodge of England was formed in the wake of the Scottish rebellion of 1715 , with the intention of bringing the movement into line with the prevailing anti-Jacobite stance .
There were slip - ups , such as the appointment of the Duke of Wharton to the Grand Master 's post ; not only was he a vociferous Jacobite , he was also a founding member of the Hellfire Club with Sir Francis Dashwood .
He was booted out of office after a tenure of only a year in 1723 and the subsequently issued ' Constitutions ' of James Anderson , a masonic minister of the Scots Church , ensured that respectability and support for the Hanoverians were indelibly established .
Meanwhile on the continent the Jacobites were setting up new lodges in the Scottish or Grand Orient mold .
Among those initiated and then given a charter to start other lodges was a German Baron , von Hund .
It appears to be from him that a tradition of " Secret Chiefs " emanates .
The people who originally initiated von Hund in Paris kept their identities concealed and then apparently disappeared .
There is evidence to suggest that these anonymous figures were high ranking Jacobites , including perhaps " the King over the Water " himself .
Their subsequent disappearance coincides neatly with the final defeat of the Jacobite rebels at Culloden in 1746 , by an English army commanded by the English Mason , William Augustus , Duke of Cumberland .
Warfare between Secret Societies ?
A member of one of the lodges established in Germany by von Hund was an ex-Jesuit , by name Adam Weishaupt .
In 1776 Weishaupt got bored with the same old stuff and founded the infamous Illuminati of Bavaria .
Among the directions pursued by Weishaupt , the ancient motto of the Assassins was revived : " Nothing is true : Everything is Permitted . "
Among traditions introduced can be included the assumption by members of ritual names or mottos to be used at group meetings ; for example , Weishaupt was known as Spartacus .
This procedure was also adopted by the Hellfire Club in England , as were various libidinous or tantric practices which may have been garnered from the nations exposure to Eastern cultures , or the product of fertile imagination .
The Hellfire Club was probably the first Secret Society to admit women to their rituals .
In the wake of the French Revolution the Illuminati were suppressed possibly / probably because of their involvement in it ( definitely says Nesta Webster ) .
The Hellfire Club became active in clandestine support of the American colonists and it has been claimed that Adam Weishaupt swapped identities with the real George Washington in a Hellfire Club ritual , and that the first president of the USA was none other than the Supreme Magus of the Illuminati of Bavaria .
In support of this theory attention is drawn to the resemblance of Washington 's likeness on every dollar bill to extant portraits of Weishaupt .
This hypothesis is possibly not true .
After the French Revolution it seems likely that the French Masons became the Government , having finally avenged their Templar forebears suffering at the hands of the royal house of France .
German Illuminism was driven underground however , and other species of Masonic / Rosicrucian activity adopted a low profile with the stories of ' secret chiefs ' intact .
Out of this period of silence emerged a masonic / illuminist group , the Ordo Templi Orientis ( OTO ) .
These people adopted the Illuminati tradition of magical names and the Hellfire Club practice of admitting women , and moreover accorded them equal status .
Many of the higher grade rituals , from published accounts , appear to be similar to those used in Grand Orient Masonry , with the possible exception of some of the supposed tantric practices of the OTO .
NOTE : the purported existence of such activities may be no more than a crude recruiting trick !
( cf Hasan-e Sabah : " Nothing is True " ) .
In England a specialized masonic study group came into existence in 1865 called Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia ( SRA ) .
Originally basing their practices on old documents found at Freemason 's
Hall they also made contact , by means of a cypher message found in a book bought off a market barrow , with a secretive German organization represented by a Frau Sprengel which turned out to have ' secret chiefs ' .
The Isis - Urania Temple of the Order of the Golden Dawn was founded by members of SRA in 1888 .
An early concern was to establish contact with the ' Secret Chiefs ' who by this time were thought to be discorporeal entities , or mysterious hermits in Tibet .
Madame Blavatsky came up with one such and founded the Theosophical Society , the then Curator of Horniman 's Museum in Forest Hill , MacGregor Mathers , also went public that he had established some sort of psychic communication and started producing volumes of teaching material .
Eventually one of the younger members , Aleister Crowley , started making communications with entities of his own which led him to proclaim the dawn of a New Aeon in 1904 ; whereupon some difference with Mathers erupted and Crowley became involved in the OTO which had emerged in Germany , eventually being promoted to ' Outer Head of the Order ' .
Crowley was an eccentric character .
A fabled yarn of his experiments with invisibility has recently enjoyed some confirmation , and so is worth telling :
“ Crowley was working with a sigil from the system presented in a book either translated or made up by Mathers known as the ' Sacred magic of Abra - Melin the Mage ' which purported to bestow invisibility on the operator .
Having attired himself in his ceremonial robes , and anointed his body with scented oil and saffron he performed the ritual .
To see if it had worked , he left his lodgings in Jermyn Street and crossed Piccadilly Circus to the Cafe Royal , where he was an habitue .
He transvected into the main tea-room , performed an adoration to the Egyptian Sun God and returned to his lodgings .
Nobody had seen him - it had worked !
The assembled gentility taking tea in the Cafe Royal had seen a strangely coloured man in exotic costume walk into the room , make gesticulations and utterance , tum round , and walk out again .
With typical aplomb they had chosen totally to ignore it . ”
Recently two American tourists " doing Crowley 's London " spoke to an elderly employee at the Cafe Royal who had been there since the 1930s when Crowley was around .
He remembered that in his first week " this foreign geezer come in , all yellow , and started babbling on in some strange language and then gone out " .
He had asked his supervisor about this and had been told " Do n't worry about that ; it 's just Mister Crowley being invisible again . "
This story may not be true .
Like some modern day professional wrestlers , Crowley revelled in his ' bad boy ' image and styled himself The Great Beast .
His detractors had plenty to latch onto ; drug addiction , obscene writings , and sex-magic .
In my view Crowley 's final joke on his acolytes in the OTO is to have left them with a constitution which is structured in such a way that schism and feuding between members is inevitable .
The result has been a series of protracted legal squabbles and several competing OTOs , each claiming that one of the other 's past OHOs had been expelled from the order by Crowley .
The Order of the Golden Dawn migrated to the colonies and has resurfaced on the West Coast of America via New Zealand .
If the Illuminati did indeed survive to become the founding establishment of the USA , they may still be up to their old tricks ; possibly in conflict or alliance with their long - standing sparring partners in the Masons and / or the Prieure de Sion .
In 1954 the Bilderberg Conference was instituted .
There are paranoid people today who believe that this club , described by Encyclopaedia Britannica as an " annual three - day conference attended by about 100 of Europe 's and North America 's most influential bankers , economists , politicians and government officials " is , in reality , the instrument of the Illuminati by which they plot and control the world 's destiny , as a sort of government behind all governments .
The same paranoid people might suggest that such an organization 's primary motivations are always towards the benefit of the Order , rather than necessarily towards the common good , except , of course , where those interests co-incide .
Or as Hasan-e Sabah might have said " Today Alamut , Tomorrow the World " .
But all this is fanciful .
They most likely just sit round a table listening attentively to the utterance of a Talking Head !
" NOTHING IS TRUE : EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , in his most pessimistic and blunt assessment to date , said Wednesday that a " recession is possible " for the U.S. economy .
Bernanke , speaking before a congressional committee , said he was n't yet prepared to declare that the economy has fallen into a recession .
Instead , he said the economy is still " slightly growing at the moment , " but he admitted it is possible the economy could shrink over the first half of this year .
In his opening remarks to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress , Bernanke also said he expects further rises in unemployment and that the economic outlook has worsened since the Fed 's economic outlook was released in January .
" It now appears likely that real gross domestic product will not grow much , if at all , over the first half of 2008 and could even contract slightly , " Bernanke said , adding that he believes the economy will rebound in the second half of the year .
One of the short - hand measures of whether a nation is suffering from a recession are two or more consecutive quarters in which GDP , the broad measure of economic activity , is negative .
His statement seems to suggest that could have occurred in the recently completed first quarter and the second quarter that started Tuesday .
Bernanke pointed out that the technical determination of a recession wo n't be made until the National Bureau of Economic Research looks at a variety of detailed economic statistics at some point in the future .
" I 'm not yet ready to say whether the U.S. economy faces such a situation , " he said .
Rate cuts coming to an end ?
Bernanke said he believed the Fed 's interest rate cuts since September , coupled with more than $ 150 billion in tax rebates under a recently passed economic stimulus plan , should help lift the economy in the second half of this year .
He dismissed questions by some committee members about whether additional stimulus would be needed later this year , saying Congress should wait until early 2009 to give the current stimulus package a chance to work .
Bernanke 's comments about the threat of a recession rattled some investors at first .
Stocks fell in early trading but recovered many of those early losses by midday .
And despite recession fears , Wall Street also seemed to interpret Bernanke 's remarks as a sign that the Fed may not cut interest rates that much more aggressively .
According to futures listed on the Chicago Board of Trade , investors are now pricing in only a 14 % chance of a half - point interest rate cut at the Fed 's next meeting April 30 , compared to a 24 % chance of a half - point cut at the close of trading Tuesday .
A stronger - than - expected reading about private sector jobs from payroll services firm ADP raised doubts about how bad the March jobs figures , to be released by the Labor Department Friday , will be .
If the job market is showing signs of improvement , that could mean the Fed would have less reason to slash rates .
Bear Stearns deal defended
Bernanke also defended the Fed 's role in arranging and helping finance the fire - sale purchase of investment bank Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) by JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) last month .
He denied it was a bailout and said it 's not something he ever wants to do again .
But he said he could n't rule out another such rescue .
He pointed out that Bear Stearns shareholders saw their holdings lose most of their value .
" I do n't think any company is interested in repeating the experience of Bear Stearns , " he said .
Bernanke said he took the actions not to rescue the company but to provide a smooth functioning of financial markets needed by all Americans .
" Our financial system is extremely complex and interconnected , and Bear Stearns participated extensively in a range of critical markets , " he said .
" With financial conditions fragile , the sudden failure of Bear Stearns likely would have led to a chaotic unwinding of positions in those markets and could have severely shaken confidence . "
The Fed 's actions were praised by Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , the chairman of the committee .
" Last month you looked into the precipice of financial meltdown and acted , " Schumer said .
" It is hard to disagree with the need to take quick and dramatic action to spare our financial system of the risk of the kind of meltdown we saw in the Great Depression . "
But Schumer and Sen. Sam Brownback , R - Kan. , the ranking Republican on the House - Senate panel , said they both had questions about the decision - making process behind the Bear Stearns bailout , and the implication it holds for future rescues .
Bernanke said , however , that he would answer more questions about this during a Senate hearing on Thursday morning about the JPMorgan Chase - Bear Stearns deal .
New York Fed President Timothy Geithner , Treasury Undersecretary Robert Steel and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox are also due to testify at this hearing .
So are JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and Alan Schwartz , chief executive of Bear Stearns .
Help for homeowners urged
Much of Schumer 's remarks focused on two topics that were not included in Bernanke 's prepared testimony - the Bush administration 's recent proposal to change the regulation of the financial sector and plans , now being debated in Congress , to provide help for homeowners having problems paying their mortgages .
" What is the justice of helping Bear Stearns and not millions of homeowners ? "
Schumer said .
" A single homeowner going under does not pose systemic risk , but millions of homeowners going under do . "
Bernanke would n't comment about a proposed plan to have the Federal Housing Administration provide guarantees to help troubled homeowners refinance mortgages they could no longer afford .
" The Federal Reserve is acting in its sphere of influence .
Housing is very important ; that 's Congress ' sphere of influence , not the Fed's , " he said in response to a question from Schumer .
Republicans and Democrats in the Senate indicated Tuesday that they were willing to work on a bipartisan agreement on such a measure , although the Bush administration is still reluctant to support it .
And some Democrats on the panel were not happy with Bernanke for avoiding the issue .
Sen. Edward Kennedy , D - Mass. , became somewhat testy as Bernanke refused to take a position on the issue , and Rep. Elijah Cummings , D - MD , urged Bernanke to take a stand .
" I know it 's up to us , but you 're the expert .
You 're the one we depend on .
You 're the superstar , " Cummings said .
" So we come to you .
I 'm just asking for three to four things that you would love to see us do that would help . "
Bernanke also did n't say much about the sweeping changes Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson proposed on Monday aimed at modernizing the regulation of the nation 's financial system .
Paulson 's plan would give the Fed much more power to regulate investment banks and the markets .
Bernanke said it was an appropriate time to have discussions about the proposal .
He said he wanted to make sure the Fed would have the resources necessary to take on additional regulatory responsibilities being discussed .
He also expressed concern that the Fed not lose any of its current oversight of commercial banks .
Looks like John McCain 's big pocket of strength among Michigan voters was from people who do n't approve of the Iraq War .
Because , of course , the man who 's managed to always position himself to George W. Bush 's right on the whole " should we squander the nation 's blood and treasure in Iraq for no reason " issue is exactly the kind of guy you want to turn to if you 're disgruntled with the course things are taking .
Meanwhile , part of the bad news for the country here is that I think Mitt Romney 's made it clear that he 'll be the candidate the voters want him to be , and if that means becoming the country 's leading cheerleader for the war , then cheer he shall .
McCain , meanwhile , does n't have it in his character to be anything other than a cheerleader for the war .
So the Republican Party will continue to be in denial about the realities of the situation .
Speaking of which , today in reality we learn : " Highly promising figures that the administration cited to demonstrate economic progress in Iraq last fall , when Congress was considering whether to continue financing the war , cannot be substantiated by official Iraqi budget records , the Government Accountability Office reported Tuesday .

If you 're feeling really courageous , you can just wipe out Firefox 2 entirely and dive into Firefox 3 full - time , like I did .
This means Firefox 3 will take over your existing Firefox profile .
While I have n't seen problems with this on Windows or Mac , backups are always good insurance .
So just to be safe : back up your Firefox profile , just in case you need to revert to Firefox 2 at some point in the future .
( Note : MozBackup is for Windows only .
Mac users can back up their profile manually by making a copy of their user profile folder . )

Now that you 're running Firefox 3 the first thing it 'll tell you is that your extensions are n't compatible with the new version .
Do n't panic .
It 's true that many Firefox extension developers have n't updated their add - ons to work with Firefox 3 .
But in many instances , this is just a matter of the extension reporting back to the application that it is n't yet compatible , even though the add - on might work anyway .
Instead of waiting for your favorite extensions to get updated , you can tell Firefox to enable them no matter what .
There are two ways to do this :

Hypercubes in two , three , four , and five dimensions .
( Images from Wikipedia )
Multi-dimensional structures called hypercubes may act as the building blocks for tomorrow ’s nanocomputers – machines made of such tiny elements that they are dominated not by forces that we ’re familiar with every day , but by quantum properties .
As Samuel Lee and Loyd Hook from the University of Oklahoma explain , microelectronic devices are continually getting smaller and faster , in accordance with Moore ’s Law .
Already , integrated circuits and transistors are reaching the nanometer scale , although they still operate based on the physical properties on the macro- scale .
True nanoelectronics , the researchers explain , are not just scaled down microelectronics , but devices that will be dominated by quantum properties , and will therefore require new architectures and novel structures .
“ Compared to today 's microcomputers , the main advantages of future nanocomputers are higher circuit density , lower power consumption , faster computation speed and more parallel and distributed computing capabilities , ” Lee told PhysOrg.com .
For example , today ’s integrated circuits process information in the form of a continual flow of electrons .
Nano integrated circuits , however , may process individual electrons , reducing the scale and power consumption .
Such circuits would require that nano logic devices be able to count single electrons , as well as the ability for parallel computing , reversibility , locality , and a three - dimensional architecture .
To address these challenges , Lee and Hook have investigated hypercubes , which researchers have previously considered as elements of nanocomputers .
In their study , which will be published in a future issue of IEEE Transactions on Computers , Lee and Hook propose a variant of the classic hypercube called the “ M - hypercube ” that could provide a higher - dimensional layout to support the three - dimensional integrated circuits in nanocomputers .
The M- hypercube has a structure similar to a classic hypercube , which basically extends from a square to a cube to increasingly complex M- dimensional shapes .
M-hypercubes ( of any dimension ) are composed of nodes and links .
The nodes act as gates , receiving and passing electrons through , while the links act as the paths that electrons travel along .
“ The unique structure of hypercubes , including M-hypercubes , has been shown to be effective in parallel computing and communication networks and provides a unique ideal intrinsic structure which fulfills many of the needs of future nanocomputing systems , ” Lee said .
“ These needs include massively parallel and distributed processing architecture with simple and robust communication linkages . ”
Unlike in classic hypercubes , M-hypercubes contain two types of nodes : state nodes , which are embedded on the “ joints ” of the M - hypercubes ; and transmission nodes , which are embedded in the middle of the links between state nodes .
In one arrangement , the researchers embedded two state nodes on each joint , both representing a single state .
Each node can be turned on or off , with the transmission nodes having the ability to isolate parts of the cube from other parts when in the off state .
Depending on the number of states required by an operation , the M - hypercube can be expanded by adding extra dimensions ( which contain more nodes ) or constricted by reducing its dimensions .
For example , if only four states are required , the logic architecture would be a 2 - D hypercube ( a square ) , which has four state nodes .
In general , the number of state nodes in a hypercube is 2 m , with m being the M - hypercube ’s dimensionality .
“ We might construct M- hypercubes of dimensions greater than three in three - dimensional space if we allow the communication linkages at the nodes of M - hypercubes to not be mutually perpendicular , ” Lee explained .
For logic operations that require many states , the researchers propose a method that could reduce the dimensions of the M - hypercube by essentially decomposing the hypercube into two lower - dimensional M-hypercubes , connected in parallel .
If needed , these two M- hypercubes could themselves be decomposed into still less complex M-hypercubes , reducing the number of state nodes required per state .
In another arrangement , Lee and Hook combined an M - hypercube with an N - hypercube , resulting in what they call an “ MN - cell . ”
Due to its versatility , the device could serve as a building block for designing sequential nano logic gates of any size and complexity .

The current industrial farm animal production ( IFAP ) system often poses unacceptable risks to public health , the environment and the welfare of the animals themselves , according to an extensive 2½ - year examination conducted by the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production ( PCIFAP ) , in a study released today .
Commissioners have determined that the negative effects of the IFAP system are too great and the scientific evidence is too strong to ignore .
Significant changes must be implemented and must start now .
And while some areas of animal agriculture have recognized these threats and have taken action , it is clear that the industry has a long way to go .
Public Health
Over the past five decades , the number of farms producing animals for food has fallen dramatically , yet the number of food animals produced has remained roughly constant .
It is the concentration of farm animals in larger and larger numbers in close proximity to one another , along with the potential of IFAP facilities to affect people , that give rise to many of the public health concerns that are attributed to IFAP .
Animals in such close confinement , along with some of the feed and animal management methods employed in the system , increase pathogen risks and magnify opportunities for transmission from animals to humans .
This increased risk is due to at least three factors : prolonged worker contact with animals , increased pathogen transmission within a herd or flock , and the increased opportunities for the generation of antimicrobial resistant bacteria ( due to imprudent antimicrobial use ) or new strains of viruses .
Stresses induced by confinement may also increase the likelihood of infection and illness in animal populations .
Communities near IFAP facilities are subject to air emissions that can significantly affect certain segments of the population .
Those most vulnerable — children , the elderly , and individuals with chronic or acute pulmonary or heart disorders — are at particular risk .
The impacts on the health of those living near IFAP facilities have increasingly been the subject of epidemiological research .
Adverse community health effects from exposure to IFAP air emissions fall into two categories : ( 1 ) respiratory symptoms , disease and impaired function , and ( 2 ) neurobehavioral symptoms and impaired function .
Environment
As with public health impacts , much of IFAP 's environmental impact stems from the tremendous quantities of animal waste that are concentrated on IFAP premises .
Animal waste in such volumes may exceed the capacity of the landscape to absorb the nutrients and neutralize pathogens .
Thus , what should be a valuable byproduct ( e.g. , fertilizer ) becomes a waste that must be disposed of .
According to the EPA , the annual production of manure produced by animal confinement facilities exceeds that produced by humans by at least three times .
Unlike most human sewage , the majority of IFAP is spread on the ground untreated .
Manure in such large quantities carries excess nutrients and farm chemicals that find their way into waterways , lakes , groundwater , soils and airways .
Excess and inappropriate land application of untreated animal waste on cropland contributes to excessive nutrient loading and , ultimately , eutrophication of surface waters .
Eutrophication is an excess of nutrients in a body of water , mostly nitrates and phosphates from erosion and runoff of surrounding lands , that causes a dense growth of plant life and the death of aquatic animal life due to lack of oxygen .
IFAP runoff also carries antibiotics and hormones , pesticides , and heavy metals .
Antibiotics are used to prevent and treat bacterial infections and as growth promoters .
Pesticides are used to control insect infestations and fungal growth .
Heavy metals , especially zinc and copper , are added as micronutrients to the animal diet .
According to a 2006 UN report , globally , greenhouse gas emissions from all livestock operations account for 18 % of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions , exceeding those from the transportation sector .
IFAP can produce greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide .
Other greenhouse gases , primarily nitrous oxide , arise mainly from the microbial degradation of manure .
Air quality degradation is also a problem in and around IFAP facilities because of the localized release of significant quantities of toxic gases , odorous substances , and particulates and bioaerosols that contain a variety of microorganisms including human pathogens .
Some of the most objectionable compounds are the organic acids , which include acetic acid , butyric acids , valeric acids , caproic acids , and propanoic acid ; sulfur containing compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and dimethyl sulfide ; and nitrogen - containing compounds including ammonia , methyl amines , methyl pyrazines , skatoles and indoles .
It is also recognized that ammonia emissions from livestock contribute significantly to the eutrophication and acidification of soil and water .
Some level of nutrient overload occurs naturally , but this process can be accelerated by human activities .
Acidification can put stress on species diversity in the natural environment .
Animal Welfare
IFAP methods for raising food animals have generated concern and debate over just what constitutes a reasonable life for animals and what kind of quality of life we owe the animals in our care .
It is an ethical dilemma that transcends objective scientific measures , and incorporates value - based concerns .
Physical health as measured by absence of some diseases or predation , for example , may be enhanced through confinement since the animals may not be exposed to certain infectious agents or sources of injury that would be encountered if the animals were raised outside of confinement .
It is clear , however , that good animal welfare can no longer be assumed based only on the absence of disease or productivity outcomes .
Intensive confinement ( e.g. gestation crates for swine , battery cages for laying hens ) often so severely restricts movement and natural behaviors , such as the ability to walk or lie on natural materials , having enough floor space to move with some freedom , and rooting for pigs , that it increases the likelihood that the animals suffer severe distress .
Good animal welfare can also help to protect the safety of our nation 's food supply .
Scientists have long recognized that food safety is linked to the health of the animals that produce the meat , dairy and egg products that we eat .
In fact , scientists have found modern intensive confinement production systems can be stressful for food animals , and that stress can increase pathogen shedding in animals .
Rural America
Life in rural America has long been challenged by persistent poverty .
The causes are many , but among them is the lack of economic diversity in rural economies .
Workers have few options in the event of a plant closure or other dislocation , and unemployment rates are high .
Consequently , IFAP is frequently considered an attractive new source of economic opportunity by local economic development officials , but with this transition comes significant change including public health threats .
The industrialization of American agriculture has transformed the character of agriculture itself and , in so doing , the face of rural America .
The family - owned farm producing a diverse mix of crops and food animals is largely gone as an economic entity , replaced by ever - larger operations producing just one animal species , or growing just one crop , and many rural communities have fared poorly .
As the food animal industry shifted to a system of captive supply transactions controlled by production contracts , economic power shifted from farmers to livestock processors or so - called integrators .
Farmers relinquished their once autonomous , animal husbandry decision - making authority in exchange for contracts that provide assured payment , but require substantial capital investment .
Once the commitment is made to such capital investment , many farmers have no choice but to continue to produce until the loan is paid off .
Such contracts make it nearly impossible for there to be open and competitive markets for most hog and poultry producers , who must enter into contracts with the integrators ( meat packing companies ) if they are to sell their production .
Although the proponents of the industrialization of animal agriculture point to the increased economic efficiency of IFAP operations , the Commission is concerned that the benefits may not accrue in the same way to affected rural communities .
In fact , industrialization leading to corporate ownership actually draws investment and wealth from the communities in which specific IFAP facilities are located .
The Commission 's recommendations focus on appropriate siting of IFAP facilities in order to prevent further degradation of air , water , and soils and to minimize the impact on adjacent communities .
Below are the Commission 's key recommendations .
1 . Ban the non-therapeutic use of antimicrobials in food animal production to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance to medically important antibiotics and other microbials .
2. Implement a disease monitoring program for food animals to allow 48 - hour trace - back of those animals through aspects of their production , in a fully integrated and robust national database .
3 . Treat IFAP as an industrial operation and implement a new system to deal with farm waste to replace the inflexible and broken system that exists today , to protect Americans from the adverse environmental and human health hazards of improperly handled IFAP waste .
4 . Phase out the most intensive and inhumane production practices within a decade to reduce the risk of IFAP to public health and improve animal wellbeing ( i.e. , gestation crates and battery cages ) .
5. Federal and state laws need to be amended and enforced to provide a level playing field for producers when entering contracts with integrators .
6 . Increase funding for , expand and reform , animal agriculture research .
“ The goal of this Commission is to sound the alarms that significant change is urgently needed in industrial farm animal production , ” says John Carlin , PCIFAP Chairman and former Kansas governor .
“ I believe that the IFAP system was first developed simply to help increase farmer productivity and that the negative effects were never intended .
Regardless , the consequences are real and serious and must be addressed . ”
Our energy , water and climate resources are undergoing dramatic changes that , in the judgment of the Commissioners , will require agriculture to transition to much more biologically diverse systems , organized into biological interactions that exchange energy , improve soil quality , and conserve water and other resources .
“ Long - term success will depend on the nation 's ability to transform from an industrial economy that depends on quickly diminishing resources to one that is more sustainable , employing renewable resources and understanding of how all food production affects public health and the environment , ” says Michael Blackwell , PCIFAP Vice Chair and former dean of the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine and former Assistant Surgeon General , ( Ret. ) USPHS .
The PCIFAP consists of 15 Commissioners who bring individual knowledge and expertise in diverse fields , including public policy , veterinary medicine , public health , agriculture , animal welfare , the food industry and rural society .
The Commission assessed the current state of industrial animal agriculture based on site visits to production facilities across the country ; consultation with industry stakeholders , public health , medical and agriculture experts ; public meetings ; peer - reviewed technical reports ; staff research ; and Commissioners ' own expertise .
PCIFAP is a project of The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
( CNN ) -- World War II was over , but as the 1940s gave way to the 1950s , a new evil lurked in the land .
The cover of David Hajdu's " Ten - Cent Plague , " shown here , was drawn by Charles Burns .
It attracted a youthful audience -- boys , mostly -- who fell victim to its colorful images , dripping in red , and gave money to its purveyors .
Authorities took notice .
The United States had a new menace , they said , one whose name started with " c " and whose first syllable rhymed with " bomb . "
Comic books .
" The country was fixated on this , " said David Hajdu , author of the recently released " The Ten - Cent Plague " ( Farrar , Straus & Giroux ) , a history of the era .
These were n't just any comic books , the ones filled with the derring - do of superheroes .
These had names such as " Tales from the Crypt , " " Shock SuspenStories " and " Justice Traps the Guilty , " and they told stories of crime and horror .
Their cover images included alluring women ( often in low - cut outfits ) , decaying corpses and spooky , murky swamps .
Hajdu , who wrote " Positively Fourth Street " about the early - '60s folk music scene , observes that when we think of postwar pop-cultural rebellion , what comes to mind is rock ' n ' roll and Marlon Brando .
But comic books , he notes , came first .
Hundreds of millions sold every month , at 10 cents a throw .
" Everybody read comic books .
They were the most popular form of entertainment in America , " he said .
The fact that such entertainment was primarily aimed at children and teens raised the ire of authorities , including social scientists , newspaper columnists and political leaders .
These works , they believed , were causing crime and degeneracy .
They had to be stopped .
Towns hosted bonfires to rid themselves of comics ; congressional hearings about the issue helped burnish the image of Tennessee 's Estes Kefauver , who had led hearings against organized crime .
Comic books had been attracting concern since they were introduced in the 1930s -- and superheroes were n't immune .
Figures such as children 's author Sterling North and a Catholic bishop , John Francis Noll , protested the medium as glorifying crime and corrupting youngsters .
The fervor dulled during World War II but came back with a vengeance afterwards as news focused on an alleged increase in juvenile delinquency .
The anti-comics movement really caught fire with the work of psychiatrist Frederic Wertham , who wrote a book , " Seduction of the Innocent , " linking comics with delinquency .
Sidebar :
Were comics that violent ?
In recent decades , Wertham has become a figure of mockery for his theories ( he called the relationship between Batman and Robin " like a wish - dream of two homosexuals living together " ) , but Hajdu says he was n't a cardboard villain .
He was committed to working with minorities -- he ran a free clinic in Harlem -- and he genuinely cared about young people .
" He was misguided and used utterly fallacious methods , but what he was getting at was understandable , " Hajdu said , though adding that " he did much more harm than good . "
Among Wertham 's adversaries was William M. Gaines , son of comics pioneer Max Gaines and the owner of EC Comics .
Thanks to a staff of innovative writers and artists -- including Al Feldstein , Harvey Kurtzman , Wally Wood , Will Elder and Jack Davis -- and a deep investment in the crime and horror genres , Gaines revived a moribund EC , making it one of the business 's most successful companies .
Its titles , including " Crypt " and " SuspenStories , " were both graphic and groundbreaking .
See some of the covers that turned heads »
" EC Comics out - bloodied them all but also used social commentary and had a lighter quality of gruesome art , " said Bill Svitavsky , a history professor at Florida 's Rollins College who teaches a course on American graphic publishing with his colleague Julian Chambliss .
" EC had statements about racism and conformity to small - town values , " Chambliss said .
Many of EC 's staffers , he observes , were World War II veterans who'd seen their share of violence , and their art -- if graphic -- gave their stories the ring of truth .
( Author Grant Geissman put together a collection of EC 's work , " Foul Play ! " ( HarperDesign ) , in 2005 . )
However , the keepers of the boundaries pushed back , Svitavsky says .
In those Red Scare times , " Adults were fearful [ of works that questioned the establishment . ] ...
Comic books were believed to be an underestimated , unpatriotic tool to get at kids . "
The children , Hajdu says , illustrated the tension of the times .
Some had tried to hide their collections ; others had energetically taken part in comic - book burnings .
He interviewed many of them , now grown - ups in their 60s or 70s .
" It was harrowing to listen to them , " he said .
The issues came to a head at the subcommittee hearings on juvenile delinquency , which began in late 1953 .
Among the witnesses were Gaines and Wertham , who " looked as if he had come straight from doing scientific work , " Hajdu writes .
The comics ' fate was sealed when Gaines , in televised testimony , attempted to defend a " Crime SuspenStories " cover , depicting the hand of a killer clutching a woman 's severed head , as " good taste . "
Audiences were shocked ; opinion leaders raged .
A comics publishers ' association put together the Comics Code Authority , which banned the words " horror " and " terror " from comic books .
Sales plunged , dozens of artists lost their jobs , and comic books did n't make a comeback for years .
" Everybody was cautious in the ' 60s , " noted Ron Goulart , author of " Good Girl Art , " a history of female images in comic books .
He credits the horror - crime scare with " probably help[ing ] resurrect superheroes , " particularly the new breed created by Marvel Comics in the '60s .
The horror and crime books were also reflective of a changing world .
Film historians have observed that the heyday of film noir was in the late ' 40s , and it was n't long before Brando , James Dean , Elvis Presley and many others were busting boundaries in other genres .
Gaines was a part of that , Hajdu observes .
There was one comic , a humor book , he had protected .
He made it a magazine to save it from the Comics Code Authority and refused to accept advertising .
In time , the magazine became one of the most influential publications of the 20th century , inspiring generations to question authority and mocking the pieties of politics , religion and popular culture .
It was called Mad .

Dear Jim : I ’ve been a fan since you used to make me late for work guest - hosting Squawk Box .
I love your show and particularly your Wall of Shame segment .
You go through CEO ’s like Darth Vader went through Admirals .
All hail , Darth Cramer ! -- Ron from Ohio
Cramer says : “ Um…he was actually a bad guy … but that ’s OK .
I appreciate any compliments that come my way .
The reason I can have Walls of Shame and be Darth Vader is because of the Linda McMahon ’s of the world , of WWE , who make money for us .
I like to run an ‘ even book . ’
We celebrate the good and we trash the bad . ”

Hi Jim : I really want to thank you very much for your aggressive stance against the NAB and the paid - off officials that are opposing the XM Satellite Radio - Sirius merger .
This has really gone on way too long and it is obvious why it has .
One thing that I find interesting is how much money has been lost in Sirius call options for January and March .
As I recall about 200,000 SIRI calls expired worthless in January , and another 300,000 or so calls with a strike price of $ 3 , $ 4 & $ 5 will expire worthless if the deal is not sealed by March 21st .
After that , the volume is markedly down .
Interesting … -- Lynn
Cramer says : “ Sirius is basically a call option .
People should n’t be buying calls on calls .
Just own the darn stock and keep pressuring everyone in Congress .
Eventually they have to realize that we should be able to listen to Major League Baseball and NFL without having to buy two cars . ”
Dear Jim : Should I be worried about Bear Stearns in terms of liquidity and get my money out of there ?
-- Peter
Cramer says : “ No ! No ! No !
Bear Stearns is not in trouble .
If anything , they ’re more likely to be taken over .
Do n’t move your money from Bear . ”

A dentist 's injection typically causes numbness for several hours .
This experience could soon be history .
Now , Clifford Woolf , professor at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , USA , and his colleagues have developed a combination of two agents which is able to specifically block pain without producing numbness or motor paralysis .
The substance is composed of a normally inactive derivative of the local anesthetic lidocaine , called QX314 , and capsaicin , the pain - producing substance in chili peppers .
Capsaicin works by opening channels present only in pain fibers to allow the QX314 only into these cells , where it blocks their function , Woolf explained in the keynote lecture “ Using Pain to Block Pain ” at the international conference “ Development and function of somatosensation and pain ” of the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine ( MDC ) Berlin - Buch , Germany .
“ This is the first example of using the body ’s own cellular channels as a drug delivery system , targeting treatment only at pain fibers , ” he pointed out .
Local anaesthetics are pain killers which are used during operations whereby patients remain alert during the procedure and thus , do not require general anaesthesia .
“ These common analgesics , including lidocaine , affect , however all neurons in the treated area , ” Woolf said .
As a result , not only are pain receptors blocked but also touch receptors , producing numbness .
Neurons , controlling muscles , are silenced as well , producing a temporary paralysis .
In order to specifically block pain receptors and leave touch sensors and motor function unharmed , the scientists used a normally inactive positively charged form of the local anaesthetic lidocaine called QX314 .
This particular type of lidocaine is special in that it is not able to pass through the cell membrane of neurons because it is charged .
Since local anesthetics only operate inside neurons , an injection of QX314 alone is ineffective , unlike lidocaine which passes easily through the membrane of all cells and therefore blocks all neurons .
As QX314 only enters pain neurons and , thereby , acts exclusively as a pain killer , the researchers combined it with capsaicin .
Capsaicin binds a membrane receptor which is only present in the membrane of neurons responsible for pain perception .
Thus , the chili pepper substance opens channels , enabling QX314 to get into the cell and then block the pain receptors .
Using rats , the scientists could show that , when applied to the animals ’ hind paws , the combination of QX314 and capsaicin exclusively blocks pain receptors .
While completely blocking the response to painful stimuli , the animals could , nevertheless , move normally and were responsive to touch .
There is , however , one disadvantage of this current strategy , said Woolf .
Capsaicin activates the sensors for pain and heat .
“ Thus , people ’s mouths seem to burn when eating very spicy food , ” he said .
“ To use the pain killing combination in patients , another way of opening the channel must be found to allow the QX314 into the cell without capsaicin causing its typical painful heat sensation until the QX314 gets into the cell and then kills the pain , ” commented Woolf .
However , he and his colleagues are working on solving this problem and have recently found promising new non-painful ways of targeting QX314 into pain fibers , which they hope will be available soon for example , for dental patients or for mothers - to - be during labor . “

I have to get this off my chest , so I 'm going to unload here .
I 've been blogging about this at Dan 's site and elsewhere , but this really needs to have a much larger audience .
Rush Limbaugh 's Operation Chaos : his urging Republicans to vote in Democratic primaries , even if it means they have to switch affiliation , and vote strongly for Sen. Clinton .
This is an intentional effort on his part to subvert the outcome of a U.S. national election .
I 'm going to draw a couple of parallels here to illustrate .
First , Cindy Sheehan and CodePink .
RL targets her frequently during his shows , accusing her and CodePink of being un-American and undermining U.S. foreign policy and , by extension , our national security .
In fact , all she is doing is exercising her constitutional freedoms to express herself openly .
Second , a hypothetical situation .
Imagine an American - Islamic organization urging its national membership to vote strongly for a particular candidate in order to undo the campaign of a candidate that 's pro-Israel / pro-nukes , going so far as to rile them up through its various channels of communication ( radio , newspapers , mosques , etc. ) to switch party affiliation during a primary election in order to thwart a particular candidate , with the ultimate goal being to prevent national voter will to run its course .
Our corporate media and their pocketed officials would be all over that , calling it a threat to our national security .
Yet RL is doing exactly this , and not a peep from anyone .
I realize that what he is doing is not illegal in many states , and possibly illegal in others , but given today 's media influence that surpasses that of previous decades , this ability of a charismatic individual in media , or from a particular extremist - religious POV , or from any marginal yet influential extremist group to subvert national voter will in an election , and esp in a presidential election , should maybe be revisited by our courts .

Nice to see there are SOME judges left in this country who put accuracy and integrity of the so - called elections above the sniveling complaints of the crocked manufacturers of voting machines and their secret software .
We have n't " elected " a president in this country since 1996 .
The 2000 " election " turned out to be a " selection " ( wherein the US Supreme Court - with a majority appointed by Regan and Bush stopped the counting of votes long enough to " run out the clock " and declare Bush the winner by 543 votes ) .
The 2004 election was stolen in Ohio as documented by many investigators , including the latest book by Richard Hayes Phillips - WITNESS TO A CRIME - A Citizens ' Audit of an American Election where the proof offered is irrefutable with a CD showing thousands of documents illustrating exactly how it was stolen , including the letter from Diebold CEO Wally O’Dell assuring Ken Blackwell ( Ohio SOS ) Diebold “ would do everything they could to deliver the election to George W. Bush . ”
And Agent 99 - that is groooooooos !

Even worse , since Limbaugh got away with his voter fraud he has taken it further .
He is encouraging riots and mayhem in Denver .
Rush Limbaugh is a terrorist in every way with his daily rantings of BS and idiocy .
He is attempting to recreate an actual riot that caused massive damage .
Is this not against federal law ???
Just because he is listened to by older white men and women does not make it any less of a crime than attempting to seduce kids to gangs .
His idea of truth is like a gang mentality .
I hope someone lists his sponsor and let 's at least hurt his pocketbook because if enough of us unite and refuse to support companies promoting this type of acts they will quit paying for him .

I 'm thinking that there is a legal line between urging citizens to vote for a candidate for reasons having to do with that candidate , and urging citizens to vote for a candidate in order to subvert voter will in an election , and I think it may be time for our courts to define this line .
Just like there are currently legal lines between freedom of expression and inciting a riot .
The line is where a person 's right to express themselves results in another person 's right to be safe in the one case , and where it subverts voters ' collective will in the other case .
You can't stand up on a podium and tell people to throw rocks at the police .
By the same thinking , maybe our courts should take a closer look at whether someone can get on the horn and tell listeners to reregister in a party they do n't belong to and vote for a particular candidate because operatives in their real party are putting together a mudslinging campaign to attack that candidate in the general election , therefore they do n't want the other candidate , who is the candidate who would be elected by the popular vote by their actual party members , to get the nomination , because they have no orchestrated mud campaign to defeat that candidate .
Somewhere in that clearly perverted scenario there must be room for common sense to prevail .

Cheers for Superior Court Judge Linda Feinberg !!!
Too bad Florida Circuit Court Judge William L. Gary was more concerned in the corporate interest in DRE " software ballot boxes " rather than the " public interest " as is Judge Feinberg !!!
( Judge William L. Gary denied plaintiff Christine Jennings ’ motion to allow review of the software code for the ES&S DRE touch - screen machines used in the contested 2006 U.S.
House race between Democrat Christine Jennings and Republican Vern Buchanan for Florida 's 13th district where 18,000 votes mysteriously went missing from the machines . )
The revelation likely to come out of an examination of NJ's Sequoia DRE touch - screen voting application software is that it is remarkably unsophisticated .
Any 3rd year Computer Science college student could design a better software system .
The examination will likely find bugs in the base voting application software as well as the Ballot Definition Software written specifically for the NJ primary election in the weeks just before election day .

Somehow , I doubt it , they seem to go right along with stolen elections .
Absolutely , no questions asked .
Personally , I do n't think Republican congressmen should be allowed to ask questions during oversight hearings , they did n't bother to hold any oversight hearings during the time they had control of the house .

boy , this could blow the whole nightmare wide open !
of course , given that the CEO is so cavalier about the IP , he may feel the machines wo n't reveal anything incriminating .
on the other hand , given how hard they 've fought this exposure , i'd say otherwise .
and given that the cavalier comment came on an ' in - house ' conference call - meant i'm sure to reassure the troops - i'd qualify his opinion of the importance .
nevertheless , his admission that sequoia does n't even own its own IP is pretty damning .
damn , this story should become an explosive scandal , especially considering the implications it carries for how thoroughly we 've sold out our democracy - our press , our defense , our infrastructure , our representation , and our voting system - to the almighty market , the greedy mean and inhuman market .

Hell of an update Brad - way to put out the stringer ( more to come , as they used to say on Johnny Carson , I am sure ) .
Anyone who missed it - it is ADDED at the bottom of the original story .
Sequoia / SVS does NOT own the Intellectual Property ( IP ) rights to the software , but they control the source code .
Not sure where this takes us legally , but I had mistakenly linked the IP rights to the source code , but as the Sequoia CEO Jack Blaine said about the source code , " ... we have the right to modify it any way we want to modify it " .
Gee , do you think that could be done seripticiously during and just before a Presidential or any other election ?

I think it 's pretty clear ( to me at least ) that Move On has let down the progressives time and time again .
Had they jumped on the election integity bandwagon , as so many of them begged them to do so in 2004 ( and continue to to the same radio silence , ) they could have stopped the Bush presidency in its tracks .
If they mustered the full power of their membership to say BS to the 2004 election coup , and continued to beat that drumhead , the media would have had no choice but to cover it and the Bush presidency would be viewed as illegitimate .
Same thing with 9 - 11 , which no one touches , yet is a powder keg just waiting to go off and bring all these bastards down .
But they do n't have the balls to stop it or even realize that they have the power to do so .
Had Move
On , with its 3 million - plus members , focused full power on either of these blackout issues , they could topple these crooks in short order .
Seriously .
They could end the Neocon reign within weeks .
But they wo n't step up .
There are plenty of other so - called progressive organizations who continue to pull their punches , too .
People for the American Way is another one .
These are organizations who are doing good work but do n't seem to really want to go to the mat or Still Do n't Get It .
I find it all sad and irritating .
Even the big so - called liberal magazines wo n't touch the blackout issues --- with the exception of Harper's , who bravely published Mark Crispin Miller 's piece on the theft of 2004 , and Rolling Stone with the Bobby Kennedy piece on same .
But I 've lost my patience with The Nation and The American Prospect and Mother Jones and am letting my subscriptions lapse on all of them , because they just Do n't Get It .
Move
On or PFAW could stop Bush tomorrow .
But to do so they 'll have to stick their neck out and tell the American people the truth .
And they 're obviously all too chickenshit to do that .

To offer a few more comments on the IP / Source Code matter .
While I 'm not an attorney , my understanding is that in order to claim IP rights , one has to assert that right .
As far as I know , Smartmatic ( who , it 's now clear , owns the IP rights to the software ) has not chosen to do so .
They have allowed Sequoia , if Blaine is to be believed , the right to modify their software , etc .
So , it would seem , Smartmatic has essentially given up their assertion of IP rights .
Even if allowing Sequoia to modify their software would n't be considered an abandonment of IP rights , the fact that they have not attempted to protect it in either NJ , or other places where the Sequoia systems have been challenged or examined , seems to me they have no right to assert it now .
In anycase , Smartmatic * has n't * asserted it , Sequoia has , but they have no claim over the IP , so they would n't seem to have standing to make such a claim .
Anywhere .
Smartmatic might try to assert a claim , but then they would be publicly admitting that they did n't really divest of Sequoia after all , which they claimed they had done , when the federal investigators from CFIUS had them under investigation last year ( which is what led to " selling off " Sequoia in the first place ) .
These guys have really done themselves in , as far as I can tell .
I 'm very very sad for them .

If you are searching for the true ringleader of the vote fraud , one need look no farther than AIPAC : http://www.cqpolitics.co...ocid=hsnews-000002711892
CQ HOMELAND SECURITY
April 25 , 2008 – 8:13 p.m. excerpt : " A former senior CIA counterintelligence operative believes the case “ will never go to trial , because of all the ugly stuff that would come out ” about Israeli activities in the United States .
Indeed , Justice Department attorneys have fought to keep “ ugly stuff ” from emerging in the trial of two officials of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , or AIPAC , charged with accepting classified documents from Pentagon official Larry Franklin .
But the federal judge in the case has indicated he might not go along with their strategy .
Last month Judge Thomas Ellis III indefinitely postponed the trial of AIPAC officials Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman , which was scheduled to open next week . "
If they can shut down a federal espionage trial indefinitely , they can sure as hell control the entire election process - and do .
Call it what it is - conspiracy .
CONSPIRACY TO COMMUNICATE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO AGENT OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENT
1 . Defendant LAWRENCE
ANTHONY FRANKLIN was employed by the United States government at the Department of Defense ( DoD ) in the Office of the Secretary of Defense ( OSD ) , International Security Affairs ( ISA ) , Office of Near East and South Asia , Office of Northern Gulf Affairs , Iran desk , and held a Top Secret security clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information ( SCI ) .
FRANKLIN'S office was located within the Pentagon , in the Eastern District of Virginia .
FRANKLIN was also a Colonel in the United States Air Force Reserve ( USAFR ) .

Smartmatic and its Trojan Horse , Sequoia : http://209.85.207.104/se...=clnk&cd=1&gl=us
" Smartmatic is privately held , " Shafer , a former executive with a Texas - based computer voting company , said .
" A controlling interest is held by its founder and CEO , Antonio Mugica , who holds dual Spanish and Venezuelan citizenship . "
However , as Smartmatic 's Uniform Business Report for the Florida Dept. of State , dated Jan. 27 , 2003 , reveals , three men named " Antonio Mugica " sit on the board of the company .
Antonio Mugica is the president ; Antonio Mugica Rivero is chairman of the board , and Antonio Mugica Sesma , company director and father of the president , is reportedly the owner of the house on Dinner Key Drive in Boca Raton where the company was based .
This raises a number of questions .
How has a little family - run company of three relatives and two friends , all Venezuelans , based in a house in Boca Raton in 2003 , been able to take control of the counting of the votes for 40 million Americans ?
And why has the mainstream media ignored the important questions of ownership that surround Sequoia Voting Systems and the other private companies that count our votes ?
How was this tiny backroom company able to attract four senior executives from the U.S. computer giant Unisys to fill the positions of president , two vice presidents , and corporate controller ?
UNISYS - THE MOSSAD'S TROJAN HORSE ?
Unisys is headed by Lawrence A. Weinbach , who is president , chief executive officer and chairman of the computer giant who provides computer equipment and software for all of the key agencies of the U.S. government and leading companies .
Under Weinbach , Unisys has integrated Israeli security software , provided by the Israel - based Check Point Software Technologies and Eurekify , into its own software .
Israeli software , written by Mossad - linked companies , now " secures " the most sensitive computers in the U.S. government and commercial sector .
" Unisys combines Check Point 's security technologies within Unisys solutions across strategic vertical markets including the commercial and federal sectors , " Unisys says on its website .
" 100 percent of the Fortune 100 rely on Check Point for unequalled security and worry - free protection , " it says .

I know you and I have been suspecting and getting circumstantial evidence ( which is admissible in court BTW ) that the military oil complex is active in the electronic voting machine industry .
It has been revealed ( and covered up ) in the past few days , that they have been massively active in injecting propaganda into the MSM :
The effort , which began with the buildup to the Iraq war and continues to this day , has sought to exploit ideological and military allegiances , and also a powerful financial dynamic :
Most of the analysts have ties to military contractors vested in the very war policies they are asked to assess on air .
( NYT , emphasis added ) .
And remember that a while back a defense contracting entity tried to take over directly one of the evoting machine companies .

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage
Espionage is usually part of an institutional effort ( i.e. , governmental or corporate espionage ) , and the term is most readily associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies , primarily for military purposes , but this has been extended to spying involving corporations , known specifically as industrial espionage .
Many nations routinely spy on both their enemies and allies , although they maintain a policy of not making comment on this .
In addition to utilizing agencies within a government many also employ private companies to collect information on their behalf .

We do n't want to be like the wimpy MSM and cut ourselves down by saying we have no evidence .
Do not forget this about evidence :
The popular notion that one cannot be convicted on circumstantial evidence is false .
Most criminal convictions are based , at least in part , on circumstantial evidence that sufficiently links criminal and crime .

So , if circumstantial evidence can be used in criminal trials , it can certainly be used in evote machine civil trials .

It says " VOTES PERCENT " , which , even if it did n't , would be obvious because you cannot have , say , 2.54 reform voters .
There is no such thing as a .54 voter --- it 's either a whole voter or none at all --- but there is such a thing as 2.54 percent of total voters or of total votes .
I 'm not arguing whether whatever you read indicated there were more votes than voters , but the evidence you have supplied does n't make the case .
Well ... never mind .
Perhaps the presentation is just confusing to read without enough spaces between the stats .
In any case , please do n't repeatedly post the same thing .
Somebody will address your concern if they are going to and not if they are n't .
Thank you .

99 - I believe you 're misreading Karen 's post ( easy , since we do n't use a fixed - size font here ) .
The " 2.54 " number you refer to is actually VOTES=2 PERCENT=.54 Karen -
As I recall , NH allowed polling - place registration on Election Day .
If that precinct only had 1 Reform Party voter , but another registered as Reform on the day of the election , that would explain at least that point in your numbers above .
No ?

Yuh , I believe you are right ... and that 's why I posted the caveat because I kept staring at those numbers and it was not jibing with what Karen was saying .
I finally noticed the space between the numbers ... which I should be used to because this sort of thing happens every single time someone tries to post stats , but it got me anyway .
Maybe when yer rich you can get somebody to write you up some code for a stat framework button and everybody can then figure out what everybody else is talking about ....
Or. Not ....

i went back to bbv and found one that shows 0 reform voters because yes the spacing after i copied makes it hard to read /// kurt on bbv says no reform votes should be listed as its a closed primary .... if u r familiar with bbvs site kurt is an election official from pa
i am srry if i broke some posting rules but i think this impossible result ( more reform voters than registered show classic " tag " )
i am rolling my eyes at myself because i didnt make it clear this is pa not nh ... no same day registration in PA
thank you for taking the time to look { Ed Note : I edited this to include the # and % symbols and correct a typo , for clarity 's sake ....
Plus , it might be well to inform everyone that no matter how well you get the numbers to line up in the comment box , in your draft , or from wherever they were copied , they squeeze up to very nearly completely unintelligible here once you hit the post button .

I do n't get the cheering .
we will have rigged elections in november , since the judge scheduled the hearing too late to fix it .
this is a disaster .

Why were so many journalists so aggravated by the latest presidential debate ?
According to Politico scribes John F. Harris and Jim VandeHei , it was n’t about George Stephanopoulos and Charlie Gibson ’s less substantive questions — instead , the problem was that “ this time there were more hard questions for Obama than for Clinton . ”
Politico :
In fact , the balance of political questions ( 15 ) to policy questions ( 13 ) was more substantive than other debates this year that prompted no deluge of protests .
The difference is that this time there were more hard questions for Obama than for Clinton .
Moreover , those questions about Jeremiah Wright , about Obama ’s association with 1960s radical William Ayers , about apparent contradictions between his past and present views on proven wedge issues like gun control , were entirely in - bounds .
If anything they were overdue for a front - runner and likely nominee .
If Obama was covered like Clinton is , one feels certain the media focus would not have been on the questions , but on a candidate performance that at times seemed tinny , impatient , and uncertain .
The difference seems clear : Many journalists are not merely observers but participants in the Obama phenomenon .
( Harris only here :
As one who has assigned journalists to cover Obama at both Politico and the Washington Post , I have witnessed the phenomenon several times .
Some reporters come back and need to go through de-tox , to cure their swooning over Obama ’s political skill .
Even VandeHei seemed to have been bitten by the bug after the Iowa caucus . )
( VandeHei only here :
There is no doubt reporters are smitten with Obama ’s speeches and promises to change politics .
I find his speeches , when he ’s on , pretty electric myself .
It certainly helps his cause that reporters also seem very tired of the Clintons and their paint - by - polls approach to governing . )

If you write the tests up front , you will instinctively be guided to writing loosely coupled code
If you add tests " after the fact " , you will clearly see whether your code is loosely coupled .
How unit testing help reduce and / or measure coupling
Low coupling refers to a relationship in which one module interacts with another module through a stable interface and does not need to be concerned with the other module 's internal implementation .
Some indicators of the level of coupling
Can you test the code with trivial unit tests ?
( I.e. no or few mock objects , no huge amounts of setup or teardown code . )
If you can , your code is likely loosely coupled .
Do you find yourself struggling to test modules independently of eachother ?
Almost certainly high coupling .
Does the code have lots of side - effects in low level code ?
This is a warning sign - it very often lead to code that is harder to test , for example because it might mutate state on lots of unrelated objects .
It 's not always avoidable , though , and if well managed , it does n't need to lead to high coupling - the trick is to isolate the calls that cause the side effects from the external environment through the use of the adapter pattern or similar .
Is the code " controlled from the top " ?
In other words , does the code pass results indicating actions up the call chain instead of having side effects ?
Code that consistently does this tend to be looser coupled ( and easier to unit test ) than code that have side effects , as long as the actions passed up are as generic as possible ( in other words , it does n't help if the action passed back for example is an object that when called will invoke a specific method on an object of a specific class - in that case you 're just delaying execution of a side effect rather than decoupling anything ) .
Is the code highly cohesive ?
That is , does each module carry a single , reasonably simple responsibility , and is all the code with the same responsibility combined in a single module ?
If code implementing a single feature of your application is littered all over the place , or if your methods and classes try to do many different things , you almost invariable end up with a lot of coupling between them , so code with low cohesion is a big red flag alerting you to the likelihood of high coupling as well .
After my previous post on the subject of coupling and cohesion , a lot of the feedback I 've gotten has been from people who want examples of lowering coupling , or want to know how they can see if their code is loosely coupled .
The easiest way I know of doing that also has other benefits :
Whether you prefer Behavior Driven Development or test driven development , or you call it something completely different , writing unit tests provide you with one or two essential things :
The Wikipedia article on coupling provides this definition : The thing is , when you write unit tests , you are putting the unit being tested into a harness .
You need it to interact with your test code , and still carry out its functions .
If you write the tests upfront , you have two alternatives : Either you create a hugely complex harness with lots of mock objects , or you write your code in a way that makes it .
That is another way of formulating low coupling : .
Unit testing under any name is a good test of the ability to call your code in isolation Testing after the fact gives you a measure of how well you have done :
If you have written code with low coupling , it should be easy to unit test .
If you have written code with high degrees of coupling , you 're likely to be in for a world of pain as you try to shoehorn the code into your test harness .
If you have n't bought into TDD / BDD for other reasons , consider it for this reason .
Try it .
The structure of your code will change if it was n't previously loosely coupled , as you 'll quickly tire of writing horrendously complicated tests .
The last point highlight that looking just at coupling in isolation is n't all that helpful .
But thankfully , if you strive to reduce coupling , one of the key things you end up doing a lot of the time is write more cohesive code .
If you 're constantly focused on ensuring code can be tested in isolation , there are few ways around that without making each module cohesive .

Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke at the Zeitgeist conference on Monday Google 's bosses are meeting in Britain on Monday evening to discuss a response to Microsoft 's new talks with Yahoo .
Google 's chief executive Eric Schmidt and the founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are at the company 's European " Zeitgeist " meeting in Hertfordshire .
They told journalists they had only just heard of Microsoft 's latest move and needed to consider their reaction .
Microsoft said on Sunday that it was considering a deal with Yahoo that would not involve a full buyout .
The Reuters news agency is reporting that the potential deal would involve buying Yahoo's search engine business and a minority stake in the rest of the company .
Asked for his comments , Eric Schmidt said : " It 's too early .
After this press conference the three of us will meet and decide what our response is . "
Dominant position
The three also insisted there was no reason for any concern about Google 's dominant position in search advertising , which is the reason Microsoft has cited for its interest in acquiring Yahoo .
Microsoft considers new Yahoo deal " Google is doing very well in what is a very small part of a very large industry , " Mr Schmidt said .
Sergey Brin said that Google had ended up in such a strong position because it delivered a better product , and he added that his company had not used the " strong - arm " tactics adopted by some firms that had fallen foul of the competition regulators .
In its battle against Microsoft , Yahoo has been working with Google in recent weeks on a pilot of its rival 's search advertising technology .
Mr Brin said the two teams had worked very well together .
Employing Yang Asked whether Google would ever consider employing Yahoo's Chief Executive Jerry Yang if he lost his job he said : " Jerry is very talented and if he wants to work at Google we'd be very excited to have him , but I do n't think that 's going to happen . "
Questioned about privacy , the two Google founders insisted that it was social networks , not search engines , which were the main cause for concern .
" Social networking is the big problem , " said Larry Page , explaining that when it came to search data , " there 's been very little evidence of damage . "

( Recasts with Exxon statement , Shell spokesman paragraph 4 )
LAGOS / LONDON , April 28 ( Reuters ) - Nigeria 's oil output was cut by around half on Monday as a strike by workers at Exxon Mobil XOM .
N shut in nearly all its production and recent attacks by Niger Delta rebels hit Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L .
Exxon said it had shut virtually all of its Nigerian output , close to 800,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) , due to the five - day - old strike , equivalent to nearly 40 percent of output from the world ’s eighth largest oil exporter .
The rebel Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( MEND ) said , meanwhile , it had learned from sources at Shell that an attack on a major pipeline on Thursday had forced the company to shut - in an additional 350,000 bpd of production .
A Shell spokesmen declined to comment on how much output had been disrupted by a spate of recent attacks , but said the company was working to recover spilled oil and undertake repairs .
Shell said last week that a prior MEND bombing had obliged it to cut 169,000 bpd of crude output from its Bonny Light stream .
The problems in Nigeria helped push oil prices to a record high near $ 120 a barrel on Monday .
“ From Friday , ( Exxon workers ) have been gradually shutting down operations .
They have shut down 770,000 barrels per day of production , literally all of their production , ” a senior oil official told Reuters in a telephone interview .
Exxon could not say how long the oil would be shut in .
“ Essentially all production of ExxonMobil ’s affiliates in Nigeria has been shut in .
The affiliates will not speculate about the length of the shut - in nor how long it will take to restart production , ” the U.S. major said in an emailed statement .
The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria ( PENGASSAN ) called the strike at Exxon Mobil ’s local unit , targeting oil production and exports , after failing to reach agreement with the company over a labour dispute .
“ There is a complete shutdown of all offices , flow stations , everything .
There is no production , ” one of the sources told Reuters .
TALKS TAKING PLACE
Negotiations between Exxon and PENGASSAN , brokered by the state - run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. ( NNPC ) , resumed on Monday in the capital Abuja .
The Nigerian government had met with the feuding parties last week in an effort to avert any loss in output .
NNPC spokesman Levi Ajuonuma said both parties were eager to resolve the matter and output could be restored 48 hours after a resolution was reached .
PENGASSAN Deputy Secretary - General Lumumba Okugbawa expressed hope a deal would be sealed on Monday .
Shares in Shell , which has born the brunt of the rebel attacks in the Delta , slipped after the latest MEND statement , trading down 0.2 percent at 1447 GMT , compared to a 0.7 percent rise in the DJ Stox European oil and gas sector index .
“ Our sources inside the Shell Petroleum Development Company has informed us today that the consequence of our April 24 attack on the Kula major trunk line is the disruption of a further 350,000 bpd , bringing the total shut - in so far to over 500,000 bpd , ” the MEND said .
If confirmed , the supply loss would bring the amount offline in Africa ’s largest oil exporter to nearly 1.7 million bpd , well over half of its potential output , according to oil companies and industry sources .

OBAMA’S HANDLING OF WRIGHT SITUATION ( Among registered voters who have heard about Wright ) All Voters Dem Primary Voters

Half of voters think Obama ’s comments on Wright were appropriate , but one in four voters ( and slightly more Republicans ) would have liked him to have gone further in his rejection .
OBAMA ’S COMMENTS ON WRIGHT WERE ...
( Among registered voters who have heard about Wright )
All Voters Dem Primary Voters
About right 52 % 53 %
Not critical enough 26 24
Too critical 6 9 Almost half – 47 % - of voters see political motivation as the main reason behind Obama ’s decision to renounce his minister .
Fewer , 34 % think the split came mainly because Obama disagreed with things Wright said .
The poll suggests that Wright had a bigger impact on Republicans than Democrats :
The general election is six months away , and most voters do not expect Wright ’s impact to linger in their own minds .
Only about one in ten say this will affect their November vote a lot .
But more say it will matter to most people they know .
The impact appears strongest among Republicans who are much less likely to vote for any Democrat .
And on the head to heads :
IF THE CANDIDATES WERE ... , WHO WOULD YOU VOTE FOR ?

It 's crystal clear the so - called " firestorm " was more in the minds of beltway bloviators ( as well as conservative talking heads who have nothing else to talk about ) than in the minds of the voters , some of whom would < gasp > never vote D in the first place .
Others figure Obama was tested and passed .
In any case , Clinton and Obama both clean 71 year old Republican McCain 's clock in this poll .
So , media , can we talk about the issues now ?
A highly intelligent former City banker who suffers from Asperger 's syndrome and an economics student have been given suspended jail sentences for cheating in university exams .
Jerome Drean , 34 , and Elnar Askerov , 23 , each received sentences of nine months ' imprisonment suspended for two years after Drean was paid £ 20,000 for posing as Askerov , a student at York University , using a fake identity card .
Both men pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the University of York , between January 2006 and May last year , at a hearing a York Crown Court in January .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The court heard yesterday that Drean , who has worked at the Bank of America and Credit Suisse and earned about £ 2 m in three years , met Askerov a few years ago to help him with his studies .
Robert Smith QC , for Drean , said Askerov , who was described as " not particularly bright academically " , asked Drean to sit his exams for him and paid him between £ 200 and £ 1,000 for each exam .
Drean sat exams in Askerov 's place using a false ID card in Askerov 's name but bearing Drean 's photograph .
They were found out in May last year when an exam invigilator noticed that someone was preparing to sit the exam who was not on the course and that Askerov was not present .
Drean told police his motivation was " money and not wanting to let a friend down " , but Mr Smith said his actions were " profoundly influenced by his disorder " .
Drean 's counsel told how his Asperger 's disorder made him " vastly intelligent " but that it could make him act in socially unacceptable ways .
He said : " He displays a genius but also displays a lack of insight in ordinary social norms . "
Mr Smith continued : " He did not want to do what he did but having been given an invitation he seems to have seen it as some sort of challenge . "
He said Drean was spoken of highly in the financial industry but would never be employed by a major bank again and had destroyed his own life as a result of this conviction .
Mr Smith said : " This man 's life has turned from success to disaster entirely of his own making . "
Alexander Cameron QC , for Askerov , said his client had felt pressure to achieve from his family .
Both men , from London , were also sentenced to undertake a maximum of 300 hours ' unpaid work and ordered to pay costs of £ 1,360 each .
Judge Ashurst made a confiscation order for Drean to pay £ 16,000 .
He has already repaid £ 4,000 .
Sentencing the men , Judge Ashurst described the case as " highly unusual " .
He said : " The court simply does not know how serious a problem examination fraud of this kind may be .
If it 's widespread of course it erodes the confidence the public can have in academic degrees .
This conduct , and your conduct in particular , must be deeply offensive to the thousands of diligent students who do work hard .
" This case involves cheating the University of York and it's quite clear that a degree of sophistication and planning was involved .
" The idea that degrees can be bought and sold must be discouraged . "
The judge said Drean was a man of " exceptional talent " and " quite remarkable abilities " .
He added : " I 'm persuaded that your underlying Asperger 's condition has had a marked influence on your poor judgement as to what happened . "

As the security strategy director in Microsoft 's Trustworthy Computing group , you 've just made the bold claim that Vista , from a first year on the market comparison , has been more secure than Windows XP , Red Hat rhel4ws , Ubuntu 6.06 LTS , and Apple Mac OS X 10.4 .

Your argument seems to break down the difference between researcher - reported vulnerabilities , the number of released patches and the amount of actual vulnerabilities left standing by the end of one year .
And you gave us this sexy chart to examine .

In every category , Vista is either the lowest , or tied for the lowest .
And since your argument seems to boil down to the logic : the less vulnerabilities , the less fixes , the more secure , Vista wins .
Of course , from what our tiny brains make of the case , such an argument does n't take into account factors like just how many people are trying to exploit a particular platform / vulnerability , or just how damaging each exploit can be .
But from that strategic commander chair , you seems to think that these issues balance themselves out .
Maybe you are right .
But I 'm not waiting in the open to find out .

Israelis Almost Took Out Tony Blair 's Jet Israeli Air Force were minutes away from shooting down Tony Blair 's private jet .
JERUSALEM , May 23 , 2008  --
The executive jet being used by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was just minutes away from being shot down by the Israeli Air Force .
Blair , who is now the international community 's special envoy to the Middle East , was traveling earlier this week to a special economic conference in the Palestinian city of Bethlehem from Egyptian airspace when two Israeli fighter jets were scrambled to intercept his plane .
Due to a technical fault in Blair 's aircraft , its pilot did not respond to Israeli air traffic controllers ' calls , leading to suspicions that the jet may have been on a terrorist mission .
The two Israeli planes flew directly above the Blair plane in a position usually taken before attack .
It was then the pilot of the executive jet realized something was wrong and hurriedly made contact with the Israeli air traffic controllers thereby ending the drama .
" They were unaware of it while they were on the plane .
They did n't hear about it until afterwards , " according to Ruti Winterstein , a spokeswoman for Blair 's office .
There was no official comment from the Israeli Defense Force 's press office , which normally refuses to comment on what its calls " operational " details .
But an unnamed security source contacted by ABC News confirmed that the incident took place and that the two Israeli fighters were scrambled in accordance with standard procedures designed to protect Israel 's skies .
The special economic conference in Bethlehem has been convened to raise much - needed funds for the Palestinian Authority , and to stimulate an economic recovery in the hope that it will encourage Palestinians to support the current U.S. - backed peace process with Israel .
I was banging along with my thoughts about the new global changes ( I really need a new term for this ; “ the coming revolutions ” ? … “ new world order ” ( barf ) ? … “ Philosophy 2.0 ” ?
That I like ! ) , and I asked myself , “ Self , what role will religion play throughout these massive changes ? ”
And Self answered , “ Religion will play the same role as nation states .
It ’s just that the associative bond is creedal instead of geographical . ”
What did Self mean ?
Well , nation states nowadays need to choose between connectivity and insularity .
If they choose to connect with other states , economically and politically and epistemologically , then they will reap the deep rewards of cooperation .
But their cultures will also be infiltrated by outside ideas , from Pepsi to disco to women ’s rights .
They will have to learn how to tolerate outside influences and tolerate differences in opinions among their citizenry .
In the end , learning such toleration is a good thing for everyone .
On the other hand , if nation states choose insularity , they will in all likelihood degenerate to the point that the rest of us have to invade and co-opt them , either because we need their resources , or they ’re getting violent , or we ca n’t stand by and watch what they ’re doing to their own citizens .
Same for religion .
Some religions , or sects within religions , are open to outside ideas and influences .
The Protestant tradition I was raised in was always asking how to read the Gospel in the light of our experience gained through science , literature , politics , or other religions .
It was n’t a matter of cleverly combining some literalist reading of , say , Genesis with Darwin ; rather , it was a matter of taking seriously what we learn through our secular studies and using that as a way of opening up new insight into our own religion .
So it was very open to connection with all sorts of new ideas and lines of thought .
The religions which typically grab the headlines , though , are closed .
They stubbornly insist on their own traditions and visions and resort to warfare talk whenever threatened by an idea that challenges their own accepted dogmas ( beating their plowshares back into swords ) .
They are the Irans of the ideological community .
Indeed , the creationist fanatics in Texas are commonly referred to as the Texas Taliban .
Many of these people homeschool their children because they do n’t want them to come into contact with “ corrupting ” ideas – thus shoving them into an educational burka of sorts .
Their mindset is , “ We ’ve got the truth !
Now do n’t disturb us with any new ideas , or we might lose track of it ! ”
It ’s exactly the same mindset as insular nation states .
This is not just an analogy , of course .
The two phenomena are connected .
Most insular nation states use some dogmatic and conservative religion to maintain their powerbase , which typically involves denying a large segment of the population any opportunity to earn money or get involved in politics .
And many insular religions would love nothing more than to set up a compound or restricted community to as to geographically isolate themselves from the outside world .
My secular humanist dream is that insular religious states will become simply impossible as ideas and economic opportunities spread – especially as they spread to women .
Tom Barnett , in Blueprint for the Future , convincingly makes the connection between the oppression of women and the back - asswardness of nation states .
The general rule is true : if women are educated and given the same political and economic opportunities as men , you ’ve got a developed nation on your hands .
( And , no , I will not accept any garbage that sounds like “ In my religion , women have a very special status – just one that is different from that of men . ”
That ultimately is code for “ We keep ‘ em barefoot and pregnant . ” )
If knowledge and commerce get shared , insular religion goes out ( inshallah ) .
But if a religion is interested in exploring new ideas , and furthering itself by co-opting new ideas , then it really can play a role , and a welcome one .
Because in addition to arguing over whether this strategy or that one is the best , we need to also be arguing over the goals we are trying to achieve .
Arguing over goal - setting means arguing over big pictures , and that is exactly where open religions – and not closed ones !
– need to be speaking loud and clear .
Religion can orient efforts and strategies , if their believers are at the same time listening and learning as well from the world outside their own creeds .
The same goes for traditional cultures .
And for each and every one of us .
Gordon Brown and David Cameron have both firmly backed the ground - breaking technique as a means to develop treatments for common conditions that could potentially save millions of lives .
The Prime Minister and Tory leader also support the creation of " saviour siblings " selected by parents in order to provide tissue material for seriously ill children .
Mr Brown has hailed both innovations as " an inherently moral endeavour " .
But opponents from all parties hope to unite to axe both from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill in crunch Commons votes on Monday evening .
And with MPs allowed to vote according to personal conscience , not the party line , on the most contentious elements of the Bill , the result is not predictable .
Leading the fight against so - called " admixed embryos " , Tory MP Edward Leigh said the technique , which involves implanting a human nucleus inside an animal cell , was " a step too far " .
Scientists believe that stem cells harvested from these embryos could provide the key to breakthroughs in the treatment of conditions such as Parkinson 's disease , cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy .
Research is currently being held up by the shortage of human eggs to create stem cells .
But critics of hybrids have branded them " Frankenstein science " , saying it is obscene to combine human and animal genetics .
They also question the benefits , insisting other methods are more effective .
But Mr Leigh said 21 other countries had banned the creation of hybrids .
" In terms of embryonic research we will almost be like a rogue state , " he warned .
But Labour MP Chris Bryant , a former Anglican curate , compared Mr Leigh 's arguments to those used by church leaders against the smallpox vaccine .
He said : " They were wrong and I think you are wrong today . "
There have been fewer than 10 convictions under the current act Mediums and spiritualists fear changes to laws regulating the industry could leave them open to malicious civil action by sceptics .
The union representing spiritual workers is to lobby the government over changes to the industry 's regulation .
The Fraudulent Mediums
Act is due to be repealed next month and replaced by new EU consumer protection regulations .
The British Humanist Association said the change offered vulnerable people greater protection against fraud .
Under the 1951 Fraudulent Mediums
Act , prosecutors have to prove the medium or healer had intended to be fraudulent in order to secure a conviction .
But under the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive , which comes into force in the UK on 26 May , it will be the medium 's responsibility to prove they did not mislead or coerce vulnerable consumers .
' Religion ' The Spiritual Workers ' Association says making mediums subject to the consumer - protection regulations does not recognise spiritualism is a religion .
It plans to lobby the government over the issue on Friday .
Its founder Carole McEntee - Taylor , told BBC News : " The problem is that it 's turning spiritualism the religion into a consumer product , which it is not . "
She said the change in law left mediums more vulnerable to prosecution .
We hope that the new regulations will make real changes to the current situation , where psychic practitioners are permitted to make completely unsubstantiated claims
Hanne Stinson
British Humanist Association
She said : " The Fraudulent Mediums Act protected the medium because it meant person receiving the information was taking personal responsibility .
" They would have to prove the medium was fraudulent or giving them advice which make them make a decision which would cost them money . "
The British Humanist Association 's chief executive Hanne Stinson , said the current law was not fit for purpose .
She said : " We hope that the new regulations will make real changes to the current situation , where psychic practitioners are permitted to make completely unsubstantiated claims and to take payment for their services , without fear of legal action .
" It is high time that this industry is better regulated , with adequate protections for consumers . "
Susie Collings , of the College of Psychic Studies welcomed the new rules , saying they would tighten standards , discourage " less than ethical " practitioners and make it easier for the public to understand what to expect from a reading .
However , she said : " There is always the possibility that mediums will be targeted by people intent on making money by suing what they see as easy targets and that is a big concern for the individual . "

A dangerous pattern has emerged as We are Change activists are framed for assault , and open calls for violence at the upcoming Democratic National Convention are proclaimed .
Rush Limbaugh has openly called for mass riots in " operation chaos " at the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Denver Colorado .
" I am not inspiring or inciting riots , I am dreaming of riots in Denver , " said Limbaugh .
Limbaugh stated that he hopes for a replay of the Chicago riots .
This follows the revelation that the anarchist group recreate 68 is preparing to stage violent acts at the DNC .
Truthalliance .net reports ,
" ReCreate 68 has a massive anti war protest planned for the DNC on the 24th , to which they were never issued a permit for .
Sparking the press to cover the story , Glenn Spagnuolo , the organizer of the group , threatened the City of Denver and all who visit the Democratic National Convention with potential violence , making a direct threat regarding his un-permited plan to occupy the Civic Center , " If the cops try to stop us , we ’ll see what happens . "
The threat estimates there will be 50,000 anti-war demonstrators who will overwhelm law enforcement .
Re-create 68 is now on a collision course with law enforcement to re-create the violence of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago . "
In addition to the danger of violence at the DNC , the peaceful activist group
We are Change has been the target of multiple frame up attempts .
Luke Rudkowski , founder of We are Change , was called a " terrorist " by police for standing in front of the new World Trade Center # 7 building and threatened with being put " … in the hole for 30 days " .
" A terrorist act– I guess they go away for about 30 days , " said the officer .
Rudkowski responds , saying that he is an American citizen , when the officer states , " You ’re right .
But by the time the government figures it out , you ’ll be in the hole for 30 days . "
In August of last year , peaceful protesters who gathered in Montebello Canada to protest the SPP encountered police posing as protesters with threatening rocks , but the peaceful activists were wise enough to spot them and denounce their tactics .
Members of We are Change Ireland were smeared recently in a supposed attack on a European MEP .
Paul Watson writes ,
" During an attempt to assault activists who asked him a question in Dublin , a European MEP tripped and fell on his face and the entire incident was caught on camera , but that did n’t stop the media from reporting that an " anti- EU gang " of thugs had screamed abuse and assaulted Proinsias de Rossa – in a crass attempt to smear opposition to the European Union . "
Now ,
We are Change activist Gary Talis has been smeared for supposedly attacking a wheelchair bound girl .
Cowardly calls for violence against Mr. Talis are prevalent in the wake of this most recent frame up .
As this current pattern unfolds , peaceful groups need to be wary of provocateurs attempting to incite violence or frame peaceful activists for committing criminal acts .
Keep your cameras rolling and stand strong .
Attempts to frame and provocateur peaceful groups only serve to demonstrate the frustration and fear the establishment is feeling .
If violence does ensue at the DNC or elsewhere , the expanding police state will be empowered even further .
The provocateurs ’ goal is to fulfill the image that the mainstream media is attempting to create surrounding peaceful activists as being violent anarchists who damage America ’s image .
Violence will only tighten the grip of the already tightening system .

I LOVE shopping at my local Gourmet Garage as much as the next guy .
But sometimes I plop a can of chicken broth down on the checkout counter and think , “ $ 2.19 ?
For someone to boil chicken bones ?
I want that job . ”
So when I heard that the food you can buy at 99 - cent stores is more diverse than you might imagine , I decided to conduct an experiment .
I ’d make dinner every night for a week using mostly ingredients bought at these stores and then , on the eighth night  once I ’d gotten my game down 
I ’d prepare a meal for friends made only from ingredients bought at 99 - cent stores .
There are 99 - cent stores , and then there is Jack’s .
It ’s Closeout Central , an off - brand oasis .
Located at 110 West 32nd Street , near Herald Square , with satellite stores at 16 East 40th Street and 45 West 45th Street , Jack ’s has not only lots of freezer cases and five or more aisles full of food , but also an upstairs gourmet section with more upscale items  Buitoni and Bertagni prepared pastas , Lindt and Ferrero chocolates , Hero jams  at prices ranging from about $ 1.99 to $ 4.99 .
Making Jack ’s my base of operations , I started with both the 99 - cent and gourmet offerings .
I quickly met with my first surprise .
Though there ’s a constancy to the food items for which 99 - cent stores are famous  pasta , rice , nuts , cookies and candy  other items sometimes ebb and flow .
Sociologist Harry Collins is interviewed in American Scientist on his fascinating mission to find out what we need to do to be considered an expert and what different types of expertise exist .
Collins has spent many years studying how science works .
Not how it is supposed to work , through experiments and falsification and gradual knowledge building , but how it actually works , through social networks , economics and traditions .
He studied physicists who research gravitational waves and realised he was able to have in - depth conversation with gravitational wave theorists even though he could n’t run the equipments or do the maths .
As most expertise plays out in conversation , how much of an expert was he ?
Collins and his colleagues wanted to test the difference between tacit knowledge , what we can do without being able to explain , and explicit knowledge , so they devised some fascinating experiments to see if people could tell the difference .
One ingenious experiment involved testing whether people could tell the difference between a colour blind person and normally sighted version from just talking to them about colour .
It turns out , they can’t .
Technical decision - making is often a matter of debating in committees and the like , so the way expertise works itself out in conversation was always going to be a central concern .
We decided to use the forerunner of the “ Turing test ” ‚Äîthe “ imitation game ” ‚Äîto see whether one kind of expert could be distinguished from another in conversational tests .
In the imitation game , a judge asks open - ended questions of , say , a full - blown expert and someone with interactional expertise only , without knowing who is who .
The judge tries to tell the difference .
In the best - known of the experiments we did in Cardiff , color - blind people were found to be indistinguishable from color perceivers , and we argued this was because the former had been immersed in the language of the latter all their lives .
As a result of this project , the research team have created a ‘ periodic table ’ of different types of expertise and how they manifest themselves .
Collins ’ research is also discussed in an interview for this month ’s Scientific American and many of his publications on expertise are available on his website .

MILWAUKEE  After all the attention showered upon Iowa , New Hampshire and a coast - to - coast string of states with elections this month , the voters of Wisconsin were anticipating having the presidential race to themselves for a week .
But coming contests in Ohio and Texas , as well as a major snowstorm on Sunday , interrupted those plans .
The storm also derailed visits by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama , who canceled campaign stops two days before the Wisconsin primary .
“ The campaign has been intense elsewhere in the country , but I do n’t feel like it ’s been intense here , ” said Susan Lund , a legal secretary from Whitefish Bay , a suburb of Milwaukee .
Even so , Ms. Lund managed to bump into Mrs. Clinton as she ducked into a grocery store on Sunday .
As freezing rain , snow and ice forced Mrs. Clinton to cancel a full day of campaign events Sunday , severe weather warnings in northern Wisconsin kept Mr. Obama away from the state entirely .
He was able to fly to Chapel Hill , N.C. , for a private meeting Sunday morning with John and Elizabeth Edwards , whose endorsements he is seeking in his duel with Mrs. Clinton .

Anthropic reasoning is under debate in the scientific community , and is considered by some as a cop-out .
It has now lost further ground as physicists show that anthropic conclusions mostly reflect our biases rather than our knowledge .
Anthropic reasoning uses the fact that the universe seems fine - tuned to support life as we know it in order to explain various physical phenomena that are otherwise unexplained .
And why is the universe fine - tuned to support life like us ?
Because , if it were otherwise , we would n't be here to observe it .
Case Western Reserve University physicists Irit Maor , Lawrence Krauss , and Glenn Starkman find this explanation troubling .
As they write in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters , the anthropic principle is " based fundamentally on ignorance rather than knowledge . "
So they have tested the robustness of the anthropic explanation , stripping it down to its simplest scientific elements in order to determine what it truly can tell us about the universe we live in .
“ In our work , we have tried to point out the hidden assumptions of anthropic reasoning : in a sense , you need to assume what you are trying to prove , ” the three scientists told PhysOrg.com .
“ Moreover , we have provided a quantitative understanding of this issue . ”
Importantly , anthropic reasoning implies that intelligent life requires the precise conditions found in our universe .
For example , one of these conditions is the dominant contribution of something that acts like a cosmological constant ( CC ) to the energy density of the universe .
Scientists have observed the CC to be not too large or too small that the universe would collapse or rip apart , but about right to allow matter to form galaxies and planets – a habitat for Earthly life .
The anthropic explanation usually claims that life could not exist in a universe with other conditions , and therefore we would not be able to observe a different universe .
However , the claim that life could not exist in a different universe is based on the assumption that we are a typical life form .
Maor , Krauss , and Starkman quantify how strongly anthropic arguments rely on the assumption that we are a typical life form .
The researchers define a parameter space ( a mathematically quantified collection ) made of all possible universes with different CCs , and then try to determine a probability for life ( either as we know it , or as we do n't know it ) within this collection .
The problem here , they explain , is that we do n't know what we can't observe , which leads to a sampling bias .
" As we are the only life - form and this is the only Universe we know , we have no information whatsoever about how Life extends over the rest of the parameter space , " the researchers explain in their study .
" It might spread over a wide range , implying life can take many forms , or it might require exactly the parameter values which lead to our life - form .
. . .
However , our limited data set of a single sample of a single point does not probe much of parameter space . "
They come to the conclusion that , without the assumption of typicality , the connection between the value of the CC and the existence of life cannot be established , and therefore the existence of life cannot explain the CC ’s special value .
" We can say that our existence is a good indicator of the observed CC , " they conclude , emphasizing that correlation is far from causation .
" The correlations illuminated by our limited anthropic understanding imply that what we ultimately learn from these arguments is that the existence of us and the existence of the observed value of the CC do not contradict each other .
That is nice , but hardly surprising . "
Unfortunately , the Case researchers and others still have more work to do before anthropic reasoning can successfully be dismissed as an explanation for why the all the parameters of our universe are such that it can support life .
“ This debate is a complex one , and is not likely to be settled quickly because it is quite interdisciplinary , ” the researchers explain .
“ It involves questions about the philosophy and methodology behind science , as well as questions about the actual observations and the mathematics used to analyze them .
Moreover , as we state in the paper , the controversy stems , in large part , from our ignorance .
We will need to learn more about the universe , and the fundamental laws governing it , before we can truly address some of these issues in an unambiguous way . ”
Still , there is no guarantee that a fundamental explanation for these questions even exists .
This may be one “ why ? ” that ca n’t be answered in a definitive manner .
“ Fundamental physics may or may not provide an explanation of the particular values of our universe 's life - supporting parameters , ” the researchers explain .
“ We may discover that the question ‘ why is the mass of the proton 2000 times the mass of the electron ? ’ ( which is essential for our exact form of life ) is more like ‘ why is the radius of Jupiter 's orbit around the sun 5 times the radius of Earth's ? ’ than like ‘ why does water expand when frozen ? ’ – a matter of probability rather than fundamental .
“ However , we should n't assume that no explanation exists just because we do n't yet know one , and , consequently , we should keep looking for an explanation at least until we have a convincing scientific theory that explains many other things and within which one can show that it is impossible to provide an explanation .
The most interesting thing is that – unless we do discover a theory of everything – we will not know what is left to discover , which makes the search exciting . ”

Pushing Daisies was nominated for three Golden Globes in the US
The second episode of Anna Friel 's hit US drama Pushing Daisies will not be screened by ITV , it has emerged .
The UK broadcaster bought the rights to the entire nine - part series , but only has space in its schedule to show eight programmes before Euro 2008 begins .
Viewers will skip straight to episode three of the modern - day fairytale , about a man who brings people back from the dead - including his first love .
Episode one brought 5.7 million viewers to ITV1 on Saturday night .
" Episode two was the only show we could drop without spoiling the storyline , " an ITV spokesman said .
Repeat showing
The missing instalment sees lead character Ned coming to terms with his power , interspersed with flashbacks to his childhood - including a school lesson where he was expected to dissect a frog .
As with the first episode , it was directed by Men In Black and Addams Family film - maker Barry Sonnenfeld .
However , ITV said the programme would " be shown at some point because the series will be repeated " .
The broadcaster said its decision was due to the US writers ' strike , which meant only nine episodes of Pushing Daisies were made .
The series has made former Brookside star Anna Friel a household name in the US .
It won her a Golden Globe nomination for best actress , although she was beaten to the prize by Tina Fey , who writes and stars in comedy series 30 Rock .
A second series is due to start filming later this year .
ITV and the BBC will split coverage of the Euro 2008 football tournament , which begins on 7 June .

There 's been a great deal of discussion over the past few weeks over the miserable state of the the Right , the Republican Party , and conservatism ( a Venn diagram is probably in order here to show the relationships and intersections of those three groups ) .
See George Packer , Fred Thompson , James Joyner , Andrew Sullivan , Ezra Klein , Stephen Bainbridge , Arnold Kling and Megan McArdle ( twice ) .
I 'm sure I 'll have a great deal more to say on this subject at the new site I 've launched with Patrick Ruffini and Soren Dayton , The Next Right .
In the meantime , while I cannot identify a specific point of failure , I can pretty easily summarize the journey to failure in just two quotes .
From Ronald Reagan :
To Rick Santorum :
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
The Pentagon is worried that " backdoors " in computer processors might leave the American military vulnerable to an instant electronic shut - down .
Those fears only grew , after an Israeli strike on an alleged nuclear facility in Syria .
Many speculated that Syrian air defenses had been sabotaged by chips with a built - in ' kill switch " – commercial off - the - shelf microprocessors in the Syrian radar might have been purposely fabricated with a hidden “ backdoor ” inside .
By sending a preprogrammed code to those chips , an unknown antagonist had disrupted the chips ' function and temporarily blocked the radar . "
This all had a very familiar ring to it .
Those with long memories may also recall exactly the same scenario before : air defenses knocked out by the secret activation of code smuggled though in commercial hardware .
This was back in 1991 and the first Iraq War , when the knockout blow was administered by a virus carried by a printer :
One printer , one virus , one disabled Iraqi air defence .
* U.S. News & World Report published news of the Gulf War virus in its coverage of the war , a narrative that also found its way into " Triumph Without Victory , " the magazine 's subsequent book on Desert Storm .
The Gulf War virus , wrote U.S. News , attacked Saddam 's defenses by " devouring windows " Iraqi defenders used to check on aspects of their air defense system .
" Each time a technician opened a window ... the window would disappear and the information would vanish . "
The virus was " smuggled to Baghdad through Amman , Jordan " in chips inside a printer . *
... or maybe not .
As The Register goes on to explain , this story actually started as an April Fool 's joke :
Frankly , this is a great story .
It 's amusing to remember how it kicked up a storm in 1991 after its initial appearance as an April Fool 's joke in Infoworld * magazine .
*
The gag asserted the National Security Agency had developed the computer virus to disable Iraqi air defense computers by eating windows – " gobbling them at the edges ... "
The virus , called AF / 91 , was smuggled into Iraq through Jordan , hidden in a chip in a printer – the latter being a distinguishing feature of many subsequent appearances of the hoax .
The details of the news story match the hoax closely .
It turns out the original story was translated in a Japanese magazine , where the joke element was lost .
It was then picked up by US media including U.S. News
& World Report hen it was retranslated , and the rest is history -
" From there , the bogus story was reported by the Associated Press , CNN ,
ABC Nightline , and newspapers across the country . "
John Gantz , who wrote the original spoof , was irked that US News & World Report , who covered the story never admitted their error .
It turns out that two
' senior level intelligence officers ' had confirmed the story … and they were not about to deny it now .
One suspects that it suited them for people to believe killer chips were the secret weapon , rather than seeing any coverage of the actual electronic warfare technology used to take down Iraqi air defenses .
Which is all fine – except that it might get some people looking in the wrong direction for the next threat .
As The Register
notes , as late as 2004 , at least one Air Force officer still thought the story was true .
Are there other areas where defense policy is based on urban myths ?
The linked rings on every Chinese Coke bottle and the leaping athletes on each McDonald 's paper bag testify to the power the world 's biggest corporations believe this summer 's Olympics wields .
But having spent huge sums , the companies sponsoring the Beijing games are about to find themselves the targets of a new , more vigorous war on China 's human rights record by campaigners boosted by the success of protests along the torch relay route .
Yesterday a coalition of Tibetan groups warned Coca - Cola that it would be " complicit in a humanitarian disaster " unless it used its influence to ensure Tibet was dropped from the torch route .
And tomorrow , Dream for Darfur will launch a critical " report card " on sponsors of the games .
Campaigners are urging companies to press the International Olympic Committee and Beijing itself for change - or risk damaging their brands .
" Companies [ who do not act ] will get physical protests ; they will get letters ; we will ask people to turn off their adverts , " said Ellen Freudenheim , director of corporate outreach at Dream for Darfur , which argues that they should press China to put pressure on Sudan as its major oil buyer .
" Sponsors do n't make policy and we understand that .
But combined they have about the equivalent of the GDP of Canada , the world 's eighth largest economy ; they have government affairs offices ; they have lobbying firms ; they have international presences - and they all do engage in politics . " .
Canny activists are targeting the stars who represent the brands too : George Clooney has already said he has raised the issue of Darfur with Omega , the Olympic sponsor and watch manufacturer which he advertises .
The aim is to create a domino effect as spokespeople or consumers pressure sponsors , who in turn push the IOC into lobbying China .
Each of the 12 global partners for this year 's event have paid £ 30 - 40 m for a four - year deal .
An IOC spokeswoman said yesterday : " A number of companies engage in partnerships with the IOC and the Olympic Movement to help us fund the work we do and spread the Olympic values .
Their support is key not only to the success of the Olympic Games but also to the sustainability of the Olympic Movement .
In the period 2001 - 2004 , sponsors contributed $ 1,459 m , 39 % of the IOC 's revenue .
Activists believe their protests are already having an effect .
The angry reception afforded the Beijing torch relay in London , Paris and San Francisco earlier this month caused acute discomfort to the relay sponsors Coca - Cola , Lenovo and Samsung .
Last week , Human Rights Watch accused " cowardly " partners of " remaining " largely silent " in the face of abuses ; just a few days earlier the media freedom body Reporters Without Borders disrupted Coca - Cola 's annual general meeting .
Campaigners say some sponsors are raising concerns privately .
" Realistically , everyone who signed up for Beijing knew there were various risks involved , " said Damien Ryan , a Hong Kong - based media consultant advising several sponsors .
He acknowledged that this " risk factor has escalated " .
Activists are well aware that multinationals hope sponsoring the Beijing games will give them privileged access to 1.3 billion increasingly wealthy people without entrenched purchasing habits .
" Almost all of the top level sponsors want to leverage the games to a better market position in China , " said David Wolf , president of Beijing - based corporate advisers Wolf Group Asia .
Olympic sponsors argue it is simply unfair to hold them responsible for every action by the Chinese authorities .
The sportswear giant Adidas , a Beijing rather than IOC partner , said in a statment it was " conscious of the exceptional importance of the protection of human rights " .
" Sponsors , however , should not be expected to solve political issues .
We clearly see the limits of our influence . "
A Coca -Cola spokesperson pointed out that the soft drinks giant had supported the Olympics since 1928 , expressed " deep concern " for the situation in Tibet and cited its support for charities working in Sudan .
Amnesty has asked all Beijing games partners to raise human rights concerns directly with the IOC and Beijing .
" The universal declaration on human rights calls on every individual and organ of society , which includes corporations , to ensure human rights are respected .
Corporations do have influence , and we would call on them to exert it publicly , " said Robert Gooden , Amnesty 's Asian - Pacific campaign co-ordinator .
Mark Beaumont crossed the finish line at 1430 GMT
Trip highlights
Mark Beaumont , from Fife , completed the journey in 195 days - beating the previous record of 276 days .
The 25 - year - old crossed the finish line at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris at 1430 GMT after an 18,000 - mile journey which began on 5 August last year .
Mr Beaumont passed through 20 countries on his way , including Pakistan , Malaysia , Australia , New Zealand and the US .
' Some sleep '
His solo journey has been dramatic at times .
He endured floods and road rage , and was knocked off his bike in the American state of Louisiana by an elderly motorist who drove through a red light .
Mr Beaumont , who is originally from Bridge of Cally in Perthshire but now lives in Newburgh , also had his wallet and camera stolen from a motel .
However , he is now celebrating .
He said : " I 'm delighted , although I think it will take a while for it to sink in .
" It 's great to see my friends and family and now I 'm looking forward to getting some sleep .
" The challenge was one of those things which was out there to be done .
" I love the idea of being the first and the fastest and I felt I was capable of beating the record . "
Mr Beaumont was met at the finish line by his mother Una , father Kevin and sisters , Heather and Hannah .
His mother has been co-ordinating his trip - paving the way with embassies , arranging flights , dealing with the media , organising transport and making sure his bike was serviced .
Mrs Beaumont said : " I am very proud of him .
With Mark , the passion is being the first and the fastest .
" It 's about pushing himself to the limit . "
He has received messages of congratulation from Prince William and Olympic cyclist Chris Hoy .
Guinness World Records spokeswoman Amarilis Espinoza said they were aware of Mr Beaumont 's attempt .
" We will be reviewing documentation from him and our researchers will go through the paperwork , but it has been logged as an official attempt and it seems everything is in order . "
Italian police have arrested 39 people and seized truckloads of fake olive oil destined for the United States , Germany and Switzerland to be sold at a big profit .
Police said on Monday they seized 25,000 litres of the fake oil .
The gang was adding flavouring and colourants to vegetable oil and slapping false labels on to bottles that claimed the contents were extra-virgin olive oil .
Random tests on olive oil , as well as suspicions raised by some Italian restaurateurs and retailers , had led police to make the discovery .
Police impounded contents of seven premises where the fake oil was being produced .
" We blocked the export of huge amounts of the oil to America , Germany and Switzerland , avoiding another international scandal after the buffalo mozzarella case , " said Ernesto Di Gregorio , a Carabinieri police chief in the southern city of Naples .
Several countries banned imports of Italian mozzarella when high levels of dioxin were found in the cheese – something blamed on the illegal dumping and burning of waste around the Naples area where the buffalo that provide the milk graze .
Italy exports 914 million euros of virgin and extra virgin oil each year .
A consumer group said the fake oil scam could further dent Italy 's reputation for high quality produce after police made a similar raid on makers of fake wine earlier this month .
" After wine and mozzarella we now have olive oil , which like the other two is an excellent product of which Italy is proud around the world , " said consumers ' association Aduc .
" It will end up that consumers abroad , when they buy Italian produce , they will have the same doubts as when they buy Chinese products , " it said , in an apparent reference to recalls of Chinese - made toys and concerns about fake goods .

Dr Colin Wakelin tries in vain to save a female iguana
Police on Grand Cayman are hunting criminals who slaughtered six of the island 's iconic and critically endangered giant blue iguanas .
The attacks , which also left three other animals injured , occurred on Saturday night in a captive breeding facility on the Caribbean island .
The police are confident the crime was perpetrated by humans .
The dead and injured iguanas seem to have been gouged by knives and show evidence of being kicked and jumped on .
Volunteers who look after the iguanas discovered the bodies on the Sunday morning .
There have not been any arrests yet but local people and businesses have donated reward money for information of KYD $ 11,000 ( £ 6,700 ) .
The ferocity of the attack has shocked islanders " This incomprehensible carnage has brought people to tears , " said Frederic Burton , director of the Blue Iguana Recovery Programme ( BIRP ) which is responsible for breeding the iguanas in pens before they are freed into the wild .
To the people on the island of Grand Cayman , it was not unlike the slaughter of the gorillas last year in the Democratic Republic of Congo , with the body of one dead iguana still missing but its entrails left strewn outside the pen in which it lived .
Some of the pens have blood on the walls .
The iguanas are turquoise blue in colour , weigh up to 10kg , live for about 20 years .
They are listed by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as critically endangered .
GRAND CAYMAN BLUE IGUANA Scientific name : Cyclura lewisi Related to iguanas found on Cayman Brac and Little Cayman , but quite distinct Never stops growing , but growth rate slows with age Biggest adults believed to be up to 1.4 m nose to tail Endemic to Grand Cayman , i.e. found nowhere else Blue colour only expressed in the presence of other iguanas However , because of a successful captive breeding programme on the island , supported by local and international NGOs and community groups , the species seemed to have been saved from extinction and their numbers were growing .
While in 2005 there were only 25 of these iguanas left in the world , now there are 140 iguanas in the captive breeding facility on Grand Cayman , and another 230 iguanas living freely in a nature reserve on the island .
" This has shocked people far beyond just the conservation community and brought out stronger than ever the way this uniquely Caymanian creature has become an icon of the Cayman Islands ' national culture , " explained Burton .
" Each of the blue iguanas killed had rich life stories and distinct personalities .
Many people feel they have lost close personal friends , " he said .
There has not been an attack on the iguanas like this before from people , although iguanas have been killed by wild dogs .
One of the dead adult iguanas was " Digger " , a symbol of the BIRP and the iguana that appears on one of the postage stamps of the Cayman Islands .
" They were also the ones that people knew and loved .
It is a setback and a horrible tragedy , " said Burton .
The attack comes at a time when naturalists on the island are hoping for government legislation to protect significant tracts of shrubland for the iguanas and other animals .
These deaths were of mature adults , capable of producing large egg clutches and could have kick - started the restoration of a wild population .
It is estimated that there needs to be at least 1,000 iguanas for the population to become stable and have a real chance of surviving .
" We are hoping for between 400 - 500 hectares of land to be protected - this is the area we need to support 1,000 iguanas , " said Dr Matt Cottam , senior research officer for the Cayman Islands Department of the Environment .
" We are all so shocked at this slaughter .
But we are also overwhelmed by the support from the local and international community since this news broke , " he said .
The BIRP and National Trust staff and volunteers are guarding the facility while additional security systems are put in place .

The couple acted a guarantors for their daughter
A County Armagh couple whose daughter died while at university in Liverpool have been told they must pay for her accommodation for the rest of the year .
The letting agent involved is claiming that because the girl 's parents acted as guarantors on the lease , they are liable for the debt .
Sinn Féin's Mickey Brady said the agent 's demand was " very unfair " .
Mr Brady said the Bessbrook family had received demands for rent owed since her death and threats of legal action .
" The agent is quite clearly arguing that the young girl , because of her sudden death in January , has breached the lease agreement and is demanding that the rent be paid in full , " he said .
" This is another example of ruthlessness of the worse kind , and a fixation on ensuring that the money owed will be obtained even if it has to override a family 's grief .
" This family is still traumatised by the sudden death of their precious daughter and now they have to cope with the added pressure and fears of debt collectors and court cases .
" In all my years in dealing with agencies and officials , I have never come across such a totally unsympathetic attitude . "
Lawrence O'Donnell : Clinton victory speech actually a concession speech David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday May 14 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Political analyst Lawrence O'Donnell reported before the West Virginia primary that a senior Clinton campaign official had told him Hillary Clinton would be dropping out of the president race by June 15 .
Now , even following Clinton 's solid victory in West Virginia , O'Donnell says he has no reason to change what he said .
" Listen to Hillary Clinton 's speech last night , " he told CNN's Kyra Phillips .
" It was a victory speech , but if you read the right lines , you can see that it was actually her concession speech about where this is going .
Lines that you never heard before May in Clinton 's speeches . "
O'Donnell pointed to phrases like " I deeply admire Senator Obama " and " I will work my heart out for the nominee . "
" This campaign understands reality , " he emphasized " They know where it 's going .
She will be supporting Senator Obama by June 15 . "
In response , Phillips played a clip of Clinton saying in the same speech , " I am more determined than ever to carry on this campaign until everyone has had a chance to make their voices heard . "
" What she just said was , ' I 'm in this until June third , ' " O'Donnell explained .
He added that by expressing her admiration for Senator Obama , Clinton is adopting a new tone , but that to give that changed tone the maximum public exposure she has to keep campaigning .
" She alienated a lot of Democratic voters with her campaigning style , " O'Donnell stated .
" She needs to stay in this campaign to rehabilitate her image ... and then also to ease her supporters ... into the reality that the nominee is going to be Senator Barack Obama .
...
What she is doing now is extremely helpful to the party . "

Transcript via closed captions :: thank you very much .
senator hillary clinton gets the big win that everyone expected from her in west virginia , but now what ?
lawrence o'donnell is a contributor to " the huffington post . " last week , he said he had intel that said that clinton would drop out of the race by june 15th .
lawrence , good morning .
what do you think ? :: good to be with you , kyra .
as i said , and i reported on huffington post and here on cnn last week , that a senior campaign official , clinton confidant , has told me the exit strategy is for her to be out by june 15th .
he said they will go through all of the voting , they will take about a week after that to make their case for the superdelegates and then basically surrender .
listen to hillary clinton 's speech last night .
it was a victory speech , but if you read the right lines , you can see that it was actually her concession speech about where this is going .
lines that you never heard before may in clinton speeches .
for example , " i deeply admire senator obama .
we have always stood together on what is most important .
our nominee will be stronger because of this primary campaign .
i will work my heart out for the nominee . "
she is very clearly implying in that speech last night that she will not be the nominee . :: well -- :: this campaign understands reality .
they know where it 's going .
she will be supporting senator obama by june 15th . :: okay .
listening to what you just said , let 's take a listen to another sound bite here and let me get your reaction . :: i am more determined than ever to carry on this campaign .
until everyone has had a chance to make their voices heard . :: okay .
little different than what you -- :: kyra , that 's exactly -- no. that was the next line i was going to read to you .
what it seems to me just said was , " i'm in this until june 3rd . " that 's when all the votes will have been heard .
by may 31st , there will be a decision on how the democrats are going to handle michigan and florida at the convention , so that will be dealt with .
june 3 srd when the final votes are cast in this primary .
she 's saying very clearly in that sentence , in effect , echoing what terry mcauliffe said last week after i reported my information .
terry mcauliffe came out and said this would be concluded by the middle of june , and there 's only one way this can be concluded by the middle of june .
there 's no way hillary clinton can reverse it . :: do you think , listening to what you have to say here , is she now kind of turning around instead of doing any type of negative speeches or advertising , she 's caring more about the party now ?
is she stepping away from -- :: exactly .
exactly .
" i deeply admire senator obama . " yeah , that 's a new tone and that 's exactly what she needs to do .
she alienated a lot of democratic voters with her campaigning style .
she 's going to win back those hearts and minds through the final weeks of this campaign .
look , if she had dropped out last week when we all said it was over , the cameras would have been turned off .
the cnn camera would have been turned off , and no one would have cared what she said after that .
she needs to stay in this campaign to rehabilitate her image in a certain sector of the democratic party and then also to ease her supporters , especially her more ardent supporters , into the reality that the nominee is going to be senator barack obama , who she admires so deeply .
she 's got to do that gradually .
that 's exactly what she 's doing .
what she 's doing now is extremely help to feel the party , extremely help to feel the eventual nominee . :: you 're executive producer of " the west wing , " very successful show .
all the drama going on within this election year , it 's historical .
do you see a new show ? :: well , you know , we predicted a lot of this , i mean , quite by accident .
he we had a minority candidate played by jimmy smits who got our nomination on the democratic side many what turned out to be a hard - fought , brokered convention with three possible nominees .
so , it 's been fun for us to watch how this has developed this year basically following a lot of the story lines we did a couple years ago . :: we ale see another show and learn what happens four years from now .
lawrence o'connell , thank you .

What is it about London Mayors and Marxist Sects ?
Boris Johnson , Munira Mirza , the Revolutionary Communist Party and the delayed coming of history
Posted by Michael Mosbacher
Michael Mosbacher on London Mayors , Marxist sects and the delayed coming of history .
Michael Mosbacher writes in a personal capacity .
As Mayor of London , Ken Livingstone drew many of his - publicly funded and extremely well paid - advisors from one particularly obscure Marxist sect , Socialist Action .
One might have thought that - with the political demise of Ken Livingstone - the era of the advisors to the London Mayor coming from Marxist sects would be at an end .
This does not , however , appear to be the case .
Yesterday 's Sunday Times records that Munira Mirza has been appointed as Boris Johnson 's " cultural advisor " .
The piece points out that Munira is the third person to be appointed by Boris Johnson who used to work for the think - tank Policy Exchange .
To my mind , much more interesting is the fact that Munira is very much part of the tight - knit little coterie which came out of the Revolutionary Communist Party .
This Marxist sect emerged around University of Kent at Canterbury sociologist Frank Furedi .
The Revolutionary Communist Party - and its magazine Living Marxism - was noted for taking provocative positions which outraged others on the left .
Famously the magazine ran to ground when ITN successfully sued Living Marxism for libel for claiming that it had fabricated its Srebrenica coverage .
While the Revolutionary Communist Party has ostensibly dissolved itself , its former personnel are still much in evidence and are still operating as a tight - knit group .
They are still noted for taking provocative positions .
There is Frank Furedi himself , Claire Fox of the Institute of Ideas and Mick Hume of The Times and Spiked Online .
Lesser figures include Bill Durodi� of Cranfield University , Ann Furedi , Frank Furedi's wife and the Chief Executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service , and - allegedly - the contrarian film maker Martin Durkin .
Munira Mirza herself runs what in less charitable times would have been described as a front organisation - the Manifesto Club .
Its strap - line is " history is still young " .
This might seem just an anodyne bit of snappy copy , but it fits rather well into what is the overall perspective of the Revolutionary Communist Party coterie .
Their perspective is that Marx is right , only that previous Marxists have got the timing wrong .
We are still in the productive stages of capitalism - the time for revolution will still come , it is just that history is not ready yet .
Michael Mosbacher is Director of the Social ; Affairs Unit .

HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) -- Zimbabwe 's High Court ruled Monday it can force the country 's electoral commission to release the results of the March 29 presidential election , but it is still unclear if the court will do so .
The court is expected to announce Tuesday morning if the matter is urgent , or whether the petition will be added to the long list of other matters on the court 's docket .
" If the court rules that the matter is urgent , we will go to arguments on the main matter as to whether the commission should be compelled to release the results , " said Andrew Makoni , a lawyer for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change .
He said he expects the court , led by Justice Tendai Uchena , to announce Tuesday at 10 a.m. whether the matter is urgent .
If it is deemed urgent , the court could immediately announce whether it will order the commission to release the results , he said .
But if it decides the petition is not urgent , it could take months before there is a ruling .

MDC petitioned the court Friday , asking it to compel the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to release the results , which it says show a victory for its leader , Morgan Tsvangirai .
The commission has dragged its feet on releasing the results , despite international calls to do so to avoid possible violence and questions about vote - rigging .
In the absence of official results , Zimbabwe 's state - run newspaper has indicated neither Tsvangirai nor President Robert Mugabe received enough votes to avoid a runoff .
Late Monday , the state - run newspaper Harare Herald reported five election officials in Zimbabwe had been arrested , accused of undercounting votes for Mugabe .
According to the Herald , the five officials , who were being charged with either fraud or criminal abuse of duty as public officers , tampered with nearly 5,000 votes .
Police were investigating problems in two other areas where they said another 1,400 votes were involved .
More than 2.3 million votes were cast .
The March 29 election presented the most formidable challenge to Mugabe 's 28 years of rule in Zimbabwe .
Tsvangirai has warned that the 84 - year - old incumbent plans to use the election delay -- including the possible runoff -- for underhanded tactics to ensure he remains in power .
Those tactics , he said , include mobilizing his hardline supporters -- the country 's war veterans .
" In the runoff , violence will thus be the new weapon to reverse the people 's win , " Tsvangirai said Saturday .
" In this regard , we know that thousands of army recruits are being recruited , militants are being rehabilitated and war veterans are already on a warpath . "
Watch why Zimbabweans are growing more suspicious »
On Sunday , Mugabe called on his supporters to make sure the country 's land does not " slip away from us and go back into the hands of the whites , " according to the state - run newspaper .
Mugabe spoke as dozens of hardline war veterans invaded at least six white - owned farms during the weekend .
Mugabe has strong support among the veterans of Zimbabwe 's war for independence , who were the main beneficiaries of his land redistribution policies that began in 2000 .
Under those policies , Mugabe seized commercially white - owned farms and gave the land to black Zimbabweans , saying they were cheated under colonial rule .
The number of white - owned farms in Zimbabwe , which used to be in the thousands , has dwindled to about 400 .
Much of the farmland is not being harvested and many analysts blame Zimbabwe 's current economic collapse -- including staggering inflation and 80 percent unemployment -- on the controversial farm seizures .
Speaking at a funeral for his wife 's uncle Sunday , Mugabe addressed recent reports that several evicted white farmers had threatened the current black owners , according to a report in Monday 's state - run newspaper .
" Some of us are still on small plots of land , but all the same that land should remain ours , " Mugabe said , according to The Herald .
" This is not the time to hear that the fight for our land has retrogressed . "
Tensions were ignited Friday after reports surfaced that a war veterans leader , Jabulani Sibanda , accused white farmers -- bolstered by the opposition 's victory over Mugabe 's ruling party in parliament -- of ordering the black owners to leave the land .
A look at the candidates »
That apparently prompted some hardline war veterans Saturday to invade six white - owned farms in Zimbabwe 's southern Masvingo province .
They gave the farmers and their families between five and 10 hours to vacate their property , the head of Zimbabwe 's Commercial Farmers ' Union , Hendrick Olivier , told CNN .
The situation in Masvingo was later resolved , he said .
On Sunday , about 25 war veterans camped on a farm in the northern province of Mashonaland Central and chanted liberation war slogans while the farmer and his family locked themselves inside their house , Olivier said .
Olivier called the raids " isolated incidents at this stage . "

The hysterical reaction in Congress to Jimmy Carter ’s trip to the Middle East , where he met with a Hamas leader today , is precisely the sort of thing I hope the new “ pro-Israel , pro-peace ” group J Street speaks out against .
This week Rep. Sue Myrick ( R - NC ) said she wants to revoke Carter ’s passport .
And Rep. Joseph Knollenberg ( R - MI ) introduced the Coordinated American Response to Extreme Radicals Act ( CARTER )
Act to cut all federal funding to the Carter Center at Emory University .
That ’s the organization that pours resources into humanitarian projects like eradicating the Guinea worm parasite in Africa and was lauded in Carter ’s 2002 Nobel Peace Prize citation .
New York Democratic representative Gary Ackerman came out against the CARTER
Act , but , in the process , managed to be just as petty and juvenile as his Republican colleagues .
As the New York Sun reported today :
“ The man is entitled his idiotic , moronic , nonsensical , anti-commonsensical , foolish opinions .
And all that being said , he is still entitled to have them .
I do n’t think we should be cutting off funding for any ex presidents to do things .
We did n’t cut off Richard Nixon , ” he said .
Mr. Ackerman added that if Mr. Carter came to his home for the Passover Seder , he would ask him to read the part of the simple son , the boy who does not know enough to even ask a question about the story of the Jewish exodus from ancient Egypt .
Should n’t the Democratic leadership be bothered by this kind of rhetoric directed against a former president of their own party ?
More important , would Ackerman slap his offensive “ simple son ” label on Colin Powell or Brent Scowcroft or Zbigniew Brzezinski or Lee Hamilton or Shlomo Ben - Ami , all of whom have called for engagement with Hamas .
And what about the 64 percent of actual Israelis who favor direct talks with Hamas ?

An interesting property rights trial was held in my hometown of Boulder , Colorado , and the entire city is buzzing about it .
Here 's the short version :
Twenty - three years ago , Don and Susie Kirlin bought an undeveloped lot down the street from their home on the outskirts of Boulder .
The property was adjacent to Edith Stevens and Richard McLean 's home .
Stevens and McClean landscaped their own property in such a way that it became convenient to trespass on the Kirlin 's lot to access their own backyard .
Stevens and McClean created paths on the Kirlin 's property , threw summer parties on the Kirlin 's property and kept a wood pile on the Kirlin 's property .
Stevens and McClean admitted in court they knew they were trespassing and never asked the Kirlins permission to use the lot .
When the Kirlins , who had been paying taxes and homeowner fees on the property all along , begen to erect a fence on their property as the first step in building a house , Stevens and McClean ( a former former district court judge , Boulder mayor , and city councilman ) hired a lawyer to sue the Kirlins for ownership of the property under the doctrine of " adverse possession " [ Wikipedia entry ] .
This doctrine states that if a person uses another person 's land for a long time without being challenged by the owner , the land belongs to the person " most attached to its use . "
On October 17 , 2007 , Boulder District Court Judge James C. Klein ordered the Kirlins to give 1/3 of their lot to McLean and Stevens .
Yesterday , the Colorado Supreme Court 's Attorney Regulation Counsel rejected the Kirlins ' request to conduct an ethical misconduct probe into the matter .
In addition , Stevens and McClean have asked the judge to force the Kirlin's to pay their legal fees .
Last Sunday , hundreds of people went to Stevens and McClean 's house to show their displeasure :
More than 200 people holding signs that read , " Thou shall not covet , thou shall not steal " and , " You 'll never enjoy a stolen view " gathered Sunday on Hardscrabble Drive in south Boulder to condemn Richard McLean , a former district court judge and former Boulder mayor , and his wife , Edith Stevens , for taking possession of a portion of two vacant lots that have belonged to Don and Susie Kirlin for nearly a quarter of a century .
Several protesters yelled " shame " and " thief " at McLean and Stevens as they drove away from their home shortly before the rally began at noon .
One woman stepped up to the car 's passenger side window and yelled , " How can you live with yourself ? "

Op - Chart : Making Money Hand Over Fist
An oil trader demonstrates the hand signals used on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Text and graphics by Ben Schott , a contributing columnist .
From Buffalo Springfield to CSNY to a storied solo career , Neil Young has more than made his name in the rock game .

Literally .
Bond discovered a new species of trapdoor spider last year in Alabama and set about publishing a paper about it with Norman I. Platnick , curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City .
When it came time to name his discovery , Bond reached not into the annals of science but those of music , dubbing it Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi ( teach your children how to pronounce that ) .
While it was Young ’s diverse sonic offerings that initially attracted Bond to the idea , it was the Canadian legend ’s track record on sociopolitics that clinched the deal .
" I really enjoy his music , " Bond explained in a press release , " and have had a great appreciation of him as an activist for peace and justice . "
In honor of Bond ’s discovery , take a listen to Young ’s epic tale of colonization " Cortez the Killer " below .

GAZA , ( PIC ) --
The agriculture ministry in the PA legitimate government in Gaza Strip asserted on Wednesday that the IOF troops had bulldozed vast agricultural areas in the eastern sector of the Gaza Strip which is considered the food basket of the 1.5 million Palestinians living there .
According to a report issued by the ministry and a copy of which was obtained by the PIC , the Israeli occupation army uprooted fruitful trees and destroyed greenhouses and artisan wells in Shokeh and Sofa villages , east of Khan Younis city over the past week in addition to ruining poultry farms estimated at 1.5 million dollars .
The report , furthermore , added that Palestinian farmers in Qarara and Al - Buraij areas , east of Deir Al - Balah city , weren�t able to reach and cultivate their farms for fear that the IOF troops stationed opposite to their farms could shoot and kill them " in cold blood " any time .
Palestinian farmer Ali Al - Dahdouh , 32 , was killed with IOF bullets while cultivating his farm in Juhr Al - Deik area , east of the tiny Strip , a couple of days ago .
Raising the alarm , the ministry warned that the brutal IOF practices against the Palestinian people and land were badly affecting the food basket of the Gaza Strip in addition to jeopardizing all aspects of life there .
For its part , the Authority of Environment Quality ( AEQ ) in the Gaza Strip seconded the warning of the PA agriculture ministry , warning further that cutting of trees and using them for cocking due to the severe shortage in the cocking gas as a result of the Israeli embargo would badly affect the Gaza Strip 's ecology , and would contribute to increasing the temperature there .
The Israeli occupation government had been imposing a wing - clipping comprehensive economic blockade on the populated Strip that had , so far , reaped the lives of more than 160 Palestinian patients suffering of chronic diseases but were banned by the IOA from receiving medical treatment outside the beleaguered Gaza hospitals .
In this concern , the AEQ urged the international community and all concerned organizations to immediately intervene and pressure the occupation to stop its aggression against the Gaza Strip and its people .
After his whole " screw people who are losing their homes " schtick went over badly , John McCain is trying to look like he gives a damn about those struggling Americans .
But TPM reader YA makes it clear just how much of this is pretense :
[ I ]t 's typical Republican bamboozlement .
McCain says that perhaps a few hundred thousand homeowners deserve ever so slightly more help than they 're already receiving , but that millions of others should lose their homes .
And it 's worth pointing out that most analysts agree that the number of folks who would be helped by this plan is probably much smaller than Holtz - Eakin estimates .
There 's really not much difference between his initial position and his bold new plan - they both amount to inaction .
So I 'd suggest that right after they note that " John McCain says he'd be happy to see our troops in Iraq for another hundred years , " the Democrats would do well to add , " John McCain says that millions of Americans deserve to lose their homes . "
All it 's going to take to beat this guy is telling the public where he stands .
So to be clear : McCain does n't care if people lose their homes .
A few weeks ago , he was happy to say so .
He 's since realized that appearing not to care was a mistake , and is trying to reverse that ( accurate ) perception .
But he still does n't give a damn , and his supposedly brand spankin ' new plan reflects that .
Obama and Clinton are slamming him hard on this one :
米国で著名ブロガーの死亡が相次ぎ、「デジタル時代の労働搾取」と話題になっている。ブログがメディアに匹敵する存在に成長、24時間労働を強いられているケースも多い。日本国内でも「ドクターストップ」が出た著名ブロガーもいる。今やブログ運営はハードワークなのだ。
スクープするため に 「 劣悪な24時間競争」強いられる
ブロガーが置かれた労働環境を報じるNYタイムズ
ブロガーが置かれた労働環境を報じるNYタイムズ
著名ブロガーの相次ぐ死亡を挙げて、「デジタル時代の労働搾取」と報じたのは2008年4月6日のニューヨークタイムズ。記事によれば、Russell Shaw、Marc Orchantといった著名ブロガーが心臓発作や血栓症などで相次いで死亡。公式な診断書では「ブログ」が死因とはされないものの、周囲でブロガーの劣悪な労働環境の危険性がささやかれているというのである。
同紙によれば、なかでも競争が激しいのはテクノロジーやニュースについてのブログで、企業のスキャンダルや新製品ニュースをスクープするために「劣悪な24時間競争」の只中にあるという。仕事で体重が増減したり、不規則な睡眠を強いられたり、過労で病気になったりといったブロガーの声や、テクノロジーのブログとして有名な「TechCrunch」の運営者が「神経が参ってしまって病院にいく事になりそうだ」「耐えられない」と漏らす姿も報じられている。
米 Digital Media Strategiesの織田浩一代表はJ-CASTニュースに対し、
「多くの日本のブロガーはブログで食べているというわけではないですが、米国では主たる収入源にしているブロガーが多いんです。『24時間戦えますか』の世界で、既存メディアや他のブログに対抗するためにスピード感が求められています」
と米国のブログの現状を説明する。米国ではすでにブログが通信社に匹敵する存在にまで成長している。そこで、収入を稼ぐためにブログ同士や既存メディアとの激しい競争が繰り広げられているというわけだ。
その一方で、織田代表は、ブロガーたちは仕事を楽しんでいる上、自分の業績・工夫・がんばりで収入をさらに得られることが分かっているのでがんばりも人一倍、辞めようと思えば辞められるという側面もあると指摘する。
国内では、米国並みの激しい競争が繰り広げられているわけではないが、「アジャイルメディア・ネットワーク（AMN）」がメディアとしての価値の高いブログを集めたブログネットワークを作るなど、日本でもブログの価値をメディア並みに高めようとする動きがあるという。
Tamarin 近況
公開. から一年半 .
最近はどうなってんのなかなーと Tamarin 周辺を見てみると , いろいろ変わっていた .
目玉は新しい JIT の仕組みである " Tamarin - Tracing " .
略して TT. それと , TT に付随して入った Forth によるインタプリタ実装 .
例のごとく マイコミジャーナル に ニュースがあった .
よくまとまっているけれどまとまり過ぎている.
もう少し詳しくみてみることに.
一次情報は ソースコード , Mozilla Wiki や tamarin - devel リスト などを参照ください .
アーキテクチャ概 観
これまでの Tamarin ( Tamarin Central : TC ) は , JIT の際に ABC -> MIR -> ネイティブコードと 2 段階の変換を行っていた .
TT ではこれが 1 段増え , ABC -> IL -> LIR -> ネイティブコードと変換される.
LIR は CPU の命令に近い低レベルな中間表現 .
TC の MIR に相当し , JIT エンジンの " nanojit " モジュールが これをネイティブコードに変換する .
IL は ABC と LIR の中間に位置するもう一つのバイトコード .
TT は ABC をロードするとすぐ IL に変換し , インタプリタ は IL を評価 , 実行する .
またインタプリタは実行中にプロファイルをとり , 頻繁に実行される " hotpath " の IL を LIR に変換 , nanojit に引き渡して JIT を行う.
この hotpath の識別や構造化には " Tracing Tree ( PDF ) " という アルゴリズムが使われている .
こんなかんじ :
Forth VM としての AVM
先に書いたとおり .
TT のインタプリタは ABC をコンパイルした IL を評価 , 実行する .
ABC から変換してできた IL は自己完結しておらず , ランタイムの関数を呼び出す .
面白いのは , このランタイムも IL だというところ .
ランタイムの IL は , もともと Forth で書かれている .
( vm.fs など. ) その Forth スクリプトが VM のビルド時に IL へとコンパイル ( fc.py ) され , VM の中に埋め込まれる .
VM は ABC から生成された IL とランタイムの IL をリンク ( というほど大袈裟じゃないけど ) して実行する :
IL 命令の実 装
ランタイム関数だけでなく , IL のインタプリ タ ( 評価ループ ) 自体も Forth の支援をうけて半自動生成される .
このへんはコードをみた方がわかりやすいかもしれない.
まず , ABC から IL への変換は ForthWriter クラスが行う .
( IL.cpp , IL.h ) 適当なメソッドを眺めてみよう :
void ForthWriter ::emitReturn( AbcOpcode op ) { int i = state -> sp ( ) ; ... if (! needCoerce (t , rt ) ) { // no coerce needed emit_LIT ( i ) ; if ( op == OP_returnvoid ) HELPER ( w_returnvoid ) ; else HELPER ( w_returnvalue ) ; } else { ... } emit_simple ( EXITABC ) ; emit_simple ( EXIT ) ; }
emit_simple ( ) は IL の命令を出力する .
void ForthWriter :: emit_simple ( enum _ Token t ) { verbose_only ( if ( verbose ) printf ( " +%04X %s
" , ( ip - buf ) , primnames [ t ] ) ; ) reserve ( 1 ) ; * ip++ = Token(t ) ; }
HELPER ( ) マクロはランタイム関数へジャンプする命令を出力する.
# define HELPER(x ) emit_LNEST(x##_offset , " " )
こうして生成された IL は Interpreter クラスで実行される .
( Interpreter.cpp )
void Interpreter : : inner ( Frame *f , wcodep ip , Box * sp , wcodepp rp ) { ... top_of_loop : INTERP_PRE switch ( NEXTIP ) { #ifdef AVMPLUS_MINBUILD
#include " vm_min_interp.h " #else #ifdef NJ_SOFTFLOAT #include " vm_softfp_interp.h " #else #include " vm_fpu_interp.h " #endif #endif } ... }
上の top_of_loop : と switch 文が VM の評価ループの中心 .
opcode の case がならぶはずの部分で include している vm_min_interp.h などのファイルは , Forth コンパイラによって生成されたもの .
TT では , ランタイム関数だけでなく命令セットの定義にも
Forth を利用している .
vm_min_interp.h はこんな風にマクロが並んだファイルだ:
/* machine generated - do not edit */ INTERP_SUPERCASE( readslotid_and_te ) /* begin nest for readslotid */ INTERP_CALLPRIM( uint32_t , u1_0 , IMM , ( f ) ) /* PICK2 stktop=1 */ INTERP_LET ( bool32 , b2_1 , sp [ - 1 ] .i ) /* OVER stktop=2 */ INTERP_LET( uint32_t , u3_2 , u1_0 ) INTERP_CALLPRIM( bool32 , b3_3 , NOT , ( u3_2 ) ) INTERP_CALLPRIM( int32_t , i2_4 , OR , ( b2_1 , b3_3 ) ) INTERP_CALLPRIM( bool32 , b2_5 , NOT , ( i2_4 ) ) ...
このマクロが展開されて , swtich 内の case 文にな る ( はず ) .
わかりやすそうなやつ , 分岐をあらわす BR 命令を追いかけてみよう .
まず生成されたヘッダファイルから :
INTERP_PRIMCASE ( BR ) INTERP_CALLPRIM_VOID( BR , ( ip ) ) INTERP_NEXT ( BR )
関係するマクロの定義はこう :
# define INTERP_PRIMCASE(x ) case x : label_##x : { TIMING_START ( t_interp ) # define INTERP_CALLPRIM_VOID( x , args ) INTERP_CALLFUNCBYNAME_VOID( prim_##x , args ) # define INTERP_CALLFUNCBYNAME_VOID( _funcname, _args ) _funcname _args ; # define INTERP_NEXT(x ) TIMING_END ( t_interp ) } goto top_of_loop ;
展開するとだいたいこんなかんじ :
case BR : label_BR : { prim_BR ( ip ) ; } goto top_of_loop ;
ようやく VM ぽくなってきた. prim_BR ( ) はこんなの :
// unconditional jump , 1 byte signed offset PRIM ( void , BR ) ( wcodep& ip ) { ip = ip + *( ( int8 _t * ) ip ) ; }
たしかにジャンプしてます .
ついでに上の BR の生成がどんな Forth コードに由来しているかも見ておこう . ( prim.fs )
{ BR (( IP -- ) ) }
これだけか .
シンプル , というか宣言的 .
二重のカッコは Forth の関数型宣言に相当する .
上の例だとスタックから要素を一つ pop し , 何も戻さないという意味になる .
型宣言からネイティブの関数呼び出しのコードを生成するあたりは , RPC の IDL や SWIG のノリだね .
スタブらしさを見るために , もう少しややこしい CHOOSE 命令を見てみよう .
C++:
PRIM ( int32_t , CHOOSE ) ( const int32_t a , const int32_t b , const bool32 cond ) { return cond ?
a : b ; }
Forth :
{ CHOOSE ( ( i2 i1 b -- i=b?i2:i1 ) ) }
スタブ :
INTERP_PRIMCASE( CHOOSE ) INTERP_CALLPRIM( int32_t , i_2_0 , CHOOSE , ( sp [ - 2 ] .i , sp [ - 1 ] .i , sp [ 0 ] .i ) ) INTERP_COPY ( sp [ - 2 ] .i , i_2_0 ) INTERP_INVALBOXTYPE(sp [ - 2 ] ) INTERP_ADJUSTSP(
-2 ) INTERP_NEXT( CHOOSE )
それっぽいでしょ .
superword
このように , IL の各命令は基本的 に C++ で実装される .
ただし一部の命令 ( superword ) は Forth で記述されている .
例として isobject 命令を見てみよう .
まず Forth 側から . " SUPER : " という特別なコンパイルモードで関数/word を定義する. ( vm.fs )
SUPER : isobject (( x -- x b ) ) peekrawboxtype BoxedObj = ;
vm_min_interp.h 内ではこうコンパイルされる .
INTERP_SUPERCASE( isobject ) /* DUP stktop=0 */ INTERP_LET ( Box , x1_0 , sp [ 0 ] ) INTERP_CALLPRIM( int32_t , i1_1 , RAWBOXTYPE , ( x1_0 ) ) INTERP_LET ( int32_t , i2_2 , int8_t(uint8_t(BoxedObj ) ) ) INTERP_CALLPRIM( bool32 , b1_3 , CMPEQ , ( i1_1 , i2_2 ) ) INTERP_COPY( sp [ 1 ] .i , b1_3 ) INTERP_INVALBOXTYPE(sp[ 1 ] ) INTERP_ADJUSTSP(1 ) INTERP_NEXT( isobject )
INTERP_SUPERCASE は INTERP_PRIMCASE
と同様に case : に展開される .
# define INTERP_SUPERCASE(x ) case x : { TIMING_START ( t_interp )
superword はインタプリタを高速化するための仕組みだろうと想像できる.
IL は ABC より粒度が細かいから , 素朴に解釈したらいかにも遅くなりそうだよね .
( そもそもなん で IL にするの , という話はまたあとで ... )
ランタイムのコンパイルと呼び出し
superword はインタプリタの評価ループに展開されたが , 多くのランタイム関数は IL へとコンパイルされる . 先に示した HELPER ( ) マクロから呼ばれている w_returnvoid 関数を見てみよう .
( vm.fs )
EXTERN : w_returnvoid ( i -- ) > R undefined R > w_returnvalue ;
この関数は IL にコンパイルされる .
コンパイルされた IL は整数の配列として C++ のコード ( vm_min.cpp ) に埋め込まれる .
/* machine generated - do not edit */ extern const uint8_t code_pool [ ] = { ... // w_returnvoid offset=7960 RPUSH , LIT8 , 0 , LIT8 , uint8_t ( BoxedVoid ) , SETRAWBOXTYPE , RPOP , JUMP , /* w_returnvalue - 3086 */ 242 , 243 , ... } ;
命令配列内の offset 位置は vm_min.h に出力される .
/* machine generated - do not edit */ ... extern_entry ( w_returnvoid , 7960 ) ...
ForthWriter はこのオフセットを使って IL を生成し , インタプリタはそれを解釈してコードを呼び出す .
PRIM ( void , LNEST ) ( wcodep& ip , wcodepp& rp ) { // 2 byte unsigned offset * rp++ = ip +2 ; ip = code_pool + uint16_t( readUnalignedInt16 ( ip ) ) ; }
こうして ABC を変換した IL からランタイムの IL を呼び出すことができた .
めでたしめでたし .
" EXTERN : " は TT Forth の拡張で , 定義した関数 の IL を指すオフセットが定数として公開される .
通常の関数定義 " : " は定数を公開しない .
TT Forth では " EXTERN : " や " SUPER : " の他にもいくつかの拡張を持っており , VM の実装を宣言的に支えている .
そのへんは面白い .
なぜ IL を使うのか ？
インタプリタの性能を考えると , IL は冗長に思える .
ABC を直接実行した方が間接化のコストもなく高速になるだろう.
おそらく IL は JIT の都合で導入された .
JIT したコードからランタイム の C/C++ 関数を呼び出すとオーバーヘッドがある.
ランタイムが呼出側と同じ IL になっていれば , JIT のインライン化によってそのオーバーヘッドをなくすことができる .
IL ではなく ABC の拡張やサブセットでランタイムを記述することもできたはずだけれど , ABC のようなオブジェクト指向で抽象度の高い命令セットは VM の下回りを支えるのに向かないのかもしれない .
ActionScript を使って ActionScript のメソッドティスパッチのコードを書くのは , さすがにもどかしそうだよね .
その点 Forth / IL は原始的なぶん低レベルな操作を書きやすそうな気はする .
( 読みにくいけど ... )
まとめ
というわけで Tamarin Tracing のインタプリタを眺めてみました .
まとめ :
ABC は ABC -> IL -> LIR -> native と変換され る
ABC から生成された IL はランタイムの関数を呼びだす .
そのランタイムも IL .
ランタイムの IL は Forth をコンパイルしてつく る
Forth コンパイラは IL インタプリタの評価ループと各 IL 命令の C++ 実装をつなぐ glue にも使われる Forth で実装された命令 ( superword ) もある
IL を挟んだのは JIT 高速化の恩恵をうけるた め( であろう ) .
ほんとは Tracing
Tree の話も書くつもりだったけど , 長くなってしまった .
続きはまたそのうち .
One had assumed that Morse code 's last hurrah ( that 's ···· ··- ·-· ... oh , life 's just too short ) had been in about 1944 .
But one had assumed wrong .
The writer Alan Sillitoe , who trained as a wireless operator in the second world war , this week revealed that he still practises taking Morse every day , listening to chatter across the airwaves , including a French station that broadcasts poetry in Morse .
So how much Morse , in iambic pentameters or otherwise , is out there ?
" Radio amateurs are still using Morse code worldwide , " says Carlos Eavis , amateur radio manager at the Radio Society of Great Britain .
" It 's something that every radio amateur needs to learn . "
Eavis points to several advantages Morse , which has been around since the 1840s , has over its modern rivals .
There is no language barrier - the dots and dashes are the Esperanto of the airwaves ; you do n't need an expensive computer , so the four - fifths of the world that does n't have internet access can still communicate ; the simplicity of the signal means it can be easily picked up , even when reception is poor ; and only the most rudimentary transmitter is needed to send messages .
Morse can't compete with computer - based systems in sending long messages - though tests have proved it is faster than text messaging on mobile phones - and most military services have abandoned it .
But the SAS is still believed to teach Morse , in case its soldiers need to rig up a simple transmitter in a remote location and send a distress call .
It also comes in useful in prisons , where prisoners can tap out messages to each other on pipes .
" Morse will continue to be used , " says Eavis , " because of its simplicity .
You do n't need anything hi-tech - it will just work . "
Samuel Morse 's name will live on , which , says Eavis , is unfair on Alfred Vail , who actually invented the code .
Morse just financed it .
Dash it !

普通 にRuby on RailsをCGI（dispatch.cgi）で動かすと遅すぎてやってられませんが、gateway.cgiを使うと、そこそこの速度で動くようになります。
最初に仕掛けを紹介してしまうと、1回目のアクセスがあったときに常駐プロセスを起動し、2回目以降のアクセスはその常駐プロセスに処理させるようになっています。CGI自体は常駐プロセスに処理を投げるだけなので軽い、というわけです。ただし、１回目のアクセスは通常通りCGIで動作させたくらいの遅さです。
常駐プロセスは一定時間アクセスがないと自動的に終了するので（次のアクセスがあったときにまた起動する）、いろいろ制限のある環境でも使える、かもしれません。
さて、そのgateway.cgiですが、Railsの標準パッケージの中に含まれています。まだexperimentalらしいですが、多少パッチを当てると動きます。

With Antoin “ Tony ” Rezko ’s federal corruption trial looming , Gov. Rod Blagojevich on Tuesday tried to deflect the heat he ’s been getting over his former adviser and top fundraiser by pointing out he ’s not the only politician who has received help from Rezko .
Blagojevich ticked off a list of elected officials who also have ties to the indicted developer .
While not naming them , he made reference to everyone from Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama to House Speaker Michael Madigan , his political nemesis , and Madigan ’s daughter , Atty .
Gen. Lisa Madigan .
When asked if he regretted his relationship with Rezko , the governor said he was not alone in facing “ some of the occupational hazards that go along with being in politics . ”
“ We presume and hope that people who are helping us are doing things honestly and forthrightly , and then sometimes there are allegations to suggest that maybe not , ” he said Tuesday following a news conference in downtown Chicago .
“ And then you deal with all the incoming that comes along with it , whether you ’re a governor of a state like Illinois , or a presidential candidate , or an attorney general , or a lieutenant governor , or a speaker of the House or even Republicans who ’ve also been the beneficiaries of some of Mr. Rezko ’s help . ”
Rezko has had ties to each of those politicians in some fashion over the years , from a once - close relationship with Obama , a first - term U.S. senator , to co-hosting a $ 3.8 million Chicago fundraiser in 2003 for President Bush .
Lt. Gov. Patrick Quinn also received contributions from Rezko ’s former development company .
Blagojevich twice made reference to Obama , whose ties to Rezko have become highlighted in the national coverage of his bid for the presidency .
On Monday , Blagojevich was the lone statewide elected official left out of a news conference showcasing Obama ’s widespread backing among Illinois Democrats .
“ This gentleman that you ’re talking about is now a national figure , ” Blagojevich said of Rezko .
“ He ’s someone who ’s been involved with helping people in politics for a long time . ”
But the connections between Rezko and the governor have run deep since Blagojevich first ran for the office .
Not only did he raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Blagojevich ’s first campaign run , he also played an early role in recommending his associates for top administration positions and acting as a political sounding board for the governor .
There was , beneath this , a darkness to many of his works , notwithstanding their irreverence .
“ Bed ” ( 1955 ) was gothic .
The all - black paintings were solemn and shuttered .
The red paintings looked charred , with strips of fabric akin to bandages , from which paint dripped like blood .
“ Interview ” ( 1955 ) , which resembled a cabinet or closet with a door , enclosing photos of bullfighters , a pinup , a Michelangelo nude , a fork and a softball , suggested some black - humored encoded erotic message .
There were many other images of downtrodden and lonely people , rapt in thought ; pictures of ancient frescoes , out of focus as if half remembered ; photographs of forlorn , neglected sites ; bits and pieces of faraway places conveying a kind of nostalgia or remoteness .
In bringing these things together , the art implied consolation .
Mr. Rauschenberg , who knew that not everybody found it easy to grasp the open - endedness of his work , once described to the writer Calvin Tomkins an encounter with a woman who had reacted skeptically to “ Monogram ” ( 1955 - 59 ) and “ Bed ” in his 1963 retrospective at the Jewish Museum , one of the events that secured Mr. Rauschenberg ’s reputation : “ To her , all my decisions seemed absolutely arbitrary  as though I could just as well have selected anything at all  and therefore there was no meaning , and that made it ugly .
“ So I told her that if I were to describe the way she was dressed , it might sound very much like what she ’d been saying .
For instance , she had feathers on her head .
And she had this enamel brooch with a picture of ‘ The Blue Boy ’ on it pinned to her breast .
And around her neck she had on what she would call mink but what could also be described as the skin of a dead animal .
Well , at first she was a little offended by this , I think , but then later she came back and said she was beginning to understand . ”
Growing Up With Scraps
Milton Ernest Rauschenberg was born on Oct. 22 , 1925 , in Port Arthur , Tex. , a small refinery town where “ it was very easy to grow up without ever seeing a painting , ” he said .
( In adulthood he renamed himself Robert . )
His grandfather , a doctor who emigrated from Germany , had settled in Texas and married a Cherokee .
His father , Ernest , worked for a local utility company .
The family lived so frugally that his mother , Dora , made him shirts out of scraps of fabric .
Once she made herself a skirt out of the back of the suit that her younger brother was buried in .
She did n’t want the material to go to waste .
For his high school graduation present , Mr. Rauschenberg wanted a ready - made shirt , his first .
All this shaped his art eventually .
A decade or so later he made history with his own assemblages of scraps and ready - mades : sculptures and music boxes made of packing crates , rocks and rope ; and paintings like “ Yoicks , ” sewn from fabric strips .
He loved making something out of nothing .
Our Sounds
First Sounds has been in the forefront of finding and playing back the world 's earliest audio recordings since 2007 .
When we began , the earliest sound anyone could hear was from 1888 .
In 2008 we pushed that date back 28 years , to 1860 .
Since then we have delved even further into the past .
The first recordings of airborne sounds were traced onto lamp blacked paper ; they were made to be viewed , not played .
David Giovannoni , Earl Cornell , and Patrick Feaster pioneered the methods to make them audible .
Other recordings were inscribed by light onto photographic media or preserved via printing press ; Patrick Feaster has been deeply involved in their study .
Extracting sound from soot is no trivial pursuit , and our approaches continue to evolve as our knowledge increases and new technologies become available .
To date we have concentrated on three inventors or centers of invention .
Hearing the sounds they recorded helps us more accurately interpret their intentions :
Édouard - Léon Scott de Martinville .
The inventor of sound recording made the world 's first recordings of airborne sounds in Paris between 1853 / 4 and 1860 on a machine he called a phonautograph .
Thomas Edison , Charles Batchelor , and the Metropolitan Elevated Railroad .
In the summer of 1878 the inventor of the phonograph and his assistant recorded noises emanating from Manhattan 's newest conveyance .
The Volta Laboratory Associates .
Funded by Alexander Graham Bell and directed by Charles Sumner Tainter , this research and development concern conducted sound recording and playback experiments in Washington DC in the 1880s .
We have also had fun with other early recordings .

The case of the missing e-mail
A federal magistrate judge on Thursday chastised the Bush administration for failing to fully answer questions related to a long - running dispute over missing White House emails .
The White House is facing lawsuits from two public interest groups , Citizens for Responsibilty and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive at George Washington University , demanding that the White House restore the missing e-mails and put in place systems to prevent further e-mail losses .
Administration officials were ordered to provide detailed information about the burdens involved in taking immediate actions to preserve copies of hard drive , tapes , and other media that may contain copies of the missing e-mails .
The ongoing dispute spotlights a part of the executive branch that does n't often get much attention : its e-mail system .
Two laws govern the retention of executive branch documents .
The Federal Record
Act requires the head of each federal agency to ensure that documents related to that agency 's official business be preserved for federal archives .
The Watergate - era Presidential Records
Act augmented the FRA framework by specifically requiring the president to preserve documents related to the performance of his official duties .
A 1993 court decision held that these laws applied to electronic records , including e-mails , which means that the president has an obligation to ensure that the e-mails of senior executive branch officials are preserved .
In 1994 , the Clinton administration reacted to the previous year 's court decision by rolling out an automated e-mail - archiving system to work with the Lotus - Notes - based e-mail software that was in use at the time .
The system automatically categorized e-mails based on the requirements of the FRA and PRA , and it included safeguards to ensure that e-mails were not deliberately or unintentionally altered or deleted .
The Bush White House " upgrades " the e-mail system
When the Bush administration took office , it decided to replace the Lotus Notes - based e-mail system used under the Clinton Administration with Microsoft Outlook and Exchange .
The transition broke compatibility with the old archiving system , and the White House IT shop did not immediately have a new one to put in its place .
Instead , the White House has instituted a comically primitive system called " journaling , " in which ( to quote from a recent Congressional report ) " a White House staffer or contractor would collect from a ' journal ' e-mail folder in the Microsoft Exchange system copies of e-mails sent and received by White House employees . "
These would be manually named and saved as " .pst " files on White House servers .
One of the more vocal critics of the White House 's e-mail - retention policies is Steven McDevitt , who was a senior official in the White House IT shop from September 2002 until he left in disgust in October 2006 .
He points out what would be obvious to anyone with IT experience : the system was n't especially reliable or tamper - proof .
From this ...
In detailed testimony to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , he detailed the " journaling " system 's flaws .
Because the archiving process was conducted manually and in an ad hoc fashion , human error could easily lead to the inadvertent omission of e-mails that are required to be preserved under federal law .
Files were " scattered across various servers " on the network of the Executive Office of the President , and there " was no consistently applied naming convention " for the files .
It 's hardly surprising that things tended to get lost .
Even more troubling , due to a lack of redundancy and proper access controls , anyone with access to the White House servers could have tampered with or deleted the e-mails in the archives .
And without adequate logging facilities , there might be no way to determine who might have tampered with the files or what might have been changed .
... to this
These deficiencies were repeatedly brought to the attention of White House systems administrators .
In 2002 and 2003 , they attempted to retrofit the old , Lotus Notes - based archiving system to work with the new Exchange - based e-mail system .
When this effort failed , they awarded a contract to Booz Allen Hamilton to design a new system and to Unisys to implement it .
According to McDevitt , the new system was set up and configured during 2005 and was " ready to go live " in August 2006 .
But the White House CIO , Theresa Payton , reportedly aborted the project in late 2006 , citing perceived inadequacies with the system 's performance and its ability segregate official presidential correspondence from political or personal materials .
McDervitt resigned in protest soon afterwards .
Payton claims that the White House is working on yet another archiving system .
But until it 's completed — and it's now looking increasingly unlikely that it will be operational before the end of the administration — the White House will lack an automated system for complying with the requirements of federal law .

Khaled Meshaal said Hamas was prepared to offer a 10 - year truce Palestinian militant group Hamas will not recognise Israel , its political leader Khaled Meshaal has insisted .
He was responding to comments by former US President Jimmy Carter , following their talks in Syria at the weekend .
Mr Meshaal said Hamas agreed to a Palestinian state on the land in east Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza that Israel captured in the 1967 war .
Mr Carter had said Hamas was prepared to accept the right of Israel to " live as a neighbour next door in peace " .
Actions speak louder than words
White House spokeswoman Speaking in Syria , where he lives in exile , Khaled Meshaal said the Palestinian state must have " Jerusalem as its capital , with genuine sovereignty , without settlements " .
He added that this did not mean recognising Israel , but he said : " We have offered a truce if Israel withdraws to the 1967 borders , a truce of 10 years as an alternative to recognition . "
The United States said Mr Meshaal 's comments did not amount to a change of position by Hamas .
In any case , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said , " actions speak louder than words " .
Many Israelis and their allies do not believe Hamas ' offer of a truce , says the BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen .
They cite the Hamas charter , which calls for the destruction of Israel and the creation of an Islamic state in Israel , the West Bank and Gaza .
' Involve Hamas ' Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert refused to see Mr Carter , as he ended his regional visit in Jerusalem .

In a speech in the city , Mr Carter said Israeli - Palestinian peacemaking had " regressed " since the US hosted Middle East talks in November at Annapolis .
He defended his talks with Mr Meshaal in Damascus .
" The problem is that Israel and the United States refuse to meet with someone who must be involved , " he told the Israel Council on Foreign Relations .
Israel , the US and the European Union regard Hamas , which controls the Gaza Strip , as a terrorist organisation .
Asked how progress could be made given Israeli views of Hamas , Mr Carter said in an interview with the BBC's Newsnight that the Palestinian Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) had been classified as a terrorist organisation before becoming a negotiator for peace .
" I think that there is always a chance to change the characterisation of dissident or rebel groups and my hope is that this brief encounter with them will lead to that conclusion , " he said .
Captured soldier Mr Carter also said the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit , captured by Hamas and other militant groups during a raid into Israel two years ago , was being held up by the lack of direct communication between Israel and Hamas .
Mr Carter said the difficulty was in agreeing the identity of the Palestinian prisoners to be released in return .
He said Egyptian officials had told him that Israel had agreed to release 1,000 prisoners but accepted only 71 names on a list of hundreds of prisoners submitted by Hamas .
Khaled Meshaal told reporters on Monday that Hamas had agreed to pass a message from Corp Shalit to his family .
Meanwhile , the Israeli army has launched a formal investigation into the death of a Reuters cameraman killed in the Gaza Strip last week .
And two Palestinians died in Israeli air strikes in the territory on Monday : one person in the southern city of Rafah and a Hamas militant at Beit Hanoun , a border town from where rockets are often fired at Israel .

Barack Obama picked up another superdelegate today as New Mexico Democratic Party Chairman Brian Colon endorsed him .
“ As I talk to Democrats all over New Mexico they are increasingly concerned with the negative tone that the campaign has taken .
I believe that Senator Obama has presented a positive message of change while continuing to focus on our real opponent ; a John McCain presidency and another four year term of failed Bush policies , ” Colon said .
Colon mentioned how Obama has run a different kind of campaign , Barack Obama has run a different kind of campaign – one that goes beyond the things that divide us and is driven by a commitment to real change that starts at the grassroots level .
Here in New Mexico , where we had a very close election on February 5th , the excitement I saw throughout the state is good for our Party and good for our State .
While there are two very talented candidates in this race , I am proud to make this announcement today because I want to see Barack Obama ’s positive movement for change continue to transform the Democratic Party and this country . ”

The country seems desperate to turn the page and move on from the post - 9/11 gloom and doom politics of the Bush administration .
I believe that people want to feel good about their nation and their government again .
They want to believe in their president , and Barack Obama projects himself as a person that can be believed in .
This is the biggest difference between himself and Sen. Clinton .
Too many Democrats feel that they ca n’t trust her .
She has a track record which suggests that she should n’t be trusted , but perhaps the biggest failing of her campaign is its failure to inspire hope and optimism in Democratic voters .
The election of Barack Obama would allow Americans the ability to start fresh and put the last 8 years behind us .
I think that is not only what a majority of voters want , but also what they need .
Obama is now 277 delegates away from clinching the nomination .

‘ Truthiness , ’ according to fount - of - all - important - wisdom and television host Stephen Colbert , represents the human preference to follow our intuition despite the presence of actual facts or evidence - and the more ambiguous an answer to a question , the more likely an individual will believe it is truthful .
Psychologists Rick Dale of the University of Memphis , Michael Spivey of Cornell University and the late Chris McKinstry affirmed this when they asked college students questions that ranged in levels of vagueness and tracked their corresponding arm movements to clicking ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ on a computer screen .
Specifically , questions such as “ is murder sometimes justifiable ? ” are considered ambiguous and could cause the sensation of being ‘ pulled ’ in both directions at once ; however , questions like “ can a kangaroo walk backwards ? ” have a high probability of ‘ no ’ responding .
The results of participants ’ cursor movements suggested that the human brain thinks and acts at the same time , in contrast to what many researchers previously assumed :
That the decision - making process was completed by the cognitive subsystem , or the brain ’s thought center , before it was shared with other parts of the brain .
“ These dynamic data showed that participant arm movements had lower velocity and curved more toward the alternative response box during ‘ no ’ responses than during ‘ yes ’ responses — suggesting that we experience a general bias toward assuming statements are true , ” the authors explained .
The findings suggest that the mind and body do in fact work together and the resulting collaboration may prompt us to lean toward ‘ truthiness . ’

Has America lost its freedom of the press ?
There seems to be no other explanation for the otherwise incomprehensible failure of the American media to report on vast array of evidence pointing to the events of 911 as being part of a U.S. government conspiracy .
People are being murdered , newspaper and TV archives are being sanitized and government announcements are being retroactively rewritten .
A growing group of academics , government officials , military veterans and other concerned citizens are fighting back using the internet and other non-traditional media .
These people include a former German Defense Minister , a former member of the Bush Cabinet , authors like Gore Vidal and Hunter S. Thomson ( who died recently under suspicious circumstances ) , prominent academics and many others .
They have succeeded to the point where 63 % of Canadians and 50 % of New Yorkers now believe the U.S. government was complicit in the 911 attacks .
Come see the evidence for yourself .
All you need to do is to bring is a mind that is 80 % shut and 20 % open .

How much are speculators adding to food and fuel inflation ?
A lot , says one trader .
One of the most interesting pieces of testimony I have read in a long time came today from Michael Masters , Managing Member of Masters Capital Management .
He was in front of the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs of the U.S. Senate .
Mr. Masters has been a long - short equity hedge fund manager for over 12 years .
Here 's what he had to say :
1 ) Commodity prices have increased more in the aggregate over the past five years than at any other time in U.S. history ; specifically assets allocated to commodity index trading strategies have risen from $ 13 billion at the end of 2003 to $ 260 billion as of March 2008 ;
2 ) The primary increase in demand for commodities has come from Institutional Investors , specifically pension funds , sovereign wealth funds , university endowments , and others , whom Master collectively calls Index Speculators .
This group now accounts for a larger share of outstanding commodities futures contracts than any other market participant .
3 ) These Speculators allocate a portion of their portfolios directly to the commodities futures market , and behave differently than traditional speculators ; specifically , they buy with little regard for price and tend to be mostly buyers , not sellers .
4 ) While much of the rise in the price of oil has been attributed to increased demand from China , speculators are responsible for at least an equal increase in demand ; specifically , annual Chinese demand for oil has increased by 920 million barrels over the last five years but Index Speculators demand for petroleum futures has increased by 848 million barrels
5 ) While the rise in corn if often blamed on ethanol production , Speculators have stockpiled over 2 billion bushels of corn futures in the last five years , enough to fuel the entire U.S. ethanol industry for a full year .
Masters concludes with this analogy : " Think about it this way :
If Wall Street concocted a scheme whereby investors bought large amounts of pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices in order to profit from the resulting increase in prices , making these essential items unaffordable to sick and dying people , society would be justly outraged . "
Masters urges Congress to 1 ) prevent pension funds from investing in commodities , and 2 ) close loopholes that allow banks to get around limits on speculative positions .
Mr. Masters assumes , as many do , that supply is adequate -- which is debatable , particularly from oil ( the world produces 85 million barrels a day and seems to be having a tough time increasing supply ) .
And we certainly know that demand has been increasing from consumers , not just from institutional investors .
So his argument is certainly far from flawless .
But Masters is one of the first to put real numbers behind the idea that speculation is a major force in commodity price increases .
Here is the full testimony .

David Beckham May Have The Largest Carbon Footprint In Human History
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Last year about this time , the Beckhams were named the most environmentally unfriendly couple .
Now , David alone has a new honor to add to his resume :
Largest Carbon Footprint In Human History !
For those playing along at home , you should imagine your best ‘ God ’ voice when saying that .
Trust me .
According to Carbon Trust , Beckham ’s extensive air travel for matches and endorsement obligations , along with his fleet of cars and homes have all added up to record numbers .
From the article ,
“ The former England captain logged over 250,000 miles last year as he flew back and forth between the U.S. and Europe for England ’s European Championship qualifiers , while also participating in a Galaxy tour of Oceania in the latter part of the year .
Beckham and his wife Victoria also collected over 50,000 frequent flyer miles for advertising obligations around the globe .
At home , Beckham owns a fleet of 15 cars , including a Porsche , a Hummer and a Lincoln Navigator . ”
This all adds up to about 163 tons of carbon dioxide yearly .
To put that in perspective , the average Englishman contributes about 9.4 tons .
The average American generates about 7.8 tons .
Said a Carbon
Trust spokesperson , “ With all his money he should be using it at least to reduce his own footprint .
He has more freedom of choice when it comes to methods of traveling .
He could also choose greener cars . ”
Or how about just f–king sit still ?!
Damn — we should tie this guy down lilliputian - style and do the world a favor .
Let ’s hope we ’re not writing about any new records this time next year .
Who knew talented feet could have such massive footprints ?

The halves of “ Che ” are mirror images .
The first , though it flashes back to Guevara ’s early acquaintance with Mr. Castro in Mexico and forward to his visit to New York for an appearance at the United Nations in 1964 , is essentially the chronicle of a successful insurgency .
It follows Mr. Castro , Guevara and their comrades from 1956 to 1959 , through the stages of their war to overthrow the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista , and it dwells less on their motives and personalities than on matters of military procedure .
With impressive coherence and attention to tactical detail , Mr. Soderbergh shows how Mr. Castro ’s initially tiny army fought its way down from the mountains of the Sierra Maestra and ultimately routed Batista ’s forces .
The second half , devoted to the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia in 1967 that ended in Guevara ’s death , is equally rigorous in its depiction of a failed revolt .
Though Guevara tried , in a new context , to apply the strategic lessons of the Cuban revolution  concentrate on the countryside ; cultivate popular support ; maintain discipline and cohesion in the ranks  everything went wrong .
And it turned out that Guevara ’s adversaries , the Bolivian army and its American advisers , had learned a thing or two about how to wage an effective counterinsurgency .
There is a lot , however , that the audience will not learn from this big movie , which has some big problems as well as major virtues .
In between the two periods covered in “ Che , ” Guevara was an important player in the Castro government , but his brutal role in turning a revolutionary movement into a dictatorship goes virtually unmentioned .
This , along with Benicio Del Toro ’s soulful and charismatic performance , allows Mr. Soderbergh to preserve the romantic notion of Guevara as a martyr and an iconic figure , an idealistic champion of the poor and oppressed .
By now , though , this image seems at best naïve and incomplete , at worst sentimental and dishonest .
More to the point , perhaps , it is not very interesting .
But “ Che ” itself is interesting , partly because it has the power to provoke some serious argument  about its own tactics and methods , as well as those of its subject .
Whether American audiences will have a chance to participate in that argument is , for the moment , an open question .
The mood here among buyers has been extremely cautious , and as of this writing , distributors have balked at spending $ 8 million to $ 10 million ( the reported asking price for “ Che ” ) on a 258 - minute movie to be released in two parts , with subtitles .

This is one of the frustrations of Cannes , for American critics at least .
We see lots of fascinating movies  not all good , but very few completely worthless  and then wonder if we , or our readers , will ever see them again .
I ’m not in the movie business ( a mutually beneficial arrangement , believe me ) , and not inclined to speculate with someone else ’s money .
I do hope , however , that sometime in the near future I can take part in the long and contentious conversation that “ Che ” deserves , and also see how my own initial ambivalence about the film resolves itself .
Did you know that with more than 1 million species , insects are the most diverse group of animals on Earth ?
No matter if they are living in large well - organized colonies or alone , insects are not welcome into our world because they do n’t seem to match our morals , habits and most of the time , psychology .
The fact that most of the times they are scary , is not a secret either .
For all these reasons and probably more others , here are our picks for 5 giant insects in the whole world .
A native from Borneo , Phobaeticus kirbyi is in terms of body length , the longest insect in the world .
It ’s a stick - insect and the female is rumored to be over 14 - inches long and as thin as a rail .
The stick insects are one of the most popular insects kept as pets .

The Goliath beetles , also known as Megasoma elephas ( elephant beetle ) , Goliathus goliatus , and Goliathus regius have the greatest visible body mass of all insects in the world .
They are part of the scarab beetle family and are found in Africa ’s tropical forests or Central America ( elephant beetle ) where they feed with tree sap and fruits .
Talking about “ diet ” and compared to it ’s body , a Megasoma in captivity was able to eat a whole avocado fruit in just one day .
When an adult Goliath beetle flies it makes a sound similar to a toy helicopter running .

Titanus giganteus ( Titan beetle ) is an extremely rare South American Longhorn Beetle and the largest known in the Amazon rainforest .
One of the most interesting facts about these insects is that males do not eat , but fly around to mate or to find those bright lights they ’re so attracted of .
The Titan beetle is also famous for its incredible mandibles , capable of snapping small pieces of wood and even flesh .
With its antennae extended the biggest specimen was reported to be 9 - inch long .

Deinacrida heteracantha also known as the Little Barrier Island giant weta is an endangered species in New Zealand .
During the day it stays hidden in different holes and only gets out at night to feed with seeds and leafs .
Though it has no wings , a pregnant giant weta have been weighed in at a record 71 grams .
It is the heaviest insect in the world .

Considered one of the largest of all beetles , Megasoma acteon also known as the Acteon Beetle , is a South American rhinoceros beetle .
The males can grow up to 3.5 - inch long , 2 - inch wide and 1.5 - inch thick making it one of the bulkiest of the abundant order of beetles .

Anyone else with entomophobia ( fear of insects ) now that you ’ve seen these large insects ?
Clarification : Somebody pointed out that , when people come here from a web search , they wo n’t realize that it ’s an April Fool ’s joke .
See here for my article in Bayesian analysis that expands on the blog entry below , along with discussion by four statisticians and a rejoinder by myself that responds to the criticisms that I raised .
Below is the original blog entry .
Bayesian inference is a coherent mathematical theory but I would n’t trust it in scientific applications .
Subjective prior distributions do n’t inspire confidence , and there ’s no good objective principle for choosing a noninformative prior ( even if that concept were mathematically defined , which it ’s not ) .
Where do prior distributions come from , anyway ?
I do n’t trust them and I see no reason to recommend that other people do , just so that I can have the warm feeling of philosophical coherence .
Bayesian theory requires a great deal of thought about the given situation to apply sensibly , and recommending that scientists use Bayes ’ theorem is like giving the neighborhood kids the key to your F - 16 .
I ’d rather start with tried and true methods , and then generalizing using something I can trust , like statistical theory and minimax principles , that do n’t depend on your subjective beliefs .
Especially when the priors I see in practice are typically just convenient conjugate forms .
What a coincidence that , of all the infinite variety of priors that could be chosen , it always seems like the normal , gamma , beta , etc. , that turn out to be the right choice ?
To restate these concerns mathematically : I like unbiased estimates and I like confidence intervals that really have their advertised confidence coverage .
I know that these are n’t always going to be possible , but I think the right way forward is to get as close to these goals as possible and to develop robust methods that work with minimal assumptions .
The Bayesian approach–to give up even trying to approximate unbiasedness and to instead rely on stronger and stronger assumptions –that seems like the wrong way to go .
In the old days , Bayesian methods at least had the virtue of being mathematically clean .
Nowadays , they all seem to be computed using Markov chain Monte Carlo , which means that , not only can you not realistically evaluate the statistical properties of the method , you ca n’t even be sure it ’s converged , just adding one more item to the list of unverifiable assumptions .
People tend to believe results that support their preconceptions and disbelieve results that surprise them .
Bayesian methods encourage this undisciplined mode of thinking .
I ’m sure that many individual Bayesian statisticians and are acting in good faith , but they ’re providing encouragement to sloppy and unethical scientists everywhere .
And , probably worse , Bayesian techniques motivate even the best - intentioned researchers to get stuck in the rut of prior beliefs .
Bayesianism assumes : ( a) Either a weak or uniform prior , in which case why bother ? , ( b ) Or a strong prior , in which case why collect new data ? , ( c ) Or more realistically , something in between , in which case Bayesianism always seems to duck the issue .
Nowadays people use a lot of empirical Bayes methods .
I applaud the Bayesians ’ newfound commitment to empiricism but am skeptical of this particular approach , which always seems to rely on an assumption of “ exchangeability . ”
I do a lot of work in political science , where people are embracing Bayesian statistics as the latest methodological fad .
Well , let me tell you something .
The 50 states are n’t exchangeable .
I ’ve lived in a few of them and visited nearly all the others , and calling them exchangeable is just silly .
Calling it a hierarchical or a multilevel model does n’t change things–it ’s an additional level of modeling that I ’d rather not do .
Call me old - fashioned , but I ’d rather let the data speak without applying a probability distribution to something like the 50 states which are neither random nor a sample .
Also , do n’t these empirical Bayes methods use the data twice ?
If you ’re going to be Bayesian , then be Bayesian : it seems like a cop-out and contradictory to the Bayesian philosophy to estimate the prior from the data .
If you want to do hierarchical modeling , I prefer a method such as generalized estimating equations that makes minimal assumptions .
And do n’t even get me started on what Bayesians say about data collection .
The mathematics of Bayesian decision theory lead inexorably to the idea that random sampling and random treatment allocation are inefficient , that the best designs are deterministic .
I have no quarrel with the mathematics here –the mistake lies deeper in the philosophical foundations , the idea that the goal of statistics is to make an optimal decision .
A Bayes estimator is a statistical estimator that minimizes the average risk , but when we do statistics , we ’re not trying to “ minimize the average risk , ” we ’re trying to do estimation and hypothesis testing .
If the Bayesian philosophy of axiomatic reasoning implies that we should n’t be doing random sampling , then that ’s a strike against the theory right there .
Bayesians also believe in the irrelevance of stopping times –that , if you stop an experiment based on the data , it does n’t change your inference .
Unfortunately for the Bayesian theory , the p-value _does_ change when you alter the stopping rule , and no amount of philosophical reasoning will get you around that point .
I ca n’t keep track of what all those Bayesians are doing nowadays –unfortunately , all sorts of people are being seduced by the promises of automatic inference through the “ magic of MCMC ” – but I wish they would all just stop already and get back to doing statistics the way it should be done , back in the old days when a p-value stood for something , when a confidence interval meant what it said , and statistical bias was something to eliminate , not something to embrace .

An American inventor based in the UK has won an international design competition .
Michael Chen , 28 , won a £ 6,000 prize for his Reactiv cycle jacket , which changes colour as the cyclist brakes .
The inspiration for the jacket came from wanting to feel safer when cycling the streets of London .
Chen said : " I cycled round London in the dark wearing my first prototype .
It was a £ 10 waterproof jacket with LEDs stuck on by gaffer tape . "
He continued : " For the first time , I noticed that cars passed me more slowly , gave me more room , and that the drivers and passengers were even making eye contact . "
How it works
The jacket uses an accelerometer to sense movement , changing the colour of LEDs on the back from green when accelerating , then to red when braking .
A tilt switch in the jacket also makes LEDs in the arm flash amber when the wearer lifts their arm to indicate a turn .
There were entries from 14 countries in the James Dyson international design awards in New York .
They included a tangle - proof sailing rope , underwear which can correct posture and a toilet which analyses waste .
Michael Chen will get a cash prize of £ 5,000 with the other £ 1,000 going to his former university in London .
Tony Blair has been the Middle East envoy for the Quartet for 11 months
Israeli fighter aircraft were scrambled to intercept a jet carrying former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair after its crew failed to identify themselves .
Aircrew used the radio to explain who they were after the two warplanes adopted an attack position , prompting them to peel off and return to base .
Mr Blair was en route to Israel from a World Economic Forum meeting at Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt on Wednesday .
He is the Middle East envoy for the Quartet of major powers .
Mr Blair has been in the role for the last 11 months .
A spokesman for the former prime minister said : " Mr Blair was one of a number of delegates on a flight back from the World Economic Forum in Sharm El Sheikh .
" We were not aware of any problem at the time , and have not been notified of any issue with the flight . "
Israel 's air defence system is one of the strictest in the world and warplanes are often scrambled for false alarms .
‘ Terror and Consent ’ : brilliant , contrarian
James E. McWilliams / Austin- American Statesman | March 30 , 2008
During the course of a long , intellectually demanding narrative , " Terror and Consent " pivots on several paradigm - shifting claims .
One of them , which appears in the introduction , stands out for its humanitarian implications : " During the era of twentieth century industrial nation states … 80 percent of the dead and wounded in warfare were civilians . "
For Philip Bobbitt , a distinguished lecturer and senior fellow at the University of Texas and a law professor at Columbia University , this is more than a gee - whiz factoid .
It ’s the basis upon which he advances an ambitious argument for fighting the wars that are bound to plague the 21st century .
The prospect that the good old industrial nation state is a shrinking violet might rankle patriotic flag - wavers .
But Bobbitt ’s statistic thrusts home an unsettling question :
What does it say about the nation state that it has so often failed to provide , in the words of British statesman Douglas Hurd , " the security , prosperity , and the decent environment which the citizens demand " ?
Might it be time for something new ?
In Bobbitt ’s view , the current wars against terror provide a shrill wake - up call to confront this question .
The best way to protect citizens of modern democracies , he claims , is to fundamentally rethink the nation state as the guarantor of the freedoms that terrorists intend to obliterate .
Bobbitt ’s previous book , " The Shield of Achilles , " explored the grand themes of warfare and state development , marking his penchant for the magnum opus .
At nearly 700 pages ( including more than 100 pages of notes ) , " Terror and Consent " follows suit , taking on a similarly big picture .
If " we want to defeat state - shattering terror in the twenty - first century , " Bobbitt writes , we will have to " transform the emerging constitutional order of the twenty - first century State . "
Specifically , we must stop thinking like a nation state and start thinking like the " market state " that we are inevitably becoming .
The nation state — a constitutional order dedicated to protecting and improving the material welfare of its citizens — served the United States well from the mid-19th century to the end of the Cold War .
But Bobbitt contends it ’s vulnerable to a new battery of threats .
The accessibility of weapons of mass destruction , the globalization of international capital and the " universalization of culture " have eroded the conventional borders that once legitimated national security .
What ’s needed is a constitutional order that takes its structural cues from multinational corporations and nongovernmental organizations , relying " less on law and regulation and more on market incentives " to expand people ’s options .
Such a market state keeps its finger on the pulse of consumer demand , advocates trade liberalization , is prone to the privatization of public works and " will outsource many functions . "
In the seminar rooms of political science departments this change is referred to as " neoliberalism " ( on the streets , it is known as " globalization " ) — and Bobbitt , who is a geopolitical realist , believes we have no choice but to embrace it .
The market state , Bobbitt contends , has great potential for the cause of individual freedom , but it also has a dark side .
Global terrorism has already taken advantage of its ethos of openness in order to undermine it .
For example , the wide - open arms market that neoliberalism endorses has allowed terrorists to gain access to weapons of destruction that they then use to destabilize legitimate market states .
" Market state terrorism , " Bobbitt explains , thus feeds on the " ardently sought innovations " of the 20th century to exploit " the increasing vulnerability of market states to catastrophic events . "
" One can not say , " Bobbitt warns , " precisely how long we have . "
What is to be done
This is not fear - mongering but rather a sophisticated geopolitical assessment .
Therefore , a great deal rests on the solutions Bobbitt offers .
Fortunately , his suggestions are , if not entirely novel , largely sensible .
But they are ambitious to the point of being unachievable without extraordinary political leadership and unprecedented corporate discipline .
First , Bobbitt argues that the market state must allow the timeworn strategies of deterrence and containment to yield to the more aggressive tactics of preclusionary warfare .
In an " epochal war , " which we ’re in , market states share the burden of employing power " preclusively rather than waiting for an acute crisis to set in that irrevocably puts us at a disadvantage . "
Venturing educated guesses about the behavior of future threats is no one ’s idea of an ideal tactical strategy , but Bobbitt argues that if we strengthen our alliances with other states , networks of shared intelligence could do an impressive job of it .
Of course , this would require a more invasive process of information gathering within and across national borders .
In order to reduce the threat to civil liberties this would entail , Bobbitt highlights " ( o ) ur commitment to globalize the systems of human rights and government by consent . "
He insists that emerging market states must collectively , out of " self respect , " define and protect our inalienable rights .
What this means in concrete terms is that governments " must rethink ideas like ‘ Homeland Security , ’ when the threats to security cannot be neatly cabined as in or out of the homeland , " that an " alliance of democracies " must form to discourage isolationism and that the United States must " change its role as hegemon " in NATO .
Only then can a consortium of neoliberal democracies draw " a bright - line rule against the intentional infliction of pain on any person detained by government , " one of the many human rights threats that Bobbitt believes we must address .
These developments — the acceptance of preclusionary war , the universalization of human rights — hinge on a revamping of international law .
Bobbitt believes that the UN Charter should be amended to allow the preemptive use of force without a Security Council authorization , that the Geneva Conventions should be changed to forbid the indefinite containment of terrorist prisoners without trial and that we must , in cases in which the use of non-lethal chemical weapons could be used to prevent terror , be able to redefine such methods as " counterforce measures . "
The messy reality
These prescriptions provide a useful blueprint for fighting terror .
As with any blueprint , however , there is the messy reality of filling in the details .
Bobbitt presents his arguments persuasively ; there is nothing dumbed down about " Terror and Consent . "
Nevertheless , one wonders if he concedes too much to the many virtues of neoliberalism without fully appreciating its negative impact .
Two issues stand out .
First , Bobbitt admits that there will be no obvious answer to many of the human rights issues that are bound to arise .
In many situations , he explains , our only option is to vest faith in properly formulated international and constitutional systems of law .
This sort of vagueness is frustrating , perhaps dangerously so .
Take one case that Bobbitt offers :
What should a market state do when an Islamic state holds free elections that bring a bin Laden to power ?
This situation , after all , presents allied market states with a human rights quandary — some sort of ethical corner will have to be cut .
Bobbitt ’s approach to these kinds of problems is often to dance a bit too delicately around them .
He argues , " States must measure their tactical and strategic policies against the impact these policies are likely to have on their legitimacy , " and " Whether ( a ) state is subject to intervention … ought to be measured by the relationship between the strategic interests of the states of consent and the severity of the deprivations of human rights . "
Both answers tell us we need to take measurements but offer no ruler with which to do so .
Further left unexplored in this response is the possibility that the market state offers a conception of inalienable rights that it has not yet developed the means to protect .
One ca n’t help but wonder , as globalization renders millions of people vulnerable to human rights violations , if the nation state and its emphasis on human welfare should be so thoroughly dismissed .
Second , there is the matter that Bobbitt does not spend much time addressing : the war in Iraq — specifically , the subcontracting tactics that a CEO president and his corporate - modeled Cabinet have embraced .
The inefficiencies of Halliburton , the corruption of Bechtel and the violence perpetuated by Blackwater call into question Bobbitt ’s advocacy of privatizing public duties .
How does a market state draw " bright - line " rules on human rights when the actors in charge of drawing those lines hold privately funded erasers ?
These questions , like so many others that this book poses , lack easy answers .
But the long century we face might demand that we answer them not by choosing good over bad , but — as is usually the case in war and politics — the lesser of evils .
If this is so , then " Terror and Consent " offers the most we can expect from our blinkered vantage point : a dauntingly learned and occasionally infuriating manifesto .

MATHEMATICS AS HISTORY .
W. W. Sawyer .
In describing the development of any subject , a choice has to be made ; can we reestrict ourselves to discussion of the subject itself , or is it necessary to consider it in the context of the time and place where it grew ?
For instance , in the history of music , is it sufficient to describe and analyze the differences between Mozart and Beethoven , or is it necessary to consider such external influences as the French Revolution and the rise of romantic nationalism ?
A similar question arises in relation to mathematics .
Of the writers who have discerned some pattern in history the three best known are Toynbee , seeing civilisations in terms of challenge and response ; Marx , often misinterpreted as ascribing all human actions to the economic interest of classes ; and the most spectacular of all , Spengler .
To the best of my knowledge Toynbee does not deal with mathematics .
Marx maintains that mathematics develops in two ways ; one is related to the needs of society , the other to the natural , internal development of the subject itself .
A good example of this internal development would be Gauss ' construction of the regular 17 - sided polygon by ruler and compasses .
Surely no society will ever have a practical need for the regular 17 - gon , and if for some strange reason they did , they would not resort to a lengthy construction with ruler and compasses .
What led Gauss to his theorem was purely intellectual curiosity .
The Greeks had succeeded in constructing the regular pentagon - in itself quite a remarkable achievement .
Gauss asked himself , " What property does the number 5 have , not possessed by 7,11 and 13 , that makes this construction possible ? "
He succeeded in answering this question , and his work has since led to a whole series of studies of what can be done with a specified type of mathematical operations .
The 17th century gives an excellent example of the influence of society on mathematical development .
The mathematical needs of society were then particularly intense .
This can be seen in the dedication of the Royal Society in 1660 .
It expresses the hope that improvements in navigation will " Deliver the Anxious Seamen from the Fatal Accidents that frequently attend their Mistaken Longitude . "
To - day longitude is determined by comparing the time , based on local observations , with the Greenwich time - signal on radio .
In the 17th century help was sought in two ways - perfecting clocks that would keep accurate time in a storm - tossed ship , and the improvement of astronomy , so that the Greenwich time could be deduced by observing , for instance , the time at which a particular star passed behind the moon .
Newton 's Principia goes into immense detail on the movement of the moon , something that would certainly be absent to - day in a publication announcing the law of universal gravity .
The theory of dynamics was involved in both approaches .
A young Russian , later murdered by Stalin , wrote an interesting and instructive account of the background to 17th century mathematics . [ 1 ]
Mechanics and geometry are both involved in the design of ships .
How far this work had gone was shown dramatically when Peter the Great visited England in 1698 .
Peter had some very unpleasant traits , but I find one aspect of his character very attractive , and most unusual in a king .
When he wanted to build a Russia navy , he decided to get a thorough understanding by himself working as a shipwright , first in Holland and then in England .
As a result of this experience , when he left England he took 500 Englishmen with him , to play a decisive part in directing and carrying out the construction of his navy .
For , he said , the Dutch simply copied what had worked in the past .
In Holland he had learned little more than ship 's carpentry .
" Peter wanted to grasp the basic secrets of ship design ...
He wanted blueprints made scientifically , controlled by mathematics " [ 2 ]
Incidentally , I do not know the details of what scientific principles for ship design were available at that time , and would be very grateful to anyone who can inform me of these .
HISTORY AS DESTINY .
The most extreme view to be considered is that of Oswald Spengler , an incredibly learned German schoolteacher , who claimed to have discovered a universal pattern in world history .
He supported his views by reference to the history of civilizations in Europe , Russia , Egypt , the Middle East , India and China throughout the centuries . [ 3 ]
With this wealth of material , it is not surprising that his book , quite apart from its general theme , contains many interesting pieces of information .
For instance , early in the book he scoffs at those who take a superficial view of history , such as the Jacobin clubs in the French Revolution , who had a cult admiring Brutus as a revolutionary .
Spengler points out that Brutus was in fact " a millionaire and an exploiter who , as a supporter of the oligarchic regime , stabbed the man of the democracy amid the plaudits of the aristocratic Senate . " [ 4 ]
I never realized this , when I did Julius Caesar at school .
According to Spengler , there was a close analogy between the history of a culture and the life of a human being .
A culture was born ; there followed a vigorous youth and a period of maturity ; finally came an age of decadence , in which old beliefs and loyalties faded and money dominated everything .
He gave the years A.D. 1800 to 2000 for this stage of our society .
Without admitting the truth of his general theory , one must admit that this has considerable resemblance to the
situation to - day .
He maintained this progression , from vigour to decadence , was as inevitable as the successive changes in a person who survives from infancy to old age .
Moreover , at each stage , every subject , every activity reflected both the surrounding culture and the stage that had been reached .
His example of a subject depending on the civilization in which it develops - , we think of our geometry as being the same as that of the Greeks , but in fact it is quite different .
It is impossible for us to understand the classical view that everything is inside the sphere of the fixed stars .
A child to - day , shown the classical picture of the universe , would immediately ask , " What is outside the largest sphere ? " Spengler says classical man had neither the word nor the concept of empty space . [ 5 ]
Greek geometry deals with the sizes and shapes of material objects .
Modern geometry is entirely different .
It may start , " Suppose there are three kinds of objects , called points , lines and planes , with the property that any two points determine a line .... " and so on .
It is a study of logical relationships , quite distinct from Euclid , in which you can pick up the triangle ABC and put it down on the triangle DEF .
The Greek fear of the distant .
Spengler says the Greeks had an acute fear of anything distant in time or space .
He relates this to the existence of the Polis .
the city - state in which Greeks lived . "
Home for classical man was what he could see from the citadel of his state .
Anything beyond this was strange , indeed hostile . " [ 5 ]
This feeling of dread came to attach to distance in any form .
Here we may begin to think Spengler is letting his imagination run away with him .
But in another place we read , " In the last years of Pericles a law was passed in Athens that threatened with the severe punishment of impeachment anyone who propagated astronomical theories . " [ 8 ]
Such theories seem perfectly harmless to us , but evidently upset the Greeks very much .
Spengler 's explanation seems as good as any .
Our Future .
Spengler asserts that we are in a late stage of a dying civilization .
Now this is a view that could be held quite rationally without any reference to Spengler .
We can apply Toynbee 's condition ; a civilization disappears when a challenge arises to which its governing circles fail to respond .
To - day there are many serious problems , social , economic and international , on which no European government - and for that matter no opposition party - seems to be preparing a determined onslaught .
Unemployment , perhaps , is the most dangerous of these .
The 1930s showed the serious consequences it could have .
However at present nations do not try to get rid of it , but only to push it onto somebody else .
We must admit that we may fail , but what Spengler says is quite different from that .
He maintains we are in the grip of an implacable destiny , which makes it certain we shall fail .
Fortunately we can prove quite rigorously that Spengler 's reasoning is unsound .
An essential point of Spengler 's theory , on which he insists many times , is that every activity reflects the stage its civilization has reached , so it is quite impossible for any subject to flourish triumphantly in an age of total decadence .
If even one subject does this , it means the whole theory has to be rejected .
And in fact there is one subject that has reached supreme heights in our century , a subject for which Spengler prophesied a future which turned out to be the exact opposite of what actually happened .
That subject is mathematics .
The reason for this is not that Spengler was ignorant of mathematics .
In his book Spengler displays a grasp of what was happening in mathematics that would have been quite creditable for a professional mathematician of his day .
What caused his mistake was his belief that , in an age of decay , mathematics must necessarily share that decline .
It was this belief - not any ignorance of mathematics - that led him to make a forecast of the future of mathematics that could not have been more untrue .
He wrote " It is certain that for us the time of the great mathematicians is over .
To - day there is in process the same work of preserving , rounding - off , refining , selecting , the talented work on details instead of the great creativeness , as there was in the Alexandrian mathematics of the later Hellenism . " [ 6 ]
In reality , while Spengler was putting his material together , two epoch - making events in mathematics took place .
These were two doctoral dissertations ;- in 1902 Lebesgue 's announcement of Lebesgue integration , which gave analysts an entirely new and extremely powerful weapon ; in 1906 Frechet 's thesis on abstract spaces , an idea that has permeated nearly all mathematical papers since that time . [ 7 ]
Spengler 's reference to " work on details " is particularly inappropriate to this latter topic , abstract spaces , for these are characterized by sweeping generalizations .
Indeed some of the more conservative mathematicians have complained that , in the pursuit of such generalizations , modern research workers have not paid any attention to certain detailed traditional problems , the solution of which would be of great value .

Post - Super Tuesday Canvass Reveals Discrepancies Between Internal Printouts and Memory Cartridges on DRE Systems in Five Separate Counties
Same ' Tamperproof ' Machines Recently Hacked by Princeton University Professor , Also Failed to Start Up Properly on Election Day ...
John Gideon Byon 2/20/2008 , 2:45 pm PT
Guest Blogged by John Gideon of VotersUnite .

The Newark Star - Ledger is reporting that New Jersey election officials have found a discrepancy in the state 's Primary Election results as reported on the Direct Recording Electronic ( DRE ) voting machines used on Super Tuesday .
Voter totals reported by the internal paper tapes on their Sequoia AVC Advantage DRE in a number of counties are failing to match up with totals found on the memory cartridges , used for both ballot definition and results storage , on the same machines , according to the report today ...
As Union County Clerk Joanne Rajoppi tried to verify returns in this month 's historic presidential primary , she kept coming up with errors for a handful of voting machines .
The numbers from the cartridges that print out vote tallies and the paper - tape backup within the machine did n't match .
Rajoppi asked her colleagues in other counties to perform the same test , and similar problems were found in voting machines for Bergen , Gloucester , Middlesex and Ocean counties .
Problems with Sequoia 's AVC Advantage systems also emerged early on the morning of Super Tuesday , forcing a 45 minute delay for the state 's Governor , who was unable to cast his vote when the machines failed to boot up on Election Day .
In February of last year , the same machines were hacked by a Princeton University Professor after he'd been able to purchase a number of the $ 8000 systems for just $ 86 apiece on the Internet .
The Star - Ledger today goes on to report some of the details on the latest failures now emerging in New Jersey during the state 's post- election canvassing ...
The errors involve voter - turnout totals .
For example , both the tape and cartridge on one machine in Cranford show 225 votes were cast when Democrat and Republican votes are added .
The problem is , the tape and cartridge do n't agree when the numbers are broken down by party , Rajoppi said .
The tape counts 168 votes for Democratic candidates , while the cartridge shows 170 .
On the Republican side , the tape counts 57 votes , but the cartridge shows 55 .
When Rajoppi discovered the problem , she called the vendor , Sequoia Voting Systems ...
" Initially , when I called Sequoia they said it was an anomaly .
And I said , ' Excuse me .
It 's not .
It 's an error , ' " Rajoppi said .
Congratulations to Rajoppi for making that important distinction .
These are not anomalies , glitches , snags , snafus or hiccups , they are failures by these expensive products and / or voting machine companies to perform as expected and well - paid .
Sequoia 's spokeswoman , Michelle Shafer , says that the company is working with election officials to determine the cause of the problem .
The Associated Press reports that a Sequoia technician has blamed the problem on a corrupted computer chip .
That seems to be a stretch in logic because it would mean that chips failed in five counties that have all reported the same problem , and they all failed at the same time .
The BRAD BLOG previously reported problems on the same voting machines early on the morning of Super Tuesday in New Jersey , when the Advantage machines failed to properly start up , resulting in embarrassment when NJ's Gov. John Corzine was forced to wait 45 minutes before he was able to cast his vote .
Reports of votes flipping from Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama were also reported that morning .
In February of 2007 , we reportedon the same Sequoia Advantage machines having been hacked in five minutes by a professor at Princeton University , who had purchased five of the machines on the Internet from an on - line government equipment clearinghouse for $ 86 apiece .
The same systems were recently purchased by the state of New Jersey for $ 8,000 each .
" We can take a version of Sequoia 's software program and modify it to do something different --- like appear to count votes , but really move them from one candidate to another , " Princeton computer science professor Andrew Appel told the New Jersey Star - Ledger at the time .
" And it can be programmed to do that only on Tuesdays in November , and at any other time .
You ca n't detect it , " he said .
At the time , an Election Integrity group had filed a lawsuit against the state , claiming the 10,000 AVC Advantage machines were in violation of state law since they were never properly certified as secure or reliable , as required by the state .
" There is zero documentation --- no proof whatsoever --- that any state official has ever reviewed Sequoia machines , " Attorney Penny Venetis , co-director of the Rutgers Constitutional Litigation Clinic , argued at the time .
" This means you can not use them ... These machines are being used to count most of the votes in the state without being tested in any way , shape or form . "
" Had the machines been tested , " the state Election Integrity advocates found , " they would have proved to be a hacker 's dream . "
Sequoia Voting Systems responded to the reports at the time by claiming their election products were " tamper proof . "
Independent studies commissioned recently by the states of California , Ohio and Colorado have all found otherwise , as the testers were reportedly able to violate the security measures on Sequoia 's DRE systems in a matter of seconds .

CNN reported yesterday that a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the U.S. Treasury Department is violating the law by failing to design and issue currency that is readily distinguishable to blind and visually impaired people .
This decision upheld a ruling from 2006 and could possibly force the Treasury Department to redesign the US paper currency so blind and visually impaired people can readily distinguish the bill denominations .
US currency has long been a sore point for blind Americans , who have to rely on other people to tell them the denomination of the bills they have .
This can lead to big problems with unscrupulous store clerks or other people more concerned with making a dishonest buck than being a decent human .
The federal appeals court upheld the ruling that the current versions of the currency are in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 , which is intended to afford disabled people the same civil rights and opportunities afforded everyone in American society .
Unfortunately , the US Treasury Department has never done a complete overhaul of their currency to align it within the realm of this law .
There are a few world currencies that are doing things differently .
Perhaps the US could learn from them .

The Euro was designed with consideration for the blind
The European Union designed the different denominations of the Euro to have large , easily identifiable numbers and gradually increase in size as the denominations increase in value .
This makes the bills easily distinguishable to those who are either blind or visually impaired .
In fact , the European Blind Union was consulted extensively during the design of the Euro bills .
In addition to the large numbers , contrasting colors , and notes that increase in size as the value increases , banknotes are printed in relief , using an intaglio printing press .
The €200 and €500 banknotes are printed in a raised ink relief to give the notes a distinctive tactile feel along their edges .
Possible Changes to US Currency ?
According to CNN , the suggested solutions include making bills different sizes , including raised markings or using foil printing which is a method of hot stamping that leaves a noticeable impression on the bill .
Will the US redesign its currency ?
It is too early to tell at this point , but if the U.S. Treasury Department is violating the law , it is possible they may be forced to make some drastic changes .
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing recently contracted with a research firm to conduct a study to find a possible solution to this problem .
However , the results of the study will not be available until early 2009 .
Whatever the result , I imagine it would cost the US government hundred of millions of dollars ( if not several billion dollars ) to redesign the currency and retool the printing facilities .
However , with counterfeit currency such a huge problem , this may be an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone .
If the US is required to make wholesale changes to its currency , I think the Australian Dollar would be a great currency to model it after .
New $ 5 Bill and $ 100 Bill .
See the changes the US has recently made to the new $ 5 bill and the security features of the $ 100 bill .
The Australian Dollar and its anti-counterfeiting measures
Australian notes are printed entirely out of polymer plastic .
This helps with counterfeit prevention and ensures the bills last longer in hot , humid climates .
The first Australian polymer notes were printed in1988 , and were rolled into production to replace old notes in the following years .
This started a trend and now several nations use similar polymers for their currency .
Security features :
The security features on the Australian notes are so good , the Reserve Bank of Australia has stated they are not aware of anyone being able to accurately forge the currency .
In general , polymer banknotes have more security features available to them than regular paper notes , including : microprinting , a clear window with a picture in it ( similar to a watemark , but much more difficult to reproduce ) , embossing , intaglio and offset printing , different colors on the obverse and reverse of the note , and security threads that can be magnetized , fluorescent , phosphorescent , microprinted , clear text , or windowed .

Subject : ANNOUNCE : Ocsigen 1.0.0
Hi , After more than 3 years of development , we are pleased to announce that Ocsigen has now reached version 1.0.0 !
Ocsigen is a research project aimed at developing new programming techniques for the Web .
It contains : - a fully featured Web server , with lots of extensions , - a programming framework , called Eliom , providing an innovative way to create dynamic Websites in OCaml .
The Web server has all the features required to be used as a replacement for Apache ( or others ) .
It is very easy to implement extensions to it in OCaml .
Among the features that come with Ocsigen are : - a CGI module to use Web sites written as CGI scripts ( for example trac on ocsigen.org , or even PHP pages through CGI ) , - a reverse proxy module ( with pipelined requests ) to use Ocsigen together with another Web server , - a powerful , findlib - aware , configuration file with access control and authentication , - a content deflation module - user configuration files ( beta ) Eliom is the most innovative part of the project .
It is a programming framework for dynamic Web programming in OCaml which introduces high - level concepts that make programming very concise and safe .
The goal is to make large pieces of code easy to maintain and evolve .
For example : - it is possible to check statically the types of html fragments so as to guarantee the validity of pages ( with respect to W3C recommendations ) .
Type checking is done either using polymorphic variants or with OCamlDuce , - pages are generated by OCaml functions with an abstract notion of " service " .
This ensures that there will be no broken links , and no wrong parameter names , - the full taxonomy of services closely matches the needs of Web developers , - it uses continuation - based Web programming for handling the " back button " , - it provides a powerful session mechanism , - etc. Eliom is not a Content Management System , but is intended to be the basis for such higher - level tools .
Several projects have already been initiated by the community , like Nurpawiki ( by Janne Hellsten ) , Litiom and Lambdium ( by Dario Teixeira ) , or Ocsimore ( by Piero Furiesi and Jaap Boender ) .
We think that the project is now mature enough for wider dissemination and we hope some of you will be interested in joining the community to develop new sites with Eliom !
Version 1.0.0 is only the beginning of Ocsigen 's story .
We have many things in mind for the future .
We have already been working , for the last few months , on a version 2 which will make it very easy to write Web sites that are highly dynamic on both client and server side .
Ocsigen is developed as a collaborative open source project .
If you need any features that are not implemented , please feel free to contribute !
Ocsigen is a research project of the PPS laboratory ( CNRS , universitÃ© Paris - Diderot ) .
It is developed by Vincent Balat , JÃ©rÃ´me Vouillon , Gabriel Kerneis , StÃ©phane Glondu , Denis Berthod , Jaap Boender , Piero Furiesi , Thorsten Ohl , Nataliya Guts , JÃ©rÃ´me Velleine and Pierre Clairambault .
I really want to thank all of them , and also the whole community of beta - testers for their very interesting contributions .
We hope that you 'll enjoy this version , and we wish you happy programming with Eliom !

Advertisement A man has been given a suspended jail sentence for attacking two Star Wars fans while posing as Darth Vader .
Arwel Wynn Hughes , 27 , from Holyhead , Anglesey , admitted assaulting Barney Jones and cousin Michael with a metal crutch , whilst shouting " Darth Vader " .
Hughes told police he had no memory of the incident as he was drunk .
District Judge Andrew Straw said the publicity his case had received was perhaps a good thing , and a " wake up call " to deal with his alcohol problem .
Diane Williams , prosecuting , said the two cousins had set up a Jedi faith church with around 30 local members in the Holyhead area .
On 25 March they were being filmed fighting with light sabres in a garden in Holyhead when Hughes jumped over a wall .
Perhaps the publicity surrounding your case has been a good thing , and is the wake - up call you need to deal with your problems
District judge Andrew Shaw
" He was wearing a black bin liner , had a cut to his face and had in his hand a crutch - which he did not need to walk as he was holding it in the air , " Ms Williams said .
" He shouted Darth Vader several times before hitting Barney Jones on the back of his head and then he hit Michael Jones to his leg . "
Hughes then laughed , said he was joking and ran off , she added .
Later when arrested by police he told them that he was " extremely drunk " at the time , she said .
Barney Jones had suffered a headache after the attack , and Michael Jones a bruised leg .
Publicity Mrs Frances Jones defending said her client had a " serious alcohol problem " .
" He has previously stopped drinking but the rehab he has needed has not been available , " Mrs Jones said .
" But now a place has become available at Touchstone in Colwyn Bay . "
Arwel Wynn Hughes after a previous hearing Mrs Jones argued that allowing Hughes to access treatment would help rather than just punish him , as similar treatment was not available in prison .
Judge Shaw told Hughes there had been an element of premeditation in the assaults because he had been wearing the bin bag , and had a weapon .
That he would be caught had been " inevitable " the judge added .
" Perhaps the publicity surrounding your case has been a good thing , and is the wake - up call you need to deal with your problems , " he said .
The judge said despite his " genuine efforts " to change however the attack had been sufficiently serious to warrant a jail sentence .
Hughes was sentenced to two months suspended for 12 months , with supervision and residence requirements overseen by the probation service .
He was also ordered to pay £ 100 to each of his two victims and prosecution costs of £ 60 .

Jailed governor 's daughter accuses judge of delaying appeal David Edwards and Muriel Kane

At the heart of the case of imprisoned former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman are charges that he was railroaded by Karl Rove and the Republican Party .
MSNBC host Dan Abrams has become a passionate advocate for Siegelman 's cause , and in an extended segment on Wednesday 's program , he examined various aspects of this allegation .
Dana Siegelman , the former governor 's daughter , joined Abrams Wednesday to discuss attempts to get her father 's sentence reviewed .
She said her father was " excited " and " reencouraged " by the CBS and MSNBC coverage of his case and that she believes Judge Mark Fuller is deliberately " sitting on " the transcript of Siegelman 's 2006 trial that has to be available before any appeal can go forward .
She confirmed that her father " absolutely " believes Rove is responsible for his incarceration .
" He knows Karl Rove is behind this .
...
My dad was the first governor to endorse Al Gore . ...
He spoke at the Democratic national meeting in Boston and said some things that were very controversial and things that scared the Republican Party into thinking that my dad was also looking to run on a national scale . "
Earlier in the program , Abrams spoke to legal professor Scott Horton , an expert on the Siegelman case , and asked him about the blackout of last Sunday 's 60 Minutes segment on Siegelman by an Alabama television station .
Horton dismissed the possibility that there could have been a technical failure as the station claims , although he did acknowledge that " it may not have been a conscious management decision . "
" The station is run by an investment group that is headed by one of the Bass brothers , " Horton stated .
" They 're very , very close to Bush .
...
In fact , the CBS people in New York told me , this is a station that was known for its hostility to Governor Siegelman . "
Alabama whistleblower : Ask Rove to swear before Congress he never met me Abrams then played part of an interview he did earlier this week with former Republican operative Dana Jill Simpson , who has claimed that Karl Rove orchestrated the attempt to bring down Governor Siegelman and personally directed her to try to get evidence of Siegelman cheating on his wife .
Abrams asked Simpson about Rove 's denial that he ever met with her .
Simpson responded , " Since Karl Rove has said that , and he feels so good about saying that , what I want him to do is go and swear in front of the United States Congress and swear what he is saying is true .
... Karl Rove has refused to do so .
... I met with Karl Rove probably three times .
... I also talked to him multiple times . "
Critics have challenged Simpson 's latest revelations about Rove by asking why she never mentioned them prior to the 60 Minutes story , but Simpson told Abrams that she had brought them up several times .
" When I talked to those Congressional investigators , I told them that I had followed Don Siegelman and tried to get pictures of him cheating on his wife .
However , they suggested to me that that was not relevant because there was nothing illegal about that and they just preferred that it not come out at the hearing . "
Simpson also rebutted claims by the Alabama Republican Party that she never worked for them , citing phone records in her possession showing her calls to state party leaders .
Scott Horton reinforced Dana Siegelman 's remarks by saying that the Siegelman forces need to push hard for him to be released pending his appeal .
" There is no legitimate reason for the Court of Appeals to continue to hold him , " Horton stated .
" What 's going on is a complete travesty . "
" We are not dropping the subject , " Abrams concluded .

How a coterie of Republican heavyweights sent a governor to jail Daughter of jailed governor sees White House hand in her father 's fall Running elections from the White House
This video is from MSNBC's Live with Dan Abrams , broadcast February 27 , 2008 .
Of the multitude of mainstream 2008 Presidential candidates , there are only three who are truly antiwar .
Two of them are running as Democrats , one as a Republican .
The two Democrats have little money in the bank , are polling in the low single digits and are clearly headed nowhere fast .
The antiwar Republican was in much the same boat as Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel the first few weeks of his Presidential bid .
But now his campaign has started to gain momentum : he has broken through the media wall of silence with recent fundraising success and his poll numbers are moving up in the early states of New Hampshire and Iowa .
That candidate ’s name is Congressman Ron Paul of Texas .
This poses a dilemma for any liberal who opposes the Iraq war and the overall war - mongering and empire building of the United States government ..
As I wrote in a previous article , a typical liberal will be opposed to Ron Paul on most issues , though Paul is very ‘ liberal ’ on the questions of war and peace , civil liberties and drug laws .
Yet Paul is the only candidate besides Kucinich and Gravel that can be trusted to keep his word and bring the troops back home immediately .
And Kucinich and Gravel are simply not making any headway in their respective campaigns .
How can liberals balance their desire for the social programs proposed by Hillary and gang against the near certainty that candidates such as Clinton and Obama will continue Bush ’s Middle East war policies , albeit on a scaled - down level ?
Which should be more important , ending the military conflict and bringing the troops home or expanding the welfare state ?
The choice seems difficult one , until one digs a little deeper .
The first point I would to make is that even if antiwar liberal ’s plans on voting Democratic in the General Election , it does not hurt the Democrats chances in November , 2008 to switch over and vote for Ron Paul in the Republican Primary .
The defection of large numbers of Democrats to vote for Paul would send a very clear and unambiguous message to the eventual Democratic nominee : take an antiwar stance or risk losing liberal votes to a Third Party candidate .
The more important point I would like to make , though , is that even if Ron Paul were to ascend to the Presidency , it would not at all be a bad thing for liberal social policy .
Paul is opposed to the income tax and wants to eliminate host of federal agencies , ranging from the IRS to Homeland Security .
He is ardently pro-gun ownership , anti-choice and would definitely veto any bill that would expand health care benefits .
Yet , none of these domestic positions he holds would likely have a practical impact on the actual functioning of government were he to take office in 2009 .
As President , he would hold no authority to unilaterally eliminate federal agencies or cut taxes or benefits .
Any changes would have to take place with the approval of Congress .
But here ’s the thing : if a war - mongering liberal Democrat takes office , there still will be no expansion of welfare programs that liberals love .
The ‘ catch ’ with voting for a candidate such as Clinton or Obama , is that their policies on war and defense budgets will likely crowd out any attempt to make a significant expansion of government programs to help the poor and middle class .
A prime example is health care .
I , personally , am much more in tune with Hillary ’s view on health care than I am with Ron Paul’s .
Yet , with the current budget deficits and the expansion of the U.S. military expenditures , where is Hillary or Obama or Edwards going to find the money to expand health care coverage ?
The answer is : they wo n’t .
Health care in America will remain the same , whether under a liberal Democrat or conservative Republican .
Any changes that might take place will be at the very far margins .
However , with a Paul Presidency , there might be some hope for some of those programs in the distant future .
Because a President Paul could unilaterally start bringing American troops back home .
Not only from Iraq , but also from Afghanistan and Kosovo and Korea .
A Paul Presidency could finally result in the long sought after ‘ peace dividend ’ .
Let ’s face it , from a liberal perspective ; the expansion of the welfare state can only happen if America scales back its imperial ambitions .
Though Ron Paul does not advocate any expansion of the welfare state , he would undoubtedly do much to downsize the American Empire .
This brings me to the abortion issue and the larger issue of who gets to appoint the next Supreme Court Justice .
Although some may feel that Paul would appoint a Scalia - type , I do not think this is a real danger .
One must recall that Paul ’s philosophy is not really conservative , but libertarian to see what kind of justice he would appoint .
President Paul would be unlikely to appoint a justice that would rubber - stamp torture or the Supreme Power of the Executive Branch .
This , in my view , would eliminate most Scalias and Thomas ’s from his consideration .
And the judge ’s that would most likely fall in Paul ’s political philosophy may or may not be anti-choice .
But they certainly would be better than the choice ’s presented by any other Republican .
“ This is a case where the use of military force against a training camp to show the Iranians we ’re not going to tolerate this is really the most prudent thing to do , ” he said .
“ Then the ball would be in Iran ’s court to draw the appropriate lesson to stop harming our troops . ”

Beijing 's plans for the London leg of the Olympic torch relay suffered a setback yesterday when it emerged that a number of torch - bearers , including the BBC 's most senior journalist , have abandoned plans to take part in Sunday 's event .
There was also confusion surrounding whether or not China 's ambassador to Britain , Fu Ying , would participate in the relay .
With protest groups opposed to China 's human rights record preparing to stage mass demonstrations along the 31 - mile route , the Chinese embassy denied reports that the ambassador had withdrawn .
But embassy officials said the ambassador was required to spend the day with a Chinese government delegation accompanying the torch , leading to confusion as to whether she would take part or not .
In a later statement , the embassy said : " There has never been a view expressed from the Chinese embassy at any point that the ambassador is pulling out of the torch relay .
She has n't said that herself either . "
Mark Byford , the deputy director general of the BBC , has also backed out of a commitment to carry the torch amid concerns that his participation would compromise the corporation 's journalistic standards .
Gabby Logan , the sports presenter , is also understood to have withdrawn , having initially been included in a provisional list of celebrity torch - bearers .
She cited a clash with her Sunday morning radio programme .
Her husband , Kenny Logan , is taking part .
Comedian Francesca Martinez also withdrew saying she felt that taking part would legitimise violence in Tibet .
She told Channel 4 News : " I was very honoured to be asked , and very honoured to represent the disabled community .
I fully support the Tibetan cause and in a way I feel that , because of the mounting pressure and the ongoing violence in Tibet , that torch - bearers should turn down their role ... because I feel that is truly promoting and supporting the Olympic ideals , which are unity and world peace , and that does n't include invasion of other countries . "
Byford , who is second in command at the BBC , head of journalism across all networks and chair of the BBC's London 2012 co-ordinating group , provisionally accepted an invitation from the Beijing Olympic organising committee to carry the torch .
With China 's hosting of the Olympics an increasingly controversial subject he withdrew .
" Mark Byford did provisionally accept an invitation to carry the torch , but then decided that as head of journalism it would be inappropriate to take part , " said a BBC spokesman .
" The torch relay is a major story and Mark might be required to make an important editorial decision , so he decided it would be inappropriate to take part . "
His withdrawal highlights the sensitivities surrounding the torch relay and Beijing 's hosting of the games , and contrasts with the position of Sir Trevor McDonald , presenter of ITV's News at Ten , who will carry the torch .
The torch relay , which left Greece last week and will visit 21 countries en route to Beijing , was intended to be a marketing exercise that would promote China and the Olympics around the world .
Following a violent crackdown on protests in Tibet last month , and continuing unease over Beijing 's support for Sudan 's government , it has become a lightning rod for those opposed to the communist regime .
Protests are planned in several of the major cities on the relay route , with Sunday 's journey through London expected to be among the biggest .
The Metropolitan police will launch a £ 1 m security operation to ensure that the torch gets from its starting point at Wembley Stadium to the O2 arena in Greenwich unscathed .
More than 2,000 officers will be on duty , with police cyclists accompanying the torch as it is carried by 80 runners on a route that passes through Piccadilly Circus , Trafalgar Square and Downing Street , where it will be greeted by the prime minister .
Commander Bob Broadhurst , who will be in charge of the operation , said that his officers would respect the right of protesters to demonstrate and assist those groups that contacted them .
Protesters who try to disrupt the passage of the torch could be detained until it has left London on Sunday night .
If demonstrations should turn violent , the relay could be abandoned or rerouted at short notice .
" If we had thousands of protesters who turned rough then we may take a pragmatic decision to move round them or go straight to the O2 , but we will not be battling through people who are determined to stop the relay , " Broadhurst said .
Charter Communications , the fourth - largest cable system in the United States , has started telling its high - speed Internet customers that it is going to keep track of every site they visit on the Web .
The cable company will sell the data to a firm called NebuAd , which in turn will use it to show ads to Web - surfing Charter customers that are meant to be related to their interests .
( Visit a knitting site yesterday and see yarn ads today . )
Charter started sending letters out to several hundred thousand customers in four markets : Fort Worth , Tex. ; San Luis Obispo , Calif . ; Oxford , Mass . ; and Newtown , Conn .
( The letters were first reported by DSLreports.com . )
Charter said it will start testing the system within 30 days and will make a decision whether to introduce it to its 2.8 million Internet customers a few months after that .
Using data from Internet service providers for what the advertising people call behavioral targeting raises all kinds of questions about privacy , disclosure and who owns the information about where Internet users surf .
I called Charter to ask about this Tuesday , and the company quickly put Ted Schremp , its senior vice president for product management and strategy , on the phone .
That immediately set Charter apart from the other Internet companies in the United States that have been identified as working with NebuAd : Embarq and Wide Open West .
Neither of them would discuss the matter when I last asked .
Charter is taking “ for the most part , a high road approach , ” according to Mr. Schremp .
“ We have told customers exactly what we are doing , ” he said .
The letter to customers , he added , was “ very forthcoming ” and “ not buried in mouse type and legal disclosures . ”
The five - paragraph letter positioned the monitoring program as an “ an enhanced online experience that is more customized to your interests and activities . ”
“ As a result , ” the letter said , “ the advertising you typically see online will better reflect the interests you express through your web - surfing activity .
You will not see more ads — just ads that are more relevant to you . ”
The letter contained a link to a Web page with answers to some common questions .
A second link in the letter goes to a page that allows users to opt out of the system .
I suggested to Mr. Schremp that there would probably be a fair number of customers who do n’t consider having their Internet activities tracked to be an enhancement .
He responded several ways .
He said that Charter convened focus groups of customers in two cities and found that most did n’t object when the program was explained to them .
( A crucial aspect of the NebuAd system is that it claims not to record any personally identifiable information about users .
Rather , it associates each user ’s behavior with 1,000 categories of interest to advertisers . )
He offered his personal view that the system was harmless and well within the norms of the Internet these days .
“ The mainstream Internet user is hugely aware of the fact that the fundamental economic model on the Internet is advertising , ” he said .
While some people object to targeted advertising systems like Google ’s Gmail , which displays ads related to the text of e-mail users are reading , many others do n’t .
“ All we are doing is , in an anonymous format , providing additional context to serve those ads .
To the extent those ads are more meaningful to me as Ted Schremp , I will have a better Internet experience than the generic ads that are part of Yahoo and everything online . ”
For those customers who disagree , Mr. Schremp said that Charter was offering the ability for them to choose not to be part of the system .
I suggested that most privacy experts prefer opt - in systems where information is n’t collected until the user explicitly grants permission .
He said that opt - out has become the norm for all targeting on the Internet .
How much money is NebuAd paying Charter for access to information about its customers ’ surfing behavior ?
Mr. Schremp would n’t say .
( Robert Dykes , NebuAd ’s chief executive , said last month that the company was willing to pay Internet providers several dollars per subscriber a month . )
Mr. Schremp did acknowledge that raising revenue was a main goal for Charter in this : “ We want to leverage technology in a way that makes sense for our economic model . ”

Information
There is information on 875 English and Welsh castles , fortified manor houses , Bishop 's Palaces and Pele towers constructed over the last twenty centuries .
These range from the most impressive and powerful of structures like Dover Castle to worn earthworks that are all that are now left of sites such as Elmley Castle .
There is also information on 300 of the mainly 18th and 19th century coastal forts and gun batteries that can still be seen , mainly around the south coasts of England and Wales .
History
The first stone fortifications were constructed by the Romans in the 1st Century , and they were so well built as at Portchester that many are still standing .
The next wave of castle building started in all the major towns and cities after the Norman invasion and between 1066 and 1200 well over two and a half thousand castles were erected .
Most were simple earth and timber structures and have now either vanished or exist only as a motte , a grassy mound , or earthworks ....... see more fortification & armament history

When his friends got suspended from school sports because of photos showing them drinking from red cups , Dustin Zebro decided to mount a protest of sorts : he invited scores of kids to a kegger party , which got busted by the cops .
But the kids got the last laugh , and here 's why :
Cars lining the street .
A house full of young people .
A keg and drinking games inside .
Police thought they had an underage boozing party on their hands .
But though they made dozens of teens take breath tests , none tested positive for alcohol .
That 's because the keg contained root beer .
The party was held by a high school student who wanted to show that teens do n't always drink alcohol at their parties .

And shock of shock , there 's a YouTube Clip :
There is a game played by CEOs with the corporate issuance of lottery tickets .
Otherwise known as stock .
Stock can be issued in any number of ways , shapes or forms .
Warrants , options , restricted or unrestricted stock .
No matter what you call it , every CEO hired , is asking for equity knowing that their only goal is to hit the jackpot and create a pool of wealth that puts them in the “ fuck you ” wealth category .
Thats enough money to buy or rent just about anything you can think of and put you in position to never have to work again .
You just live off the cash in the bank .
Put another way , every hired CEO is looking to be in a position to look in the mirror , smile and tell themselves they have made it .
They are living the American dream .
The only way to do that is to grab as much equity equivalents as you can and do everything you can to get that stock price up as high as you can while periodically liquidating the stock and stuffing the cash in your bank account .
There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing so .
Any CEO who doesnt take advantage of this golden ticket opportunity is an idiot .
In fact , although I do n’t have actual numbers , I would hazard a guess that more than 95 pct of CEOs hired to run companies with a billion dollar plus public market caps probably do get themselves to the position of having more than 10 mm dollars in equity very quickly .
While those who manage to hold on to their jobs a while and not screw up too bad , can relatively quickly get past the 25 mm dollar in equity mark and reach the 50 mm dollar mark with in 10 years .
Its actually pretty tough to screw up and not get there if you have any brains at all .
Why ?
Because you have the entire Mutual Fund , Hedge Fun and Brokerage industry doing everything they can to get you there .
Think about it .
You ca n’t turn on CNBC or Fox Business without them cheerleading the market to go up .
Every man , woman , child , fund , index or interested party who buys the stock is doing everything they can to get the stock of the company to go higher .
They do n’t really care how you run the company and they care less about the results of the company than they do about the performance of the stock .
Heck , even if they did care , shareholders dont really own anything and have zero say in the company .
If you really dig into it , its the ultimate in social networking .
Everyone who owns the stock belongs to the fan page or group for the stock and they are telling everyone they can how wonderful the company is and why the stock will go up , all while praying it does so .
Its the American way and it works !
Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent every year by brokerages telling every American that the stock market over time will go up 7 pct per year .
All you have to do is diversify and hold onto your stock long enough .
For better or worse , everyone believes it .
With all of that social networking power , call it stocksourcing behind stocks , how can CEOs not get rich ?
The problem with all of this is that there is a huge disconnect between the CEO and shareholders doing well and those who work for the company doing well
Yes , its true , particularly in markets like we are experiencing now , stocks can hit 52 week , or even multi- year lows . ( although more often than not , in spite of low stock prices , market caps have increased ) .
Yes , its true that CEOs see the value of their holdings shrink .
However , unlike lottery tickets whose value goes to zero when you dont hit the number , the CEO equity positions retain their upside and history has shown us that if they go far enough underwater , they will get repriced and / or reissued .
All in the name of keeping the CEO happy .
So while CEOs may get “ less rich ” for awhile , the game is stacked so that a downturn gets them happy real fast when the upturn comes .
The disconnect is that there is a big difference between not making Wall Street happy and not making money .
The pressure from Wall Street is to grow earnings forever .
Not matter what it takes .
This isnt a problem when a company is doing well .
EVeryone is happy .
But when the economy hits a bump like it has now , when the market is hitting a bump and stock prices are declining , like it is now , the pressure comes .
Everyone owning the stock reacts and whats to know what the CEO will do to get the price back up .
This , as they say “ is where the CEO earns their pay ” Unfortunately , what this really means is that everyone who works for that company is at risk .
At risk of losing their jobs , benefits , raises , you name it .
Its at risk .
All of which is a long winded way of saying that employees live in the corporate cash zone , CEOs and the top few in management live in the equity / lottery ticket zone .
Those in the cash zone always take the first hit .
People , places and things that consume cash are the first things to go because cash expenses immediately reduce earnings .
If you or anyone like you consumes cash , unless someone upstairs thinks you generate a straight to the bottom line return on the cash expenditure , you are about to become a corporate ghost .
Your person , place and thing will be memorialized as a cut to increase earnings mentioned in a press release that wall street will cheer and use to push up the stock price .
What makes me sad about all of this is that I really think that in this country if there truly was a connection between shareholders and management , that if given a choice by profitable companies , most of us would choose to hold on to our shares and accept an expanded PE for some period of time in exchange for people keeping their jobs .
I would love to receive an email from a company I own saying something to the effect of :
Dear Shareholder ,
We are facing a very difficult decision that we would like your feedback on .
Our earnings per share last quarter were 20 cents , and for the entire last year , 80 cents .
Because of a downturn in business caused by XYZ factors , we face the choice of making 10 pct less , or cutting headcount and related expenses in order to maintain our earnings and possibly even grow our earnings a couple cents this year .
As a shareholder , we would like to ask you whether you would consider allowing us to retain these valued employees .
We recognize that it would require you accepting a PE multiple 10 pct higher than the current market .
We hope you would be willing to make this concession .
We think that the jobs this will save will return far greater value to shareholders over the long run .
We look forward to your vote .
Personally ,
Im willing to give a higher multiple in exchange for saving people ’s jobs .
At least once .
Unfortunately , this of course is a fantasy that can’t happen in this country .
Which brings us back to CEO Pay .
As long as CEOs live in the equity / lottery ticket zone and employees in the cash zone , CEO pay is going to be outrageous relative to everyone else .
The only possible way to change this is to put CEOs in the cash zone .
Make companies generate 100 pct of their compensation in cash that is 100 pct expensable in the quarter paid .
Thats not to say they cant own stock .
Hell yes they can own stock .
But make them buy it either on the open market , or as part of the programs that make stock available to every company employee , on the same terms .
They are getting paid enough in cash and if they believe in their ability to run the company , they can put their money where their mouth is .
Eliminate all the free lottery tickets .
Make them buy stock , options , warrants , whatever , on the same terms as everyone else can .
Shareholders tend to ignore how much stock is given to management , they do n’t ignore cash .
Companies will always be a lot more stringent with their cash , whether its paid to the CEO or anyone else .
CEO cash compensation will go way up , but total compensation will come way down .
More importantly , CEOs getting paid huge sums in
cash will stand out like a sore thumb when things arent going so well .
They will be treated like everyone else in the cash zone and held far more accountable for their work .
Of course this is all just my opinion , but to me its a good thing for all involved .
The rich can still get richer , but everyone shares in the risk .
We all have the right to pledge allegiance to our country without at the same time making a specific religious statement .
It is also unconscionable to ask any American to remain silent while another American promotes their beliefs with governmental authority .
This is as un-American as you can get .
The Pledge in use today , written by Francis Bellamy in 1892 , was modified by the U.S. congress in 1954 by adding the words “ under God ” and in effect turning it into an unconstitutional public prayer .
There are millions of Americans who believe in God but do not believe they are " under " God .
Some find
God within their own hearts while others believe they are part of -- not under -- a divine power or sacred universe .
Still others do not believe in God at all .
The religious beliefs of these Americans are violated by our government , in schools , in public meetings , or anywhere the Pledge is recited .
Because of a desire to avoid 1st Amendment conflicts , many simply avoid reciting the Pledge .
It was changed before and it can be changed back .
Whether you consider yourself Christian , Muslim , Jewish , Native American , Buddhist , Hindu , Pagan , Atheist , Humanist , etc.... , as Americans we all recognize that the strength of this country is based on its plurality of cultures and beliefs .
True patriotism is not shown by how often you wave the flag or say the Pledge , but by the respect you accord the primary pillar of our democracy , the Constitution of the United States .
Anthony Norton , a junior at the University of Massachusetts in Boston , just learned a tough lesson in economics :
The credit market crisis is spreading to student loans .
Norton thought he was set when he deposited a $ 16,000 student - loan check to pay for summer classes and the fall semester .
But when he started to pay bills for classes , rent , and other expenses last week , his checks bounced .
He was one of 500 students left in the lurch with the April 7 bankruptcy filing of The Education Resources Institute Inc. , a Boston nonprofit that guarantees student loans .
And his ordeal is only the latest example of chaos in the college loan market .
More than 50 firms have abandoned or cut back their federal or private student loan programs this year , unable to raise money in the financial markets .
Yesterday , Citigroup , one of the largest private lenders , said it would stop lending at some schools and end its federal loan consolidations .
While families used to secure student loans almost regardless of their credit history , " Those days are over , " said Tony Erwin , director of financial aid services at Northeastern University in Boston and president of the Massachusetts Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators .
As students and parents begin the process of applying for financial aid and loans for the upcoming school year , Erwin warned , loans are going to be harder to come by and more expensive : " It 's going to be a problem .
There 's no question about it . "
Student loans have been among the easiest and cheapest loans to get - allowing millions of Americans to go to college as long as they promised to pay the bills after graduation .
Given this year 's challenging environment , many colleges are offering more assistance to students , such as more generous grants and direct government - backed loans with capped interest rates , such as Stafford loans .
But many families , especially those paying for private schools , will find that 's not enough .
For example , if a private college costs about $ 45,000 a year , a typical family will have to come up with at least $ 20,000 on their own , whether from loans or savings .
One Raynham mother and human resources executive was so concerned about nailing down private loans for her two sons in college that she applied in March , earlier than usual .
With $ 60,000 in tuition bills due this fall and her husband struggling with cancer , Lynne Tartaglia applied for $ 33,000 in loans from Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority , or MEFA .
She received her approval on March 7 .
Still , Tartaglia was nervous .
So , loan agreement in hand , she contacted MEFA again .
An e-mail she received in response said that Tartaglia had applied too early and that the rates and terms she was promised were not valid for the coming year .
But she hopes they will honor her signed document .
The investigation into a blood thinner suspected in some 19 U.S. deaths is now focusing on the possibility that raw biological ingredients were contaminated even before they reached a factory in China , manufacturer Baxter Healthcare Corp. said Friday .
That raises the prospect that the problem could have occurred somewhere along a supply chain that includes layers of middlemen and originates in pig farms .
Heparin , a generic medication , is derived from a substance in the lining of pig intestines .
The drug is widely used to prevent blood clots from forming during kidney dialysis and cardiac surgery .
The case has reinforced concerns about the quality of Chinese products .
But unlike last year ’s pet food recall , it was frail patients who suffered the ill - effects of the drug contamination .
Nearly 800 patients suffered severe allergic reactions , some life - threatening .
The Food and Drug Administration on Friday announced new testing requirements for all imported heparin .
Manufacturers must agree in advance to undertake sophisticated tests or their shipments will be held at ports of entry for government testing .

FDA officials said they are close to identifying the mysterious look - alike ingredient that contaminated the Baxter heparin and prompted a recall last month .
The substance , which acts much like heparin , could not be detected with conventional tests for drug purity and potency .
Once the contaminant is identified , investigators should be able to tell more about whether it was deliberately added or occurred naturally , or as a result of some problem with processing , FDA Deputy Commissioner Janet Woodcock said .
“ We are very close , ” she said .
“ When we complete that , [ it ] will help our understanding of how it got in . ”
However , pinpointing the source may not be possible if the contamination occurred along the chain of farmers and middlemen who handle the material in China , where the FDA ’s regulatory reach does not extend and where manufacturing standards have been called into question .
Advertisement
FDA officials said they have visited some of the middlemen -- called “ consolidators ” -- to discuss the quality of materials received from slaughterhouses .
Consolidators refine the material and prepare it for shipping to a pharmaceutical facility in Changzhou .
FDA officials said they are trying to arrange with Chinese authorities for additional inspections of the supply chain .
The Illinois - based Baxter said in a news release that the focus of the investigation had turned to the supply chain and to scientifically proving that the contaminant caused the allergic reactions seen in U.S. patients .
“ There are three key questions that we are trying to answer , ” said Norbert G. Riedel , Baxter ’s chief scientist .
“ What exactly is the contaminant , where in the supply chain was it introduced , and can we prove that this contaminant is in fact causing the reactions we ’ve seen ? ”
China is the world ’s leading producer of heparin .
Baxter ’s supplier , Wisconsin - based Scientific Protein Laboratories , is a joint venture partner in the Changzhou facility that produced the tainted heparin .

The FDA failed to inspect the Chinese plant before it started shipping heparin to this country because someone at the agency mixed up the name of the facility with one that had already been inspected .

PUBLISHER’S PREFACE TO THE Liberty Fund EDITION
Socialism , by Ludwig von Mises , was originally published in German under the title
Die Gemeinwirtschaft : Untersuchungen über den Sozialismus ( Jena : Gustav Fischer , 1922 ) .
A few paragraphs and the appendix were added to the second German edition , published by the same firm in 1932 , and a few more paragraphs were included in the first English translation —
Socialism : An Economic and Sociological Analysis , translated by J. Kahane ( London : Jonathan Cape , 1936 ) .
An enlarged edition of the Kahane translation was published in 1951 ( New Haven : Yale University Press ) .
This edition included an epilogue originally published ( and still available ) under the title
Planned Chaos ( Irvington , New York : Foundation for Economic Education , 1947 ) .
This enlarged edition was reprinted by Jonathan Cape ( London ) in 1969 , and is here reprinted again , in 1981 , by Liberty Fund ( Indianapolis ) .
This edition leaves the text as translated by Kahane in 1936 and added to by Mises in 1951 undisturbed .
The present publisher has , however , undertaken to add certain features to aid the contemporary reader .
Translations have been provided for all non-English expressions left untranslated in the Jonathan Cape edition .
These translations appear in parentheses after the expressions or passages in question .
Chapters have been numbered consecutively throughout the book .
All footnotes have been checked against the second German edition .
When works in languages other than English are cited by Mises , information concerning versions in English has been provided when such versions could be located .
The corresponding page references in the English versions are also provided insofar as location of these was possible .
Complete information concerning the English version is provided at the first citation of a given work .
Only the page references in the English are provided in later citations , but full information is easily located in the Index to Works Cited .
All bibliographical information added to the footnotes is clearly labeled as a publisher ’s note .
Having been written in 1922 in Austria and ranging over many fields of learning ,
Socialism contains a number of references to individuals and events with which many readers will not be familiar .
Brief explanations of such references are provided by asterisked footnotes printed below Mises ’ notes and clearly labeled as being added by the publisher .
Such notes also offer explanations quoted from Mises of his special use of a few English terms .
In order to facilitate study of the book , two new indexes have been provided .
An Index to Works Cited lists all books and authors cited in
Socialism .
This index also provides English versions of works cited by Mises in German .
In cases where no English version has been found , a literal translation of the title has been provided .
A general Subject and Name Index is also provided .
Socialism has been available in English for more than forty years and references to it abound in the scholarly literature .
Since Liberty
Fund editions are set in new type , the pagination of this new edition differs from the earlier ones .
We have , therefore , indicated the pagination of the expanded edition of 1951 in the margins of the Liberty Fund edition .
The pagination of all previous English language editions was the same from pages 15 through 521 .
In the enlarged edition of 1951 , a Preface was added as pages 13 - 14 , and the Epilogue was added as pages 522-592 .
By placing the pagination of the 1951 edition in the margins of our edition , we provide a guide to the location of citations of all earlier English editions .
The publisher wishes to acknowledge with thanks the aid of several persons who helped with this edition .
The many aids to study and understanding offered in this edition are due primarily to the work of Bettina Bien Greaves of the Foundation for Economic Education .
She performed the monumental task of checking the footnotes against the second German edition .
She also undertook the equally difficult task of providing most of the citations to English language versions of works cited in German .
She provided most of the material for the asterisked explanations of unfamiliar references .
She also did most of the work of preparing the new indexes .
If this edition is more easily studied by contemporary readers , most of the credit should go to Mrs. Greaves .
For aid with translations from Greek , the publisher acknowledges the help of Professors Perry E. Gresham and Burton Thurston of Bethany College .
For help with Latin translations , Professor Gresham must be acknowledged again along with Father Laut of Wheeling College .
Percy L. Greaves , Jr. , of Dobbs Ferry , New York , provided translations from French .
Professor H. D. Brueckner of Pomona College provided aid with locating translations and citations of Kant .

In 1869 Prince - Smith had noted the fact that the socialist ideas had found supporters among employers .
He mentions that amongst business men , “ however strange this may sound , there are some who understand their own activity in the national economy with so little clarity that they hold the socialist ideas as more or less founded , and , consequently , have a bad conscience really , as if they had to admit to themselves that their profits were actually made at the cost of their workmen .
This makes them timid and even more muddled .
It is very bad .
For our economic civilization would be seriously threatened if its bearers could not draw , from the feeling of complete justification , the courage to defend its foundations with the utmost resolution . ”
( Prince - Smith’s
Gesammelte Schriften [ Berlin , 1877 ] , vol. 1 , p. 362 . )
Prince - Smith , however , would not have known how to discuss the socialist theories critically .
19 .
The term “ liberalism ” is used by Mises “ in the sense attached to it everywhere in the nineteenth century and still today in the countries of continental Europe .
This usage is imperative because there is simply no other term available to signify the great political and intellectual movement that substituted free enterprise and the market economy for the precapitalistic methods of production ; constitutional representative government for the absolutism of kings or oligarchies ; and freedom of all individuals for slavery , serfdom , and other forms of bondage . ”

It is a fine irony of history that even Marx suffered this fate .
Untermann finds that “ even the mental life of typical proletarian thinkers of the Marxist school ” contains “ remains of past epochs of thought , if only in rudimentary form .
These rudiments will appear all the stronger the more the thought stages lived through before the thinker became Marxist were passed in a bourgeois or feudal milieu .
This was notoriously so with Marx , Engels , Plekhanov , Kautsky , Mehring , and other prominent Marxists ” ( Untermann ,
Die logischen Mängel des engeren Marxismus [ Munich , 1910 ] , p. 125 ) .
And De Man believes that to understand “ the individuality and variety of the theories ” one would have to consider , besides the thinker ’s general social background , also his own economic and social life — a “ bourgeois ” life … “ in the case of the college - trained Marx ” ( De Man ,

However , he later came to prefer the term “ praxeology , ” derived from the Greek
praxis , meaning action , habit or practice .
In his “ Foreword ” to
Epistemological Problems of Economics ( Princeton : Van Nostrand , 1960 ; New York : NYU Press , 1981 ) , he commented on his use of the term “ sociology ” in a 1929 essay included in that volume : “… in 1929 , I still believed that it was unnecessary to introduce a new term to signify the general theoretical science of human action as distinguished from the historical studies dealing with human action performed in the past .
I thought that it would be possible to employ for this purpose the term
sociology , which in the opinion of some authors was designed to signify such a general theoretical science .
Only later did I realize that this was not expedient and adopted the term praxeology . ” ( Pub . )

Who does n’t want to have a sharp mind ?
Having a sharp mind is something we all want .
I recently read a thought - provoking article about it entitled Cognitive Fitness in Harvard Business Review .
The article talks about how the minds of people like Warren Buffet and Alan Greenspan stay sharp even in their old age .
What is the secret ?
The secret is brain workout .
They exercise their brain continuously and that makes their minds sharp .
One way to exercise your brain is playing :
Play engages the prefrontal cortex , responsible for your highest - level cognitive functions – including self - knowledge , memory , mental imagery , and incentive and reward processing …
Activities like bridge , chess , sudoku , role - playing games , and challenging crossword puzzles all provide rigorous neural workouts .
Looking at myself , I must admit that I do not play as much as I should .
So I went around the web and searched for places where I can play games to have fun and exercise my brain .
What I want are places where I can play for free and – whenever possible – play alone without having to find partners first .
This way I can easily exercise my mind whenever I want .
Here I would like to share what I found along with resources to help you play those games better .
But , first of all , here are some tips to get the most out of the games :
Set aside time to play
Though not everyday , you need to allocate time to play .
This is not just playing anyway ; this is time investment to sharpen your mind .
Start with a game you are familiar with
If you found it difficult to understand how to play a game , you might not be motivated to play .
So start with the games you are familiar with .
This way you can soon train your brain without being distracted by the game rules .
Choose a new game later
After you have played a game quite often , you should try a new game .
It gives your brain a different kind of training that enriches it .
Increase the level of difficulty
Just like you should increase the weight you use in weight training to build your muscles , you should also increase the difficulty of the games you play to build your brain muscles .
This way you stretch your mind beyond its current boundary .
With those tips in mind , here are 10 free mind games to exercise your brain :

Want to start a startup ?
Get funded by Y Combinator .
April 2008
Umair Haque wrote recently that the reason there are n't more Googles is that most startups get bought before they can change the world .
Google , despite serious interest from Microsoft and Yahoo — what must have seemed like lucrative interest at the time — did n't sell out .
Google might simply have been nothing but Yahoo's or MSN 's search box .
Why is n't it ?
Because Google had a deeply felt sense of purpose : a conviction to change the world for the better .
This has a nice sound to it , but it is n't true .
Google 's founders were willing to sell early on .
They just wanted more than acquirers were willing to pay .
It was the same with Facebook .
They would have sold , but Yahoo blew it by offering too little .
Tip for acquirers : when a startup turns you down , consider raising your offer , because there 's a good chance the outrageous price they want will later seem a bargain . [ 1 ]
From the evidence I 've seen so far , startups that turn down acquisition offers usually end up doing better .
Not always , but usually there 's a bigger offer coming , or perhaps even an IPO .
Of course , the reason startups do better when they turn down acquisition offers is not necessarily that all such offers undervalue startups .
More likely the reason is that the kind of founders who have the balls to turn down a big offer also tend to be very successful .
That spirit is exactly what you want in a startup .
While I 'm sure Larry and Sergey do want to change the world , at least now , the reason Google survived to become a big , independent company is the same reason Facebook has so far remained independent : acquirers underestimated them .
Corporate M&A is a strange business in that respect .
They consistently lose the best deals , because turning down reasonable offers is the most reliable test you could invent for whether a startup will make it big .
VCs
So what 's the real reason there are n't more Googles ?
Curiously enough , it 's the same reason Google and Facebook have remained independent : money guys undervalue the most innovative startups .
The reason there are n't more Googles is not that investors encourage innovative startups to sell out , but that they wo n't even fund them .
I 've learned a lot about VCs during the 3 years we 've been doing Y Combinator , because we often have to work quite closely with them .
The most surprising thing I 've learned is how conservative they are .
VC firms present an image of boldly encouraging innovation .
Only a handful actually do , and even they are more conservative in reality than you 'd guess from reading their sites .
I used to think of VCs as piratical : bold but unscrupulous .
On closer acquaintance they turn out to be more like bureaucrats .
They 're more upstanding than I used to think ( the good ones , at least ) , but less bold .
Maybe the VC industry has changed .
Maybe they used to be bolder .
But I suspect it 's the startup world that has changed , not them .
The low cost of starting a startup means the average good bet is a riskier one , but most existing VC firms still operate as if they were investing in hardware startups in 1985 .
Howard Aiken said " Do n't worry about people stealing your ideas .
If your ideas are any good , you 'll have to ram them down people 's throats . "
I have a similar feeling when I 'm trying to convince VCs to invest in startups Y Combinator has funded .
They 're terrified of really novel ideas , unless the founders are good enough salesmen to compensate .
But it 's the bold ideas that generate the biggest returns .
Any really good new idea will seem bad to most people ; otherwise someone would already be doing it .
And yet most VCs are driven by consensus , not just within their firms , but within the VC community .
The biggest factor determining how a VC will feel about your startup is how other VCs feel about it .
I doubt they realize it , but this algorithm guarantees they 'll miss all the very best ideas .
The more people who have to like a new idea , the more outliers you lose .
Whoever the next Google is , they 're probably being told right now by VCs to come back when they have more " traction . "
Why are VCs so conservative ?
It 's probably a combination of factors .
The large size of their investments makes them conservative .
Plus they 're investing other people 's money , which makes them worry they 'll get in trouble if they do something risky and it fails .
Plus most of them are money guys rather than technical guys , so they do n't understand what the startups they 're investing in do .
What 's Next
The exciting thing about market economies is that stupidity equals opportunity .
And so it is in this case .
There is a huge , unexploited opportunity in startup investing .
Y Combinator funds startups at the very beginning .
VCs will fund them once they 're already starting to succeed .
But between the two there is a substantial gap .
There are companies that will give $ 20 k to a startup that has nothing more than the founders , and there are companies that will give $ 2 million to a startup that 's already taking off , but there are n't enough investors who will give $ 200 k to a startup that seems very promising but still has some things to figure out .
This territory is occupied mostly by individual angel investors — people like Andy Bechtolsheim , who gave Google $ 100 k when they seemed promising but still had some things to figure out .
I like angels , but there just are n't enough of them , and investing is for most of them a part time job .
And yet as it gets cheaper to start startups , this sparsely occupied territory is becoming more and more valuable .
Nowadays a lot of startups do n't want to raise multi-million dollar series A rounds .
They do n't need that much money , and they do n't want the hassles that come with it .
The median startup coming out of Y Combinator wants to raise $ 250 - 500k .
When they go to VC firms they have to ask for more because they know VCs are n't interested in such small deals .
VCs are money managers .
They 're looking for ways to put large sums to work .
But the startup world is evolving away from their current model .
Startups have gotten cheaper .
That means they want less money , but also that there are more of them .
So you can still get large returns on large amounts of money ; you just have to spread it more broadly .
I 've tried to explain this to VC firms .
Instead of making one $ 2 million investment , make five $ 400 k investments .
Would that mean sitting on too many boards ?
Do n't sit on their boards .
Would that mean too much due diligence ?
Do less .
If you 're investing at a tenth the valuation , you only have to be a tenth as sure .
It seems obvious .
But I 've proposed to several VC firms that they set aside some money and designate one partner to make more , smaller bets , and they react as if I 'd proposed the partners all get nose rings .
It 's remarkable how wedded they are to their standard m.o .
But there is a big opportunity here , and one way or the other it 's going to get filled .
Either VCs will evolve down into this gap or , more likely , new investors will appear to fill it .
That will be a good thing when it happens , because these new investors will be compelled by the structure of the investments they make to be ten times bolder than present day VCs .
And that will get us a lot more Googles .
At least , as long as acquirers remain stupid .
Notes
[ 1 ] Another tip :
If you want to get all that value , do n't destroy the startup after you buy it .
Give the founders enough autonomy that they can grow the acquisition into what it would have become .

Phones distract drivers say experts
A company is banning its drivers from using hands - free mobile phone devices , citing research that says using them is as dangerous as drink driving .
Is that right ?
It 's the UK's largest transport company and from January FirstGroup is banning its 135,000 - strong workforce from speaking hands - free on the phone while behind the wheel .
Driving with mobile phones was banned in the UK in 2003 , but it 's not illegal to use a hands - free kit .
FirstGroup says it 's banning the devices in response to the " growing body of evidence " against them .
In particular , research that suggests it 's easier to drive drunk than to drive while using a phone , even when it 's hands - free .
Is that right ?
THE ANSWER
Research has found drivers using hands - free devices have slower reaction times than those under the influence of alcohol
According to a study by the Transport Research Laboratory ( TRL ) drivers are four times more likely to have an accident while using any mobile phone .
Reaction times were slower than those under the influence of alcohol and it found the risk of an accident was raised for up to 10 minutes after a hands - free call had been made , suggesting a driver remained preoccupied long after a call ended .
" Drivers found it easier to drive drunk than to drive while using a phone , even when it was hands - free , " says a TRL spokesman .
Constant demand
" Driving behaviour while talking on a phone is not only worse than normal driving , it can also be described as dangerous .
Drivers need to be strongly discouraged from engaging in any phone use while behind the wheel . "
An earlier TRL report also concluded drivers using mobile phones , including those with hands - free equipment , were also less able to maintain a constant speed and found it more difficult to keep a safe distance from the car in front .
In the tests at 70 mph , the braking distance was 102ft ( 31 m ) , which increased to 115 ft ( 35 m ) with alcohol ; 128 ft ( 39 m ) with a hands - free phone and 148 ft ( 45 m ) with a hand - held mobile .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
While some argue speaking hands - free is no more of a distraction than talking to a passenger , other research suggests they are little better than hand - held phones .
Several studies have found it is the increased demands on the brain involved in holding a conversation on a phone - whether hand - held or hands - free - that 's the real danger while driving , not handling of the device .
If a person is in a car they are aware of the pressures on the driver at any given moment and regulate conversation levels to allow them to concentrate .
However , someone at the other end of the phone cannot see road conditions and make such adjustments , say researchers .
" The danger with a conversation on a mobile is that it psychologically removes you from the vehicle , " says Cris Burgess , an expert on driving behaviour .
It 's the same if you are holding the phone or using a hands - free kit , he says .
The government has expressed concerns over hands - free kits .
It has stopped short of banning them but they could still get you into trouble with the law .
" Hands - free phones are a distraction and you risk prosecution for not having proper control of a vehicle if the police see you driving poorly while using one , " says the Department for Transport 's ( DfT ) .
Stephen Harper equates criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism .
" Unfortunately , Israel at 60 remains a country under threat – threatened by those groups and regimes who deny to this day its right to exist , " he told a Toronto celebration marking the anniversary .
" And why ?
Look beyond the thinly veiled rationalizations :
Because they hate Israel , just as they hate the Jewish people . "
Many groups and regimes , such as Hamas , Hezbollah and Iran , do deny Israel 's right to exist .
But not all others do so solely for the reasons cited by Harper .
Some hold back recognition as a negotiating tool in the Palestinian dispute .
The Prime Minister also told radio station CFRB : " My fear is what I see happening in some circles is anti-Israeli sentiment , really just as a thinly disguised veil for good old - fashioned anti-Semitism . "
He added that he saw anti-Semitic sentiments during the 2006 Israeli invasion of Lebanon among " some elements in our political system , even some Members of Parliament . "
On Friday , Bob Rae , Liberal foreign affairs critic , asked in the Commons as to which MPs the Prime Minister was referring .
Rae did not get an answer .
One wonders what Harper would make of those Israelis , as well as Jewish Canadians and others , who do strongly support Israel but also question some Israeli policies .
What would he say about the Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians ?
This newly formed umbrella organization of 23 groups , critical of some Israeli policies , obviously does not " hate Israel , " or " hate the Jewish people . "
Harper 's position is designed to silence and delegitimize even the mildest criticism of Israeli policies .
It 's an undemocratic formulation that the Israelis themselves would reject .
There 's a sturdy debate in Israel on all aspects of its policies in the Occupied Territories .
In Rae 's words , Harper is saying , " there 's a very close association between being anti-Israel and being anti-Semitic ...
I do n't think it 's fair to say that everybody who has or expresses concerns about Israeli foreign policy is anti-Semitic .
" If that were true , three - quarters of the population of Israel would be anti-Semitic . "
Harper 's comments came the same day as the Israeli ambassador to Canada , Alan Baker , told the Globe and Mail and later CTV News that growing Muslim communities in France , Britain and Scandinavia have had an impact on the foreign policies of those nations and that he " fears " the same in Canada .
The 2001 census put the number of Muslims at 580,000 and of Jewish Canadians at 330,000 .
Baker : " Do you expect from these greater numbers that they will absorb themselves into Canadian society as Canadians or that they 'll try to push Canadians to adopt their own values and principles ? "
What values ?
That they may exercise their democratic right to lobby their own government ?
Baker also complained that he or other Israelis speaking on university campuses may face demonstrations or be prevented from speaking , as happened to Ehud Barak in 2004 at Concordia University .
First , that Montreal cancellation was much criticized .
Second , Baker did not say when and where he was prevented from speaking .

There 's an ongoing debate in Canada over when freedom of speech crosses the line into hate .
The argument gets played out in universities over Israel Apartheid Week .
Despite pressure to cancel it , the universities of Toronto , York and Ryerson have opted for academic freedom but McMaster axed the event .
Baker singled out " a Muslim Member of Parliament , " Omar Alghabra , as having been " outspoken in his hostility toward Israel . "
Later , he called Alghabra 's views " less than friendly , " without citing any statement by the MP .
" I 've got nothing against the fact that Muslims are members of the Canadian Parliament .
But it worries me that the type of political influence that we 're seeing in Britain , in France , might ultimately reach the Canadian political system . "
Baker seems to want what Harper wants : Pro-Israeli voices should be heard loud and clear , but those who might question this or that policy of Israel should be silenced .
This is not how Canada works .
All groups , regardless of their religion , race or ethnicity , are free to speak , and the government of Canada makes foreign policy decisions in the interest of all Canadians .
Canada is not Israel where Israeli Arabs are second - class citizens .
For all of Baker 's nervousness , our foreign policy has been pro-Israeli dating back to Paul Martin in 2004 .
Harper has just made it more so .
Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion and Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day have done well to call Baker 's comments inappropriate .
Carl Rosenberg of Vancouver , a regular reader of this column , was so angry with Baker that he emailed me the following :
" Canada 's policy on the Middle East should be debated on its own merits , without resorting to obnoxious statements about the demographics of one or another religious or ethnic community ...
I wonder what the response would be if an ambassador to Canada from any one of several Arab states were to express concern about the impact of Jewish Canadians on Canada 's Middle East policy ? "
We 'd tell them to mind their own business and not interfere in Canadian affairs .

As Clinton releases ' bitter ' ad , spokeman claims campaign has been ' civil ' Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday April 15 , 2008

Print This Email This Hillary Clinton 's campaign team rarely passes up an opportunity to remind reporters how badly they are being outspent in the ad wars leading up to next week 's Pennsylvania primary .
For the last few days , Clinton and her supporters have taken just about every opportunity they can to criticize Barack Obama 's remark that small - town voters " cling to " cultural issues because they are " bitter . "
Team Clinton is taking that message to the airwaves now , with a new television ad it is purchasing in the Keystone State featuring supporters criticizing Obama over the remarks .
Although they are being outspent two - to - one by Obama , his remarks at a San Francisco fundraiser , which were reported last week , have become an " an important issue in this race because he said them , " campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said Tuesday .
The new ad features five Clinton supporters saying they were " insulted " by an " out of touch " Obama .
At an April 6 fundraiser , Obama was speaking about the challenges of reaching voters who have fallen on hard times over the last 25 years .
" So it 's not surprising then that they get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations , " he said .
Since the comments were reported , Obama has apologized if his phrasing offended anyone , but he 's stood by the general sentiment , which has been much explored in Democratic circles .
Clinton has criticized Obama at length over the comments before unveiling the new ad Tuesday .
" The issues raised in the ad are important issues , " Wolfson said .
" They believe Sen. Obama condescended to them . "
Clinton 's ad buy follows a similar effort from Obama , who unveiled his own ad Monday featuring Pennsylvania Sen .
Bob Casey , a prominent Obama supporter .
Although the Obama ad does n't mention his comments directly , Casey decries the " political games and division that stops anything from getting done , " in an indirect jab at Clinton 's incessant criticism .
Asked by one reporter whether the latest Clinton effort would spark a " death spiral " that could damage the Democratic party , Wolfson predicted Democrats would be able to come together to support the eventual nominee .
" This has been a relatively mild campaign , " he said .
" Both candidates have focused on issues ; it has been relatively civil . "
While the flap over Obama 's comments nearly monopolized campaign coverage since they were first reported , indicators are beginning to emerge that the criticism is doing little to damage his standing in the state primary .
A Quinnipiac pool showed no change in voters opinion after the comments were reported , and a Survey USA poll conducted since the flap showed similar results .
Clinton continues to lead in both polls , and the numbers seem to have stabilized since Obama began to gain ground about a week ago .
This ad was unveiled Tuesday from Clinton 's campaign :

Gorbachev : US Imperialists could start new Cold War
By Adrian Blomfield and Mike Smith in Paris
Mikhail Gorbachev has accused the United States of mounting an imperialist conspiracy against Russia that could push the world into a new Cold War .
With Dmitry Medvedev due to be inaugurated today as Russian president , the Soviet Union ’s last leader said that the White House ’s claims of peaceful intentions towards its former superpower rival could no longer be trusted .
Delivering one of his most scathing attacks on the US , Mr Gorbachev told The Daily Telegraph that a US military build - up was under way to contain a resurgent Russia .
From Nato ’s expansion plans in the former Soviet Union to Washington ’s proposals for a bigger defence budget and a missile shield in central Europe , the US was deliberately quashing hopes for permanent peace with Russia , Mr Gorbachev said .
“ We had 10 years after the Cold War to build a new world order and yet we squandered them , ” he said .
“ The United States can not tolerate anyone acting independently .
“ Every US president has to have a war . ”
The 1990 Nobel Peace Prize winner ’s denunciation of the US mirrors the most belligerently anti-Western speeches of Vladimir Putin – who is said to consult Mr Gorbachev on foreign policy matters .
Mr Putin may be switching jobs to become prime minister , but many expect him to remain the most powerful figure in Russian politics .
Mr Gorbachev hinted that the former KGB spy could still direct Russia ’s foreign policy , leaving President Medvedev – seen by some as more liberal than his mentor – to concentrate on internal matters .
Yet if Washington blames Mr Putin ’s self - aggrandising rhetoric for the worst crisis in East - West relations since the Cold War , for Mr Gorbachev the blame lies entirely with the administration of President George W Bush .
“ The problem is not with Russia , ” he said , speaking at a friend ’s château outside Paris .
“ Russia does not have enemies and Putin is not going to start a war against the United States or any other country for that matter .
“ Yet we see the United States approving a military budget and the defence secretary pledging to strengthen conventional forces because of the possibility of a war with China or Russia .
“ I sometimes have a feeling that the United States is going to wage war against the entire world . ”
Last year , Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , told a congressional committee that America needed to boost military spending to counter myriad threats including the “ uncertain paths of China and Russia ” .
Those comments caused uproar in Russia , with pro-Kremlin newspapers claiming they heralded the start of a new Cold War .
Tensions have already been heightened by a US proposal to build a missile defence shield in Poland and the Czech Republic to counter a nuclear strike by Iran .
Mr Gorbachev , however , claimed the plans were an aggressive act against Russia .
“ Erecting elements of missile defence is taking the arms race to the next level , ” he said .
“ It is a very dangerous step . ”
Relations have further deteriorated after Nato promised eventual membership to Georgia and Ukraine , a move interpreted by Mr Gorbachev as an attempt to extend America ’s sphere of influence into Russia ’s backyard .
“ The Americans promised that Nato would n’t move beyond the boundaries of Germany after the Cold War but now half of central and eastern Europe are members , so what happened to their promises ?
It shows they can not be trusted . ”
For a man hailed as one of the heroes of the 20th century , Mr Gorbachev , now 77 , often sounded like the ageing hardliners he struggled against in the Kremlin during the 1980s .
He railed against a “ military - industrial complex ” that he insisted was the “ real government ” of the US and , quoting a Russian documentary on state television , suggested that Margaret Thatcher had supplied weapons to Chechen terrorists .
Still , while Mr Gorbachev may be delighted by the rebirth of what many see as Russian imperialism , many wonder whether he approves of the way in which Mr Putin has eroded freedom of expression to such an extent that some claim glasnost is dead .
“ I do not think that glasnost is dead in Russia , ” he said .
“ There is a phenomenon in the West to criticise Putin ’s domestic record .
But in Russia he has mass support .
His popularity ratings are 70 to 80 percent .
“ Is this not democracy ? ”
Enlarge By Brian Harkin for USA TODAY American Airlines flight attendants Judie Merrill , left , and Kitty Marie Kolz practice CPR .
American says its jets have more oxygen and medications for seizures and diabetes than the FAA requires .
The death of an American Airlines passenger during a flight from Haiti to New York last month has cast a spotlight on the growing number of medical emergencies on commercial jets , a trend that largely has escaped public notice because airlines are n't required to report such incidents .
The clearest picture of the problem comes from MedAire , an Arizona - based company that provides emergency medical advice to airlines that carry nearly half of the 768 million passengers on U.S. flights each year .
A MedAire analysis , done at USA TODAY 's request , indicates the rate of medical emergencies aboard commercial flights nearly doubled from 2000 to 2006 , from 19 to 35 per 1 million passengers .
SURVEY : Share what you know about in - flight emergencies with USA TODAY YOUR VIEW :
How should in - flight emergencies be handled ?
The increasing rate of medical incidents , health and aviation analysts say , partly reflects a collision of two factors : •
The rising number of older passengers as the 79 million baby boomers begin entering retirement but continue traveling habits established when they were younger .
•
Flights that go farther and last longer than was typical several years ago .
In a sample of 11 airlines served by MedAire , the average length of a flight rose from 1,233 miles in 2000 to 1,347 miles in 2006 .
Medical crises are the force behind a rising number of emergency landings , says Joan Sullivan Garrett , MedAire 's chairman .
" If you are ill , an airplane is the worst place to be , " says David Stempler , president of the Air Travelers Association .
" You are trapped at 35,000 feet . "
Airlines and industry groups such as the Air Transport Association have mostly resisted revealing details about medical emergencies , saying such information is hard to collect and can be misinterpreted .
And because airlines are n't required to file such reports , more is known about in - flight emergencies involving animals than humans .
The Department of Transportation requires airlines to report animals ' deaths on commercial flights ; last year there were 14 , the DOT says .
The death of Carine Desir on an American Airlines flight from Haiti to New York on Feb. 22 raised questions about how airlines handle medical emergencies .
Desir 's family has questioned whether the airline responded quickly enough with oxygen to save her .
The airline says its own review of the incident found the crew did all it could to help Desir .
The New York medical examiner later found Desir died from complications of heart disease and diabetes .
MedAire says passengers with diabetes , seizure disorders and heart and respiratory ailments account for 23 % of in - flight deaths and 29 % of medically related flight diversions .
A USA TODAY analysis based on a variety of sources offers a fuller picture of in - flight medical incidents : •
There are more deaths from in - flight medical emergencies than from airline accidents .
Since Jan. 1 , 2003 , there have been 95 passenger fatalities from airline accidents , according to the National Transportation Safety Board .
MedAire reports that 219 passengers have died on the U.S. flights it analyzed during the same period .
The company says the actual number is probably much higher because it tracks fewer than half of all U.S. airlines .
•
In cases in which MedAire had information about the age of passengers with medical emergencies , those 51 and older accounted for 83 % of 63 in - flight deaths in 2006 .
That age group accounted for 59 % of 550 medical - related flight diversions in 2006 .
• Airline industry trade groups such as the Air Transport Association ( ATA ) and the Regional Airline Association say in - flight medical emergencies are rare .
But USA TODAY found it is common for emergency personnel to meet a plane carrying a sick passenger .
The newspaper obtained 911 dispatch data from 10 agencies that operate major airports .
Eight agencies reported that crews were sent to help a very sick passenger at least once a week .
The airports include some of the nation 's busiest , such as Los Angeles International and Dallas - Fort Worth International .
• Medical emergencies can affect safety .
The newspaper found 559 reports filed from 1998 to 2006 into a NASA safety incident database where crews logged events concerning in - flight illnesses .
In 25 % of the cases , crews said responding to medical emergencies led to abnormal flying situations , such as diverted jets landing overweight because of excess fuel and sometimes blowing tires , or getting approval to fly faster than regulations allow .
• Communication difficulties sometimes make it difficult for doctors on the ground to help passengers in distress .
Because airlines removed many phones from cabins and secured cockpit doors after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , information usually has to be relayed by intercom from the back of a plane to the pilots , who then pass it along to doctors on the ground .
Not being able to communicate directly with flight attendants or others at the side of a stricken passenger makes it harder for doctors on land to give timely advice , says David Streitwieser , MedAire 's medical director .
He supervises a team of emergency physicians at a call center in Phoenix .
" With chest pain , it 's almost impossible to do with any certainty . "
Some airlines are using satellite radios on flights over the Pacific Ocean and putting headsets in the cabin that flight attendants can use to speak with doctors on the ground , Garrett says .
Medical specialists say a key to ensuring adequate care aboard commercial flights is having a complete picture of what incidents are occurring among passengers .
Collecting such data is important from a public health standpoint , says David McKenas , former medical director for American Airlines .
" Data surveillance is key in trying to reduce disease in any kind of environment , and airlines just happen to be one unique environment . "
Russell Rayman , executive director of the Aerospace Medical Association , the primary medical advisers to the airlines , says he has tried to create a database of medical emergencies , but airlines have not cooperated .
" Airlines do n't want to tell anybody about their medical problems in flight , " he says .
" There is no public affairs value in that at all . "
Airlines resist disclosure
In September , USA TODAY sent a survey to every major airline 's chief executive officer — a total of 60 — asking them how often in - flight medical emergencies occur , how many passengers die and how the airlines train and equip crews to deal with such emergencies .
A few airlines responded : Express Jet , Sun Country and Virgin Atlantic gave some details on the number of medical emergencies they experienced , how they train flight attendants , and the equipment they carry on board beyond federal requirements .
Then the ATA , the industry 's trade association , stepped in .
" Nobody is going to complete the survey , " spokesman David Castelveter said .
" We 've spoken with them about it , and that is where we are going to draw the line . "
Through the ATA , airlines collectively described their reasons for not releasing information : " Data are not kept in this format ; records are not readily accessible ; information is proprietary or protected by privacy policies ; or time and resource constraints prevent us from preparing a meaningful response . "
The industry 's stance often has made it difficult for families of those who die during flights to determine what happened , says Craig Goldenfarb , a lawyer in West Palm Beach , Fla. , who is representing a family in a suit against US Airways .
Court records have become a key source of information about in - flight medical emergencies .
Some families have alleged that automated external defibrillators ( AEDs ) failed to function properly .
Such devices shock a quivering heart back to a normal beat .
Each airline must equip its planes with working AEDs , but federal rules allow jets with inoperable ones to make a few flights until a replacement can be found .
The Federal Aviation Administration requires various medical equipment , medication and training for all carriers .
Besides oxygen and AEDs , required supplies range from bandages and gloves to aspirin and heart medications .
Some airlines — including American , Virgin Atlantic , British Airways and Qantas — say they provide more than the minimum .
American , for example , carries drugs not required by the FAA — but called for by doctors who have come to the aid of passengers on flights — to treat seizures , diabetes and persistent vomiting .
American also says it provides more portable oxygen bottles than required .
The most common medical crisis in flight is neurological , which can range from a fainting spell to a seizure to a stroke .
Last year there were 5,837 calls about neurological emergencies to MedAire , and those led to 266 emergency diversions .
Sometimes pilots are close enough to their destination airport — or they think that a suitable airport with qualified medical help is too far away — so they determine that continuing the scheduled flight is the best option .
A pilot 's decision on whether to divert his aircraft in an emergency can be one of life and death , says Enrique Leira , assistant professor of neurology at the University of Iowa College of Medicine .
Leira has taught new pilots what questions to ask flight attendants to determine quickly whether a passenger has had a fainting spell or a stroke that needs immediate intervention to save the brain .
He says having more data from airlines would help " improve outcomes . "
Doctors know that the airline cabin causes a strain on the body , one that healthy people tolerate without much difficulty .
Cabin air can be very dry .
People in fragile health can become dehydrated .
The airline cabin is pressurized , but it is a lower air pressure than at sea level , meaning less oxygen reaches the brain .
" The in - flight environment is plausibly more conducive to stroke than on the ground , " Leira says .
But without data , he says , it 's impossible to say for sure .
Defending the airlines Stempler says passengers have to take some responsibility to ensure they 're fit to fly , making sure , for example , that their medications are within reach .
Chris Chiames , a former US Airways executive who heads the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Association in Washington , D.C. , defends the airlines .
" The reality is , airlines are doing a better job responding to medical emergencies than any other segment of the community , " Chiames says .
" Airlines have thousands of people trained in first aid and CPR .
They have equipment nearby .
They are actually a role model here . "
Linda Campbell , a nurse , has worked at American Airlines for more than a decade , pulling together information about medical emergencies from pilots , flight attendants and passengers .
She says the data are used to help train and equip flight attendants .
During a crisis , she says , crews " ca n't call 911 .
They are 911 . "
Shawn Lynn , who recently retired from American Airlines , celebrated a 10 - year anniversary last month .
On Feb. 18 , 1998 , she was the first U.S. airline flight attendant to save a passenger on a jet with an AED .
The airline has saved 81 lives since then .
Lynn notes that a crew is alerted to a medical emergency by four rings of the aircraft 's chime .
" When you hear the four bells , it 's a sobering moment , " she says .
" We have to continue to train and keep up on current medical procedures .
Saving one life is worth it . "

I wonder how we would react if 50,000 of us got killed in one whack , as apparently has happened in the China earthquake .
Or , God forbid , 121,000 , which is the high estimate for the number of dead in the Myanmar cyclone .
Judging from our reaction to the terror attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , which claimed 3,000 lives , I suspect we would go nuts .
Back in 2001 , it became Terror Week on television , so that we got to see the damage endless numbers of times .
Politicians were scrambling for flag pins and trying to remember the words of the national anthem .
Hardly a family pet could be buried without the TV cameras and the mayor showing up .
The president said it was our patriotic duty to spend money and then declared world war on terrorists everywhere , even though the 9/11 attackers had nothing to do with the others .
I infuriated one of the TV talkie boys one night .
I accused him of being fearmonger because he was ranting about the ever - present menace of terrorism .
I pointed out that while terrorists had killed 3,000 Americans , 17,000 had killed themselves in falls , 15,000 had been murdered by homegrown criminals and 109,000 died in accidents .
He shouted and hung up .
Never let the news media set your priorities for things to worry about .
They will be hopelessly wrong .
Any one American ’s chances of being killed by a terrorist is minuscule .
The only thing you have to do to protect yourself from a bomb is be somewhere else , and in a country of 3 million square miles , the odds are that most of us will be somewhere else .
There is no worldwide network of terrorists .
Al - Qaida is the only group we have to worry about , and it is small and not very influential .
Hamas , Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad have no quarrel with us .
Their quarrel is with Israel .
Colombia ’s terrorists are trying to overthrow the Colombian government , and that goes for most guerrilla organizations in the world .
A sensible administration would have taken out Osama bin Laden a long time ago .
It ’s pretty embarrassing when you can’t find a guy who is 6 feet 6 inches tall in a country where most people are short .
We need to develop some stoicism , because it is possible that we could lose a large number of people .
A powerful earthquake in Los Angeles or San Francisco at rush hour could kill a good number of people .
We ’re 30 minutes from 150 million people dead as long as nuclear missiles sit in silos in Russia and China .
The most stupidly dangerous thing this administration has done is allow our relations with Russia to deteriorate .
When the Russians needed our help , we tried to exploit them instead .
Now they have become an energy superpower and have little or no use for us .
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin proved to be a smarter man and a better leader than George W. Bush .
Russia ’s economy is booming ; ours is in decline .
Russia is energy - independent ; we are desperately dependent on energy imports .
Russia ’s power and influence are on the rise ; ours are in decline .
That ’s what happens when we vote jovial dullards into office who surround themselves with ideologues .
Other than throw out a couple of baseballs , what has Bush done right ?
I ca n’t think of anything .
I ’m not excited about any of the possible replacements .
I just pray that whichever one it is will have more brains and less arrogance than the present occupant .
Forgive me for sounding cynical , but I ’ve been listening to politicians promise to solve these same problems for 40 years , and the problems have all gotten worse , not better .

Satellite provider OnSat recently shut off internet service to the Navajo nation , leaving the entire reservation without access vital to education , government , and other services .
OnSat claims it did so because the federal government failed to pay about $ 2 million it owed , which OnSat in turn pays to a subcontractor for satellite time .
Snip :
The Universal Service Administration Co. , which administers the E- rate program , is withholding the funding because of a tribal audit that showed OnSat may have double - billed the tribe .
The audit also raised questions about how the tribe requested bids for the Internet contract .
Tribal officials say it could be a couple of weeks before service is restored to chapter houses across the 27,000 square - mile reservation .
They 've been meeting with other Internet service providers to explore their options .
Utah - based OnSat , meanwhile , has offered to reconnect the affected chapter houses , if they pay out of their own pockets .

Although Brice had n't been on the job for very long , he 'd gotten pretty comfortable with leading technical interviews .
He 'd quickly compiled a stock set of questions that could weed out the hacks .
Questions that immediately disqualify you for the position if you get them wrong :
What is your first name ?
Name a .NET language .
Questions that almost certainly disqualify you if you get them wrong :
What datatype would you use to store a string of characters ?
Is it C sharp or C pound ?
When Brice 's company had five other developer positions to fill , he was called on for the technical portion of each interview .
Not long ago , a candidate named Corey applied and was brought in for an interview .
Brice could n't put his finger on what it was exactly , but from the moment Corey walked in something just seemed ... off .
Corey 's résumé described him as a C# developer with some SQL experience , so Brice moved immediately to the easy SQL questions .
He opened a new query editor window on his laptop and asked Corey to determine the number of rows in a table called " Parts . "
Corey looked down for a second , smirked , and looked back up .
" I ca n't do it . "
Brice and his boss exchanged surprised glances .
" OK , well why do n't you just get me all parts with a weight of 1.0 . "
Corey thought for a second , tapped his finger on the table a few times , and finally said " I can't do that either . "
" How about getting a list of every part in the table ? "
Corey shrugged .
Brice was stunned .
He could n't fathom what SQL experience Corey could possibly have that did n't require him to use a SELECT query .
Anyway , even if he was n't good with SQL , they needed good C# guys , so Brice , Brice 's boss , and Corey went out to lunch to chat further .
After ordering their food and some awkward small talk , Brice got back on topic , asking which features Corey liked in C# that are n't available in Java and C ++.
" Well , " Corey began , " I coul n't really tell you .
I 've only done VB , never any C pou- er , sharp . "
Brice was puzzled again .
" I 'm sorry , I thought it said on your résumé that you were a C# developer in your last job .
I must 've been looking at the wrong one ... "
" No , that was mine .
I noticed that typo after I sent my résumé out .
I do VB . "
That 's a heck of a typo , Brice thought .
" OK ... well ... "
Brice was off his stock question list , and just asked the first technical question that came to mind .
" In VB , how would you validate an XML document ? "
Corey paused , and almost looked as though he was trying to gauge whether it was a trick question .
Finally , he answered , " I 'm not sure , I 've never used XML .
Is it new to the latest version of . NET or something ? "
On the long drive back to the office , Corey shared a bit more of his background information .
Not in regards to his experience as a developer , mind you , but his experience as a human being .
" You know , it 's been hard for me to find a job , " Corey said .
" After getting fired from my last job , I was kind of down in the dumps , you know ?
It was at the end of my probationary period .
Plus , you know , the whole custody thing . "
What ' custody thing ? '
Brice thought .
" My wife and her new husband are fighting for custody of my kids .
And it 's been hard to find a job .
I mean , you guys are 90 minutes away from my house , but I 'm kind of stuck there , what with the court orders keeping me in the county where I live . "
When Corey started volunteering information about all of his personal crises , the interview moved past ' ridiculous ' and into ' hidden camera TV show ' territory .
It was such a frightening and spectacular failure of an interview that Brice could n't help but laugh .
Brice and his boss reflected on the interview .
" That was odd , " Brice said .
" Yeah , he 's a little weak technically , but ... you know ... we really need another body ... "
" Do n't even joke about that !
I mean ... you 're not serious — you can't be ! "
His boss 's expression did n't change .
He was serious .
" I do n't know about this .
I really do n't think he'd be of much benefit to us . "
" I think I have some work he can do . "
A few short weeks later , Brice had a new officemate .
After working side - by - side with the guy , Brice can confirm that Corey had been honest during his interview — he really had no SQL or C# experience .
Sharing an office with Corey , combined with his boss 's decision to hire him in the first place ultimately led to Brice 's departure .
No doubt he 's been replaced with another body .

An Al Qaeda - backed terrorist who plotted to kidnap a British Muslim soldier and behead him " like a pig " even tried to indoctrinate his five - year - old son , it emerged yesterday .
" Islamist fanatic " Parviz Khan was secretly taped ordering little Abrar to swear allegiance to Osama Bin Laden under threat of a beating with a stick .
Khan , 37 , also told a friend he wanted his three - year - old daughter to marry a Mujahideen terrorist and give birth to his children .
Scroll down for more ...
His plan had been to burn the kidnapped soldier 's body and parade his head on a stick as a warning to other Muslims against joining the British Army .
Yesterday Khan was jailed for life for the plot , which a judge said was designed to " strike at the heart " of the British Government .
Mr Justice Henriques recommended he serve a minimum term of 14 years and warned that Khan was a " terrorist in the grip of idealistic extremism " who may never be safe for release .
Leicester Crown Court heard how Khan and the rest of his five - man terror cell - many of them on benefits - were placed under surveillance and his terrace home in a Birmingham suburb was bugged by the security services .
The device recorded Khan telling one of the men : " We give the judgment , we 'll then cut it out / off .
Off like you cut a pig , man .
. .
Then you put it on a stick and we say , this is to all Muslimee , man , we likes to , we want to join the ( British ) army , this is what will happen to you . "
He was also recorded asking his son Abrar : " Who do you love ? "
The child answered : " Sheik Osama Bin Laden .
Sheik Abu Hamza " - a reference to the jailed hook - handed Finsbury Park Mosque cleric .
Khan - who was paid £ 20,000 a year in benefits - also boasted of making non-Muslims " bleed financially " and said Muslims had a duty to " take from the Kuffar " ( non-believers ) .
Khan and three other members of his Birmingham - based cell pleaded guilty ahead of their trial last month .
But full details of his fanaticism could not be reported until the trial of two other alleged members of the group concluded yesterday .
One of those - British - born school attendance monitor Zahoor Iqbal - was Khan 's right - hand - man .
He grew up in the same street as the family home of Lance Corporal Jabron Hashmi , 24 , the first British Muslim soldier to be killed on active duty in the war on terror .
The cell also included Moroccan Hamid Elasmar , 44 , who married an English legal secretary in the early Nineties and then secretly showed sickening videos of the 9/11 atrocity to their children when they split .
Khan wanted Basiru Gassama , a Gambian national , to find a Muslim soldier who would then be lured to his death with cocaine during a night out in central Birmingham .
He would be driven to a lock - up garage and beheaded .
Footage of the " ghastly " atrocity would be released to Arab TV station Al Jazeera , making " young ( Tony ) Blair go crazy " , Khan told Gassama .
The court heard Khan 's terror cell was primarily committed to supplying equipment to Mujahideen insurgents fighting UK forces on the Afghan border with Pakistan .
Under cover of earthquake relief and aid , the gang sent £ 20,000 in cash and equipment such as laser range - finders , clothing and , ironically , anti-bugging devices to their terror bosses in Pakistan .
But Khan craved a physical role in the killing himself and so hatched the soldier plot .
He was recorded by a listening device at his home as he taught his five - year - old son how to carry out a beheading , and had boasted of meeting Al Qaeda 's " number three " on the Afghan - Pakistani border , who had 450 locals ready to commit " martyrdom operations " - some against the UK .
Scroll down for more ...
Detectives from West Midlands Police 's Counter Terrorism
Unit moved in to arrest the gang in January last year after a year - long surveillance operation .
Although Khan had failed to identify a soldier to target , his home was crammed full of equipment ready for the group 's fifth shipment , as well as extremist literature and videos .
Khan was the hub of the cell .
Not all the men knew each other , but they all knew Khan .
Detective Superintendent Liam O'Brien said the fanatic had " known connections " with others being investigated for terrorism around the UK .
He said : " I 'm convinced that the plot was supported by Al Qaeda .
My strong view is that if we had n't ( arrested the men ) we would be sitting here now talking about the kidnap and murder of a British soldier . "
Khan , of Alum Rock , Birmingham , has refused to attend court throughout proceedings and has shown no remorse .
He pleaded guilty by videolink from prison to engaging in conduct with the intention to commit acts of terrorism , supplying terrorist equipment and two counts of possessing documents useful to a terrorist .
Michael Wolkind , QC , defending , said the plot was a mixture of " fanaticism and fantasy " born out of Khan 's ' rage and frustration ' at UK foreign policy .
Sentencing , Mr Justice Henriques said : " So rampant your ( Khan 's ) views , excitable your temperament , so persuasive your tongue , and so imbued with energy are you that it is impossible to predict when , if ever , you will be safe for release into the public . "
Gassama , 30 , of Hodge Hill , Birmingham , admitted failing to alert the authorities to the soldier plot and was sentenced to two years .
Because of time served on remand , Gassama , who was in Britain legally , will now be deported .

Iqbal , a father of two of Perry Barr , Birmingham , was convicted of supplying terrorist equipment but found not guilty of possessing a document or record likely to be useful to a terrorist .
He was jailed for seven years .
The final two members of the cell - Mohammed Irfan , 31 , of Ward End , and Elasmar , 44 , of Edgbaston , both in Birmingham - admitted engaging in conduct with the intention of assisting in acts of terrorism .
Irfan received a four - year jail sentence , Elasmar was jailed for three years and four months .
None had previous convictions .
A sixth man , shopkeeper Amjad Mahmood , 32 , of Alum Rock , Birmingham , was cleared of failing to alert the authorities to the plot and helping Khan supply equipment to terrorists .
Assistant Chief Constable Anil Patani said the guilty pleas and convictions would force those within the local Muslim community who condemned the arrests 12 months ago to " look in the mirror and reflect on what they have said " .
Chief of the General Staff , General Sir Richard Dannatt , praised police and intelligence services and said : " As the head of the British Army I welcome the conviction of a group of men who were prepared to conduct such a cowardly and grotesque attack against members of the Army , based solely on their religion . "
' WE'LL CUT IT OFF LIKE A PIG '
The recordings revealed Khan told Basiru Gassama he would carry out the soldier 's execution in a mock Islamic court .
He told Gassama the atrocity would be carried out after a fatwa - or judgment - was delivered , mirroring previous murders including those of Britons Ken Bigley and Margaret Hassan in Iraq .
Other terms
Khan used are explained below * .
Only Khan was charged with plotting the beheading because there was no evidence Gassama did anything to help him bring it to fruition .
Part of the transcript suggests Gassama made a half - hearted attempt to make Khan see reason .
The recording was made on November 6 , 2006 .
PK : So , you want to kill Muslims ?
You want to go to Islamic countries , fight with Kuffar against Muslims ?
OK , I have some brothers there .
We give like a Bis , we give the judgment ( ' in the name of God ' ) ... we 'll then cut it out / off like you cut a pig , man ...
Then you put it on a stick and we say , this is to all Muslimee , man , we likes to , we want to join the Kuffar army , this is what will happen to you .
Then we throw the body , burn it , send the video to the chacha , the chacha can release it there .

Ocean motion used to power up homes Associated Press

When it comes to tapping energy from the ocean , off - shore oil rigs are often what comes to mind .
But the ocean itself is proving to be an efficient and environmentally friendly source of energy .
Blustery winds threaten to topple Iain Russell off the dock into the narrow stretch of water connecting the Irish Sea and the Atlantic Ocean .
But those gusts are a key reason why his company , Wave Dragon Ltd. , plans to anchor the world 's largest wave energy converter several miles out to sea off this small town on the southwestern Welsh coast .
More than a century after the industrial revolution 's coal mines and steel works turned Wales ' lush green valleys into stark black hills , the strong winds that batter its coastline are playing a major part in the local government 's plan to turn the country green again .
By 2025 , Wales wants to generate all its electricity from renewable sources and even become a net exporter of power .
Wales is betting that two huge projects _ a $ 30 billion tidal barrage in the Severn Estuary and the largest biomass plant in the world in Port Talbot _ will produce most of the electricity needed to reach its 2025 target .
For the rest , the local government is hoping that its natural winds , streamlined bureaucracy , access to skilled labor , proximity to universities and state funding will prove enticing to companies in both the renewables and clean technology sectors .
Going green could make or break Wales following the death of the mining industry in the 1980s .
While Cardiff has blossomed from a provincial city into a significant capital in recent years under a retail - and services - led boom , rural Wales has limped along on tourism and agriculture .
A parade of companies deciding to make products from cars to cell phone chargers in Wales shows that the strategy is paying off .
Wave Dragon was encouraged to move its headquarters from Denmark to Wales in part by a $ 10 million grant from the Welsh European Funding Office .
" The funding dried up in Denmark so we started looking elsewhere , " said Russell .
" We also discovered how much more wave energy there is here than in the North Sea . "
The company plans to locate its wave energy converter about 2 miles to 3 miles off the Welsh coast for testing over three to five years .
The barge produces electricity directly from the power of the water by first enhancing , then pulling in oncoming waves to turbines in the bottom of the structure .
Russell said that the project could produce enough electricity each year during the testing phase to meet the demands of between 2,500 and 2,000 homes .
The company hopes to eventually sink around 10 of the structures some 10 miles to 12 miles out to sea to form Britain 's first commercial wave energy farm _ but the plan is dependent on nearly $ 71 million of extra funding Wave Dragon is seeking from private sources .
Wales ' government is " very committed to the renewables goal , but we need the cutting - edge technologies that the private sector can offer , " said David Jones , vice president of International Business Wales , the trade and investment arm of the Welsh Assembly .
Mining , once a mainstay of the economy , is no longer a major source of revenue or employment in Wales .
The economy is now underpinned largely by the services and production industries .
Agriculture , forestry and fishing also contribute to a lesser degree .
In 1979 , Wales ' gross domestic product was 93 percent of the British average .
That has since fallen to just 77 percent .
Over the same period , Ireland _ the so - called Celtic tiger _ has seen its GDP go from 60 percent of the UK average to 104 percent thanks to low corporate tax , investment in higher education and EU membership .
Wales hopes to emulate that success with its state funding for renewables and clean technology .
On the outskirts of Cardiff , where G24 Innovations makes silicon - free thin film solar cells to charge mobile phones , the company is planning to install a massive wind turbine in its parking lot later this year .
That will enable the factory to run on renewable energy and eventually sell electricity back to the grid _ making it one of the first factories in the world to use renewable energy to make a renewable product .
G24 is initially targeting the African and Indian markets , where mobile phone penetration is growing but electricity grids are in short supply .
The company already has a contract with Vodacom in Tanzania , Lesotho and Kenya .
When a new production line is ready later this year , G24 plans to raise production to several million units per year .
The company , which is seeking around $ 40 million to $ 50 million in further funding and eventually hopes to list on a stock exchange , also aims to branch out into backpacks with built - in chargers for both emerging and European markets .
A few miles to the west , Connaught Engineering Ltd. has invested $ 24 million in a factory to produce a CO2 emissions - cutting engine component that can be retrofitted to commercial vans .
The system saves both fuel and an estimated 25 percent of carbon emissions on diesel home delivery vans .
Tesco PLC , Britain 's largest grocery chain , is one of several companies testing the hybrid retrofit system .
If successful , Connaught expects orders of around 4,000 units a year .
Connaught CEO
Tony Martindale said the company was initially hesitant when approached by the Welsh Assembly , looking instead at sites in Germany , before being won over by a $ 6.7 million grant .
" The universities here will also be a feed for research and development in our future business , " he said , including the development of the world 's first gasoline / electric engine high - performance sports coupe .
Similarly , G24 considered London and Germany before deciding to invest $ 75 million of its own funds to build its factory in Wales .
" Quite frankly , the difference in the rhetoric between the political circles in talking about renewables and actually how difficult it was to go into business was quite stunning , " said chairman Robert Hertzberg , a former California lawmaker , of his experiences in the United States .
" Here 's a place that was the backbone of the industrial revolution in the coal mines and now all of a sudden , they can be the backbone of the next generation in terms of green energy . "

Advertisement Dramatic evidence of the break - up of the Arctic ice - cap has emerged from research during an expedition by the Canadian military .
Scientists travelling with the troops found major new fractures during an assessment of the state of giant ice shelves in Canada 's far north .
The team found a network of cracks that stretched for more than 10 miles ( 16 km ) on Ward Hunt , the area 's largest shelf .
The fate of the vast ice blocks is seen as a key indicator of climate change .
Satellite image of Ward Hunt Ice Shelf cracks

One of the expedition 's scientists , Derek Mueller of Trent University , Ontario , told me : " I was astonished to see these new cracks .
" It means the ice shelf is disintegrating , the pieces are pinned together like a jigsaw but could float away , " Dr Mueller explained .
According to another scientist on the expedition , Dr Luke Copland of the University of Ottawa , the new cracks fit into a pattern of change in the Arctic .
" We 're seeing very dramatic changes ; from the retreat of the glaciers , to the melting of the sea ice .
" We had 23 % less ( sea ice ) last year than we 've ever had , and what 's happening to the ice shelves is part of that picture . "
When ice shelves break apart , they drift offshore into the ocean as " ice islands " , transforming the very geography of the coastline .
Mission to Ayles Ice Island Last year , I was part of a BBC team that joined Dr Mueller and Dr Copland as they carried out the first research on Ayles Ice Island , an iceberg the size of Manhattan .
It has since split into two , each vast chunk of ice now 400 miles ( 640 km ) south of its original position .
The rapid changes in the Arctic have reignited disputes over territory .
The Canadian military 's expedition was billed as a " sovereignty patrol " , the lines of snowmobiles flying Canadian flags in a display of control .
After the record Arctic melting last year , all eyes are now on what happens to the sea ice this summer .
Although its maximum extent last winter was slightly greater than the year before , it was still below the long - term average .

BRUTAL Fair Gaming in Canada : Scientology ’s Attempts to Ruin Gregg Hagglund Posted by RB on April 26 , 2008 · 8 Comments
Gregg Hagglund has been a civilized and ethical picketer of the Cult of Scientology since the mid-90s .
He has picketed in front of the Toronto Scientology Org over 80 times and played an integral role in the defeat of Scientology ’s application for charity status in Canada .
The Cult ’s response to this was anything but civilized and ethical .
They have declared Hagglund a Suppressive Person ( SP ; i.e. , an enemy of Scientology ) and subjected him and his family to years of absolutely BRUTAL Fair Gaming ( for those not in the know , Fair Game is official Scientology policy whichc specifies that a Scientologist can lie to , trick , steal from or destroy anyone deemed to be an enemy of the cult ) .
Even with my familiarity with this Cult ’s absolute evil when it comes to dealing with critics , I was still left stunned by Hagglund ’s account .
Fair Game is real .
Fair Game is dangerous .
Fair Game continues to this day .
On Saturday May 10 be sure to attend one of the many global protests against this disgusting cult .
The focus of this , the fourth major international protest against Scientology , is Fair Game .
Lets continue to spread the word continent to continent about how malevolent this organization is , how destructive it can be to anyone that has anything substantial to do with it ( whether they be members , critics , journalists , etc. ) , lets put an end to its tax exemption wherever it is received , lets see that justice is done to all who have done evil in the name of Scientology , and lets stop the evil .
On May 10 , lets tell this cult that it is GAME OVER .

August 28 , 2002 -- On August 18 , 2002 , the New York Times carried a front - page story headlined , “ Officers say U.S. aided Iraq despite the use of gas ” .
Quoting anonymous US “ senior military officers ” , the NYT “ revealed ” that in the 1980s , the administration of US President Ronald Reagan covertly provided “ critical battle planning assistance at a time when American intelligence knew that Iraqi commanders would employ chemical weapons in waging the decisive battles of the Iran - Iraq war ” .
The story made a brief splash in the international media , then died .
While the August 18 NYT article added new details about the extent of US military collaboration with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during Iraq 's 1980 - 88 war with Iran , it omitted the most outrageous aspect of the scandal : not only did Washington turn a blind - eye to the Hussein regime 's repeated use of chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers and Iraq 's Kurdish minority , but the US helped Iraq develop its chemical , biological and nuclear weapons programs .
Nor did the NYT dwell on the extreme cynicism and hypocrisy of the current US administration 's citing of those same terrible atrocities — which were disregarded at the time by Washington — and those same weapons programs — which no longer exist , having been dismantled and destroyed in the decade following the 1991 Gulf War — to justify a massive new war against the people of Iraq .
A reader of the NYT article ( or the tens of thousands of other articles written after the latest war drive against Iraq began in earnest soon after September 11 ) would have looked in vain for the fact that many of the US politicians and ruling class pundits demanding war against Hussein today — in particular , the most bellicose of the Bush administration 's “ hawks ” , defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld — were up to their ears in Washington 's efforts to cultivate , promote and excuse Hussein in the past .
The NYT article read as though Washington 's casual disregard about the use of chemical weapons by Hussein 's dictatorship throughout the 1980s had never been reported before .
However , it was not the first time that “ Iraqgate ” — as the scandal of US military and political support for Hussein in the ‘ 80s has been dubbed — has raised its embarrassing head in the corporate media , only to be quickly buried again .
One of the more comprehensive and damning accounts of Iraqgate was written by Douglas Frantz and Murray Waas and published in the February 23 , 1992 , Los Angeles Times .
Headlined , “ Bush secret effort helped Iraq build its war machine ” , the article reported that “ classified documents obtained by the LA Times show … a long - secret pattern of personal efforts by [ George Bush senior ] — both as president and vice president — to support and placate the Iraqi dictator . ”
Even William Safire , the right - wing , war - mongering NYT columnist , on December 7 , 1992 , felt compelled to write that , “ Iraqgate is uniquely horrendous : a scandal about the systematic abuse of power by misguided leaders of three democratic nations [ the US , Britain and Italy ] to secretly finance the arms buildup of a dictator ” .
The background to Iraqgate was the January 1979 popular uprising that overthrew the cravenly pro-US Shah of Iran .
The Iranian revolution threatened US imperialism 's domination of the strategic oil - rich region .
Other than Israel , Iran had long been Washington 's key ally in the Middle East .
Washington immediately began to “ cast about for ways to undermine or overthrow the Iranian revolution , or make up for the loss of the Shah .
Hussein 's regime put up its hand .
On September 22 , 1980 , Iraq launched an invasion of Iran .
Throughout the bloody eight - year - long war — which cost at least 1 million lives — Washington backed Iraq .
As a 1990 report prepared for the Pentagon by the Strategic Studies Institute of the US War College admitted : “ Throughout the [ Iran - Iraq ] war the United States practised a fairly benign policy toward Iraq … [ Washington and Baghdad ] wanted to restore the status quo ante … that prevailed before [ the 1979 Iranian revolution ] began threatening the regional balance of power .
Khomeini 's revolutionary appeal was anathema to both Baghdad and Washington ; hence they wanted to get rid of him .
United by a common interest … the [ US ] began to actively assist Iraq . ”
At first , as Iraqi forces seemed headed for victory over Iran , official US policy was neutrality in the conflict .
Not only was Hussein doing Washington 's dirty work in the war with Iran , but the US rulers believed that Iraq could be lured away from its close economic and military relationship with the Soviet Union — just as Egypt 's President Anwar Sadat had done in the 1970s .
In March 1981 , US Secretary of State Alexander Haig excitedly told the Senate foreign relations committee that Iraq was concerned by “ the behaviour of Soviet imperialism in the Middle Eastern region ” .
The Soviet government had refused to deliver arms to Iraq as long as Baghdad continued its military offensive against Iran .
Moscow was also unhappy with the Hussein 's vicious repression of the Iraqi Communist Party .
Washington 's support ( innocuously referred to as a “ tilt ” at the time ) for Iraq became more open after Iran succeeded in driving Iraqi forces from its territory in May 1982 ; in June , Iran went on the offensive against Iraq .
The US scrambled to stem Iraq 's military setbacks .
Washington and its conservative Arab allies suddenly feared Iran might even defeat Iraq , or at least cause the collapse of Hussein 's regime .
Using its allies in the Middle East , Washington funnelled huge supplies of arms to Iraq .
Classified State Department cables uncovered by Frantz and Waas described covert transfers of howitzers , helicopters , bombs and other weapons to Baghdad in 1982 - 83 from Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Jordan and Kuwait .
Howard Teicher , who monitored Middle East policy at the US National Security Council during the Reagan administration , told the February 23 , 1992 , LA Times : “ There was a conscious effort to encourage third countries to ship US arms or acquiesce in shipments after the fact .
It was a policy of nods and winks . ”
According to Mark Phythian 's 1997 book Arming Iraq : How the US and Britain Secretly Built Saddam 's War Machine ( Northeastern University Press ) , in 1983 Reagan asked Italy 's Prime Minister Guilo Andreotti to channel arms to Iraq .
The January 1 , 1984 Washington Post reported that the US had “ informed friendly Persian Gulf nations that the defeat of Iraq in the three - year - old war with Iran would be ‘ contrary to US interests ' and has made several moves to prevent that result ” .
Central to these “ moves ” was the cementing of a military and political alliance with Saddam Hussein 's repressive regime , so as to build up Iraq as a military counterweight to Iran .
In 1982 , the Reagan administration removed Iraq from the State Department 's list of countries that allegedly supported terrorism .
On December 19 - 20 , 1983 , Reagan dispatched his Middle East envoy — none other than Donald Rumsfeld — to Baghdad with a hand - written offer of a resumption of diplomatic relations , which had been severed during the 1967 Arab - Israel war .
On March 24 , 1984 , Rumsfeld was again in Baghdad .
On that same day , the UPI wire service reported from the UN : “ Mustard gas laced with a nerve agent has been used on Iranian soldiers … a team of UN experts has concluded … Meanwhile , in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad , US presidential envoy Donald Rumsfeld held talks with foreign minister Tariq Aziz . ”
The day before , Iran had accused Iraq of poisoning 600 of its soldiers with mustard gas and Tabun nerve gas .
There is no doubt that the US government knew Iraq was using chemical weapons .
On March 5 , 1984 , the State Department had stated that “ available evidence indicates that Iraq has used lethal chemical weapons ” .
The March 30 , 1984 , NYT reported that US intelligence officials has “ what they believe to be incontrovertible evidence that Iraq has used nerve gas in its war with Iran and has almost finished extensive sites for mass producing the lethal chemical warfare agent ” .
However , consistent with the pattern throughout the Iran - Iraq war and after , the use of these internationally outlawed weapons was not considered important enough by Rumsfeld and his political superiors to halt Washington 's blossoming love affair with Hussein .
The March 29 , 1984 , NYT , reporting on the aftermath of Rumsfeld 's talks in Baghdad , stated that US officials had pronounced “ themselves satisfied with relations between Iraq and the US and suggest that normal diplomatic ties have been restored in all but name ” .
In November 1984 , the US and Iraq officially restored diplomatic relations .
According to Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward , in a December 15 , 1986 article , the CIA began to secretly supply Iraq with intelligence in 1984 that was used to “ calibrate ” mustard gas attacks on Iranian troops .
Beginning in early 1985 , the CIA provided Iraq with “ data from sensitive US satellite reconnaissance photography … to assist Iraqi bombing raids ” .
Iraqi chemical attacks on Iranian troops — and US assistance to Iraq — continued throughout the Iran - Iraq war .
In a parallel program , the US defence department also provided intelligence and battle - planning assistance to Iraq .
The August 17 , 2002 NYT reported that , according to “ senior military officers with direct knowledge of the program ” , even though “ senior officials of the Reagan administration publicly condemned Iraq 's employment of mustard gas , sarin , VX and other poisonous agents … President Reagan , vice president George Bush [ senior ] and senior national security aides never withdrew their support for the highly classified program in which more than 60 officers of the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) were secretly providing detailed information on Iranian deployments , tactical planning for battles , plans for air strikes and bomb - damage assessments for Iraq . ”
Retired DIA officer Rick Francona told the NYT that Iraq 's chemical weapons were used in the war 's final battle in early 1988 , in which Iraqi forces retook the Fao Peninsula from the Iranian army .
Another retired DIA officer , Walter Lang , told the NYT that “ the use of gas on the battlefield by the Iraqis was not a matter of deep strategic concern ” .
What concerned the DIA , CIA and the Reagan administration was that Iran not break through the Fao Peninsula and spread the Islamic revolution to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia .
Iraq 's 1982 removal from Washington 's official list of states that support terrorism meant that the Hussein regime was now eligible for US economic and military aid , and was able to purchase advanced US technology that could also be used for military purposes .
Conventional military sales resumed in December 1982 .
In 1983 , the Reagan administration approved the sale of 60 Hughes helicopters to Iraq in 1983 “ for civilian use ” .
However , as Phythian pointed out , these aircraft could be “ weaponised ” within hours of delivery .
Then US Secretary of State George Schultz and commerce secretary George Baldridge also lobbied for the delivery of Bell helicopters equipped for “ crop spraying ” .
It is believed that US - supplied choppers were used in the 1988 chemical attack on the Kurdish village of Halabja , which killed 5000 people .
With the Reagan administration 's connivance , Baghdad immediately embarked on a massive militarisation drive .
This US - endorsed military spending spree began even before Iraq was delisted as a terrorist state , when the US commerce department approved the sale of Italian gas turbine engines for Iraq 's naval frigates .
Soon after , the US agriculture department 's Commodity Credit Corporation ( CCC ) guaranteed to repay loans — in the event of defaults by Baghdad — banks had made to Iraq to buy US - grown commodities such as wheat and rice .
Under this scheme , Iraq had three years to repay the loans , and if it could not the US taxpayers would have to cough up .
Washington offered this aid initially to prevent Hussein 's overthrow as the Iraqi people began to complain about the food shortages caused by the massive diversion of hard currency for the purchase of weapons and ammunition .
The loan guarantees amounted to a massive US subsidy that allowed Hussein to launch his overt and covert arms buildup , one result being that the Iran - Iraq war entered a bloody five - year stalemate .
By the end of 1983 , US $ 402 million in agriculture department loan guarantees for Iraq were approved .
In 1984 , this increased to $ 503 million and reached $ 1.1 billion in 1988 .
Between 1983 and 1990 , CCC loan guarantees freed up more than $ 5 billion .
Some $ 2 billion in bad loans , plus interest , ended up having to be covered by US taxpayers .
A similar taxpayer - funded , though smaller scale , scam operated under the auspices of the federal Export - Import Bank .
In 1984 , vice - president George Bush senior personally intervened to ensure that the bank guaranteed loans to Iraq of $ 500 million to build an oil pipeline .
Export - Import Bank loan guarantees grew from $ 35 million in 1985 to $ 267 million by 1990 .
According to William Blum , writing in the August 1998 issue of the Progressive , Sam Gejdenson , chairperson of a Congressional subcommittee investigating US exports to Iraq , disclosed that from 1985 until 1990 “ the US government approved 771 licenses [ only 39 were rejected ] for the export to Iraq of $ 1.5 billion worth of biological agents and high - tech equipment with military application …
“ The US spent virtually an entire decade making sure that Saddam Hussein had almost whatever he wanted …
US export control policy was directed by US foreign policy as formulated by the State Department , and it was US foreign policy to assist the regime of Saddam Hussein . ”
A 1994 US Senate report revealed that US companies were licenced by the commerce department to export a “ witch 's brew ” of biological and chemical materials , including bacillus anthracis ( which causes anthrax ) and clostridium botulinum ( the source of botulism ) .
The American Type Culture Collection made 70 shipments of the anthrax bug and other pathogenic agents .
The report also noted that US exports to Iraq included the precursors to chemical warfare agents , plans for chemical and biological warfare facilities and chemical warhead filling equipment .
US firms supplied advanced and specialised computers , lasers , testing and analysing equipment .
Among the better - known companies were Hewlett Packard , Unisys , Data General and Honeywell .
Billions of dollars worth of raw materials , machinery and equipment , missile technology and other “ dual-use ” items were also supplied by West German , French , Italian , British , Swiss and Austrian corporations , with the approval of their governments ( German firms even sold Iraq entire factories capable of mass - producing poison gas ) .
Much of this was purchased with funds freed by the US CCC credits .
The destination of much of this equipment was Saad 16 , near Mosul in northern Iraq .
Western intelligence agencies had long known that the sprawling complex was Iraq 's main ballistic missile development centre .
Blum reported that Washington was fully aware of the likely use of this material .
In 1992 , a US Senate committee learned that the commerce department had deleted references to military end - use from information it sent to Congress about 68 export licences , worth more than $ 1 billion .
In 1986 , the US defence department 's deputy undersecretary for trade security , Stephen Bryen , had objected to the export of an advanced computer , similar to those used in the US missile program , to Saad 16 because “ of the high likelihood of military end use ” .
The state and commerce departments approved the sale without conditions .
In his book , The Death Lobby : How the West Armed Iraq , Kenneth Timmerman points out that several US agencies were supposed to review US exports that may be detrimental to US “ national security ” .
However , the commerce department often did not submit exports to Hussein 's Iraq for review or approved them despite objections from other government departments .
On March 16 , 1988 , Iraqi forces launched a poison gas attack on the Iraqi Kurdish village of Halabja , killing 5000 people .
While that attack is today being touted by senior US officials as one of the main reasons why Hussein must now be “ taken out ” , at the time Washington 's response to the atrocity was much more relaxed .
Just four months later , Washington stood by as the US giant Bechtel corporation won the contract to build a huge petrochemical plant that would give the Hussein regime the capacity to generate chemical weapons .
On September 8 , 1988 , the US Senate passed the Prevention of Genocide Act , which would have imposed sanctions on the Hussein regime .
Immediately , the Reagan administration announced its opposition to the bill , calling it “ premature ” .
The White House used its influence to stall the bill in the House of Representatives .
When Congress did eventually pass the bill , the White House did not implement it .
Washington 's political , military and economic sweetheart deals with the Iraqi dictator came under even more stress when , in August 1989 , FBI agents raided the Atlanta branch of the Rome - based Banca Nazionale del Lavoro ( BNL ) and uncovered massive fraud involving the CCC loan guarantee scheme and billions of dollars worth of unauthorised “ off - the - books ” loans to Iraq .
BNL Atlanta manager Chris Drougal had used the CCC program to underwrite programs that had nothing to do with agricultural exports .
Using this covert set - up , Hussein 's regime tried to buy the most hard - to - get components for its nuclear weapons and missile programs on the black market .
Russ Baker , writing in the March / April 1993 Columbia Journalism Review , noted : “ Elements of the US government almost certainly knew that Drougal was funnelling US - backed loans — into dual - use technology and outright military technology .
The British government was fully aware of the operations of Matrix - Churchill , a British firm with an Ohio branch , which was not only at the centre of the Iraqi procurement network but was also funded by BNL Atlanta ...
It would be later alleged by bank executives that the Italian government , long a close US ally as well as BNL 's ultimate owner , had knowledge of BNL 's loan diversions . ”
Yet , even the public outrage generated by the Halabja massacre and the widening BNL scandal did not cool Washington 's ardour towards Hussein 's Iraq .
On October 2 , 1989 , US President George Bush senior signed the top- secret National Security Decision 26 , which declared : “ Normal relations between the US and Iraq would serve our long - term interests and promote stability in both the Gulf and the Middle East .
The US should propose economic and political incentives for Iraq to moderate its behaviour and increase our influence with Iraq ...
We should pursue , and seek to facilitate , opportunities for US firms to participate in the reconstruction of the Iraqi economy . ”
As public and congressional pressure mounted on the US Agriculture Department to end Iraq 's access to CCC loan guarantees , Secretary of State James Baker — armed with NSD 26 — personally insisted that agriculture secretary Clayton Yeutter drop his opposition to their continuation .
In November 1989 , Bush senior approved $ 1 billion in loan guarantees for Iraq in 1990 .
In April 1990 , more revelations about the BNL scandal had again pushed the department of agriculture to the verge of halting Iraq 's CCC loan guarantees .
On May 18 , national security adviser Scowcroft personally intervened to ensure the delivery of the first $ 500 million tranche of the CCC subsidy for 1990 .
According to Frantz and Waas ' February 23 , 1992 , LA Times article , in July 1990 “ officials at the National Security Council and the State Department were pushing to deliver the second installment of the $ 1 billion in loan guarantees , despite the looming crisis in the region and evidence that Iraq had used the aid illegally to help finance a secret arms procurement network to obtain technology for its nuclear weapons and ballistic - missile program ” .
From July 18 to August 1 , 1990 , Bush senior 's administration approved $ 4.8 million in advanced technology sales to Iraq .
The end -users included Saad 16 and the Iraqi ministry of industry and military industrialisation .
On August 1 , $ 695,000 worth of advanced data transmission devices were approved .
“ Only on August 2 , 1990 , did the agriculture department officially suspend the [ CCC loan ] guarantees to Iraq — the same day that Hussein 's tanks and troops swept into Kuwait ” , noted Frantz and Waas .

The Telecommunications and Internet subcommittee of the the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing today on H.R. 5353 , the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2008 .
The bill would establish an official national broadband policy , one that prevents service providers from subjecting lawful content to " unreasonable interference " or " discrimination . "
It also calls on the Federal Communications Commission to assess competition in and consumer access to broadband Internet access in light of this policy .
The testimony at the hearing , however , suggested that these provisions , and net neutrality in general , means very different things to different groups .
And , as far as the RIAA is concerned , net neutrality legislation could hamstring the fight against piracy .
Edward Markey
Representative Edward Markey ( D - MA ) , a sponsor of the bill and chair of the subcommittee , left little doubt that the IFPA is about a specific vision of net neutrality .
" Now we are faced with a choice , " he said in his opening statement , " Can we preserve this wildly successful medium and the freedom it embodies , or do we permit network operators to fundamentally alter how the Internet has historically functioned ? "
Markey presented the neutral Internet as an enabler of innovation , and contrasted it with a future in which , " in the name of network management , policymakers permit carriers to act in unreasonable , anti-competitive fashion . "
Telcos , not surprisingly , beg to differ .
Kyle McSlarrow , president of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association , was one of the witnesses testifying , and his past testimony regarding a similar Senate bill reveal that he 's apparently operating in an entirely different universe than Markey .
From his perspective , mandated net neutrality would somehow suppress all incentive for ISPs to expand broadband access .
He accused companies like Yahoo and Google , which flourished in the broadband market , of trying to " foreclose any new business model that would enable new entrants to challenge them . "
From McSlarrow 's perspective , network management , far from ensuring neutrality , is a form of innovation that will somehow bring the next generation of Internet into being .
In this , McSlarrow got support from University of Pennsylvania law professor Christopher Yoo .
Yoo has testified on behalf of ISPs before , arguing that congestion caused by file sharing represents a real burden for all Internet users .
His academic writing also presents ' Net neutrality as somehow interfering with solving the " last mile access " problem .
Christopher Yoo
Markey 's universe was n't entirely uninhabited , however .
A representative of the Christian Coalition and the president of Shoebuy.com both testified that a non-neutral ' Net in which ISPs could charge for access to their customers would stifle both small organizations and newly formed companies .
Ben Scott , the policy director of Free Press also echoed Markey 's concerns , and suggested that Comcast 's blocking of P2P traffic suggested that net neutrality regulation is no longer an abstract concern — it 's a real - world problem .
" It is time for Congress to act , " Scott testified , " this is the right bill at the right time . "
Representatives of the RIAA and the Writer 's Guild of America were also on hand .
For these groups , the traffic filtering favored by telcos is a close cousin of the content - based filtering that they favor for combating piracy .
As such , they clearly have an interest in helping ISPs enable some form of network filtering on a non-neutral ' Net .
But the actual state of the Internet is less important to the RIAA than blocking piracy so , since it has been far from successful in bringing all ISPs on board the filtering bandwagon , its representative played hardball .
The RIAA barely addressed the legislation at hand , and simply thanked those who crafted it for recognizing a distinction between legal and illegal Internet traffic .
Instead , its testimony seemed to consist largely of a veiled threat against ISPs , suggesting the RIAA hoped to negotiate a market - based solution with them , but it would support legislative intervention — which the service providers are hoping to avoid — if necessary .
To a certain extent , the testimony was filled with questionable comparisons and false dichotomies , such as the telcos equating innovation in biasing Internet traffic with the innovative companies that succeeded through services offered on an unbiased network .
Any informative debate or informed legislation will ultimately have to carefully separate these issues , and there seems to be a degree of urgency in doing so .
As the Free Press ' Scott noted , " it is not a question of whether consumers will have laws guarding against Internet gatekeepers , but how those laws will be crafted . "
After the war Irena Sendler continued in her profession as a social worker and also became a director of vocational schools .
In 1965 she became one of the first Righteous Gentiles to be honoured by Yad Vashem , the Holocaust Martyrs ' and Heroes ' Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem .
At that time Poland 's Communist leaders would not allow her to travel to Israel , and she was unable to collect the award until 1983 .
( Adds details , background )
NEW YORK , May 8 ( Reuters ) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Thursday that the worst of the credit crisis is over , according to sources who attended a speech he delivered in New York .
Greenspan said while the current credit crisis was the worst he had ever seen , the worst was over as low interest rates meant companies could borrow more cheaply long - term , the sources who attended his speech at the Alternative Public Strategies Conference told Reuters .
Conference organizers said Greenspan had requested that members of the media intending to cover his speech could only do so in their personal capacity and would not be allowed to report on whatever he said .
Greenspan also said U.S. house prices still had a long way to fall and that it was unlikely they would stabilize by year - end , the sources said .
As chairman of the Federal Reserve , Greenspan oversaw the reduction of the federal funds rate 1.0 percent in 2003 which some critics charge provided fuel for the U.S. real estate bubble that followed .
Greenspan has vehemently rejected assertions that his monetary policy was the cause of the problem .
Low interest rates and lending practises that saw loans being advanced to home owners with poor credit histories have been blamed for the U.S. housing market meltdown .
The U.S economy is reeling from a housing - led slowdown , with some analysts convinced it is already in a recession despite a 0.6 percent growth rate in the first quarter of 2008 .
The Fed has cut it ’s key overnight lending rate by 3.25 percentage points to 2.0 percent since mid-September in a bid to prevent the housing downturn from spilling over to the broader economy .
The aggressive rate cuts were also directed at healing the fractured credit markets .
According the sources , Greenspan mentioned that United States growth was likely to be sluggish for an extended period of time but that a so - called doomsday scenario was unlikely to materialize .
On Monday , Greenspan was quoted by Bloomberg news agency as saying that the U.S. growth had fallen into an “ awfully pale recession ” and might remain stagnant for the rest of the year .
PHYS771 Lecture 12 : Proofs
Scott Aaronson
( Thanks to Bill Rosgen and Edwin Chen for help preparing these notes . )
We 're going to start by beating a retreat from QuantumLand , back onto the safe territory of computational complexity .
In particular , we 're going to see how in the 80's and 90's , computational complexity theory reinvented the millennia - old concept of mathematical proof -- making it probabilistic , interactive , and cryptographic .
But then , having fashioned our new pruning - hooks ( proving - hooks ? ) , we 're going to return to QuantumLand and reap the harvest .
In particular , I 'll show you why , if you could see the entire trajectory of a hidden variable , then you could efficiently solve any problem that admits a " statistical zero - knowledge proof protocol , " including problems like Graph Isomorphism for which no efficient quantum algorithm is yet known .
What Is A Proof ?
Historically , mathematicians have had two very different notions of " proof . "
The first is a that a proof is something that induces in the audience ( or at least the prover ! ) an intuitive sense of certainty that the result is correct .
On this view , a proof is an inner transformative experience -- a way for your soul to make contact with the eternal verities of Platonic heaven .
The second notion is that a proof is just a sequence of symbols obeying certain rules -- or more generally , if we 're going to take this view to what I see as its logical conclusion , a proof is a computation .
In other words , a proof is a physical , mechanical process , such that if the process terminates with a particular outcome , then you should accept that a given theorem is true .
Naturally , you can never be more certain of the theorem than you are of the laws governing the machine .
But as great logicians from Leibniz to Frege to Gödel understood , the weakness of this notion of proof is also its strength .
If proof is purely mechanical , then in principle you can discover new mathematical truths by just turning a crank , without any understanding or insight .
( As Leibniz imagined legal disputes one day being settled : " Gentlemen , let us calculate ! " )
The tension between the two notions of proof was thrown into sharper relief in 1976 , when Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken announced a proof of the famous Four - Color Map Theorem ( that every planar map can be colored with four colors , in such a way that no two adjacent countries are colored the same ) .
The proof basically consisted of a brute - force enumeration of thousands of cases by computer ; there 's no feasible way for a human to apprehend it in its entirety .
Devin :
If the Four - Color Theorem was basically proved by brute force , then how can they be sure they hit all the cases ?
Answer : Good question !
The novel technical contribution that human mathematicians had to make was precisely that of reducing the problem to finitely many cases -- specifically , about 2000 of them -- which could then be checked by computer .
Increasing our confidence is that the proof has since been redone by another group , which reduced the number of cases from about 2000 to about 1000 .
Now , people will ask : how do you know that the computer did n't make a mistake ?
The obvious response is that human mathematicians also make mistakes .
I mean , Roger Penrose likes to talk about making direct contact with Platonic reality , but it 's a bit embarrassing when you think you 've made such contact and it turns out the next morning that you were wrong !
We know the computer did n't make a mistake because we trust the laws of physics that the computer relies on , and that it was n't hit by a cosmic ray during the computation .
But in the last 20 years , there 's been the question -- why should we trust physics ?
We trust it in life - and - death situations every day , but should we really trust it with something as important as proving the Four - Color Theorem ?
The truth is , we can play games with the definition of proof in order to expand it to unsettling levels , and we 'll be doing this for the rest of the lecture .
Probabilistic Proofs
Recall that we can think of a proof as a computation -- a purely mechanical process that spits out theorems .
But what about a computation that errs with 2-1000 probability -- is that a proof ?
That is , are BPP computations legitimate proofs ?
Well , if we can make the probability of error so small that it 's more likely for a comet to suddenly smash our computer into pieces than for our proof to be wrong , it certainly seems plausible !
Now do you remember our definition of NP , as the class of problems with polynomial - size certificates ( for positive answers ) that can be verified in polynomial time ?
In other words , it 's the class of problems we can efficiently prove and check .
So once we admit probabilistic algorithms as proofs , we should combine them with NP to get MA ( named by Laszlo Babai after Merlin and Arthur ) , the class of problems with proofs efficiently verifiable by some randomized algorithm .
We can also consider the class where you get to Ask Merlin a question -- this is AM .
What happens if you get to ask Merlin more than one question ?
You'd think you'd be able to solve more problems or prove more theorems , right ?
Wrong !
It turns out that if you get to ask Merlin a constant number of questions , say , AMAMAM , then you have exactly the same power as just asking him once .
Zero-Knowledge Proofs
I was talking before about stochastic proofs , proofs that have an element of uncertainty about them .
We can also generalize the notion of proof to include zero - knowledge proofs , proofs where the person seeing the proof does n't learn anything about the statement in question except that it 's true .
Intuitively that sounds impossible , but I 'll illustrate this with an example .
Suppose we have two graphs .
If they 're isomorphic , that 's easy to prove .
But suppose they 're not isomorphic .
How could you prove that to someone , assuming you 're an omniscient wizard ?
Simple :
Have the person you 're trying to convince pick one of the two graphs at random , randomly permute it , and send you the result .
That person then asks : " which graph did I start with ? "
If the graphs are not isomorphic , then you should be able to answer this question with certainty .
Otherwise you 'll only be able to answer it with probability 1 / 2 .
And thus you 'll almost surely make a mistake if the test is repeated a small number of times .
This is an example of an interactive proof system .
Are we making any assumptions ?
We 're assuming you do n't know which graph the verifier started with , or that you can't access the state of his brain to figure it out .
Or as theoretical computer scientists would say , we 're assuming you can't access the verifier 's " private random bits . "
What 's perhaps even more interesting about this proof system is that the verifier becomes convinced that the graphs are not isomorphic without learning anything else !
In particular , the verifier becomes convinced of something , but is not thereby enabled to convince anyone else of the same statement .
A proof with this property -- that the verifier does n't learn anything besides the truth of the statement being proved -- is called is called a zero - knowledge proof .
Yeah , alright , you have to do some more work to define what it means for the verifier to " not learn anything . "
Basically , what it means is that , if the verifier were already convinced of the statement , he could 've just simulated the entire protocol on his own , without any help from the prover .
Under a certain computational assumption -- namely that one - way functions exist -- it can be shown that zero - knowledge proofs exist for every NP - complete problem .
This was the remarkable discovery of Goldreich , Micali , and Wigderson in 1986 .
Because all NP - complete problems are reducible to each other ( i.e. , are " the same problem in different guises " ) , it 's enough to give a zero - knowledge protocol for one NP - complete problem .
And it turns out that a convenient choice is the problem of 3 - coloring a graph ( meaning : coloring every vertex red , blue , or green , so that no two neighboring vertices are colored the same ) .
The question is : how can you convince someone that a graph is 3 - colorable , without revealing anything about the coloring ?
Well , here 's how .
Given a 3 - coloring , first randomly permute the colors -- for example by changing every blue country to green , every green country to red , and every red country to blue .
( There are 3!=6 possible permutations . )
Next , use a one - way function ( whose existence we 've assumed ) to encrypt the color of every country .
Then send the encrypted colors to the verifier .
Given these encrypted colors , what can the verifier do ?
Simple : he can pick two neighboring vertices , ask you to decrypt the colors , and then check that ( 1 ) the decryptions are valid and ( 2 ) the colors are actually different .
Note that , if the graph was n't 3 - colorable , then either two adjacent countries must gotten the same color , or else some country must not even have been colored red , blue , or green .
In either case , the verifier will catch you cheating with probability at least 1 /m , where m is the number of edges .
Finally , if the verifier wants to increase his confidence , we can simply repeat the protocol a large ( but still polynomial ) number of times .
Note that each time you choose a fresh permutation of the colors as well as fresh encryptions .
If after ( say ) m3 repetitions , the verifier still has n't caught you cheating , he can be sure that the probability you were cheating is vanishingly small .
But why is this protocol zero - knowledge ?
Intuitively it's " obvious " : when you decrypt two colors , all the verifier learns is that two neighboring vertices were colored differently -- but then , they would be colored differently if it's a valid 3 - coloring , would n't they ?
Alright , to make this more formal , you need to prove that the verifier " does n't learn anything , " by which we mean that by himself , in polynomial time , the verifier could 've produced a probability distribution over sequences of messages that was indistinguishable , by any polynomial - time algorithm , from the actual sequence of messages that the verifier exchanged with you .
As you can imagine , it gets a bit technical .
Is there any difference between the two zero - knowledge examples I just showed you ?
Sure : the zero - knowledge proof for 3 - coloring a map depended crucially on the assumption that the verifier can't , in polynomial time , decrypt the map by himself .
( If he could , he would be able to learn the 3 - coloring ! )
This is called a computational zero - knowledge proof , and the class of all problems admitting such a proof is called CZK .
By contrast , in the proof for Graph Non-Isomorphism , the verifier could n't cheat even with unlimited computational power .
This is called is a statistical zero - knowledge proof , a proof in which the distributions given by an honest prover and a cheating prover need to be close in the statistical sense .
The class of all problems admitting this kind of proof is called SZK .
Clearly SZK⊆CZK , but is the containment strict ?
Intuitively , we 'd guess that CZK is a larger class , since we only require a protocol to be zero - knowledge against polynomial - time verifiers , not verifiers with unlimited computation .
And indeed , it 's known that if one - way functions exist , then CZK = IP = PSPACE -- in other words , CZK is " as big as it could possibly be . "
On the other hand , it 's also known that SZK is contained in the polynomial hierarchy .
( In fact , under a derandomization assumpition , SZK is even in NP∩ coNP ) .
PCP
A PCP ( Probabilistically Checkable Proof ) is yet another impossible - seeming game one can play with the concept of " proof . "
It 's a proof that 's written down in such a way that you , the lazy grader , only need to flip it open to a few random places to check ( in a statistical sense ) that it 's correct .
Indeed , if you want very high confidence ( say , to one part in a thousand ) that the proof is correct , you never need to examine more than about 30 bits .
Of course , the hard part is encoding the proof so that this is possible .
It 's probably easier to see this with an example .
Do you remember the Graph Non-Isomorphism problem ?
We 'll show that there is a proof that two graphs are non-isomorphic , such that anyone verifying the proof only needs to look at a constant number of bits ( though admittedly , the proof itself will be exponentially long ) .
First , given any pair of graphs G 0 and G 1 with n nodes each , the prover sends the verifier a specially encoded string proving that G 0 and G 1 are non-isomorphic .
What 's in this string ?
Well , we can choose some ordering of all possible graphs with n nodes , so call the ith graph H i .
Then for the ith bit of the string , the prover puts a 0 there if H i is isomorphic to G 0 , a 1 if H i is isomorphic to G 1 , and otherwise ( if H i is isomorphic to neither ) he arbitrarily places a 0 or a 1 .
How does this string prove to the verifier that G 0 and G 1 are non-isomorphic ?
Easy : the verifier flips a coin to get G 0 or G 1 , and randomly permutes it to get a new graph H .
Then , she queries for the bit of the proof corresponding to H , and accepts if and only if the queried bit matches her original graph .
If indeed G 0 and G 1 are non-isomorphic , then the verifier will always accept , and if not , then the probability of acceptance is at most 1/2 .
In this example , though , the proof was exponentially long and only worked for Graph Non-Isomorphism .
What kind of results do we have in general ?
The famous PCP Theorem says that every NP problem admits PCP's -- and furthermore , PCP 's with polynomially long proofs !
This means that every mathematical proof can be encoded in such a way that any error in the original proof translates into errors almost everywhere in the new proof .
One way of understanding this is through 3SAT .
The PCP theorem is equivalent to the NP - completeness of the problem of solving 3SAT with the promise that either the formula is satisfiable , or else there 's no truth assignment that satisfies more than ( say ) 90 % of the clauses .
Why ?
Because you can encode the question of whether some mathematical statement has a proof with at most n symbols as a 3SAT instance -- in such a way that if there 's a valid proof , then the formula is satisfiable , and if not , then no assignment satisfies more than 90 % of the clauses .
So given a truth assignment , you only need to distinguish the case that it satisfies all the clauses from the case that it satisfies at most 90 % of them -- and this can be done by examining a few dozen random clauses , completely independently of the length of the proof .
Complexity of Simulating Hidden - Variable Theories
We talked last week about the path of a particle 's hidden variable in a hidden - variable theory , but what is the complexity of finding such a path ?
As Devin points out , this problem is certainly at least as hard as quantum computing -- since even to sample a hidden variable 's value at any single time would in general require a full - scale quantum computation .
Is sampling a whole trajectory an even harder problem ?
Here 's another way to ask this question .
Suppose that at the moment of your death , your whole life flashes before you in an instant -- and suppose you can then perform a polynomial - time computation on your life history .
What does that let you compute ?
( Assuming , of course , that a hidden - variable theory is true , and that while you were alive , you somehow managed to place your own brain in various nontrivial superpositions . )
To study this question , we can define a new complexity class called DQP , or Dynamical Quantum Polynomial - Time .
The formal definition of this class is a bit hairy ( see my paper for details ) .
Intuitively , though , DQP is the class of problems that are efficiently solvable in the " model " where you get to sample the whole trajectory of a hidden variable , under some hidden - variable theory that satisfies " reasonable " assumptions .
Now , you remember the class SZK , of problems that have statistical zero - knowledge proof protocols ?
The main result from my paper was that SZK⊆DQP .
In other words , if only we could measure the whole trajectory of a hidden variable , we could use a quantum computer to solve every SZK problem -- including Graph Isomorphism and many other problems not yet known to have efficient quantum algorithms !
To explain why that is , I need to tell you that in 1997 , Sahai and Vadhan discovered an extremely nice " complete promise problem " for SZK .
That problem is the following :
Given two efficiently - samplable probability distributions D 1 and D 2 , are they close or far in statistical distance ( promised that one of those is the case ) ?
This means that when thinking about SZK , we can forget about zero - knowledge proofs , and just assume we have two probability distributions and we want to know whether they 're close or far .
But let me make it even more concrete .
Let 's say that you have a function f :{ 1,2 , ... , N} → {1,2 , ... , N} , and you want to decide whether f is one - to - one or two - to - one , promised that one of these is the case .
This problem -- which is called the collision problem -- does n't quite capture the difficulty of all SZK problems , but it 's close enough for our purposes .
Now , how many queries to f do you need to solve the collision problem ?
If you use a classical probabilistic algorithm , then it's not hard to see that √N queries are necessary and sufficient .
As in the famous " birthday paradox " ( where if you put 23 people in a room , there 's at least even odds that two of the people share a birthday ) , you get a square - root savings over the naïve bound , since what matters is the number of pairs for which a collision could occur .
But unfortunately , if N is exponentially large ( as it is in the situations we 're thinking about ) , then √N is still completely prohibitive : the square root of an exponential is still an exponential .
So what about quantum algorithms ?
In 1997 , Brassard , Høyer , and Tapp showed how to combine the √N savings from the birthday paradox with the unrelated √N savings from Grover 's algorithm , to obtain a quantum algorithm that solves the collision problem in ( this is going to sound a joke ) ~ N1/3 queries .
So , yes , quantum computers do give at least a slight advantage for this problem .
But is that the best one can do ?
Or could there be a better quantum algorithm , that solves the collision problem in ( say ) log ( N ) queries , or maybe even less ?
In 2002 I proved the first nontrivial lower bound on the quantum query complexity of the collision problem , showing that any quantum algorithm needs at least ~ N1/ 5 queries .
This was later improved to ~ N1/3 by Yaoyun Shi , thereby showing that Brassard , Høyer , and Tapp 's algorithm was indeed optimal .
On the other hand -- to get back to our topic -- suppose you could see the whole trajectory of a hidden variable .
In that case , I claim that you could solve the collision problem with only a constant number of queries ( independent of N ) !
How ?
The first step is to prepare the state
Now measure the second register ( which we wo n't need from this point onwards ) , and think only about the resulting state of the first register .
If f is one - to - one , then in the first register you 'll get a classical state of the form i , for some random i .
If f is two - to - one , on the other hand , then you 'll get a state of the form , where i and j are two values with f( i ) = f( j ) .
If only you could perform a further measurement to tell these states apart !
But alas , as soon as you measure you destroy the quantum coherence , and the two types of states look completely identical to you .
Aha , but remember we get to see an entire hidden - variable trajectory !
Here 's how we can exploit that .
Starting from the state , first apply a Hadamard gate to every qubit .
This produces a " soup " of exponentially many basis vectors -- but if we then Hadamard every qubit a second time , we get back to the original state .
Now , the idea is that when we Hadamard everything , the particle " forgets " whether it was at i or j .
( This can be proven under some weak assumptions on the hidden - variable theory . )
Then , when we observe the history of the particle , we 'll learn something about whether the state had the form i or .
For in the former case the particle will always return to i , but in the latter case it will " forget , " and will need to pick randomly between i and j .
As usual , by repeating the " juggling " process polynomially many times one can make the probability of failure exponentially small .
( Note that this does not require observing more than one hidden - variable trajectory : the repetitions can all happen within a single trajectory . )
What are the assumptions on the hidden - variable theory that are needed for this to work ?
The first is basically that if you have a bunch of qubits and you apply a Hadamard to one of them , then you should only get to transfer between hidden - variable basis states that differ in the first qubit .
Raymond :
Does this say that the hidden variables are related one - to - one to qubits ?
A : Well , it does nontrivially constrain how the hidden variables can work .
Note , though , that this assumption is very different from ( and weaker than ) requiring the hidden - variable theory to be " local " , in the sense physicists usually mean by that .
No hidden - variable theory can be local ( I think some guy named Bell proved that ) .
And the second assumption is that the hidden - variable theory is " robust " to small errors in the unitaries and quantum states .
( This assumption is needed to define the complexity class DQP in a reasonable way . )
As we 've seen , DQP contains both BQP and the Graph Isomorphism problem .
But interestingly , at least in the black - box model , DQP does not contain the NP - complete problems .
( More formally , there exists an oracle A such that NPA ⊄DQPA . )
The proof of this formalizes the intuition that , even as the hidden variable bounces around the quantum haystack , the chance that it ever hits the needle is vanishingly small .
It turns out that in the hidden - variable model , you can search an unordered list of size N using ~3√N queries instead of the ~ √N you 'd get from Grover 's algorithm , but this is still exponential .
The upshot is even that DQP has severe computational complexity limitations .
Gus :
Does this imply that hidden - variable theories are n't that outlandish ?
A : Well , at least they do n't fail this one test !

U.S. director Clint Eastwood attends a news conference for the film " The Exchange " at the 61st Cannes Film Festival May 20 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jean - Paul Pelissier
BERLIN ( Reuters Life ! ) - Veteran actor and director Clint Eastwood rejected criticism from fellow U.S. director Spike Lee that his films “ Flags of Our Fathers ” and “ Letters from Iwo Jima ” failed to recognize the role of African - American soldiers .
In an interview with Germany ’s Focus magazine , Eastwood said it was nonsense to suggest he had “ erased the role of black GIs from history ” .
He said there were no Afro-Americans in those films because there were no Afro-American soldiers involved .
“ Does he know anything about American history ? ” Eastwood told Focus when asked about Lee ’s criticism .
“ The U.S. military was segregated til the Korean War , and the blacks in World War Two were totally segregated .
The only black battalion on Iwo Jima was a small munitions supply unit that came to the beach .
“ The story was about the men who raised the flag and we ca n’t make them black if they were not there .
So tell him :
Why do n’t you go back and study your history and stop mouthing off ! ”
Lee had said in an interview with Reuters that Hollywood has mostly ignored the role played by black American soldiers and has made a film about the racially segregated , all - black 92nd Buffalo Division which fought against Nazi occupation in Italy .
“ Many black veterans who fought in Iwo Jima were hurt that there was no representation of them in both of those films , ” Lee said in the 2007 interview in Rome .
“ Flags of Our Fathers ” deals with the U.S. soldiers who raised the flag while “ Letters from Iwo Jima ” looks at the battle from the Japanese point of view .
“ Very few Hollywood films deal with black soldiers , ” Lee said .
“ For the most part , if you look at the history of Hollywood cinema they have n’t dealt with anybody other than white Americans .
If you think Hollywood and World War Two , you think John Wayne -- the great white male that saved the world . ”
SACRAMENTO , California ( Reuters ) - A California bill proposing a 25 percent tax on revenues from adult entertainment would do little to ease the state ’s budget shortfall and would cost the state money by encouraging its pornography industry to move , opponents said on Monday as lawmakers reviewed the bill .
The legislation would especially hurt the economy of the San Fernando Valley , the Hollywood of pornographic filmmaking , said opponents , who included several dancers and other adult entertainment performers and employees at a hearing on the bill in the state capital , Sacramento .
“ This will decimate the San Fernando Valley , ” Larry Kaplan , executive director of the California branch of the Association of Club Executives , a group representing adult entertainment clubs , told Reuters .
“ We estimate it would take $ 3.5 billion out of California , ” Kaplan added , referring to the economic activity the state could lose if it were to tax strip - club performances , porn - shop sales and adult Web site revenues at a 25 percent rate .
Matt Gray , a lobbyist for the state ’s adult entertainment industry , echoed the familiar refrain of mainstream small and big businesses directed at lawmakers who propose raising business taxes : “ It ’s an unfriendly business climate here . ”
If porn - film production costs are pushed up , California ’s adult movie - makers will have even more reason to shoot movies elsewhere , Gray said , adding that Budapest is giving the San Fernando Valley , north of Los Angeles , a run for porn - film production money .
“ It ’s actually cheaper to fly everyone to Budapest to do their shoots there and to fly them back , ” Gray said .
FINANCIAL , SOCIAL FIX
Assemblyman Charles Calderon had proposed his bill to help raise revenues for the cash - strapped state .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has forecast a $ 20 billion budget shortfall .
But additional tax revenues from the adult entertainment activity would also help defray social costs associated with it , including crime , drug abuse and sexually transmitted diseases , according to Calderon , the Democratic chairman of the chamber ’s committee on revenues and taxation .
“ This tax would cover the gamut of adult entertainment , ” he told fellow lawmakers .
His bill would tax production , distribution , retail sales , Internet downloads and performances of adult entertainment .
“ Every second , $ 3,000 is being spent on adult entertainment , ” Calderon said .
“ Every 39 minutes , a new adult video is being made in the United States . ”
Former porn actress Shelley Lubben spoke in favor of Calderon ’s bill , detailing to lawmakers her history of prostitution , drug abuse and sexually transmitted disease while in the industry .
“ I really do n’t think the state understands the problem , ” Lubben said .
“ It literally took me eight years to recover . ”

( AOL Autos ) -- I have been in the auto repair industry since 1972 .
Hmmmm , a simple calculation of the math illustrates that I have been in car repair for , uh , well , let 's not go there .
It makes me depressed .
You do the math and keep it to yourself .
At any rate , enough about my mid life crisis .
Let 's talk about oil change intervals .
Oil changes can be done every 4,000 to 5,000 miles instead of the previously suggested 3,000 miles .
For years the accepted oil change interval ( as per the carmakers ) has been every three months or 3,000 miles , whichever comes first .
Why ?
Because the oils of yesterday degraded and broke down when left in the crankcase environment for longer than the prescribed interval .
The combination of heat , friction , and the oil oxidizing over time resulted in an unholy clothing of the engine 's internal parts called sludge .
As an automotive machinist for a good part of my career , I can tell you that sludge is an engine killer .
Sludge takes a greasy , cake - like oily form and plugs oil return passages and acts like a sponge and soaks up good oil to grow its grotesque form starving the engine of vital lubricants .
Once established , engine heat crystallizes it to a hardened rock of ughhhhhh , I have spent many an hour scraping and yes , sometimes chiseling established sludge from the inside of an engine before performing a machining operation on it !
As the machinist prepares to perform a machine operation on a cylinder head , crankshaft , engine block or the likes he / she must clean their work meticulously before performing the prescribed operation .
If the sludge is not cleaned properly , the result will be a failed engine .
Why this lesson about sludge ?
Because without clean good quality oil in your car 's engine , it will develop sludge and cause premature engine failure .
Now more than ever before , vehicle engines operate at high heat and close tolerances .
The reason for this is the Federal Emissions mandates the government has imposed on the carmakers .
Vehicles have to emit a smidgeon of the tailpipe emissions they did a decade ago .
Carmakers have risen to this occasion by increasing combustion chamber temps with higher compression engines , running leaner fuel systems , adjusting ignition timing for optimum emissions , narrowing cooling system water jackets , and tightening engine oil tolerances .
All this makes for hotter running engines that emit less tailpipe emissions .
Putting these demands on engines requires a lubricant that can stand up to this harsh environment .
Hence , petroleum companies ' work hand in hand with carmakers to develop engine lubricants to meet the requirements and demands of a particular powerplant , still delivering the advertised horsepower and torque output that consumers expect .
Research and development between carmakers and petroleum companies has resulted in improved engine lubricants that properly lubricate your vehicle 's engine as well as keep the inside clean of sludge buildup , and can go longer between oil changes !
A pioneer in extending oil change intervals ...
A few years back , GM introduced a system called the OLM ( Oil Life Monitor ) system .
This system had been in testing since 1984 and actually was put into some Buicks on a test basis .
The goal of this system ?
To extend oil change intervals and attain bragging rights to having a more maintenance - free vehicle .
The OLM monitors crankcase temp , moisture , and combustion chamber events ( this represents the actual work the engine is doing while in operation ) .
By closely monitoring these elements of engine operation the system can measure the serviceable life of the oil to within 10 percent .
After officially introducing the OLM with virtually no engine failures attributed it the OLM , GM changes their service recommendations to what they called an " Enhanced Maintenance Schedule . "
With the Enhanced Schedule , the motorist need only follow the dictates of the OLM and have other scheduled services done at prescribed intervals .
Ford Motor Company has followed GM into the extended oil change interval march .
Four months ago ( March of this year )
Ford announced that they are revising engine oil change intervals to every 7,500 miles .
Ford told The Associated Press last year it was increasing the recommended time between oil changes because extensive testing indicated oils now were better and improved engines operate at higher a temperature which helps burn off the gunk in oil .
The automaker also cited the financial and environmental benefits of the adjusted standards .
Yes oil is much better than it used to be , engines are better protected with today 's new lubricants but the same old logic still applies to the oil filter : always use a good quality filter when having the engine oil changed .
The filter is the storehouse for dirt in the engine and when it does n't do its job , the engine suffers internally .
When dirt and grit are allowed to circulate over , within and on the engine bearing surfaces , cylinder walls , crankshafts , piston rings , camshafts and virtually all metal mating surfaces , they are damaged resulting in wider oil tolerances , lowered oil pressure and ultimately premature engine failure .
While I concur with R&D results over the years with respect to oil change intervals , I am still squeamish about leaving petroleum - based oil in an engine for 7,500 miles .
I guess I just know too much based on personal experience .
So while yes , I have revised my thinking regarding extending oil change intervals :
Here are my revised oil change recommendations : change regular petroleum based oils every 4,000 to 5,000 miles and synthetic every 5,000 to 7,000 miles .
There , those of you that for years have criticized me as being in the back pocket of petroleum companies for recommending 3,000 mile oil changes , are you happy now ?

Trunk - cams in action
Cameras held by elephants ' trunks have been used to provide an intimate view of tigers in the jungle .
Because the big cats are used to the presence of elephants , the tusked giants were able to get far closer to them than a human film crew ever could .
Thanks to the " trunk - cams " , the team was able to follow four newborn tiger cubs all the way through to adulthood .
The footage was recorded over a period of three years in the Pench National Park in India .
Newborns filmed
It is the basis of a three - part BBC One series : Tiger - Spy in the Jungle , which is narrated by Sir David Attenborough .
Series producer John Downer , from John Downer Productions , said : " Tigers are so secretive and they live in such dense jungle that it is very difficult for a human film crew to get close to them .
" But elephants are the ultimate four - by - four camera vehicle - and have allowed us to film these animals closer than we have ever been able to film them before . "
The crew used three types of high - definition cameras , designed and built by Geoff Bell and operated by cameraman Michael Richards :
A remotely - operated trunk - cam , which could film while the elephants were on the move and could also be set down .
A remotely - operated tusk - cam , which was smaller than the trunk cam and could be carried by the elephants for much longer periods .
Log and rock cams - cameras disguised as logs or rocks - which could be set down either by an elephant or human crew member and were activated by motion sensors .
At the waterhole Mr Downer said : " The elephants were remarkably stable - almost like a steady - cam , and they only needed a little bit of training to carry and set down the cameras .
" With these cameras , anywhere a tiger went or whatever it did , we could keep on filming it .
They were the ultimate filming devices . "
Mr Downer added : " This sort of thing has n't been done before .
" It is a bit of a bonkers idea , and in my wildest dreams , when I thought about the challenges of filming tigers , I never thought we would suceed in doing what we did in this way , but now it seems the most natural thing in the world . "
The cameras also recorded other animals , including langur monkeys , sloth bears and red dogs .
Curious langur monkeys caught on log-cam
The first programme of Tiger - Spy in the Jungle will be shown on BBC One on Sunday 30 March at 2000 GMT

Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) left , and his wife Cindy listen as McCain is introduced at a McCain 2008 campaign rally in Portsmouth , NH .
Anti-war group posts McCain ' gotcha ' videos
Two videos of Sen. John McCain calling for withdrawal of U.S. forces from past conflicts in Haiti and Somalia have been posted on YouTube by the antiwar group Americans Against Escalation in Iraq .
In the clips , the Arizona Republican uses arguments similar to those he has criticized opponents of the war in Iraq for using today .
His opposition to withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq has been a major feature of his 2008 presidential campaign .

" It 's intellectually dishonest to compare the situations in Haiti and Somalia to the current situation in Iraq , " said McCain spokesman Matt David .
" Number one , we live in a post 9/11 world .
Number two , we 're dealing with the volatility of the Middle East .
And number three and most importantly , Haitians and Somalians do not want to follow us home and attack us on American soil . "
In the videos , McCain addresses the following :
On Haiti , Oct. 6 , 1994 , in support of a resolution to withdraw : “ ( T ) he resolution offers support for the withdrawal of United States Armed Forces as soon as possible .
In my view that does not mean as soon as order is restored to Haiti .
It does not mean as soon as democracy is flourishing in Haiti .
It does not mean as soon as we have established a viable nation in Haiti .
As soon as possible means as soon we can get out of Haiti without losing any American lives . ”
On Somalia , Oct. 14 , 1993 , in support of a similar resolution : “ Mr. President , can anyone seriously argue that another six months of United States forces in harm ’s way means the difference between peace and prosperity in Somalia and war and starvation there ?
Is that very dim prospect worth one more American life ?
No , it is not . ”
At the end of the Somalia clip , McCain draws connections between the situation there and in Lebanon : “ The tragedy in Beirut : 240 young Marines lost their lives , but we got out .
Now is the time for us to get out of Somalia , as rapidly , and as promptly , and as safely as possible . ”

New footage proves that Bhutto was shot
P rime Minister Manmohan Singh [ Images ] described Benzair Bhutto as 'one of the outstanding leaders of our sub- continent , who always looked for reconciliation between India and Pakistan ' .
Most magazines are doing cover stories on her .
Bhutto is on the verge of becoming a ' martyr of democracy ' .
It is a sad that a mother of three children was so brutally killed and we all mourn her terrible death .
Full coverage : Benazir Bhutto killed
Nevertheless , truth must be told .
For , as usual , what the press says is not exactly what happened .
Firstly , under Bhutto , anti-Indian terrorism in the Kashmir region was fostered and increased .
Benazir was also directly responsible for the ethnic cleansing of Hindus in Kashmir .
" She was instrumental in sponsoring jihad , openly inciting militants to intensify terrorism in India , " says Ajai Sahni , the executive director of the New Delhi - based Institute for Conflict Management .
" I find it very difficult to discover a single element with her relationship to India that is positive and for the betterment of her country or the region , " he adds .
Remember how she was shouting her slogans of azaadi , and exhorting the people of Kashmir to cut Jagmohan , then governor of the state , into pieces , as in " jag - jag , mo - mo , han - han " .
She would say this while making chopping motions with her right hand as it moved from her left wrist to the elbow , leaving nobody in any doubt as to what she meant .
Secondly , under Bhutto , the Taliban formed and , helped by Pakistan 's intelligence service , swept across Afghanistan and later hosted Osama bin Laden .
It is a bit of an irony that she may have been killed by the very people she helped foster if at all she was murdered .
We South Asians like our leaders dead
Thirdly , she deliberately increased tension levels and then threatened India with a pre-emptive nuclear strike .
The tension peaked when Bhutto repeated her late father 's immortal boast of waging a 1,000 - year war against India .
Even Rajiv Gandhi was forced to mock her in Parliament , asking if those who talked of a 1,000 - year war could last even a 1,000 hours .
And fourthly , in her last speech before she died , she alluded to India as one of the threats Pakistan had to face , implying that if she was elected she would deal firmly with it .
Then why is it that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh calls her a friend of India and that Indians mount candlelight vigils in the Gateway of India for her ?
I interviewed Benazir Bhutto [ Images ] twice , the second time as she was campaigning to be re-elected for a second term .
The first question I asked , was about Kashmir , as she was the one who had called for Azad Kashmir , a Kashmir free from India , which had triggered the ethnic cleansing of most of the Hindus of the Valley of Kashmir -- 400,000 of them had to flee their ancestral land .
" You know , " she answered , " You have to understand the Pakistani point of view on Kashmir .
If one goes by the logic of Partition , then at least the Kashmir valley , which is in great majority Muslim -- and it should be emphasised that for long the Hindus Pandits in Kashmir exploited and dominated the Muslims , who are getting back at them today -- should have reverted to Pakistan .
But let us say that officially we want to help grant Kashmiris their right to self - determination . "
" That 's the only reason ? " I continued .
" No , " answered Benazir .
" It should be clear also that Pakistan never forgot the humiliating loss of Bangladesh at the hands of India , although India claims it only helped Bangladesh to gain its freedom in the face of what the Bangladeshis say was Pakistani genocide .
Zia 's emergence was a result of that humiliation . "
" But Zia hanged your father � " I interrupted .
" Yes and I hate him and god the almighty already punished him for that , " said Benazir , alluding to Zia 's death in a plane crash .
" But Zia did one thing right , he started the whole policy of proxy war by supporting the separatist movements in Punjab and Kashmir , as a way of getting back at India . "
" What about Pakistan ' nuclear bomb ? " I asked .
" That 's my father 's work , " she said proudly .
" He realised , after having lost the 1965 and 1971 wars with India , that both numerically and strategically , we can never beat India in a conventional conflict .
Thus he initiated the programme by saying that ' We will get the nuclear bomb , even if we have to eat grass ' . "
" But is it not a dangerous weapon if it falls in the hands of the fundamentalists of your country ? " I asked .
Anti-Bhutto army factions behind the murder ?
" No such danger , " Benazir answered .
" Anyway , it is not only a deterrent against India 's military conventional superiority and an answer to India 's own nuclear capability , but also the ultimate weapon to re-assert Islam 's moral superiority . "
" We in Europe are going to unite in a Common Market , why do n't Pakistan and India forget their differences and form some kind of confederation with other South Asian countries , instead of killing each other ? "
I asked .
" Pakistan and India were never one country , " answered the imperious lady .
" They were only kept together by force , whether by Mauryan , Moghul or British rule .
Hindus have recognised the reality of Islam , and we needed our own country to feel free . "
I was flabbergasted : here was a lady educated in Oxford and Harvard , who mouthed such irrational statements .
She spoke good English , was pretty , articulate and pleased the press .
But when in power , she had to resort to anti-Indianism to please her voters .
Her husband was known as Mr 10 Per Cent .
She was hounded out of power twice for incompetence and corruption .
Is she then a martyr of democracy ?
History will tell .
( Adds detail from arrival ceremony )
WASHINGTON , April 15 ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict arrived in Washington for his first papal visit to the United States on Tuesday after declaring himself " deeply ashamed " by a sexual abuse scandal tarnishing the Roman Catholic Church 's image here .
On his flight from Rome , the pope vowed to keep pedophiles out of the priesthood .
The scandal of priests sexually abusing youths broke in 2002 and has forced U.S. dioceses to pay over $ 2 billion in damages .
Five have gone bankrupt .
The six - day visit includes a United Nations address , masses in baseball stadiums and meetings with Catholic educators and leaders of other religions , but the abuse scandal has shaken the Church so much that the German - born pope addressed it even before landing .
President George W. Bush greeted the pontiff on arrival at Andrews Air Force Base outside the U.S. capital , the first time he has gone to the airport to meet an incoming dignitary .
Neither made a public statement , but onlookers sang " Happy Birthday " for Benedict , who turns 81 on Wednesday .
" We will absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry , " Benedict told reporters on his flight across the Atlantic .
The Church will screen candidates for the priesthood , he said , " so that only really sound persons can be admitted . "
" It is more important to have good priests than to have many priests , " Benedict said .
Polls say three - quarters of U.S. Catholics approve of the pope , but just as many say they disapprove of the defensive way the Church first responded to the sexual abuse crisis .
The pontiff said he would discuss the sensitive topic of immigration with Bush , especially the way it split families and strained " the moral and social fabric " of poor countries .
" The United States has to help these countries develop , " he said during the flight , so their citizens do not feel they must leave .
" It is in the interest of everyone , not only these countries but of the world and particularly of the United States . "
He also praised the role of faith in American public life as an example for more secularized Europe .
VIEW FROM THE UNITED STATES
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Bush and Benedict would probably discuss " their shared values of human rights and the importance of fighting extremism and also promoting religious tolerance " at the White House on Wednesday .
During his six - day trip , Benedict will also pray at Ground Zero , the site in New York where the World Trade Center was destroyed on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
A Washington Post - ABC news poll published on Tuesday showed almost three - quarters of U.S. Catholics approve of Pope Benedict but most find the Church out of touch with their views and criticize the way the sex abuse scandal was handled .
Half wanted the pope to stress traditional teachings and 45 percent preferred policies that " reflect the attitudes and lifestyles of modern Catholics . "
Most Americans view the pontiff favorably , but he is not as popular as his immediate predecessor , John Paul II , a poll by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life showed .
Benedict said the sexual abuse scandal caused " great suffering " to the Church in the United States and also " for me personally . "
" It 's difficult for me to understand how it was possible that priests betrayed in this way their mission to give healing , to give the love of God to these children , " he said .
Several victims of the pedophile priest scandal denounced Benedict 's comments as hollow and insincere during a news conference in Boston , where the scandal erupted in 2002 .
" He should be ashamed that he is not meeting with survivors and talking with us , " said Robert Costello , founder of A Matter of Truth , a Boston - based organization for victims of sexual abuse by priests .
The pope , who marks the third anniversary of his election during the trip , has said he hopes the visit will lead to a spiritual renewal in America .
His U.N. address on Friday will aim to highlight the need for greater peace and justice around the world .
In New York , Benedict will also make a brief stop at a synagogue to wish the Jewish community a happy Passover .

いらなくなったバイクをそのままにしてしまっていませんか？
バイクは売ることができます。バイクを買取に出す時は、一括見積もりで査定してもらうのがいいでしょう。
その理由には何があるのでしょうか。また、実際にどうしたら効率よく売ることができるのでしょうか。
今回は、バイクを売りたくなったらどうすればいいのかについてお伝えしていきます。
中古査定というと、バイクや車が挙げられます。中古車は、それまでその車なりバイクを使っていたが、いかに使っていたかによっても、状態は変わってきます。
同じ車種であっても、それぞれ異なる車歴を持っているのです。このように、一台ずつ状態が異なる中古車を正確に評価していくことが大切です。
バイクを売るのに適した方法があります 不要になったバイクを売りたいけれど、本当に売ることはできるの～？と不安に感じている人もいるでしょう。
しかしながら、バイクは売ることができます。
その例としては、オークションで自分で売る方法があります。
あるいは、中古バイク業者同士でバイクを売りさばいているバイク買取業者に売ることもできます（バイクランドなど）
オークションでバイクを売りさばいているバイク買取業者に売ることもできるでしょう。
中古バイクを高く売るためには仲介手数料を省くことが大事
バイクは仲介手数料が掛からない分、自分で売りさばいてしまうのが、やはり一番高く売れるでしょう。
しかしながら、自分で売りさばく場合には多少の知識も必要です。
手間がかなりかかってしまうのも、心得ていた方がいいでしょう。
さらに、取引額や売却後のバイクのトラブルで、相手と揉めてしまう可能性も否めません…。
思わぬトラブルに巻き込まれてしまうこともあるのです。
従って、個人でバイクを売りたいと考えている人は、業者に買い取ってもらうのがまず一番と言えるでしょう。
一番高く売れる方法とは？ 業者に売る時、少しでも高く売りたいですよね。 高く売るコツとしては、中古のバイクしか店内に置いていなくて、かつ店舗内に修理場があるバイク屋で売ることです。
こうすると、高く売れる可能性が高いです。なぜかというと全部自社内で行えるということもあり、手数料の関係が限りなく抑えられるからでもあります。
他業者と競争にかけるとさらに買取価格がアップ？
これは上級者向けになりますが、業者にバイクを売ろうとする時に、他の業者と競争させることによって、適正価格あるいはそれ以上の価格で売ることができます。
バイクを買い取った業者は、バイクを売るのが目的です。
あなたの売りたいバイクを欲しがっている人は、業者の顧客リストの中にいた場合、不良在庫になるリスクもなく、バイクを多少高くても買い取ろうとするでしょう。
それでは反対に、そうでない業者の場合は、かなりの率でふっかけようとしています。
多数の業者に見積もりをかけることによって、この可能性を回避することができるでしょう。
査定に来た査定員は、その日に契約を取りたがるでしょうが、自分が納得できるような金額にならない限り、譲らない方がいいでしょう。
中古バイクを高く売るためには仲介手数料を省くことが大事
「 私は気弱だから無理！」と思っている人は、自らバイク店に出向いて一つずつ査定してもらうといいでしょう。
見積もりの交渉に進んだら、会話の内容を念のため録音しておくといいです。
後になって、「証拠」として役立つかもしれないからです。 ただの口八丁かどうか後で吟味するためにも、録音したデータを持って、馴染みのバイク店などで聞いてもらうようにしましょう。
バイク引取り後に見積もり額と違う金額を提示してくれるところもあるため、このような場合には、「録音したデータとバイク写真をネットに公開して、皆さんに判断してもらいますね」などと言えば、引き下がってくれるでしょう。
売るタイミングを見極めること どのような時期に売るのかによっても、バイクの値段は変わってきます。
一番いいのは、3月と4月です。 春休みやゴールデンウィークに向けてバイクを買おう！という人が増えるのです。
反対におすすめできないのは、12月、1月、2月の時期です。
この時期は繁忙期というわけではなく、購入する人達も少ないため、業者側は安く見積もってしまいがちです。
それ以外の期間だと、いつ販売してもそれほど変動はないでしょう。ただし、新車種が出た場合には、一気に値崩れする可能性もありません。 結局、「売りたい！」って思った時が売り時なのでしょう。
高く売るためのコツ～精一杯ごねる 幾分か強行手段になりますが、もしも査定金額に納得いかないような場合には、精一杯ごねるようにしましょう。
高い買取金額でない限りは、業者にそこそこ利益は出てくるものです。
業者が一番嫌がるのは、査定気に来たのにバイクを売ってもらえないことです。
無料査定とうたっていますが、業者側も商売です。
何時間もかけて査定に来てあげたのに、「あ、やっぱりいいです。他で売りますから」なんて言われたら、たまったものじゃありませんよね。
人件費も無駄になってしまいますし、交通費だって損になります。
Super Collider lab now gathering weeds near Dallas SUPER COLLIDER
Behind a scientific success , a failed Texas experiment
A shell of a lab that would have dwarfed Europe 's accelerator now gathers weeds near Dallas
Congress canceled the Superconducting Super Collider 15 years ago , and today the project 's buildings outside Waxahachie remain deserted .

COLLEGE STATION —
Under a leaden sky that mirrored his mood , physicist Peter McIntyre eyed a long submarine - shaped magnet resting on the ground .
Had the Superconducting Super Collider been completed south of Dallas as planned , the magnet would now lie in a 54 - mile - long tunnel , accelerating bits of matter to near the speed of light , producing spectacular collisions and re-creating conditions that existed at the universe 's beginning .
But after spending billions of dollars , Congress axed the SSC 15 years ago .
The magnet now sits outside McIntyre 's lab near the Texas A&M University campus , a weathered reminder of what might have been and an apt metaphor for the state of U.S. high - energy physics .
" It 's just a shame , " McIntyre said .
Later this year , the Switzerland - based CERN laboratory is scheduled to fire up a new particle accelerator near Geneva .
By laying claim to the world 's most powerful collider , Europeans will wrest leadership in high - energy physics away from the U.S. after 80 years of American hegemony .
" Europe 's now playing in the major leagues , and we 're in the minors , " said A&M physicist Bhaskar Dutta .
American physicists have dominated the field since the 1930s , when Ernest Lawrence and colleagues at the University of California at Berkeley developed the first cyclotron , an early particle accelerator .
Atomic secrets
The device allowed scientists to discover atomic secrets by accelerating protons to high speeds , slamming them into a target and studying new particles the collisions produced .
The discoveries led , in part , to the development of the atomic bomb .
Later spinoffs included the development of cancer therapies and the processing of a host of materials , such as semiconductor chips .
After World War II , the United States built a number of evermore powerful accelerators , culminating with the Tevatron at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago .
The machines seek to create highly energetic collisions between atomic particles .
Only at high energies do the smallest , most exotic particles - which existed at the beginning of the universe — briefly appear .
Existing accelerators already achieve collisions near the speed of light , so the only way to reach higher energies is to build larger rings through which the particles travel .
The Tevatron ring measures about 4 miles in circumference .
The SSC ring was to have been 54 miles in circumference , producing collisions 20 times more intense than the Tevatron .
The new European accelerator , called the Large Hadron Collider , will not be as powerful as the mighty SSC would have been .
The Large Hadron Collider 's ring , about 17 miles in circumference , should be capable of producing collisions about one - third as powerful .
The deserted scene
" The SSC would unquestionably have made Texas an exciting center of fundamental research , " said Steven Weinberg , a Nobel laureate and physics professor at the University of Texas at Austin .
" We terribly regret this wasted opportunity .
I 'm even sorry for the farmers in Ellis County who had to give up their houses and move away for no reason . "
A drive to the main , 135 - acre site just west of Waxahachie yields such a sensation of waste .
Amid a pastoral countryside where corn fields mix with scattered country homes , the SSC 's main buildings rise incongruously above the plain .
The boxy , forlorn structures could house large commercial airplanes .
The tunnels were filled in long ago .
The site , for all practical purposes , is abandoned .
So little used are the surrounding roads that truck - driving instructors use them for training .
Before the project 's cancellation , about 16,000 acres of land were condemned , including about 90 homes .
Afterward , the land and buildings were largely deeded to the state , which in turn transferred the property to Ellis County .
Bits and pieces were sold .
However , the main buildings and an accompanying 135 acres of land remained unsold until 2006 , when a group that included J.B.
Hunt , founder of the billion - dollar trucking empire , purchased the property with the intent of marketing it as a high - tech secure data center .
After Hunt 's death , his estate abandoned those plans .
Earlier proposals — for prisons , schools , movie studios and a Veterans Administration facility — met a similar fate .
" I 'm not happy about it , not one bit , " said one of the SSC 's original champions , U.S. Rep .
Joe Barton , a Republican whose district includes Ellis County .
The despair stands in stark contrast to the mood in Europe .
" The attitude here is one of wild enthusiasm , " said Paul Padley , a Rice University physicist in charge of building a $ 40 million collision detector for the Large Hadron Collider .
" We 're motivated by the physics questions we 're trying to answer , and we 're willing to move heaven and Earth to get the experiment built to answer these fundamental questions about the universe , " Padley said .
The United States has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the European collider , which may cost as much as $ 10 billion , giving American scientists a stake in the project .
" Still , it 's incredibly hard for Americans to be effective on a European experiment , " said David Toback , an A&M physicist who has worked on the Tevatron and now works on one of the Large Hadron Collider experiments .
That 's because Europeans will generally run the large experimental collaborations , interpret the results and publish them .
They 'll get the lion 's share of glory .
The SSC 's cancellation followed more than a decade of planning and construction .
McIntyre , a magnet designer , was among the earliest evangelists for a Texas accelerator , and he helped arrange an early meeting with then Vice President George H.W. Bush to prod the project along .
Bush helped put it on the fast track .
But internal and external forces began working against the project , said Neal Lane , a Rice physicist who served on the SSC 's board of overseers and later as President Bill Clinton 's science adviser .
From 1987 to 1993 , the project 's estimated price tag ballooned from about $ 4.4 billion to as much as $ 12 billion .
Some physicists say this reflected poor management .
But other factors were involved , Lane said .
Expected money from external sources , such as Japan , never came .
In the early 1990s , budget cutting was in vogue .
And the Texas delegation , with Lloyd Bentsen leaving the Senate to become secretary of the Treasury Department , lost some of its clout .
As the Cold War ended , the SSC lost support to the international space station , which had a comparable cost and offered an opportunity for rapprochement with the Russians .
" Congress had to have some symbol of fiscal restraint , and we were it , " said Roy Schwitters , a UT physicist and the SSC 's director .
Pulling the plug
So , after spending more than $ 2 billion and digging 14 miles of tunnels , Congress canceled the project in October 1993 .
Science fiction author Bruce Sterling captured the mood among physicists during a visit to Waxahachie .
" To say that morale is low at the SSC Labs does not begin to capture the sentiment there , " he wrote in an essay titled " The Dead Collider . "
At the time , 2,000 people remained at the project , winding it down .
They stayed , Sterling wrote , " because , despite their alleged facility at transforming themselves into neurophysiologists , arms control advocates , et al. , there is simply not a whole lot of market demand anywhere for particle physicists , at the moment . "
The loss extended to Waxahachie and the state in general .
The accelerator would have attracted thousands of physicists and brought a new economic and cultural dimension to the area south of Dallas , leading to spinoff computer and cryogenic companies , Lane said .
The opening of the Large Hadron Collider comes at an especially bleak time for U.S. high - energy physics .
Earlier this month , 20 of America 's physics Nobel laureates sent a letter to President Bush , urging him to restore half a billion dollars in fiscal year 2008 science funding .
As a result of the cuts , physicists say , hundreds of scientists have been laid off and research grants have been slashed .
One surviving lab
In the last few years , the number of high - energy physics labs in the United States has been reduced from three to one — Fermilab , which is itself facing a diminished budget .
The " brain drain " that brought brilliant European physicists - such as Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi — to America in the 1930s appears to be reversing , U.S. physicists say .
" The entirety of U.S. high - energy physics is at very significant risk , " said Al McInturff , who helped develop magnets for the Tevatron , SSC and the Large Hadron Collider .
" It 's just a very , very painful situation . "
" That 's something of an understatement , " McIntyre added .

Unifying forces
A string universe .

To understand the ideas and aims of string theory , it 's useful to look back and see how physics has developed from Newton 's time to the present day .
One crucial idea that has driven physics since Newton 's time is that of unification : the attempt to explain seemingly different phenomena by a single overarching concept .
Perhaps the first example of this came from Newton himself , who in his 1687 work Principia Mathematicae explained that the motion of the planets in the solar system , the motion of the Moon around the Earth , and the force that holds us to the Earth are all part of the same thing : the force of gravity .
We take this for granted today , but pre-Newton the connection between a falling apple and the orbit of the Moon would have been far from obvious and quite amazing .
The next key unifying discovery was made around 180 years after Newton by the Scottish mathematician James Clerk Maxwell .
Maxwell showed that electrostatics and magnetism , by no means similar phenomena at first sight , are just different aspects of a single thing called electromagnetism .
In the process Maxwell discovered electromagnetic waves , which are in fact light — Maxwell had inadvertently explained a further seemingly different aspect of nature .
Another two hundred years on , in 1984 , the Pakistani Abdus Salam and the American Steven Weinberg showed that the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force , which causes radioactive decay , are both just different aspects of a single force called the electroweak force .
This leaves us with three fundamental forces of nature : gravity , the electroweak force and the strong nuclear force which holds protons together .
Unifying matter
That deals with the forces , but what about matter ?
Many ancient belief systems have postulated that matter — and reality itself — is made from a finite number of elements .
Modern physics confirms this idea .
Experiments performed with the particle accelerator at CERN in Geneva have shown that there are just twelve basic building blocks of matter .
These are known as the elementary particles .
Everything we 've ever seen in any experiment , here or in distant stars , is made of just these twelve elementary particles .
( See Plus article The physics of elementary particles to find our more . )
All this is truly impressive : the entire Universe , its matter and dynamics explained by just three forces and twelve elementary objects .
It 's good , but we 'd like to do better , and this is where string theory first enters : it is an attempt to unify further .
To understand this , we have to tell another story .
Quantum gravity
There have been two great breakthroughs in the 20th century physics .
Perhaps the most famous is Einstein 's theory of general relativity .
The other equally impressive theory is quantum mechanics .
Massive bodies warp spacetime .
Image coutesy NASA .
General relativity is itself a unification .
Einstein realised that space and time are just different aspects of a single object he called spacetime .
Massive bodies like planets can warp and distort spacetime , and gravity , which we experience as an attractive force , is in fact a consequence of this warping .
Just as a pool ball placed on a trampoline will create a dip that a nearby marble will roll into , so does a massive body like a planet distort space , causing nearby objects to be attracted to it .
The predictions made by general relativity are remarkably accurate .
In fact , most of us will have inadvertently taken part in an experiment that tests general relativity : if it were false , then global positioning systems would be wrong by about 50 metres per day .
The fact that GPSs work to within five metres in ten years shows just how accurate general relativity is .
The other great breakthrough of the 20th century was quantum mechanics .
One of the key ideas here is that the smaller the scale at which you look at the world , the more random things become .
Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle is perhaps the most famous example of this .
The principle states that when you consider a moving particle , for example an electron orbiting the nucleus of an atom , you can never ever measure both its position and its momentum as accurately as you like .
Looking at space at a minuscule scale may allow you to measure position with a lot of accuracy , but there wo n't be much you can say about momentum .
This is n't because your measuring instruments are imprecise .
There simply is n't a " true " value of momentum , but a whole range of values that the momentum can take , each with a certain probability .
In short , there is randomness .
This randomness appears when we look at particles at a small enough scale .
The smaller one looks , the more random things become !
The idea that randomness is part of the very fabric of nature was revolutionary : it had previously been taken for granted that the laws of physics did n't depend on the size of things .
But in quantum mechanics they do .
The scale of things does matter , and the smaller the scale at which you look at nature , the more different from our everyday view of the world it becomes : randomness dominates the small scale world .
What happens to spacetime at small scales ?
Again , this theory has performed very well in experiments .
Technological gadgets that have emerged from quantum theory include the laser and the microchip that populate every computer , mobile phone and MP3 player .
But what happens if we combine quantum mechanics and relativity ?
According to relativity , spacetime is something that can stretch and bend .
Quantum mechanics says that on small scales things get random .
Putting these two ideas together implies that on very small scales spacetime itself becomes random , pulling and stretching , until it eventually pulls itself apart .
Evidently , since spacetime is here and this has n't happened , there must be something wrong with combining relativity and quantum mechanics .
But what ?
Both these theories are well - tested and believed to be true .
Perhaps we have made a hidden assumption ?
It turns out that indeed we have .
The assumption is that it 's possible to consider smaller and smaller distances and get to the point where spacetime pulls itself apart .
What has rested in the back of our minds is that the basic indivisible building blocks of nature are point - like — but this may not necessarily be true .
Strings to the rescue
This is where string theory comes to the rescue .
It suggests that there is a smallest scale at which we can look at the world : we can go that small but no smaller .
String theory asserts that the fundamental building blocks of nature are not like points , but like strings : they have extension , in other words they have length .
And that length dictates the smallest scale at which we can see the world .
What possible advantage could this have ?
The answer is that strings can vibrate .
In fact they can vibrate in an infinite number of different ways .
This is a natural idea in music .
We do n't think that every single sound in a piece of music is produced by a different instrument ; we know that a rich and varied set of sounds can be produced by even just a single violin .
String theory is based on the same idea .
The different particles and forces are just the fundamental strings vibrating in a multitude of different ways .
The mathematics behind string theory is long and complicated , but it has been worked out in detail .
But has anyone ever seen such strings ?
The honest answer is " no " .
The current estimate of the size of these strings is about 10 - 34 m , far smaller than we can see today , even at CERN .
Still , string theory is so far the only known way to combine gravity and quantum mechanics , and its mathematical elegance is for many scientists sufficient reason to keep pursuing it .
The theory 's predictions
If string theory is indeed an accurate model of spacetime , then what else does it tell us about the world ?
One of its more startling and most significant predictions is that spacetime is not four , but ten- dimensional .
It is only in ten dimensions of spacetime that string theory works .
So where are those six extra dimensions ?
The idea of hidden dimensions was in fact put forward many years before the advent of string theory by the German Theodor Kaluza and the Swede Oskar Klein .
Aerial view of the CERN site just outside Geneva .
The underground particle accelerators ( with circumferences of 27 km and 7 km ) allow scientists to look at tiny scales .

Shortly after Einstein described the bending of space in general relativity , Kaluza and Klein considered what would happen if a spatial dimension would bend round and rejoin itself to form a circle .
The size of that circle could be very small , perhaps so small that it could n't be seen .
Those dimensions could then be hidden from view .
Kaluza and Klein did show that in spite of this , these dimensions could still have an effect on the world we perceive .
Electromagnetism becomes a consequence of the hidden circle with motion in the hidden dimension being electric charge .
Hidden dimensions are possible and they in fact can give rise to forces in the dimensions that we can see .
String theory has embraced the Kaluza - Klein idea and currently various experiments are being devised to try and observe the hidden dimensions .
One hope is that the extra dimensions may have left an imprint on the cosmic microwave background , the left - over radiation from the Big Bang , and that a detailed study of this radiation may reveal them .
Other experiments are more direct .
The force of gravity depends crucially on the number of dimensions , so by studying gravitational forces at short distances one can hope to detect deviations from Newton 's law and again see the presence of extra dimensions .
Mathematics and physics have always influenced each other , with new mathematics being invented to describe nature , and old mathematics turning out to lend perfect descriptions for newly - discovered physical phenomena .
String theory is no different and many mathematicians work on ideas inspired by it .
These include the possible geometries of the hidden dimensions , the basic ideas of geometry when there is a minimum distance , the ways in which strings can split and come together , and the question of how we can relate strings to the particles in the world that we see .
String theory gives us an exciting vision of nature as miniscule bits of vibrating string in a space with hidden curled - up dimensions .
All the implications of these ideas are yet to be understood .
String theory is an active area of research with hundreds of people working to see how the theory fits together and produces the world we see around us .

New York magazine reports this morning that another former member of Bill Clinton 's cabinet plans to announce his endorsement of Barack Obama today , joining Bill Richardson on the list of high - profile defections among the Clintons ' longtime personal and political friends .
This time it 's Robert Reich , Bill Clinton 's former Labor secretary , current Berkeley professor and self - described friend of the Clintons for 40 years .
Reich , who has been critical of the Clintons before , despite the friendship , reportedly will announce the endorsement at 10 a.m. PDT on his blog ( cue James Carville ) .
Reich told reporter John Heilemann that he initially intended to stay out of the fray , primarily out of loyalty to the long friendship .
But Clinton 's post - " bitter " ads in Pennsylvania moved him to action .
" I 've come to the point , after seeing those ads , where I can't in good conscience not say out loud what I believe about who should be president .
Those ads are nothing but Republicanism .
They 're lending legitimacy to a Republican message that 's wrong to begin with , and they harken back to the past 20 years of demagoguery on guns and religion .
It 's old politics at its worst — and old Republican politics , not even old Democratic politics .
It 's just so deeply cynical . "

A large area of the city centre has been sealed off
An explosive device has detonated at a restaurant in Exeter .
One person was injured in the explosion at about 1250 BST after a man walked into the Giraffe restaurant in the Princesshay shopping mall .
A large area of the city centre is being evacuated and firearms officers have been sent to the scene .
A police spokesman said one man was in custody with " slight injuries " .
He added the possibility of other devices in the area could not be ruled out .
Officers are currently evacuating the city 's bus station and have extended an exclusion cordon to include the Princesshay centre , Bedford Square , High Street , Queen Street and Paris Street .
Bomb disposal experts have been sent to the restaurant .
Police have asked stores in the area to retain any CCTV footage in case it is needed at a later date .
' Three explosions '
At least one man was injured in the incident , which happened at a time when the recently opened centre would have been crowded with shoppers .
No details have been released about the injured man .
It 's all a bit scary that it happened here
Alison Fewens Juliet Joffe , a director of Giraffe , confirmed to the BBC a " small explosion " had occurred in the restaurant .
She said the restaurant was evacuated " quickly and efficiently " .
Eyewitness Peter Lacey who was in the restaurant with his wife told BBC News : " There were three explosions .
It is my impression they sounded more like gunshots than a bomb , like a lightbulb exploding .
" They came from a locked toilet . "
Alison Fewins , 27 , from Exeter , was shopping with her friend , Louise Platt , also 27 , when the incident happened .

Ms Fewins said : " We were about three or four shops away when we felt a vibration and heard a noise which we thought was building work .
" I am a bit shaken .
It 's all a bit scary that it happened here . "
Devon and Cornwall Police said more resources are being sent to the area .
Assistant Chief Constable Bob Spencer said : " We are carrying out a careful evacuation of the premises using the police and other emergency services that are at the scene .
" We will update the people of Exeter about what has happened as soon as we can .
" In the meantime , I 'd urge motorists to stay away from the city centre area and road delays are likely . "
Commenting on reports of the possibility of further devices he told BBC News : " There 's always that potential . "
The £ 230 m Princesshay development officially opened last September .
The scheme has been heralded as the biggest single investment in regeneration in the city 's history .
It contains a mix of shops , restaurants and apartments .

Many of the people behind identity theft scams are themselves having data stolen from them in the process , a security researcher has revealed .
Phishers , who trick online banking users into typing in their details to fake sites , use tools in the process which have built - in security holes for others to access the data that many do not have the technical skills to spot , according to a security researcher .
Nitesh Dhanjan will next week tell the Black Hat security conference in Washington of the results of his and his colleague Billy Rios 's immersion in the world of phishers .
He told OUT - LAW Radio of his findings this week .
Dhanjani claims that most phishers are far from the technical sophisticates of the popular imagination .
Most , he said , use pre-written phishing kits that take little skill to operate .
" What you see in [ the kits ] is ready made phishing sites , " he said .
" All the research we 've done is just basically what you can do from a web browser without even crossing the line where it 's called hacking . "
Dhanjani said it was extremely easy to come across details that had been stolen just hours previously .
" Within 15 minutes of starting this research we were staring at people 's bank accounts and credit card numbers and ATM PIN numbers posted on international message boards , " he said .
But the authors of the phishing kits are using more junior phishers to do the work for them .
Dhanjani said when he and Rios , who both work for un -named major corporations , looked at the computer code in the kits , they found that it had two different instructions commanding the system to email a victim 's details .
" We realised that in the second mail command there was a hard coded email address that the victim 's information was also going to , " said Dhanjani .
" So unbeknown to the phisher deploying this kit , his information from the victim is going to him in addition to the author who wrote this kit , so there you have a phisher phishing a phisher . "
Gartner estimated that phishing scams cost $ 3.2bn in 2007 , and there are significant costs over and above the money lost because it is often very difficult and time consuming for people to prove that they were not responsible for spending in their name .
Dhanjani said that there is no easy fix to the problem .
He said that until banks and governments have more sophisticated systems than just simple credit card or government identity numbers the problem will continue .
He said , though , that the cost of changing those systems was greater than the sums currently being lost , meaning the systems are unlikely to change soon .

The Orange Order 's new superhero has been given a name , Diamond Dan the Orangeman .
The colourful figure was the focus for unprecedented media attention when he was introduced to the public in November .
He appeared on Orange Institution Christmas cards and proved an instant success .
He will now feature on new badges and other merchandise such as fridge magnets and notebooks .
Grand Lodge launched a competition to name the cartoon figure and there were more than 120 suggestions , many of them from the young people to whom the character was intended to appeal to the most .
A special committee was set up to select the winning name .
Director of Services of the Grand Lodge , David Hume said , ‘ We were delighted with the response to the competition .
There were many strong entries such as Sash Gordon , Sashman and the Boyne Wonder . ’
‘ We picked Diamond Dan the Orangeman for a number of reasons . ’
‘ The name Diamond Dan has resonance going back more than 200 years to the formation of the Institution at the Diamond , Loughall , in 1795 .
Dan Winter was one of the founding fathers of the Order .
It will raise questions , which we can answer as part of our education outreach and explanation of our history . ’
‘ And of course apart from the historical aspect of the name , it has a good ring to it , ’ he said .
The name was the idea of Steven Mitchell a primary school pupil from Lisburn .
He received a cheque from the Grand Treasurer , Mervyn Bishop .
Orange Order education officer David Scott would like him to be a mentor for young people offering advice on a range of matters encompassing the general theme of civic responsibility .
‘ It goes without saying that the Orange superhero will be in favour of young people attending church , helping others and showing respect for the community , ’ he said .
‘ Diamond Dan will be the kind of person who offers his seat on a crowded bus to an elderly lady .
He wo n't drop litter and he will be keen on recycling .
He will also be very committed to the Orange Order and to the Junior movement and will make efforts to know all he can about the history and culture of his community . ’
‘ The whole idea is really a bit of fun and an attempt to make the Orange Order more appealing to young people .
Diamond Dan will not replace King Billy but his creation will give us the chance to promote the true values of being an Orangeman , ’ he said .
Rushbo says he could n't care less who wins the Democratic Party 's presidential nomination .
He just wants the two surviving candidates to beat up on each other as long as possible , hopefully ...
Not because he suddenly likes her after all these years of anti-Clinton rants .
Nor , judging by what he 's said on the air , because he's a huge fan of the presumptive Republican nominee , Sen. John McCain , who is n't conservative enough for the broadcaster .
Usually as shy and retiring as , say , P.T. Barnum , the influ ential conservative radio talk - show host is in his bombastic element these past couple of months , ordering many of his 12 million - plus obedient daily listeners to switch their voting registration presumably from the Republican party and go cast a ballot wherever they are for Sen.
Hillary Clinton .
Rush Limbaugh , the self - appointed Commander - in - Chief of Operation Chaos , is puffing on his immense cigar and gloating at this very moment in his Florida bunker .
And preparing to celebrate two more grand and glorious political victories over Democrats today , no matter who wins the primaries in Indiana and Florida .
into their national convention in Denver in late August .
In fact , the maverick maestro admitted during a Fox News interview Monday that he thinks Sen. Barack Obama will ultimately win the Democratic nomination .
But the freshman Illinois senator will be a lot more bruised than he would have been had he floated to easy victories all winter and into the spring as Clinton fell behind in votes , delegates and money .
Nobody really knows , of course , how influential Limbaugh has actually been , although the promotional publicity for him and his program has been absolutely priceless .
Anecdotal evidence suggests many thousands of Republicans did , in fact , cross over to vote for Clinton , which , frankly , is fine with her .
She 'll take anybody 's vote these days .
All Rush is saying is that he urged Texas Republicans , without a real contest of their own , to cross over and vote for Clinton and she won the state 's popular vote .
And he urged Ohio Republicans to cross over .
And she also won there big - time , raising disturbing doubts about Obama 's ability to win the populous heartland industrial states that Democrats need for a November victory .
And then Rush urged Republicans to cross over in Pennsylvania .
Which they did .
And Clinton won again by nearly 10 points .
So Rush is just saying .
He 's also just saying that Obama has n't won a primary since Feb. 22 , that Clinton has slowed his momentum and landed numerous blows , and Obama and his wife Michelle have stumbled a little on their own with the Rev. Wright business and being proud to be American for the first time and all .
It 's all helped to bring the freshman senator down to earth and turn him into a mortal politician instead of the unstoppable evangelical force he was early on in the nominee selection process coming out of Iowa .
" Our definition of success , " Rush says , " is that there be chaos .
Our original purpose was to bloody up the messianic Obama .
We do n't care which one gets it as long as neither one gets it in the primaries .
We want the fight to proceed into the convention . "
On Sunday during her appearance on ABC's " This Week , " when Clinton praised a Republican audience member who 'd decided to vote Democratic , the host , George Stephanopoulos , noted that Limbaugh was urging the same thing .
" Oh , " Clinton said with a wave of her hand , " he 's always had a crush on me . "
Hardly .
Asked about that , Limbaugh told a story instead about ex-President Clinton allegedly " hitting on " Rush 's date last year in a New York restaurant .
Rush admits he 's worried though about Indiana today .
One of his well - informed sources told him that Clinton 's internal polls had her losing the Hoosier State , which would be a stiff blow for the New York senator , especially since she 's also been trailing in North Carolina polls .
" That 's why , " Limbaugh explains using the royal we , " we 've issued orders to our operatives in Indiana today to get out and vote for Hillary Clinton . "
We 'll see tonight if enough followed their commander 's orders to prolong the Democratic chaos .

The publishing of this handbook [ edit ]
The publishing of this handbook is a copyright violation .
See [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] .
Because Wikinews is part of the Wikimedia Foundation , I assume the same rules that apply at Wikipedia also apply here regarding linking to copyright violations :
However , if you know that an external Web site is carrying a work in violation of the creator 's copyright , do not link to that copy of the work .
Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States ( Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry [ 1 ] ) .
Linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else 's work sheds a bad light on Wikipedia and its editors .

Alanraywiki - ( talk ) 16:27 , 19 April 2008 ( UTC )
Whilst I appreciate the point you make , in order for us to discuss this publication we need to be able to list the leaked document as a source .
Of course in most circumstances linking copyright violations is to be discourage but here it is necessaryd , in doing so it should be clear in how it is linked that it is not supposed to condone the violation .

There 's nothing newsworthy in this book , and the false implication that Mormons question whether to take donated organs is academically inappropriate .

Picture [ edit ]
Why is there a picture of the scriptures of the church when the article is about the Church Handbook of Instructions ?
They are completely different publications .
Also , there are four separate books that are bound together in this picture , not one holy book .
Alanraywiki - ( talk ) 04:11 , 20 April 2008 ( UTC )
Nothing new here .
[ edit ]
As far as I can see , all of this information is available in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism : Cremation : " Since the organization of the Church in 1830 , Latter - day Saints have been encouraged by their leaders to avoid cremation , unless it is required by law , and , wherever possible , to consign the body to burial in the earth and leave the dissolution of the body to nature , " for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return " ( Gen. 3:19 ) . " - Encyclopedia of Mormonism , Vol. 1 , Cremation
Organ Donation : " Because the transplanting of body parts raises some concerns regarding ethics and moral issues , the Church has issued the following statement : " Whether an individual chooses to will his own bodily organs or authorizes the transplant of organs from a deceased family member is a decision for the individual or the deceased member 's family .
The decision to receive a donated organ should be made with competent medical counsel and confirmation through prayer " ( General Handbook of Instructions , 11 - 6 ) . " - Encyclopedia of Mormonism , Vol. 2 , Organ Donations and Transplants
Euthanasia : " A person who participates in euthanasia — deliberately putting to death a person suffering from incurable conditions or diseases — violates the commandments of God . "
( General Handbook of Instructions , 11 - 5 ) " When severe illness strikes , Church members should exercise faith in the Lord and seek competent medical assistance .
However , when dying becomes inevitable , it should be looked upon as a blessing and a purposeful part of eternal existence .
Members should not feel obligated to extend mortal life by means that are unreasonable . "
( General Handbook of Instructions , 11 - 6 ) - Encyclopedia of Mormonism , Vol. 3 , Prolonging Life .
Tithes : " The collection of tithing is the responsibility of the bishop in each ward ... he forwards the tithes collected locally to Church headquarters ... these funds are used for such purposes as the building and manintenance of meetinghouses , temples and other facilities , as well as for partial support of the missionary , educational and welfare programs of the Church . "
- Encyclopedia of Mormonism , Vol. 4 , Tithing .
The Encylopedia of Mormonism was published in 1992 .
It is available freely online ( here ) and is by no means a secret church document .
It directly cites the General Handbook of Instructions , as does this website .
This article reveals nothing that was not already known about the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter - Day Saints and for that matter it does n't even reveal anything new about the General Handbook .

Citation [ edit ]
I propose citing the book itself rather than the Wikileaks scanned copy .
When any other book is cited , a link is not provided to a place where an illegal copy can be obtained .
It is more than enough to say " the book is available on Wikileaks " and leave it at that , we do n't have to provide a direct link to the book .
Remember , this is a copyright violation .
210.9.137.20 02:36 , 21 April 2008 ( UTC )
We site Reuters , CNN , FOX News and other in daily news reports .
They are all copyrighted .
What would make this any different ?
Find a kink to the book and all the documents from WL online and sure ... we can use that .
Dragon Fire1024 ( Talk to the Dragon ) 03:03 , 21 April 2008 ( UTC )
Dragon , the difference is that in the case of the news agencies you cited they have published their own copyrighted material on the Internet for public consumption .
In this case , however , the person posted the material without the permission of the copyright holder , thus violating copyright laws .
It is like someone taking the latest bestseller , scanning it and posting it on the Internet .
An interesting article to read on Wikipedia on the matter of linking to this material is Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry .
Alanraywiki - ( talk ) 04:50 , 21 April 2008 ( UTC )
What I am proposing is to simply cite the book in the form that is was originally published .
This book was never published online , but we have access to its bibliographical information .
It is probable that many readers of Wikipedia / Wikinews do not have access to the many books that are cited in articles , but that is no reason to cite an illegal copy .
210.9.137.20 06:26 , 21 April 2008 ( UTC )
You 've misunderstood me , I 'm not saying that citing the book is a copyright violation .
The scanned copy , however , is a copyright violation , and we should not be linking to it .
An article posted on the official CNN website is not violating CNN 's copyright , but this book has been posted on Wikileaks without the permission of the LDS .
May I draw your attention , if / when you reply to this comment , to the large , bold text underneath the editing box .
It reads " do not submit copyrighted work without permission . "
This should be enough to remind anyone of Wikipedia / Wikinews ' attitude towards copyright violation .

Mr.Z-man - ( talk ) 05:30 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC ) Yup , Ticket# : 2008050510027181 -- Brian McNeil / talk 07:38 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
Can I ask , and excuse me being frank , what the heck does this mean ?
Dragon Fire1024 ( Talk to the Dragon ) 10:21 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
For the most part it means someone is asserting that we should not engage in the promotion of , or support of , the violation of copyright .
The correct action has been taken in removing the link and seeking advice from Mike Godwin .
I will raise the issue on the Communications Committee mailing list as I am not qualified to say if this can - or should - be challenged .
It may be the case that Wikileaks should challenge the similar DMCA they will have received and the decision there would influence how Wikinews should respond .
So , keep your cool , mark the deletion request for this article as suspended ( leave all templates ) and I 'll either let you know what Mike says , or persuade him to post here .
-- Brian McNeil / talk 10:29 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
I am cool , but really , this would affirm something about the manual .
So as I said it before , we link to copyrighted material constanty .
What WL has on their site is not our responsibility .
We report on what they posted , not what we posted .
Pending Godwin's advice , I will wait to get all pissed , but this is ridiculous .
Dragon Fire1024 ( Talk to the Dragon ) 10:35 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC ) Wikileaks , at least at firast glance , is not aware of any order against them , in this regards .
But nonetheless , they will look into the issue and respond to me sometime today .
As of now though I have to go to real work .
Keep me posted brianmc .
DragonFire1024
( Talk to the Dragon ) 11:05 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC ) Yes , we link to ( c ) material , but generally not to unauthorised reproductions thereof .
-- Brian McNeil / talk 13:55 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
I have raised this with ComCom .
Likely at least two or three hours away from Mike looking at it .
Please confirm Wikileaks has not been served with a similar takedown notice .
This , I believe , may influence how WMF reacts .
-- Brian McNeil / talk 13:53 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
I would argue that linking is fair use , although I have no intention of ignoring this notice .
User:Anonymous101 :)
ComCom people have pointed out that the notice is improperly filed as email is not a valid notification method .
I have responded to the OTRS ticket stressing this point , and that it is ( per Mike Godwin ) questionable if a URL is actually something actionable .
It seems somewhat ironic ...
This was a story destined for deletion as non-notable , but the LDS people have changed that .
-- Brian McNeil / talk 15:07 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
Not sure what is so newsworthy about this incident to be honest .
Having looked at the OTRS ticket , I 'd suggest it would probably have best for you to have left any replying to our legal guys .
By linking to this material we could be seen as facilitating the illegal distribution of this and I suspect we do n't have much room to argue here .
I suspect we 'll accept their request as valid and keep the link out and that 'll be the end of it .

It is not necessary to link to the material to write an article about its presence on Wikileaks .
Agreed that this new wrinkle with the DMCA Take - Down Notice is interesting and noteworthy - has this ever happened to Wikinews before ?
Cirt - ( talk ) 18:03 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
No it has n't .
RE : Adambro :
We are facilitating nothing other than a rport from a web URL from Wikileaks , who by the way , lets not wander away from the fact that they uploaded it and they have it .
Not Wikinews and not WMF .
We simply report on it .
So in reality we are using fair use .
I am still at work , but when I get home I will see if Wikileaks e-mailed me back .

Also , I agree with brianmc .
if this book was not a big deal or newsworthy , why the fuss over it on Wikinews ?
I have to agree that this entire situation changes everything .
The LDS essentially made this even more news than it was or was n't before .

Should we remove all the revisions with the alleged copyright violation ?
User:Anonymous101 :) 18:18 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
Absolutely not .
I see no reason to as there has been no course of action yet determined .
Dragon Fire1024 ( Talk to the Dragon ) 18:20 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
Adambro , do you really think I would respond to something as serious as this without first seeking input from Mike Godwin ?
You wound me .
The request is improperly filed and asserts we must remove a link as opposed to infringing material .
These are the most extreme limits of the DMCA legislation and I believe the response I sent to the complainant was both professional and articulate in expressing these issues .
For Wikimedia projects to remain relevant we must question any such notices that are not open and shut cases .
Vague and non-specific threats should be challenged to avoid a " chilling effect " on free speech .

Fair Use [ edit ]
I believe that linking was fair use under US law as Wikinews is non profit and the document was being used for informative purposes .
We were liking to Wikileaks , a non profit site that posted a document online for informative purposes .
This document had not previously been used to make profit .
User:Anonymous101 :) 18:21 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
Do we even really even have to claim fair use ?
We are n't duplicating material , just linking to a website , which WMF has no control over , if they violate copyright thats their problem and not ours , just my 2 cents .

Well , at least on Wikipedia they have a rule about not linking to copyright infringements , and I 'd suggest that many of the arguments for that would apply here as well .

Article on DMCA [ edit ]
Good title for article about the DMCA Take - Down Notice -- Wikinews receives ' take - down ' notice from Mormon Church .
I do not think that we should rename / move this article to that title , but rather that that should be a completely new article about this incident - with the previous article as a reference .
Cirt - ( talk ) 18:37 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
I agree .
DragonFire1024 ( Talk to the Dragon ) 18:38 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
However , let 's wait a bit on this until we can get more info / sources .
The DMCA itself must have produced a filing in a federal court , and that document should be public domain .
Cirt - ( talk ) 18:40 , 6 May 2008 ( UTC )
I 'd suggest that it would be entirely inappropriate and unprofessional to publish an article about this incident .

Title [ edit ]
Would n't Wikileaks publishes a copy of handbook for leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints be a better title ?
If any of our editors has a " copy " , I would think that what they have is a copy of the PDF file that Wikileaks put up on their site , and not a physical copy of the book .
Afterall , we are relying on Wikileaks that what they put up is a faithful scan of the book .
I think it would also serve to distance ourselves from the copyright infringement claims made by the church .
Of course , this would also necessitate changes to the opening paragraph , which is usually problematic for archived articles , but seeing as this was just recently re-published and archived in a single edit , I think this would be OK in this case .

Even if you have to rewrite the software in another language as part of selling the company , I 'd still call that working .
But I do n't believe this is often a substantial obstacle .
Companies buy startups because they 're afraid their competitors will .
If it looks like you 're going to have the dominant market share , acquirers can overlook nearly anything ; and if you do n't , they do n't want you at all .
To the extent there is any discomfort about the language you used , you can often use the pointy - haired bosses ' mistaken ideas against them .
If they take as an axiom that " all languages are equivalent , " ( if this is true , btw , we 're all wasting our time talking about language design on this list ) they 'll easily believe that it will be a trivial matter to port your code to some more boss - friendly language , and that the language your software is written in is thus no serious barrier to acquisition .
I do n't think I intentionally misled Yahoo ( too much ) on this point , but if I did it was for their own good .
Many of the aspects of Y Store they 've been able to change ( the pricing , the test drive ) , they 've messed up .
But because they did n't dare touch the Editor itself , they have n't been able to spoil it .
How many big companies can say five years after acquiring software from a startup that the software is just as good as it was under the startup ?

TALKING TECH TALKING TECH HOW TO GET LISTED HOW TO GET LISTED
You can get your business listed ( and reviewed ) online .
Here 's a sampling of the many choices : Maps.google.com :
The Web 's most desired home for local businesses , for two big reasons .
Google is the most visited website , and it now lists local businesses -- and reviews -- in search results .
Business owners can sign up at http://maps.google.com/local/add to create a listing .
( You 'll need to register for a Google account . )
Add pertinent information including hours and policies , plus photos and YouTube videos .
Google confirms that you are indeed the business owner with an automated phone call and PIN .
Once you confirm , the site is up and running .
Business owners can then send e-mail links from the Google site to customers for potential reviews .
However , there are so many characters in the local Maps Internet address that such a link can be unwieldy .
But here 's a tip : Copy that long address to http://www.tinyurl.com , where the huge mass of letters can be winnowed down to 6 characters .
Once customers click the link , they sign in with their Google ID , and click " Write a Review . "
Local.yahoo.com : Yahoo has a similar local business offering , at local.yahoo.com .
Sign up with your Yahoo ID .
As with Google , you can add business details , upload pictures and collect reviews from customers via a long e-mail link .
Try Tinyurl for this site , as well .
Yelp :
Yelp is a site all about reviews of local businesses .
A new " Yelp for Business Owners " feature was recently introduced at http://Biz.yelp.com.
Business owners sign up for Yelp , then sign into the business center , where they get to see how many people visited their Yelp page .
They can also initiate communication with customers .
" It 's about bringing businesses into the fold so they do n't feel left out , " says Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman .
LOS ANGELES  Mike Dorausch is always on the lookout for new chiropractic clients in Los Angeles .
To help spread the word about his services , he gently asks patients to say nice things about him at one of the many customer - review sites popping up on the Web .
" Online reviews is how people find us , " Dorausch says .
About 80 % of his new business stems from customers finding online reviews about him and booking appointments , he says .
Picking up on a trend started by the travel industry , business - listing sites by Google ( GOOG ) , Yahoo ( YHOO ) and others including Yelp and Citysearch let customers rave about their favorites , or complain about poor service .
That helps consumers get real - life opinions about local businesses and services .
For businesses attempting to reach consumers , the feedback spreads the word in a way ads can't .
But perhaps more important , the reviews can dramatically raise a website 's visibility in search engines .
Reviews and star ratings are often cited in search results .
A Google search for " Los Angeles chiropractor , " for instance , includes not only links to websites and descriptions , but also a 10 - item list of local chiropractors with their addresses , reviews , star ratings and a local map at the top of the page .
" You 're seeing a lot of businesses fighting to get into that top 10 , " says Greg Sterling , an analyst at Sterling Market Intelligence .
" This is the most privileged position on the Internet .
It 's a big , prominent placement .
If you 're there , you benefit , and if you 're not , you do n't . "
Sterling says businesses will spend about $ 1.7 billion this year trying to reach potential local customers online , growing to $ 2.2 billion in 2009 .
Dramatic growth at local level Local listing sites are showing dramatic growth .
Traffic at Google Maps is up 25 % year to year .
Relative newcomer Yelp , founded in 2004 , is up 129 % .
Yelp is all about members waxing enthusiastic ( or critical ) about everything from hotels , restaurants and local shops to neighborhood favorites including best city parks and cool street corners .
Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman says business owners have to walk a fine line in how enthusiastically they seek reviews .
" Some business owners will post their reviews on their door , or on the counter , to show them off , and that 's a subtle way of asking customers to write about them , " he says .
" If you go too aggressive , the community could get upset , and you could end up hurting yourself . "
" Yelpers " will write negative things if they think they were harassed to offer their opinions , he says .
Dorausch feels he 's subtle about it .
" No one has ever gotten mad , " he says .
Yes , he does have signs in the office asking visitors to leave their Gmail address ( you must have a Google account to leave reviews on Google 's local pages ) , but he wo n't ask before working on your back .
Dorausch says he waits for patients to say how they enjoyed their visit .
" That 's where the opportunity is to ask if they 'd like to share that in a review , " he says .
( He follows up with an e-mail with Web addresses for review sites . )
" I would think most businesses would not go wrong with that approach , " he says .
Most customers take up his offer to leave a review , he says .
More important , potential customers read them .
" People look for somebody in their area and read what other people have written .
Do these people practice what they preach ?
They take a lot of value in that . "
Still , readers should tread with some caution as they sift through reviews , says Chris Winfield , president of 10e20 , a New York firm that helps local businesses with their online marketing campaigns .
" As a reader , you have to take the reviews with a grain of salt , because you just do n't know who really wrote it , " says Winfield .
" Fake reviews are all over the Web . "
Were they written by actual customers — or friends of the business owner as a favor ?
Or perhaps even by the business owner , under a phony name ?
Getting into trouble Winfield says he 's seen some businesses aggressively seek reviews by offering free iPods or gift certificates in exchange for a client taking the time to go online and wax poetic .
But to be so brazen can get you in trouble .
TripAdvisor , the most - visited travel site , has strict rules about reviews that were obtained via remuneration : Asking is OK — but rewarding is forbidden .
" If somebody was being incentivized , it would impact the degree of trust in the review , " says Brian Payea , TripAdvisor 's trade relations manager .
TripAdvisor would remove such a review from its site , he says .
It has lots to choose from .
TripAdvisor 's 6 million members have written 15 million reviews since the site was launched in 2002 .
At Google , where the number of reviews are " in the seven figures , " the company has no such policy .
Readers are savvy enough to winnow out the phonies , says product manager Carter Maslan .
" It 's a free marketplace for people to leave their opinions , " says Maslan .
" When I see a business that seems like it's an infomercial , I can see through it , and make my own judgment . "

Ron Paul on Eliot Spitzer :
He acted badly but did n't deserve this
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , he of the quixotic GOP presidential campaign and unique policy positions , is never one to be shy about his opinions .
Take the case of fallen New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer ( D ) , whose political career fell apart this week after his liaisons with high - priced call girls became public .
Spitzer resigned his office effective Monday .
Most politicians from both sides of the aisle publicly ( at least ) offered condolences for Spitzer and his poor family , including his three daughters , but did n't — of course — defend Spitzer 's atrocious behavior .
But for Paul , Spitzer 's downfall at the hands of a Justice Dept. investigation shows government at its worst .
Yes , Spitzer climbed to power on the backs of political enemies he destroyed , making him not a swell guy , but he did n't deserve what happened to him .
The FBI should have never been allowed to listen in to his phone call in the first place , according to the Texas Republican .
Here 's the statement Paul made on the House floor last night .
It 's worth reading , at least for the enlightenment it gives into Paul 's view of the world , which basically comes down to who controls the money :
" Madam Speaker , it has been said that 'he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword . '
And in the case of Eliot Spitzer , this could n't be more true .
In his case it 's the political sword , as his enemies rejoice in his downfall .
Most people , it seems , believe he got exactly what he deserved .
" The illegal tools of the state brought Spitzer down , but think of all the harm done by Spitzer in using the same tools against so many other innocent people .
He practiced what could be termed ' economic McCarthyism , ' using illegitimate government power to build his political career on the ruined lives of others .
" No matter how morally justified his comeuppance may be , his downfall demonstrates the worst of our society .
The possibility of uncovering personal moral wrongdoing is never a justification for the government to spy on our every move and to participate in sting operations .
" For government to entice a citizen to break a law with a sting operation — that is , engaging in activities that a private citizen is prohibited by law from doing — is unconscionable and should clearly be illegal .
" Though Spitzer used the same tools to destroy individuals charged with economic crimes that ended up being used against him , gloating over his downfall should not divert our attention from the fact that the government spying on American citizens is unworthy of a country claiming respect for liberty and the Fourth Amendment .
" Two wrongs do not make a right .
Two wrongs make it doubly wrong .
" Sacrifice of our personal privacy has been ongoing for decades but has rapidly accelerated since 9/11 .
Before 9/11 , the unstated goal of collecting revenue was the real reason for the erosion of our financial privacy .
When 19 suicidal maniacs attacked us on 9/11 , our country became convinced that further sacrifice of personal and financial privacy was required for our security .
" The driving force behind this ongoing sacrifice of our privacy has been fear and the emotional effect of war rhetoric — war on drugs , war against terrorism and the war against Third World nations in the Middle East who are claimed to be the equivalent to Hitler and Nazi Germany .
" But the real reason for all this surveillance is to build the power of the state .
It arises from a virulent dislike of free people running their own lives and spending their own money .
Statists always demand control of the people and their money .
" Recently we 've been told that this increase in the already intolerable invasion of our privacy was justified because the purpose was to apprehend terrorists .
We were told that the massive amounts of information being collected on Americans would only be used to root out terrorists .
But as we can see today , this monitoring of private activities can also be used for political reasons .
We should always be concerned when the government accumulates information on innocent citizens .
" Spitzer was brought down because he legally withdrew cash from a bank — not because he committed a crime .
This should prompt us to reassess and hopefully reverse this trend of pervasive government intrusion in our private lives .
" We need no more Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act !
No more Violent Radicalization & Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Acts !
No more torture !
No more Military Commissions Act !
No more secret prisons and extraordinary rendition !
No more abuse of habeas corpus !
No more Patriot Acts !
" What we need is more government transparency and more privacy for the individual ! "
Greenhouse gas pollution has acidified the coastal waters of western North America more rapidly than scientists expected , says a study published today in Science .
In a survey of waters stretching from central Canada to northern Mexico , researchers led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Richard Feely found cold , unexpectedly low - pH water " upwelling onto large portions of the continental shelf . "
In some locations , the degree of acidification observed had not been expected to occur until 2050 .
Ocean acidification is a side effect of excessive atmospheric carbon dioxide , lesser - known but no less troubling than climate change .
When seawater absorbs CO2 , the proportion of hydrogen ions rises [ pdf ] – a phenomenon remembered from high school chemistry class as the reddening of a litmus test .
The availability of carbonate ions falls correspondingly , the trends dovetailing to form bad news for marine organisms whose shells or skeletons require calcium carbonate .
The shells become weaker and dissolve .
Among the affected creatures are corals , crustaceans and shellfish – and if those populations collapse , entire marine ecosystems will follow .
In September of 2005 , Feely was among the authors of a Nature article predicting that acidication would claim Antarctic Ocean waters by 2050 , spreading into the subarctic Pacific by 2100 .
" Our findings indicate that conditions detrimental to high - latitude ecosystems could develop within decades , not centuries as suggested previously , " they wrote [ pdf ] .
In the latest study , they found unusually low - PH water off the continental shelf of western North America .
This occurred primarily at depths between 40 and 120 meters , but in one region off the California coast it extended all the way to the surface .
Such upwellings are a seasonal phenomenon , the researchers noted , but appear to be getting worse , with low - pH water claiming ever - larger ocean areas .
" Our results show for the first time that a large section of the North
American continental shelf is impacted by ocean acidification , " they wrote .
The waters now rising to the ocean surface were last exposed to atmospheric CO2 in the mid-2oth century .
What hill happen , one wonders , when water that sank to the deep sea during our own CO2 - choked time comes back again ?
" Water already in transit to upwelling centers is carrying increasing anthropogenic CO2 and more corrosive conditions to the coastal oceans of the future , " write the authors .
Ocean acidification " could affect some of the most fundamental biological and geochemical processes of the sea in the coming decades . "
If anything , the clinical language of science only makes their words more disturbing .

Still wondering why you should bother recycling your aluminum cans ?
Just ask Greg Wittbecker .
He 's the director of Corporate Metal Recycling for Alcoa and a big proponent of boosting the paltry amount the U.S. recycles ( 52 % of cans ) to 75 % .
What 's the big deal ?
Greg says it 's all about energy and waste disposal .
" If we could recover and recycle 75 % of the aluminum cans being currently tossed into landfills â€ “ 600,000 metric tons of aluminum â€ “ we could save 1286 megawatts of generated electricity .
Thatâ€™s the amount produced by two coal fired power plants , and consumed by two aluminum plants , " says Greg .
" Replacing this production with recycling would keep 11.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from being generated and released into the atmosphere . "
It would also reduce the amount of mercury going into the environment , since power plants emit polluting mercury when they burn coal .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Why is recycling so efficient ?
According to Alcoa , recycling a ton of aluminum uses just 5 % of the energy required to make virgin metal .
Every ton of recycled aluminum that Alcoa uses saves about 14,000 kilowatt hours of electricity .
The U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) estimates that the average American household consumes 920 kilowatts of electricity per month .
Consequently , using 1 ton of recycled aluminum as opposed to 1 ton of virgin aluminum would make enough conserved energy available to power an American household for over 15 months .
Despite the compelling energy savings that accrue from recycling aluminum , we Americans are not recycling as much as other countries .
Compared to our 52 % , consider how well the nations below are doing :
â€¢ Brazil 94.4 %
â€¢ Japan 90.9 %
â€¢ Germany 89 %
â€¢ Global Average 63 %
â€¢ Western Europe 57.7 %
Why the diff ?
On top of the " throw it away " mentality common among American households , many communities do n't make it easy for citizens to do the right thing .
More towns and cities need to offer curbside recycling programs or convenient recycling centers .
Retailers that sell canned beverages could help , too , by setting up recycling centers on their premises .
Eleven states already put deposits on canned beverages to insure that the cans are returned to the manufacturer .
The rest should follow suit .
To find locations where you can recycle nearby , check out earth911 .
And do n't forget to contact your city administrator or solid waste manager to urge them to make community recycling easier for everyone in your community .
It has , however , committed to installing more runway status lights , which warn pilots at intersections when a runway is in use .
The board also recommended requiring tower controllers to clear planes for each runway crossing , rather than simply clearing a plane to proceed from a gate to a runway end .
But the F.A.A. has not agreed to that change .
Runway safety has loomed larger as a problem partly because other issues have been resolved .
For example , in the last decade , all jet airliners have been equipped with systems that make it much harder to accidentally fly into a mountain or collide with another plane .
Fire extinguishers and smoke detectors have been put in cargo compartments , and insulation that could feed an in - flight fire has been replaced .
But the technology gap that remains between the air and the ground is striking .
“ You can fly an aircraft across the Pacific or across the Atlantic , and at any point in that journey you know where you are within about three meters , until you get on the ground , ” said Randy Babbitt , a longtime airline pilot and former president of the Air Line Pilots Association .
In the air , big airliners have navigation systems based on Global Positioning System satellites , that locate them in the air , but these are not generally linked to surface maps , which would locate them by taxiway and runway .
So an approaching plane can find a runway end in near - zero visibility , but can then get lost once on the surface .
“ If you ’ve got a G.P.S. in your car , you have infinitely more detailed information about where you are than in the cockpit of an airplane on the ground at Kennedy , ” Mr. Babbitt said .
The most deadly aviation accident ever was the collision in March 1977 of two Boeing 747’s , on a foggy runway in Tenerife , in the Canary Islands , killing 583 people .
The F.A.A. recognizes the problem .
At the height of the American Airlines flight cancellations , on April 10 , the associate administrator for safety , Nicholas A. Sabatini , was testifying before a Senate aviation subcommittee about his agency ’s safety work , and while the senators wanted to hear about lapses in inspections , almost half his testimony was about runway safety .
Hannity 's laughing at you , George , for making him the only clear winner of last Wednesday 's debate .

Hannity :
The liberal blogs are losing their minds today in part because I suggested the question to George Stephanopoulos
Tues afternoon on my radio show .
While we 've had plenty of criticism for MSNBC's and CNN 's debate coverage this season , nothing they did came anywhere near to what ABC pulled last Wednesday and Stephanopoulos ' on - air dumpster diving for gotcha questions on Hannity 's radio show will likely go down as one of the dumbest moves by a debate moderator ever .
We 've come to expect smear jobs like this from the likes of Hannity , and the Dems have rightly refused to attend any debate on the GOP / Fox News Channel because of it , but now we have ABC News 's Chief Washington Correspondent and former Democratic presidential political adviser openly seeking their advice and unapologetically emulating them .
How is it that Stephanopoulos , of all people , thought this was a good move ?
Josh Marshall offers this depressingly valid observation :
I was mulling over the ABC debate this morning and the moderators ' claim that knocking Obama with a more or less uninterrupted stream of Swift Boat gotchas was justified by focusing the debate on ' electability ' .
And it occurred to me that we have now crossed an important threshold where the Republican operative cadre has sufficiently disciplined and trained the press ( and more than a few Democrats ) that their own role may simply be redundant .
...
Thankfully , there are still more than a handful of journalists who are n't GOP pawns who together have penned a letter slamming ABC for its debate debacle .
In those essays , I provided some history of oil shale , discussed Shell 's unique process , as well as the reasons those " trillions of barrels " remain elusive .
But one of Shell 's recent moves has raised some eyebrows , as they are in the process of buying up water rights in Colorado to process the shale .
It is n't hard to see why I am an oil shale skeptic .
I outlined my reasons in two essays on oil shale : “ Oil Shale Development Imminent ” and Oil Shale = Cellulosic Ethanol .
First , a quick review on their process .
Shell 's process is in situ retorting , as explained here :
Shell Oil is currently developing an in situ conversion process ( ICP ) .
The process involves heating underground oil shale , using electric heaters placed in deep vertical holes drilled through a section of oil shale .
The volume of oil shale is heated over a period of two to three years , until it reaches 650 –700 °F , at which point oil is released from the shale .
The released product is gathered in collection wells positioned within the heated zone .
Shell 's current plan involves use of ground - freezing technology to establish an underground barrier called a " freeze wall " around the perimeter of the extraction zone .
The freeze wall is created by pumping refrigerated fluid through a series of wells drilled around the extraction zone .
The freeze wall prevents groundwater from entering the extraction zone , and keeps hydrocarbons and other products generated by the in - situ retorting from leaving the project perimeter .
It is very difficult for me to see how any company is going to make a go of it , given the need to simulaneously heat and freeze the ground for several years .
However , as I was recently passing through the Denver Airport - I spotted this story in the Denver Post :
Shell makes run on water
Shale country tends to be dry country , and Shell 's process uses a lot of water .
Some excerpts from the story :
In its quest to melt oil out of western Colorado 's shale , Royal Dutch Shell has been buying up land and water rights in anticipation of what is likely to be a thirsty new industry .
Some officials , however , worry that the demands of the oil - shale industry could drain every drop of the region 's remaining water .
" On the upper end , we 're looking at potentially several hundred thousand acre - feet of water — more than people think is commonly available to develop in the Colorado River , " said Dan Birch , deputy general manager for the Colorado River Water Conservation District .
Shell and other energy companies have amassed tens of thousands of acres of cropland , ranches and open space — including a state wildlife area — to gain water that would be needed to power the oil - shale process .
Count me among those who thinks this is a bad idea .
We are pulling down aquifers now ; I hate to see us accelerate that process to produce oil from shale .
The energy return is already going to be very marginal .
If it was any better than that for tar sands , they would already be producing oil from shale .
But now add the fact that they are going to be using up water in dry areas , and it looks to me like a losing proposition .
While the claims of the oil potential there are pretty huge , so are the water requirements :
The Bureau of Land Management estimates the shale formation in western Colorado could yield as much as 1.8 trillion barrels of oil .
Getting that oil , however , could require three times as much water to operate power plants , according to some estimates .
" The volumes are pretty enormous , " said Bart Miller , water - program director for conservation group Western Resource Advocates .
" The net water requirements . . . were something in the neighborhood of 200,000 to 300,000 acre - feet annually , " Miller said .
" To put that in context , that 's the consumption of about 2.5 million people . "
A couple of things .
First , there are also trillions of dollars of gold in the oceans .
Just because a resource exists does n't mean you can devise a cost - effective way to utilize it .
Second , that 1.8 trillion is certainly not a net value .
The net value is going to be far less , as it is going to take energy to process the oil .
Even if the EROEI was 2 to 1 , and I doubt it is , that would mean it would take almost a trillion barrels - all contributing more pollution to the environment - to process the 1.8 trillion barrels .
I remain skeptical .
Oil shale , like cellulosic ethanol and algal biodiesel - has always been just around the corner from commercialization .
I think it will remain around the corner .
On the other hand , the people at Shell are buying up those water rights for a reason ...

How to Sell Security
It ’s a truism in sales that it ’s easier to sell someone something he wants than a defense against something he wants to avoid .
People are reluctant to buy insurance , or home security devices , or computer security anything .
It ’s not they do n’t ever buy these things , but it ’s an uphill struggle .
The reason is psychological .
And it ’s the same dynamic when it ’s a security vendor trying to sell its products or services , a CIO trying to convince senior management to invest in security , or a security officer trying to implement a security policy with her company ’s employees .
It ’s also true that the better you understand your buyer , the better you can sell .
First , a bit about Prospect Theory , the underlying theory behind the newly popular field of behavioral economics .
Prospect Theory was developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979 ( Kahneman went on to win a Nobel Prize for this and other similar work ) to explain how people make trade - offs that involve risk .
Before this work , economists had a model of “ economic man , ” a rational being who makes trade - offs based on some logical calculation .
Kahneman and Tversky showed that real people are far more subtle and ornery .
Here ’s an experiment that illustrates Prospect Theory .
Take a roomful of subjects and divide them into two groups .
Ask one group to choose between these two alternatives : a sure gain of $ 500 and 50 percent chance of gaining $ 1,000 .
Ask the other group to choose between these two alternatives : a sure loss of $ 500 and a 50 percent chance of losing $ 1,000 .
These two trade - offs are very similar , and traditional economics predicts that the whether you ’re contemplating a gain or a loss does n’t make a difference :
People make trade - offs based on a straightforward calculation of the relative outcome .
Some people prefer sure things and others prefer to take chances .
Whether the outcome is a gain or a loss does n’t affect the mathematics and therefore should n’t affect the results .
This is traditional economics , and it ’s called Utility Theory .
But Kahneman ’s and Tversky ’s experiments contradicted Utility Theory .
When faced with a gain , about 85 percent of people chose the sure smaller gain over the risky larger gain .
But when faced with a loss , about 70 percent chose the risky larger loss over the sure smaller loss .
This experiment , repeated again and again by many researchers , across ages , genders , cultures and even species , rocked economics , yielded the same result .
Directly contradicting the traditional idea of “ economic man , ” Prospect Theory recognizes that people have subjective values for gains and losses .
We have evolved a cognitive bias : a pair of heuristics .
One , a sure gain is better than a chance at a greater gain , or “ A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . ”
And two , a sure loss is worse than a chance at a greater loss , or “ Run away and live to fight another day . ”
Of course , these are not rigid rules .
Only a fool would take a sure $ 100 over a 50 percent chance at $ 1,000,000 .
But all things being equal , we tend to be risk - averse when it comes to gains and risk - seeking when it comes to losses .
This cognitive bias is so powerful that it can lead to logically inconsistent results .
Google the “ Asian Disease Experiment ” for an almost surreal example .
Describing the same policy choice in different ways–either as “ 200 lives saved out of 600 ” or “ 400 lives lost out of 600 ” – yields wildly different risk reactions .
Evolutionarily , the bias makes sense .
It ’s a better survival strategy to accept small gains rather than risk them for larger ones , and to risk larger losses rather than accept smaller losses .
Lions , for example , chase young or wounded wildebeests because the investment needed to kill them is lower .
Mature and healthy prey would probably be more nutritious , but there ’s a risk of missing lunch entirely if it gets away .
And a small meal will tide the lion over until another day .
Getting through today is more important than the possibility of having food tomorrow .
Similarly , it is better to risk a larger loss than to accept a smaller loss .
Because animals tend to live on the razor ’s edge between starvation and reproduction , any loss of food — whether small or large — can be equally bad .
Because both can result in death , and the best option is to risk everything for the chance at no loss at all .
How does Prospect
Theory explain the difficulty of selling the prevention of a security breach ?
It ’s a choice between a small sure loss — the cost of the security product — and a large risky loss : for example , the results of an attack on one ’s network .
Of course there ’s a lot more to the sale .
The buyer has to be convinced that the product works , and he has to understand the threats against him and the risk that something bad will happen .
But all things being equal , buyers would rather take the chance that the attack wo n’t happen than suffer the sure loss that comes from purchasing the security product .
Security sellers know this , even if they do n’t understand why , and are continually trying to frame their products in positive results .
That ’s why you see slogans with the basic message , “ We take care of security so you can focus on your business , ” or carefully crafted ROI models that demonstrate how profitable a security purchase can be .
But these never seem to work .
Security is fundamentally a negative sell .
One solution is to stoke fear .
Fear is a primal emotion , far older than our ability to calculate trade - offs .
And when people are truly scared , they ’re willing to do almost anything to make that feeling go away ; lots of other psychological research supports that .
Any burglar alarm salesman will tell you that people buy only after they ’ve been robbed , or after one of their neighbors has been robbed .
And the fears stoked by 9/11 , and the politics surrounding 9/11 , have fueled an entire industry devoted to counterterrorism .
When emotion takes over like that , people are much less likely to think rationally .
Though effective , fear mongering is not very ethical .
The better solution is not to sell security directly , but to include it as part of a more general product or service .
Your car comes with safety and security features built in ; they ’re not sold separately .
Same with your house .
And it should be the same with computers and networks .
Vendors need to build security into the products and services that customers actually want .
CIOs should include security as an integral part of everything they budget for .
Security should n’t be a separate policy for employees to follow but part of overall IT policy .
Security is inherently about avoiding a negative , so you can never ignore the cognitive bias embedded so deeply in the human brain .
But if you understand it , you have a better chance of overcoming it .

McCain blunders on Iraq , again : Confuses Iraqi cleric with Prime Minister on ceasefire deal David Edwards and Chris Tackett
Published : Sunday April 6 , 2008

During an appearance on Fox News Sunday , John McCain again repeated the false claim that Muqtada al - Sadr declared the ceasefire in Basra last week and said he thought the Iraqi army was performing well .
" It was al - Sadr that declared the ceasefire , not Maliki , " said McCain .
" With respect , I dont think Sadr would have declared the ceasefire if he thought he was winning .
Most times in history , military engagements , the winning side doesnt declare the ceasefire .
The second point is , overall , the Iraqi military performed pretty well .
The military is functioning very effectively . "
As the blog , Think Progress notes , " it was members of Prime Minister Nouri al - Malikis government who brokered the ceasefire , to which Sadr agreed .
Experts agree that Sadrs influence was strengthened  rather than diminished  by the Basra battle . "
It 's not the first time McCain has erred when talking about Iraq .
Last month , McCain wrongly said Iran trains Al - Qaeda members .
McCain made the gaffe right in the middle of an official visit in the Middle East that was supposed to highlight his knowledge in foreign affairs .
" It 's common knowledge and has been reported in the media that Al - Qaeda is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq .
That 's well known , " the 71 - year - old Vietnam war veteran said .
Pressed by reporters about his allegations , McCain said : " We continue to be concerned about the Iranians taking Al - Qaeda into Iran and training them and sending them back . "
It was only after fellow Senator Joe Lieberman , who was traveling with him , whispered into his ear that McCain corrected himself , US media reported .
" I am sorry , the Iranians are training extremists , not Al - Qaeda , not Al - Qaeda , I am sorry , " McCain said .
Asked by Chris Wallace Sunday about the recent news from The New York Times that up to a thousand Iraqi soldiers had refused to serve , McCain implied the news was good because it showed improvement from past performance .
" Compare that to two years ago when the army was unable to function in any way effectively , " McCain said .
" Look , I did n't particularly like the outcome of this thing , but i am convinced that we now have a government that is governing with some effect and a military that is functioning very effectively .
Up in mosul where some of the best units are , they 're functioning well .
I 've always said , Chris , it 's long and hard and tough .
We 're paying a huge penalty for a failed strategy I voted hard against and I believe the strategy can and will succeed . "

It was in Texas that Clark had her first real break : an audition for the platoon - size indie - pop outfit the Polyphonic Spree , based in her hometown Dallas , as one of the band ’s two guitarists .
Her gig with the Polyphonic Spree , known for its emphatically sunny , slightly spacey anthems , led to work with the category - confounding Christian indie - folk phenomenon Sufjan Stevens ; at the same time , an MP3 of “ Now Now , ” a song that would become the opening track of St. Vincent ’s first album , was causing a stir on the Internet .
Clark was approached by the first of a number of major labels , and she eventually signed with Beggars Banquet , a large and reputable independent .
The name St. Vincent came about more or less by chance , as band names tend to .
“ It was arbitrary , really , ” Clark said , shrugging her shoulders .
“ Everything else was very purposeful , but not that .
The name just seemed to follow me around . ”
Image LAPTOP REVOLUTION : Releases by St. Vincent , Final Fantasy and Panda Bear .
Despite the full , layered soundscapes ( and the confounding monikers ) , each is the product of one individual  and countless hours in a home digital studio .
Throughout her time spent rehearsing , recording and touring in other people ’s bands , Clark maintained a sense of herself as an autonomous and almost entirely self - sufficient artist , and “ Marry Me ” is the fruit of years of solitary trial and error .
Released this past July , the album is almost recklessly heterogenic : each of its 11 tracks has its own highly idiosyncratic frame of reference , from torch songs to New York ’s no-wave of the ’80s to Parisian chansons .
“ That album took forever to make , mostly just me alone with my computer , ” Clark said with a good - humored sigh .
“ I call the time I spent on it ‘ invisible hours , ’ because no one knows how long it took but me . ”
On some tracks , the hours are less invisible than on others : “ Paris Is Burning , ” a protest song disguised as a fantasia of Paris ’s fall to the Nazis , is an opera unto itself , beginning with a somber trio of horns and arcing through an elegantly condensed history of 20th - century popular music before landing , somewhat drunkenly , in a stiff - legged , apocalyptic waltz .
The title track , by contrast  a deceptively dulcet piano ballad that manages to conceal a disquieting critique of marriage behind its seemingly straightforward proposal  is a study in effective restraint .
Like Pallett , Clark plays virtually every instrument on the record , though she draws far more heavily on synthesized sounds and effects ; the handful of other musicians featured ( among them Mike Garson , David Bowie ’s longtime pianist ) seem to have been brought in less out of necessity than as the sonic equivalent of icing on the cake .
From start to finish , “ Marry Me ” succeeds in fostering the illusion of effortlessness , of an almost careless expertise , as much in production and arrangement as in songwriting and execution  a far cry from such low - fi , rough - around - the - edges indie debuts as Cat Power ’s “ Dear Sir ” or the Pixies ’ “ Come On Pilgrim . ”
It ’s a fair bet , however , that “ Marry Me ” was considerably less expensive to record .
“ It ’s a completely different situation these days , ” Clark said when I asked how she recorded her album .
“ With the  can I call it a technological revolution ?
 and the advent of the Internet , there ’s this idea of global access , and to some extent it ’s true .
I came to music at a time when the Internet was still mostly for freaks , but I kind of fit into that category ; I discovered all sorts of crazy things that way . ”
I asked whether that might account , in part , for the wide range of stylistic influences on “ Marry Me , ” and Clark nodded thoughtfully .
“ The home - recording situation  having it be affordable and easy  was a big part of it , too : I had so much time to try out weird ideas , then get rid of them or keep them if I wanted .
I never really fantasized about joining a band , or thought , This song would be really good if I could just find a drummer , because I did n’t need to think about things in those terms .
It was more fun for me to try it on my own . ”
IF PALLETT AND CLARK ACHIEVE POP liberation through technology , “ chops ” and a flair for performance , a third variation on the theme of musical self - sufficiency is presented by the curious case of Noah Lennox .
Lennox records and performs , both alone and in a wide variety of partnerships and collectives , under the moniker Panda Bear .
Although he is an accomplished drummer and guitarist , he used neither instrument in the recording of his acclaimed third album , “ Person Pitch , ” and the technical aspects of his performances have more in common with Clark ’s “ invisible hours ” than with Pallett ’s assured showmanship .
You could almost describe Lennox , whose persona is low - key in the extreme , as the drummer who fired himself .
Panda Bear has been well known for a number of years  at least in the insular world of experimental pop  for his involvement with the peculiarly elliptical band Animal Collective , of which he was a founding member ( in either 2000 , 2001 or 2003 , depending on whom you ask ) .
Animal Collective  which features Lennox and three collaborators of long standing who go by the names Avey Tare , Geologist and Deakin  is arguably the most innovative group to emerge from New York City ’s progressive - music scene since Sonic Youth .
What it is , exactly , that makes the band unique is hard to pinpoint , since its sound ranges widely , from ethereal , open - ended psychedelia to something Owen Pallett described , admiringly , as “ panic folk ” ; common to all the band ’s projects , however , is an unapologetic embrace of eccentricity .
Side projects are often perceived as threatening to a band ’s equilibrium  Metallica famously forbade its members to participate in any  but everyone in Animal Collective seems to have at least one , and Lennox clearly views his two endeavors as mutually sustaining .
“ We ’ve been getting more interested in sampling lately , all sorts of electronic sounds , moving away from conventional rock - band instrumentation , that whole guitar - driven thing , ” Lennox told me when I visited him in Lisbon , where he now lives with his Portuguese wife and their child .
He gave a quick , self - deprecating smile .
“ I guess my solo record is proof of that . ”
Apple is one of the most innovative tech companies around , with their current patent there is no doubt that they are key at being environmentally friendly as well as technologically advanced .
Would n’t it be nice to have a laptop that did n’t need to be plugged in to charge ?
What about taking your portable device with you into un-industrialized places ?
This has been sought after for many years now and it seems that a good company is in the right place at the right time .
I look forward a self sustaining portable device .
While we wait , and wait … and wait for manufactures to perfect long - lasting fuel cells , Apple and others are pursuing at least one other approach : solar augmentation .
In a patent application dated April 24 , 2008 and titled “ Solar cells on portable devices ” attributed to a number of Apple employees , Apple reveals possible plans to integrate solar cells into devices such as iPods and MacBooks .
The application describes a scenario where , “ Solar cells are typically stacked with other layers made of transparent or semi- transparent materials …
Some of these layers may be used for display or input purposes , and some layers may be coated with various materials or they may be etched with product logos or other patterns . ”
In other words , Apple is looking to cover the entire device , including the transparent display , with a layer of solar cells — the latter approach already patented by Motorola .
While the efficiency of solar cells and existing manufacturing techniques call into question the immediate viability of such an approach , it ’s intriguing nonetheless as a means to offset any lost battery life on the move to say , 3G .

This winter , as politicians fulminated over the destroyed tapes of the waterboarding of Al Qaeda member Abu Zubaydah , a former CIA operative told me that after 9/11 he was approached to take part in a special counterterrorism group authorized to use “ enhanced techniques . ”
He had “ a moral problem with it , ” he told a superior , but he wanted to go after the bad guys ; what should he do ?
“ These enhanced techniques may make us feel good now , but one of these days they will leak , ” the superior told him .
“ They will hit the press , and there will be congressional investigations .
And God forbid someone will go overboard and kill someone . ”
So , the former operative turned down the job , “ thank God . ”
After that , a division emerged between what a former senior Agency official described to me as the “ SS crowd ” and the “ Wehrmacht crowd , ” the “ hard edged ” and the “ smarter and better informed . ”
He said , “ People managed not to take assignments .
There were senior people who would not go to meetings if they thought that extraordinary rendition or enhanced interrogation techniques were going to be discussed . ”
Sure enough , when public opinion finally shifted , the administration left the spooks to twist in the wind .
“ The Bush administration ordered it and approved it and then never came to the Agency ’s defense when it hit the fan , ” the former operative said .
“ The hypocrisy is breathtaking . ”
That prompted a former CIA counterterrorism officer , John Kiriakou , to go on national television to point out that administration officials had been briefed in detail about the Zubaydah interrogation and others .
For his trouble , Kiriakou now is reportedly the subject of an FBI investigation focused on whether he disclosed classified information .
What about Congress ?
“ They have known for a long time that [ the CIA ] uses stress positions and hypothermia and waterboarding and sleep deprivation — and they have n’t done anything about it , ” says Marty Lederman , a former Justice Department attorney who now teaches law at Georgetown University .
“ They do n’t disagree with it .
And if they do disagree with it , what are they going to do about it ?
The default position is to have closed hearings , which is preposterous .
The intelligence oversight committees are totally captured by the intelligence community . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Lehman Brothers
Inc strategists expect financial institutions worldwide to write down as much as $ 400 billion for bad debts by the end of 2008 , and said competing estimates of as much as $ 1.2 trillion seem implausible .
If Lehman is right , then the worst of writedowns by banks , brokerages and insurers may have passed .
But many of the riskier financial markets may not have bottomed out , Lehman strategists led by Chief Global Fixed Income Strategist Jack Malvey wrote .
Goldman Sachs &
Co estimated last month some $ 1.2 trillion of global credit losses .
U.S. banks , brokerages , hedge funds , and government - sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae FNM .
N could account for $ 460 billion of credit losses , Goldman said .
Lehman ’s forecast is far lower .
“ Himalaya - like guestimates , ranging from $ 600 billion to an Everest $ 1.2 trillion , seem highly improbable , in our opinion , ” the Lehman strategists wrote .
Financial institutions reeling from the global credit crunch have recorded $ 291.8 billion of writedowns so far , the Lehman team wrote .
That has been partially offset by about $ 181.6 billion of equity infusions , but still leaves banks with about $ 110 billion less capital .
Given that financial institutions borrow most of the money they lend or otherwise invest , that could translate to about $ 1.5 trillion less liquidity globally , the strategists said .
The worst scares for financial institution stability may have passed in March , but riskier markets such as stocks and junk bonds may have further to drop , Lehman strategists said .
Financial markets have grown much more optimistic about banks and brokers this week .
On Tuesday , UBS AG UBSN .VX said it was recording a $ 19 billion write - down , and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.
N said it sold $ 4 billion of dilutive convertible preferred securities .
But U.S. and European financial stocks rallied on the news , amid investor hopes the worst may have passed for banks and brokers .
Many analysts argue there are still clouds on the horizon for the global economy .
U.S. corporate bond spreads , a measure of how much extra yield over safe Treasuries investment - grade companies must pay to borrow , are on average three times as high as they were a year ago , according to Merrill Lynch & Co indexes .
And financial companies may have to raise capital in the future on increasingly onerous terms , after their recent bout of fund - raising , analysts have said .

[ Just how rampant is piracy in PC casual gaming ?
In a startling instalment of his regular Gamasutra column , Reflexive 's director of marketing Russell Carroll ( Wik , Ricochet ) reveals the 92 % piracy rate for one of his company 's games , and what worked ( and did n't work ) when they tried to fix it . ]
“ It looks like around 92 % of the people playing the full version of [ the pictured ] Ricochet Infinity pirated it . ”
It ’s moments like those that make people in the industry stop dead in their tracks .
92 % is a huge number and though we were only measuring people who had gotten the game from Reflexive and gone online with it , it seemed improbable that those who acquired the game elsewhere or did n’t go online were any more likely to have purchased it .
As we sat and pondered the financial implications of such piracy , it was hard to get past the magnitude of the number itself : 92 % .
In the casual games space , where the majority of the industry is tied to an internet - distributed product , piracy is a common problem .
Search for any casual game through Google , add the word ‘ crack ’ , and the search engine will help you find and illegally acquire every casual game you can imagine .
One way to fight the search - engine facilitated piracy is to work to remove the ever - expanding number of links to illegal copies , but in many cases improving the Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) system to be more secure can be more effective as it renders a large number of those links obsolete .
This is tricky to be sure , because improving the security must be done without making the DRM so onerous that it keeps honest customers from purchasing games .
Reflexive , where I work , is in a peculiar position in this regard .
Whereas most of the casual games industry licenses their DRM from a vendor , Reflexive has its own in - house DRM .
Over the years it has undergone many improvements , including several changes made specifically to combat piracy .
With that background , my penchant for actual numbers , and a lot of help from Brian Fisher , Reflexive ’s king of number crunching logic , let ’s tackle the question of the 92 % piracy rate on Ricochet Infinity .
Could we realistically assume that stopping piracy would have caused 12 times more sales ?
Beating the DRM
Pirates beat DRMs through Exploits , KeyGens and Cracks .
Each of these approaches is distinct , and requires differing amounts of effort .
A brief description of each , in order of least to most effort involved to make them work , can be found below .
Exploits
Exploits are holes in a DRM that can be circumvented without downloading anything to the computer .
For example , going into the registry to delete a time limit on a game demo , renaming a hidden .exe file , or using task manager to ‘ quit ’ the DRM are all things that have been done in the past or can be done currently to circumvent casual game DRMs .
KeyGens
Most DRMs work around an encryption system that delivers the full game to players but limits them to a 60 minute trial .
The full game can be unlocked by entering in a serial - type key into the game .
Keygens are programs that illegally create serial keys to unlock a portal ’s games .
They are distributed in multiple ways , often shared among friends , as well as being sold or provided free of charge on websites around the internet .
Cracks
Cracks are perhaps the most commonly mentioned type of piracy .
In this case the entire game is made DRM free by the addition of a file that impedes the DRM .
Closely associated with cracks are ‘ cracked games . ’
This refers to a DRM - free version of the game that was cracked and then distributed by pirates .
Obtaining a crack or a cracked game requires downloading files to the customer ’s computer from locations that are clearly illegitimate .
Fixing the DRM
Over the last 2 years , Reflexive has made a number of security updates to its DRM that were designed to make one or more of the existing DRM workarounds obsolete and thereby turn the people pirating games into purchasing customers .
While the updates have n’t made the system unbreakable , they have made it so all known or search - engine - findable piracy tools ceased to function .
Fixing The Holes - The Results
Below are the results of Reflexive.com sales and downloads immediately following each update :
Fix 1 – Existing Exploits & Keygens made obsolete – Sales up 70 % , Downloads down 33 %
Fix 2 – Existing Keygens made obsolete – Sales down slightly , Downloads flat
Fix 3 – Existing Cracks made obsolete – Sales flat , Downloads flat
Fix 4 – Keygens made game - specific – Sales up 13 % , Downloads down 16 % ( note : fix made after the release of Ricochet Infinity )
From the results above , it seems clear that eliminating piracy through a stronger DRM can result in significantly increased sales – but sometimes it can have no benefit at all .
So what does that mean for the question about whether a pirated copy means a lost sale ?
The decreases in downloads may provide a clue to that
As we believe that we are decreasing the number of pirates downloading the game with our DRM fixes , combining the increased sales number together with the decreased downloads , we find 1 additional sale for every 1,000 less pirated downloads .
Put another way , for every 1,000 pirated copies we eliminated , we created 1 additional sale .
Though many of the pirates may be simply shifting to another source of games for their illegal activities , the number is nonetheless striking and poignant .
The sales to download ratio found on Reflexive implies that a pirated copy is more similar to the loss of a download ( a poorly converting one ! ) than the loss of a sale .
Though that does n’t make a 92 % piracy rate of one of our banner products any less distressing , knowing that eliminating 50,000 pirated copies might only produce 50 additional legal copies does help put things in perspective .
The Future of Piracy in Casual Games
Certainly in casual games the issue of piracy is n’t going away anytime soon .
As the casual games industry continues to combat piracy , there are many battles still to be fought .
The question most of the portals ask themselves is n’t whether or not to fight piracy , but what is the best way to fight it .
Casual games is an industry still in its adolescence , and certainly as it matures , more and more lessons will be learned about what the best approach is to fighting piracy , and what the realistic returns are of doing so .
Outspoken atheist Rob Sherman , who ( with his daughter ) filed a lawsuit that eventually put a stop to the Mandatory Moment of Silence , was back in the Illinois General Assembly on Wednesday .
He was there arguing Governor Rod Blagojevich ‘s $ 1,000,000 grant to the Pilgrim Baptist Church — which was given to them via the more secular Loop Lab School .
( Shadiness all around . )
Anyway , he got into an exchange with Rep. Monique Davis ( D - Chicago ) .
You wo n’t believe what she said ( emphasis is mine ) :
Davis : I do n’t know what you have against God , but some of us do n’t have much against him .
We look forward to him and his blessings .
And it ’s really a tragedy — it ’s tragic — when a person who is engaged in anything related to God , they want to fight .
They want to fight prayer in school .
I do n’t see you ( Sherman ) fighting guns in school .
You know ?
I ’m trying to understand the philosophy that you want to spread in the state of Illinois .
This is the Land of Lincoln .
This is the Land of Lincoln where people believe in God , where people believe in protecting their children . …
What you have to spew and spread is extremely dangerous , it ’s dangerous– Sherman :
What ’s dangerous , ma’am ?
Davis :
It ’s dangerous to the progression of this state .
And it ’s dangerous for our children to even know that your philosophy exists !
Now you will go to court to fight kids to have the opportunity to be quiet for a minute .
But damn if you ’ll go to [ court ] to fight for them to keep guns out of their hands .
I am fed up !
Get out of that seat !
Sherman :
Thank you for sharing your perspective with me , and I ’m sure that if this matter does go to court —
Davis :
You have no right to be here !
We believe in something .
You believe in destroying !
You believe in destroying what this state was built upon .
According to Davis , atheism is destroying the state .
Corrupt or misguided politicians have nothing to do with it , of course …
As Eric Zorn of the Chicago Tribune puts it , “ consider what the outcry would have been if a lawmaker had launched a similar attack on the beliefs of a religious person . ”
If that happened , you might have actually heard about this story by now .
It would be playing on news stations everywhere .
But since the attack is on atheists , this is likely the first time you ’ve read anything about it .
Not enough for you ?
Listen to the audio of the exchange ( MP3 ) .
Infuriating , is n’t it ?

The Ministry of Defence has announced a public inquiry into one of the most notorious episodes involving British soldiers in Iraq : the death of Baha Mousa , a hotel receptionist , and the abuse of other civilians in Basra in September 2003 .
The unexpected move was announced in a written statement to the Commons this afternoon by Bob Ainsworth , the armed forces minister .
After months of bitter argument in the courts and a court martial that failed to get close to the full story of what happened , the government has decided the issue will not go away and was persuaded that an open inquiry was the best answer .
" Someone died , we must find out what happened and in what circumstances , " a well - placed official told the Guardian .
Mousa , 26 , died while being held for a weekend in a British detention centre .
He had 93 identifiable injuries on his body and had suffered asphyxiation .
Eight other Iraqis were inhumanely treated .
Six soldiers of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , including Colonel Jorge Mendonca , the commanding officer , were acquitted of negligence and abuse .
A corporal admitted inhumane treatment .
No one was convicted of killing Mousa .
Des Browne , the defence secretary , admitted in March to " substantive breaches " of the European convention on human rights , specifically articles two and three of the convention , which guarantee the right to life and prohibit torture .
The admissions , which could cost the MoD millions of pounds in compensation , followed a vigorous campaign in and outside the courts by relatives of Mousa and the other Iraqi victims .
They and their lawyers argued that the Human Rights
Act demanded an independent inquiry into the incident .
Today , Browne told MPs : " A public inquiry into the death of Baha Mousa is the right thing to do .
It will reassure the public that we are leaving no stone unturned in investigating his tragic death .
The army has nothing to hide in this respect and is keen to learn all the lessons it can from this terrible incident . "
The inquiry will investigate not only what happened but why .
It will look into why the soldiers and other senior figures in the British army were apparently unaware that five brutal interrogation techniques - including wall - standing , hooding , subjection to noise , sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and drink - were banned .
The methods were expressly prohibited in 1972 by the then prime minister , Edward Heath , after the European human rights court condemned techniques used by the security forces in Northern Ireland .
The court martial heard that British soldiers used " conditioning " techniques to " soften up " Iraqi detainees .
It revealed that army officers had ignored the 1972 ban on hooding and other techniques .
Signficantly , Brigadier Euan Duncan , the director of the army 's Intelligence Corps , told the court that US commanders had criticised British forces in 2003 for failing to extract sufficient intelligence from detainees .
In a report earlier this year , Brigadier Robert Aitken , the army 's director of personnel strategy , said British soldiers had not been told about their obligations under international law .
Troops were given " scant " information on how to treat civilian detainees and needed " a better understanding between right and wrong " , he said .
The military 's Defence Intelligence and Security Centre did not mention the five techniques banned in 1972 , he said .
Phil Shiner , a lawyer for the Iraqis , insisted today that any new inquiry must include other claims of ill - treatment by British troops .
" It will not be sufficient if the inquiry has a narrow remit and does not look at all the cases and issues , " he said .
" The public , as well as parliament , must be given the opportunity of fully understanding what went wrong in our detention policy in Iraq and what are the lessons to be learned for the future . "
He said his clients wanted a single inquiry into the British detention policy in Iraq .
" The most serious allegations that could be made about UK forces ' behaviour in Iraq include that 20 Iraqis were executed at Abu Naji facility in May 2004 , another nine survivors tortured , and that bodies were mutilated , " Shiner said .
The investigation announced today will be held under the 2005 Inquiries Act .
The act - drawn up after the Bloody Sunday inquiry and the Hutton inquiry into the death of the government weapons expert David Kelly - gave the government new powers to control aspects of the conduct of independent public inquiries .
Thomas Kohnstamm says he never visited the streets of Colombia Lonely Planet has insisted its travel books are accurate , after reports that one of its former writers claimed he had made up sections in its guides .
Author Thomas Kohnstamm said he had accepted free services , contravening company policy , and did not even visit one of the countries he wrote about .
Lonely Planet says it has reviewed the books that Mr Kohnstamm contributed to but has so far found no inaccuracies .
It also denied that the author 's methods were common in travel writing .
" It is n't commonplace , because we have no evidence that the things that he alleges that he did working on the Brazil 5 guide ... applied to other books , " Stephen Palmer , the chief executive of Lonely Planet , told BBC News .

Mr Kohnstamm has been publicising his new book , Do Travel Writers Go To Hell ?

He says that after having sex with a waitress on a table after hours , he reviewed the restaurant with the words " the table service is friendly " .
He also said he never visited Colombia , despite being hired to write about it .
" They did n't pay me enough to go to Colombia .
I wrote the book in San Francisco .
I got the information from a chick I was dating - an intern at the Colombian consulate , " he was quoted as telling Australia 's Sunday Telegraph newspaper .
Piers Pickard , from the publisher of the Lonely Planet guide books , said Mr Kohnstamm 's claim was " disingenuous " , because he was commissioned to write about the history of Colombia , not to review services in the country .
" Thomas ' claims are not an accurate reflection of how our authors work , " Mr Pickard told the Associated Press news agency .
Other travel writers , while not endorsing Mr Kohnstamm 's methods , said he was reporting genuine failures in the travel - writing industry - that writers are poorly paid , have to cover their own costs , and were expected to check a vast amount of detail .
However , Stephen Palmer defended Lonely Planet 's payment system , saying : " We 're pretty confident that we pay right at the top of the range . "

Maybe it 's the booze they serve at Cafe Milano in Georgetown .
Maybe it 's just Madsen being Madsen .
After all , journalists and writers with any lick of integrity have been shamed , shocked and traumatized by the " suicides " of both Hunter S. Thompson and Gary Webb -- not to mention the sudden " fading into the discredited bastion of mental health treatment " of Mike Ruppert .
Having seen this vast panoply of weirdness unfolding before our very eyes while creampuffs and lightweights like Matt Lauer and Brit Hume have made all the money -- perhaps Madsen has just had enough .
Perhaps he is ready to be a hero .
Or a martyr .
At any rate , our intrepid Wayne Madsen wanted our beloved Vice President , Richard " the Dick " Cheney to know that his dealings with Palfrey 's escort agency in the 1990's were n't going to be forgotten .
One would infer that Madsen has some evidence regarding Cheney 's addiction to Cialis - laden trysts with frustrated hookers who could n't get the poor bastard off with an enema bag and a stick of dynamite .
But why stop there , says I .
Why not bring up Shandra Levy and Gary " Which Way Did He Go " Condit for good measure ?
Why not bring up Norm Mineta 's testimony before the 911 Commission and how at odds it was with Veep McDicky ?
People pay good money to see political figures in women 's bloomers and pumps .
Especially since Rudy Guilliani lowered the bar for crossdressers everywhere with his disgusting displays of transvetitism ( no offense to the actual " ladies in waiting " out there in dollsville ) .
No , if there is one thing an old oil man and drunkard like Dickey would hate it would be the humiliation of being photographed having illicit sex with a penguin .
Or a spotted owl .
In pumps .
It would put all this sabre rattling and threats of wiping out Iran like Hiroshima or Nagasaki into some actual perspective .
It 's okay to be mentally ill , Dickey .
Your mother was .
The sin is not doing something about it .
The sin is creating flashburns of Iranian children on their school playgrounds , or blowing everyone but the truly guilty into red mist simply because you have n't known how to pleasure a real woman in , what , six or seven heart surgeries ?
I hope Mr. Cheney lives long enough to be brought to the gallows in his wheelchair .
Enjoy the bunker , Dickie .
Rats make really good eating once you get past the fact that they 're -- well -- rats .
The report questioned if pre-flights checks were done A Belfast - bound plane had to make an emergency descent of 8,000 feet after crew apparently did not turn on anti-icing switches , a report said .
Seventy - one people were on board the Flybe flight from Edinburgh to Belfast City Airport in December 2006 when several cockpit instruments failed .
An Air Accident Investigation Branch report questioned if the crew had carried out a full pre-flight check .
No one was injured .
Flybe has now made changes to its training procedures .
According to Air Accident investigators , the crew of the Dash 8 had to take emergency action to get the plane to a lower level after several cockpit instruments failed .
The cockpit display relied on readings from instruments outside the aircraft .
' Distracted '
However , these stop working if they become iced up and pilots need to switch on heaters to ensure this does not happen .
The report said that one of the heaters was definitely not turned on and , " in all probability " the crew had failed to turn on two others .
This was only done after the pilots had taken the plane from 16,000 to 8,000 feet to reduce the threat of ice , it found .
The report said the crew 's pre-flight checks may not have been done properly and that they may have become distracted before take off .

Ryan Singel over at Wired.com spells out some of the mysterious activity on the part of the US government recently .
Most disturbing to me is the attempt by the NSA to take over cyber surveillance on US citizens .
Or rather continue their cyber surveillance of US citizens .
Senators Joe Lieberman ( I - Connecticut ) and Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) state in a letter to DHS Secretary Chertoff on Friday :
DHS has requested substantial new resources for cyber security , and it is critical that the funds are spent carefully and appropriately .
The Department has requested an additional $ 83 million dollars for the National Cyber Security Division ( NCSD ) for fiscal year 2009 .
Including the $ 115 million that was awarded for the initiative in the FY 2008 omnibus appropriations bill , this would be a nearly $ 200 million dollar increase , tripling the amount of money spent on cyber security in DHS since 2007 .
I think that means that $ 300 million is being spent on cyber security within DHS .
That is a lot of money .
I wonder where it is going ?
What is really perplexing is evidently DHS plans on spending $ 30 Billion on cyber security .
Now that is a lot of money .
Keep in mind that that is almost twice the annual market for all security products in the WORLD .
The senators go on to ask seventeen questions of Mr. Chertoff .
Here is a good one :
For example , on March 20th , you announced that Rod Beckstrom would be the Director of the new National Cyber Security Center ( NCSC ) within DHS .
Prior to this announcement , committee staff had been instructed that the existence of the NCSC itself was classified .
Moreover , the Department has yet to publicly disclose very many details on the role of the NCSC beyond the brief press release .
To clarify these matters , we renew our request for an unclassified summary of the CNCI – a request made by Committee staff over five months ago .
Pretty strange behavior to classify the existance of the Cyber Security Center , then announce its leader in a public press release .
There are lots more unanswered questions .
I think it is important for Congress to realize that good security does not have to be secret .
Just as good encryption algorithms are published and all " secret " methods of encryption are suspect , security measures must be transparent so that they can withstand the scrutiny of overseers and experts .
Allowing the DHS to keep its cyber security measures secret is a formula for disaster .
The arrests came at Nepal 's first all - women protests against China
Nepalese police have arrested some 560 Tibetan women , including many Buddhist nuns , after breaking up demonstrations against China 's crackdown in Tibet .
In the first example of all - women protests , three rallies in Kathmandu were quickly stopped by police .
It was the biggest round - up since Tibetan exiles began near daily demonstrations in March .
Protestors wearing black armbands wept and shouted " We want free Tibet " as they were dragged to police vans .
Police said those detained were being held in detention centres around the capital , and would be freed later .

Kathmandu is home to thousands of Tibetan exiles who have mounted almost daily protests against Beijing since deadly riots broke out in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in March .
Rioting erupted after days of protests pivoting around the anniversary of the failed 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule .
More than 20,000 Tibetans have been living in Nepal since fleeing their Himalayan homeland after the failed uprising and China 's subsequent crack - down .
Nepal says it cannot allow Tibetans to demonstrate because it recognises Tibet as an integral part of China .
But the UN says the mass arrests are against the spirit of a society governed by the rule of law .
The Examiner is reporting that new technology could open up an area , which in 1995 had 151 million barrels of recoverable oil ( quite small ) .
Thanks to new technology , now drillers could get at approximately 25 times that .
The Bakken Formation , as its called , is located in eastern Montana and western North Dakota .
Here ’s the real meat of it :
That would make it by far the largest recoverable oil area in the 48 mainland states — and , if available all at once , it could replace every drop of American oil imports for about 10 months .
But here ’s where the story gets even better : Estimates of total oil deposits in the Bakken Formation run between 170 billion and 400 billion barrels , or in other words , up to 100 times the size of even the new estimate of what is “ technically recoverable . ”
That ’s where the lesson really comes in :
If , in 13 years , technology has improved enough to multiply the recoverable assets by 25 times , what ’s to say that technological advancements wo n’t make available the rest of these vast reserves in an additional 10 or 20 years ?
Note to our representatives in Congress : do not let what happened in Alaska ’s ANWR happen here .
Sequoia Voting Systems ' CEO , Jack Blaine , Sent Deceptive Letter to Windy City Officials Following ' Evasive ' and ' Troublesome ' Testimony on his Company 's Control by Smartmatic , a Chavez - tied E- Voting Firm
Documents Reveal Officials Sought to Ensure Venezuelan Company 's Divestiture of Sequoia Was ' Not a Sham Transaction Designed to Fool Regulators ' ; Recent Reporting by The BRAD BLOG Reveals That it Was ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/21/2008 , 11:02 am PT
-- by Brad Friedman
The CEO and President of one of America 's largest voting machine companies , Sequoia Voting Systems , gave both deceptive , and carefully selective , answers in his reply to a letter sent earlier this year from two high - ranking officials in Chicago , according to documents recently obtained during an ongoing investigation by The BRAD BLOG .
Sequoia 's chief executive , Jack Blaine , repeated knowingly false answers , at least three different times , in his January 18 response to Chicago Alderman Edward M. Burke and the Chair of Chicago 's Board of Election Commissioners Langdon D. Neal .
The pair had written to the company on January 11 , expressing concerns about the truth behind Sequoia 's claims that they had completely divested from their purportedly " former " parent company , Smartmatic , the Venezuelan - run firm with direct ties to Hugo Chavez and his government .
Last year , as media reports revealed the true extent of Smartmatic 's shadowy foreign ownership --- and with it , the direct control of some 20 % of U.S. elections --- the firm came under close scrutiny by federal investigators from Treasury Department , the FBI and the IRS .
In November of last year , Sequoia announced that it had " completely " divested from Smartmatic in a management team - led buyout , thus ending an official review by Treasury 's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) .
But in January , the officials from the Windy City --- where Sequoia holds one of the company 's most lucrative contracts --- had continuing concerns about whether the sale was legitimate , or simply a dodge to avoid scrutiny by federal investigators .
They were right to be concerned .
In their letter , Burke and Neale requested written responses from Sequoia after what was described as " evasive " and " troublesome " sworn testimony from Blaine the previous year , following " malfunctions of Sequoia voting machines during primary elections held on March 21 , 2006 . "
In his testimony before a Chicago City Council joint committee in April of 2006 , Blaine had claimed he did n't know the specific details of the financial arrangement that existed between Sequoia Voting Systems , Inc. , and the Smartmatic Corporation , despite being president of both companies at the time .
He did , however , manage to admit to the joint committee that at least 15 Venezuelan nationals were flown in to assist in the tabulation of votes in the troubled March '06 election and that the Venezuelans had access to Sequoia 's source code .
Blaine also conceded that it was " possible " that Chavez ' government could hold an interest in the company , but that he was n't certain because the ownership of Smartmatic was concealed in an off - shore trust .
In their series of follow - up questions to Blaine in January 2008 , Alderman Burke noted that " the entire Smartmatic episode has served as a reminder of how important it is to know and trust who is counting the votes in our elections . "
" It is therefore important , " he continued , " to confirm that the sale of Sequoia by Smartmatic is not a sham transaction designed to fool regulators and to further confirm that Smartmatic and the government of Venezuela have no ability to influence or control the new owners of Sequoia . "
Blaine 's written responses to the officials , sent to Neale the following week , were dishonest , misleading , and even cleverly evasive on at least one crucially important point .
His answers also contradict details recently exposed in a series of investigative exclusives by The BRAD BLOG , revealing several startling facts about the true ownership and control of Sequoia .
Moreover , after we broke the news in April , concerning the attempted hostile takeover of Sequoia by competitor Hart InterCivic , Blaine appeared to joke with employees during a confidential company - wide " town hall " teleconference about " the line " he used with yet another Chicago official , Cook County Clerk David Orr .
" He accepted it completely , " Blaine told employees , as he underscored the importance of keeping details of the attempted takeover confidential , and how he was being less than forthcoming about it with the company 's customers ...
LYING ABOUT SMARTMATIC'S CONTROL OF SEQUOIA
In November of last year , as a federal investigation by the Treasury Department 's CFIUS was closing in on the true provenance of Smartmatic 's shadowy ownership , and after a failed attempt to find an outside buyer for the company , Blaine and several other Sequoia and / or Smartmatic executives formed SVS Holdings , Inc. , and proceeded to purchase Sequoia from the parent company .
However , a recent series of exclusive BRAD BLOG investigative reports has revealed that the sale , which succeeded in moving CFIUS to end their official review of the matter , was not what it seemed to be .
Recent court documents unearthed and published by The BRAD BLOG , detailing the terms of the attempted hostile takeover of Sequoia by competitor Hart InterCivic , make clear that Smartmatic still retains the intellectual property ( IP ) rights over Sequoia 's popular , if oft - failed e-voting systems , as well as licensing control of the software used in their voting machines and tabulators .
The April 2008 opinion [ PDF ] by Delaware 's Court of Chancery Vice Chancellor Stephen P. Lamb also disclosed an element of the confidential agreement struck between CFIUS and Smartmatic last year , which had apparently disallowed even " indirect " control over Sequoia Voting Systems , Inc. , by the Venezuelan firm .
However , as we reported in late April , statements made by Blaine himself , during a confidential , company - wide teleconference convened to explain the attempted hostile takeover in the wake of our report , confirmed that Sequoia has no claim to the IP rights of voting systems bearing the name Sequoia , including those electronic systems recently purchased by Cook County and the Chicago Board of Elections .
Rather , it is Smartmatic that retains control of those rights , as the software itself is used by Sequoia under a continuing licensing agreement with the off - shore company which continues to supply the hardware and software used in Venezuelan elections under Chavez .
Blaine 's January '08 letter [ PDF ] , in response to Alderman Burke and Chairman Neal 's letter [ PDF ] earlier that month , claims --- at least three times --- that his management - led buy - out team had " completely eliminated " Smartmatic 's " ownership , control and operational rights of any kind in Sequoia . "
" Any rumors or speculation to the contrary are wrong and unfounded , " Blaine wrote to the Chicago officials .
Blaine 's thrice - repeated line was the same one , word for word , used by Sequoia in their official announcement of " new corporate ownership " in November of 2007 as they appeared to be breaking away from Smartmatic .
In describing the general details of the financial arrangement , the press release used what would become Blaine 's Chicago boiler plate explanation , that the deal " completely eliminates Smartmatic 's ownership , control and operational rights of any kind in Sequoia . "
But our reporting to date --- and Blaine 's curious failure to respond at all to one key question from Burke , while offering answers , accurate or otherwise , to all the others --- demonstrates that Blaine blatantly misled the Chicago officials in response to their well - merited concerns .
" IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER WE HAVE THE IP OR NOT "
During the April 11th , 2008 conference call which Blaine convened to explain the attempted Hart takeover to his employees , after we broke the story , he was confronted with a question from an employee about one of the details in our report .
The employee asked about the ownership of the Intellectual Property ( IP ) rights of the voting systems sold in the United States by Sequoia .
" It does n't matter whether you have the IP rights , or you do n't have the IP rights , " Blaine explained on the call that he 'd repeatedly stressed should remain confidential .
His comments were in direct contradiction to both what he'd told the Chicago officials in January and what his company had been representing to election officials and in courtrooms across the country .
" We have the source code , and we have the right to modify it any way we want to modify it , " he explained to the employee , concerning the company 's ongoing licensing agreement with Smartmatic .
" So it does n't matter really whether we have the IP or not . "
He then went on to claim that he did n't care all that much about those IP rights during his negotiations the previous year with Smartmatic .
" I did n't particularly want the IP ... As we 've discussed in the past , I believe we 've really come across the perfect time to change our portfolio going forward .
And it's not gonna be dependent on the Smartmatic technology , or the IP or anything else .
It 's gonna be dependent on what we collectively believe the market , and what the future standards , will require . "
While intending to " maintain " existing voting systems they 'd sold , now in use across the United States , he was more interested in selling the company 's new line of voting machines , " codenamed : System Nine , " as he elucidated to his underlings .
The admission was quite a departure from his repeated written claims to Chicago 's Alderman and Chair of their Election Commission , that " Smartmatic has no ownership , control and operational rights of any kind in Sequoia . "
Additionally , the Delaware court documents also revealed that Smartmatic had succeeded in including an interesting non-compete provision in their negotiations to sell Sequoia to Hart .
The proposed agreement would bar Hart from competing with Smartmatic for elections business in a number of foreign countries .
" Hart promises not to compete with Smartmatic in Latin America , the Philippines , and Belgium , " Vice Chancellor Lamb wrote in describing the proposed Hart / Smartmatic agreement .
" In return , Smartmatic promises to grant Hart a license to use its intellectual property found in Sequoia 's machines . "
The written opinion from Lamb further underscores the control Smartmatic retains over Sequoia , and which they will likely continue to retain whether or not Hart is successful in its takeover attempt .
The management team that had purchased Sequoia , Blaine 's SVS Holdings , Inc. , has the right in its original contract to match the deal from Hart .
Sources at both companies confirm that Sequoia / SVS is attempting to do exactly that , and may even be successful ( we hope to have more , in the near future , on the attempts by Sequoia / SVS to save themselves , and the extraordinary financial measures and risks they are currently undertaking to try and do so . )
So whether SVS Holdings or Hart InterCivic wrestles some of the company away from Smartmatic , which currently holds a $ 2 million loan note from SVS ' original " purchase " of the company , the Venezuelan Chavez - tied firm will still have control over software licensing rights and intellectual property rights for the voting systems used in some 20 % of U.S. elections .
Smartmatic also has the continuing right to determine where Sequoia may or may not do business outside of the U.S .
All in direct contradiction to claims that last years " new corporate ownership " had " completely eliminate [d ]
Smartmatic 's ownership , control and operational rights of any kind in Sequoia . "
For its part , Hart InterCivic , a direct competitor of Sequoia 's which Blaine told his employees on the conference call currently maintains control of some 8 % of the election industry in the U.S. , has troubles of its own .
The firm is facing a company whistleblower 's federal fraud lawsuit unsealed last March .
No matter what , it seems , those who 've gone into business with Sequoia will be saddled with Smartmatic whether they know it , or like it , or not .
And worse , they may possibly even be forced to do business with a company facing a federal false claims lawsuit to boot .
* * *
As if Blaine 's thrice - stated written deception to the two Chicago officials was n't blatant enough , he appears to have attempted to fool the officials regarding these same points in one other curious point in his written reply .
The January 11 , 2008 , letter from Alderman Burke and Chairman Neal had requested Blaine answer and / or produce supporting documents in response to a series of bulleted questions .
Most of those questions were re-typed in Blaine 's response , and numbered , ( eg. " Ald. Burke Question # 1 " ) preceding each answer offered in response by Blaine .
But one question / request --- which would have been # 5 --- was completely skipped by Blaine in his responses .
Given his sequential numbering of the previously un-numbered questions , the " oversight " was easy to miss , since question # 6 became numbered as question # 5 and so on .
Only close comparison with the original reveals that Blaine disappeared one of the questions entirely .
The question / request which Blaine failed to even address in his response :
Please list any license , royalty and / or other intellectual property agreements between Sequoia and Smartmatic and / or their affiliates .
Given what we now know , it 's little wonder Blaine conveniently " forgot " to respond to that request .
Alderman Burke 's spokesman Donal Quinlan told
The BRAD BLOG that while their office is " likely to comment on this matter in the future , " they are choosing to " not comment at the moment " as they further look into the matter .
Repeated requests for comment from Chairman Neal 's office went unanswered .
DECEIVING THE COOK COUNTY CLERK TOO
It would n't be the last time Blaine felt it necessary to be less than forthcoming with officials from Chicago and / or Cook County , IL , where they maintain one of the company 's largest contracts , struck in 2006 .
On the heels of The BRAD BLOG 's original exclusive report disclosing the attempted Hart takeover , Cook County Clerk David Orr apparently expressed concern about the company 's current and / or future ownership in a conversation with the Sequoia CEO and President .
At the end of the " town hall " teleconference explaining the shake - up to his employees , Blaine bragged of " the line " that he had used to ease Orr 's concerns during a discussion earlier that day .
" I apologize again that we did n't do this earlier , " Blaine told the employees on the call , adding , ironically enough , " I 'm a big believer in communicating , but our hands were tied until we finally got to go through this , and got some agreements from the other side to , to uh , allow this to occur . "
It 's not clear from his comments whether the " other side " referred to is Hart or Smartmatic .
Given VP of Communications & External Affairs Michelle Shafer 's refusal to respond to queries from The BRAD BLOG , since we originally broke this story , and the secretive and litigious nature of Sequoia and Blaine , as witnessed by their various recent attempts ( see here and here , for example ) to keep information from the public , it 's amusing to hear his claims that he 's " a big believer in communicating . "
Following Shafer 's lack of response to a request for comment prior to our original story , she sent out an email memo to all employees within minutes after we published our story , " as a reminder " to " direct any and all calls from the media , and the like " to her .
Yet she has still failed to respond to any of our inquiries since then .
Blaine followed his comments with another reminder to employees to keep details of the phone call , and the attempted buy - out " in the family , " before quickly clarifying : " I mean within the Sequoia family , not necessarily your real family .
And , uh , limit who talks to the customers and somewhat what we say ... actually we can't talk about everything I said here today with customers . "
He then explained " the line " he gave to Cook County Clerk Orr in response to his concerns earlier that day .
" Basically , the line I used with David Orr today for example , when he called --- and he accepted it completely --- was , uh yes , the rumor 's true , but the present ownership is uh , plans to uh , retain control .
But I did n't know for sure what the outcome would be . "
In response to details , and quotes from that phone call , Orr 's spokeswoman , Courtney Greve , declined specific comment to The BRAD BLOG , stating for the record only : " Since we were not privy to that conference call , we decline to comment . "
She confirmed , however , that her office is following these developments , and our coverage of them , closely .
LOCAL ELECTION INTEGRITY ADVOCATES CONCERNED
The news of Blaine 's latest prevarications came as little surprise to Election Integrity advocates from the Illinois Ballot Integrity Project ( IBIP ) .
The non-partisan , non-profit election watchdogs have tussled with various Illinois election officials on both the right and left for years .
They 've challenged both the wisdom and legality of a number of their decisions on administrative election procedures , voting and tabulation equipment and questionable contracts with private vendors in a number of state counties .
IBIP has been informing officials about Sequoia - related concerns for years .
In early 2006 the chair of their Suburban Cook County Chapter , Robert Wilson wrote about the " daunting task " of " tracking the ownership of Smartmatic " from one international holding firm in one country , to another investment firm in yet another country .
The latest revelations were predictably disturbing to Melissa Urda , IBIP 's state chair .
" If Sequoia 's ties to Venezuela were basically hidden from Chicago officials , what other aspects of the voting machines , like software security , have been concealed from us ? " she commented via email .
" Again , and again election reformists ask the question : how are we to trust that these machines are correctly interpreting and tallying the intent of the voter , and the answer is , of course , we can 't , " Urda decried .
For now , neither she nor the voters of Chicago and Cook County have a choice .
They 're stuck with Sequoia until something changes .
FENDING OFF THE TAKEOVER ... AND CFIUS
In the past several weeks , Sequoia / SVS has been taking extraordinary measures in their efforts to raise the initial $ 7 million needed to match Hart 's takeover offer to Smartmatic .
Payments to some vendors have been withheld , bond deadlines have been missed ( such as in New York , where the company 's huge new $ 100 million contract now may be perilously in question ) , and certain accounts receivable from a number of clients across the country , including Cook County , IL , have been leveraged without advance notice to the customers --- to the surprise and consternation of several of them --- as part of a scheme to help the cash - poor Sequoia raise the hard funds needed to match Hart 's offer in hopes of fending off the takeover .
Hart has been temporarily sidelined from the tussle , as Sequoia / SVS and Smartmatic , continue their rather contentious negotiations .
Among the recent stumbling blocks , according to sources : attempts by Sequoia / SVS to find a way to break away , once and for all , from their continuing direct and / or indirect control by Smartmatic .
That , despite Blaine 's repeated assertions to Chicago officials , in his deceptive letter of January 2008 , that " all terms and conditions of the [ Smartmatic / Sequoia divestiture ] transaction were reviewed and approved by CFIUS . "
Well then there 's nothing to worry about here right ?
If you believe that , then apparently you do n't know Jack .
The story will continue .
Stay tuned ...

RABAT - Archaeologists have uncovered shells used for finery by prehistoric man 85,000 years ago in a cave in eastern Morocco , the country 's heritage institute said today .
A research team led by archaeology and heritage institute ( INSAP ) member Abdeljalil Bouzouggar and Nick Barton from Oxford University found the 20 perforated shells in a cave near Taforalt between March and April this year .
The Nassarius gibbosulus shells are the type prehistoric man would have worn , according to a statement from the Moroccan Ministry for Culture .
In preparation for my PyCon talk on HTML I thought I ’d do a performance comparison of several parsers and document models .
The situation is a little complex because there ’s different steps in handling HTML :
Parse the HTML Parse it into something ( a document object ) Serialize it
Some libraries handle 1 , some handle 2 , some handle 1 , 2 , 3 , etc .
For instance , ElementSoup uses ElementTree as a document , but BeautifulSoup as the parser .
BeautifulSoup itself has a document object included .
HTMLParser only parses , while html5lib includes tree builders for several kinds of trees .
There is also XML and HTML serialization .
So I ’ve taken several combinations and made benchmarks .
The combinations are :
lxml : a parser , document , and HTML serializer .
Also can use BeautifulSoup and html5lib for parsing .
serializer .

BeautifulSoup : a parser , document , and HTML serializer .
serializer .
html5lib : a parser .
It has a serializer , but I did n’t use it .
It has a built - in document object ( simpletree ) , but I do n’t think it ’s meant for much more than self - testing .
ElementTree : a document object , and XML serializer ( I think newer versions might include an HTML serializer , but I did n’t use it ) .
It does n’t have a parser , but I used html5 lib to parse to it .
( I did n’t use the ElementSoup . )
serializer ( I think newer versions might include an serializer , but I did n’t use it ) .
It does n’t have a parser , but I used html5 lib to parse to it .
( I did n’t use the ElementSoup . )
cElementTree : a document object implemented as a C extension .
I did n’t find any serializer .
HTMLParser : a parser .
It did n’t parse to anything .
It also does n’t parse lots of normal ( but maybe invalid ) HTML .
When using it , I just ran documents through the parser , not constructing any tree .

htmlfill : this library uses HTMLParser , but at least pays a little attention to the elements as they are parsed .
Genshi : includes a parser , document , and HTML serializer .
serializer .
xml.dom.minidom : a document model built into the standard library , which html5 lib can parse to .
( I do not recommend using minidom for anything — some reasons will become apparent in this post , but there are many other reasons not covered why you should n’t use it . )
I expected lxml to perform well , as it is based on the C library libxml2 .
But it performed better than I realized , far better than any other library .
As a result , if it was n’t for some persistent installation problems ( especially on Macs ) I would recommend lxml for just about any HTML task .
You can try the code out here .
I ’ve included all the sample data , and the commands I ran for these graphs are here .
These tests use a fairly random selection of HTML files ( 355 total ) taken from python.org .
Parsing
The first test parses the documents .
Things to note : lxml is 6 x faster than even HTMLParser , even though HTMLParser is n’t doing anything ( lxml is building a tree in memory ) .
I did n’t include all the things html5lib can parse to , because they all take about the same amount of time .
xml.dom.minidom is only included because it is so noticeably slow .
Genshi is fairly fast , but it ’s the most fragile of the parsers .
html5lib , lxml , and BeautifulSoup are all fairly similarly robust .
html5lib has the benefit of ( at least in theory ) being the correct parsing of HTML .
While I do n’t really believe it matters often , lxml releases the GIL during parsing .
Serialization
Serialization is pretty fast across all the libraries , though again lxml leads the pack by a long distance .
ElementTree and minidom are only doing XML serialization , but there ’s no reason that the HTML equivalent would be any faster .
That Genshi is slower than minidom is surprising .
That anything is worse than minidom is generally surprising .
Memory
The last test is of memory .
I do n’t have a lot of confidence in the way I made this test , but I ’m sure it means something .
This was done by parsing all the documents and holding the documents in memory , and using the RSS size reported by ps to see how much the process had grown .
All the libraries should be imported when calculating the baseline , so only the documents and parsing should cause the memory increase .
HTMLParser is a baseline , as it just keeps the documents in memory as a string , and creates some intermediate strings .
The intermediate strings do n’t end up accounting for anything , since the memory used is almost exactly the combined size of all the files .
A tricky part of this measurement is that the Python allocator does n’t let go of memory that it requests , so if a parser creates lots of intermediate strings and then releases them the process will still hang onto all that memory .
To detect this I tried allocating new strings until the process size grew ( trying to detect allocated but unused memory ) , but this did n’t reveal much — only the BeautifulSoup parser , serialized to an lxml tree , showed much extra memory .
This is one of the only places where html5lib with cElementTree was noticeably different than html5lib with ElementTree .
Not that surprising , I guess , since I did n’t find a coded - in - C serializer , and I imagine the tree building is only going to be a lot faster for cElementTree if you are building the tree from C code ( as its native XML parser would do ) .
lxml is probably memory efficient because it uses native libxml2 data structures , and only creates Python objects on demand .
In Conclusion
I knew lxml was fast before I started these benchmarks , but I did n’t expect it to be quite this fast .
So in conclusion : lxml kicks ass .
You can use it in ways you could n’t use other systems .
You can parse , serialize , parse , serialize , and repeat the process a couple times with your HTML before the performance will hurt you .
With high - level constructs many constructs can happen in very fast C code without calling out to Python .
As an example , if you do an XPath query , the query string is compiled into something native and traverses the native libxml2 objects , only creating Python objects to wrap the query results .
In addition , things like the modest memory use make me more confident that lxml will act reliably even under unexpected load .
I also am more confident about using a document model instead of stream parsing .
It is sometimes felt that streamed parsing is better : you do n’t keep the entire document in memory , and your work generally scales linearly with your document size .
HTMLParser is a stream - based parser , emitting events for each kind of token ( open tag , close tag , data , etc ) .
Genshi also uses this model , with higher - level stuff like filters to make it feel a bit more natural .
But the stream model is not the natural way to process a document , it ’s actually a really awkward way to handle a document that is better seen as a single thing .
If you are processing gigabyte files of XML it can make sense ( and both the normally document - oriented lxml and Element Tree offer options when this happens ) .
This does n’t make any sense for HTML .
And these tests make me believe that even really big HTML documents can be handled quite well by lxml , so a huge outlying document wo n’t break a system that is appropriately optimized for handling normal sized documents .
