CAIRO , Egypt — Egyptian security forces have clashed with demonstrators in downtown Cairo for the second time this month , in a sign that foment over a worsening economy and political uncertainty is growing .
Plainclothes security officers beat at least one protester before bundling him into a car during clashes on Tuesday , witnesses said .
The demonstration , which also saw hundreds of protesters physically taunt riot soldiers , was aimed at challenging police brutality that occurred at a rally last week .
During that protest , activists and journalists were attacked and about 100 people were detained .
Egypt ’s excessive use of force to quell political assemblies — which are illegal under the country ’s controversial emergency law — is nothing new , especially during a parliamentary election year .
In spite of the threat of violence , a worsening economy and concerns over the health and future of 81 - year - old President Hosni Mubarak have led to increasing unrest on the streets of the capital .
“ There ’s been an increase in sporadic strikes and violence in the past five years , ” said Maye Kassem , professor of political science at the American University in Cairo and author of several books on Egyptian politics .
“ Discontent is rising and more people are willing to voice their opinions . ”
Signs of discontent are visible everywhere , but perhaps nowhere more so than on the steps of Egypt ’s parliament building .
Workers from various industrial groups and companies have spent days , and in some cases weeks , camped out on the streets near Egypt ’s parliament .
A group of handicapped Egyptians have parked themselves directly across the street from the lower house of parliament for the past two months .
Chanting , waving signs , and braving the chilly nights , these activists are holding peaceful , extended sit-ins , rather than potentially rowdy street protests .
Still , they face metal barricades blocked by riot troops .
Most are hoping to bring attention to a specific set of various labor issues : dismal working conditions , limited rights and , above all , low wages .
Egypt ’s official minimum wage is a meager $ 7 per month .
Public sector workers too have increasingly joined the fray .
Archaeologists from the Supreme Council of Antiquities recently staged public protests demanding higher wages , according to a report published this week by the independent Al Masry Al Youm newspaper .
There are only two options in the attempt to solve the growing unrest , said Magdy Sobhy , an economist at the Al - Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies , a government - funded think tank .
“ The first option involves a lot of changes in the Egyptian economy , including providing more jobs , a higher minimum wage and increasing production to settle the growing inflation , ” said Sobhy .
“ The only other option is chaos . ”
But chaos is exactly what the almost 30 - year - old emergency law seeks to avoid .
Egypt ’s modern emergency law came into effect almost immediately with Mubarak ’s ascension to power after President Anwar Sadat ’s assassination in 1981 .
Its original purpose was to combat extremism , but critics argue the emergency law takes away virtually all human rights at the discretion of Egypt ’s vast police force .
“ The emergency law gives state security the impunity to control elections , conduct arbitrary detention and military tribunals , and even torture , ” said Gamal Eid , executive director of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information .
“ The government can do anything they want in the name of public peace . ”
On April 6 , protesters demanding an end to the emergency law quickly realized the full might of the same government power they were rallying against .
Almost as soon as it started , the peaceful demonstration was over , crushed by plainclothes police officers under the watchful eye of baton - wielding riot guards .
There were several instances of violence , as security beat and dragged several protesters down the street before hauling them off to detention .
Journalists were also targeted that day .
Police , hit , pushed and knocked over several reporters while their cameras and tapes were confiscated .
The violence witnessed over the past week is reminiscent of street protests from 2005 , also a parliamentary election year like this one .
Such violence is par for the course in any authoritarian regime , said Kassem .
“ Still , the regime is firmly in control , even if they are acting more harshly than they normally do , ” said Kassem .
“ They may be more nervous than before because they are in a period of transition . ”
The transition is not yet official , but Mubarak ’s age and extended absence from Egypt while in Germany recovering from gallbladder surgery last month created ample public speculation over potential successors .
Perhaps complicating matters is the recent arrival of Mohamed ElBaradei , the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , and the man many Egyptians are hoping will challenge Mubarak in the upcoming presidential race .
At the very least , say supporters , ElBaradei should help to bring more transparency to Egypt ’s restricted political landscape , which has become stagnant over the past three decades of Mubarak ’s rule .
ElBaradei received a hero ’s welcome from supporters upon his arrival in Cairo in February , and has attracted hundreds to the streets in his recent travels around Egypt .
ElBaradei did not attend the latest protests , much to the dismay of supporters chanting his name in the onlooking faces of security forces .
He did , however , respond to government through his Twitter account , calling the April 6 reports “ repugnant and inhumane . ”
“ Detentions and beatings during peaceful demonstration [ sic ] is an insult to the dignity of every Egyptian , ” tweeted ElBaradei the day after the protest .
“ Shame . ”
The arrests also drew condemnation in Washington .
Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley announced at the daily briefing on April 7 that the U.S. was deeply concerned about arrests made under Egypt ’s emergency law .
“ The government of Egypt must uphold the rights of all people to express their political views peacefully and to ensure due process , ” Crowley said .
Egypt ’s Foreign Ministry later rejected Washington ’s “ interference ” in Egypt ’s internal affairs in a statement published in the state - funded Al - Ahram newspaper .
Egypt , the Arab world ’s most populous country , has long been one of Washington ’s closest allies in the region , home to both the Suez Canal and the Middle East ’s first peace treaty with Israel .
American aid to Egypt is just under $ 2 billion a year , making it a recipient of one of the highest levels of U.S. foreign aid in the world .
Still , the Obama administration has yet to clarify a firm position on democracy in Egypt , where pushes for greater reform during the George W. Bush presidency ultimately led to electoral wins for the Muslim Brotherhood in the last parliamentary elections .
Members of Egypt ’s Muslim Brotherhood , banned by the semi- tolerated Islamist opposition group , are frequently rounded up and jailed under the emergency law .
The popular independent journalist Salama A. Salama pointed out the irony of American foreign policy in Egypt in a recent column in Al - Ahram .
“ Without the extraordinary powers the emergency laws give to [ Egypt ’s ] government , the latter would n't be able to help American policy .
Take for example the government 's unlawful detention of dozens of Muslim Brotherhood members .
Is not this a move that fits well into American policies ? ” he wrote last month .
“ Should n't the Americans be pleased ? ”
LOS ANGELES — Six in 10 Americans — about 175 million people — are living in places where air pollution often reaches dangerous levels , despite progress in reducing particle pollution , the American Lung Association said in a report released yesterday .
The Los Angeles area had the nation ’s worst ozone pollution .
The report examined fine particulate matter over 24 - hour periods and as a year - round average .
Bakersfield , Calif. , had the worst short - term particle pollution , and the Phoenix area of Arizona had the worst year - round particle pollution .
The US cities with the cleanest air were Fargo , N.D. , Wahpeton , N.D. , and Lincoln , Neb .
The report is accurate , but it does n’t show how far California has come , said Dimitri Stanich , a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board .
“ More than 45 percent of the days in the 1990 ozone season were considered very unhealthy ’’ in the South Coast area , he said .
“ Today , 45 percent of the days are clean , more than double the number of clean days during 1990 .
“ So while we are still not meeting the federal air quality standards , the concentrations that Californians are exposed to are coming down dramatically , ’’ he said .
In Arizona , Benjamin H. Grumbles , the state ’s environmental quality director , issued a statement objecting to the methodology used in the report .
“ This finding came about because of one lonely air quality monitor near the cowtown area of western Pinal County , nearly 40 miles and across the mountains from downtown Phoenix , ’’ he said .
He also called the data outdated , saying pollution levels have improved since 2008 .
“ We ’re making some progress on dust and ozone in the Phoenix area , but not enough and not as quickly as we ’d like , ’’ he said .
The report , based on 2006 - 08 figures , credited cleaner diesel engines and controls on coal - fired power plants for decreasing pollution such as soot and dust .

After months of denying any technical problems with its SmartMeter program , PG&E publicly detailed a range of glitches Monday affecting tens of thousands of the digital meters .
But the San Francisco - based utility said it had found just eight meters that inaccurately reported a customer ’s energy use , despite thousands of complaints from customers who say the new meters have overcharged them .
The utility would not say how many of the 5.5 million meters installed so far have been tested for accuracy after installation .
PG&E detailed 43,376 cases in which the meters were involved in other kinds of problems .
It said 23,000 meters were installed improperly , 11,376 failed to retain consumer usage information and 9,000 had trouble connecting with the wireless network .
“ No technology is infallible .
No technology is completely immune to human error .
And , to my knowledge , no one at PG&E has made such a claim , ” Helen Burt , PG&E senior vice president and chief customer officer , said in prepared remarks before a California Senate hearing Monday .
“ Last fall , when we said ‘ the meters work , ’ we meant it .
They do .
But that does n’t mean that every single one of them works 100 percent of the time . ”
A PG&E spokesman said “ a few ” customers received bills that did not reflect their actual energy usage , but declined to be more specific .
He urged any customers who have concerns about their electric usage or bills to call PG&E directly .
But state Sen. Dean Florez , D - Fresno , said Monday that he thinks thousands of consumers may have received inaccurate bills .
“ We need to know how many meters failed , and how many meters failed to transmit data , and we ’re finally beginning to get some answers , ” Florez said .
“ But if all of these various parts are n’t working , then the bills are n’t accurate .
Why not own up to the fact ? ”
Utilities across the country are replacing analog meters with digital meters that can be read remotely .
As more features are added , the so - called smart meters will be able to give consumers detailed information about their power use , from how much energy their appliances draw to consumer electric usage by the hour and day .
PG&E , which provides gas and electric service to customers from Eureka to Bakersfield , was the first major utility to aggressively adopt the technology and is installing about 12,000 SmartMeters a day , with the goal of having 10 million in place by the end of 2012 .
But the rollout has been far from smooth .
Hundreds of PG&E customers who already have SmartMeters have complained of skyrocketing electric bills , leading to widespread suspicions that the meters either malfunction or are used to intentionally overcharge .
In November , a PG&E spokesman told the Mercury News that “ the meters themselves are completely accurate ” and noted that customers in Bakersfield and elsewhere were noticing higher bills because of rate increases and the heavy use of air conditioning during the sweltering summer months .
Monday ’s remarks mark the first time that PG&E has publicly acknowledged technology problems .
“ Up until now , PG&E ’s basic message has been ‘ We are 100 percent right , and our customers are 100 percent wrong , ’ ” said Mark Toney , executive director of consumer advocacy group TURN , The Utility Reform Network .
“ Today they acknowledged some widespread technology problems , which is what they should have done in the first place . ”
The flood of consumer complaints led the California Public Utilities Commission to hire the Structure Group of Houston to conduct a long - awaited independent evaluation of PG&E ’s SmartMeters .
Under its $ 1.4 million contract , which is expected to be completed in August , Structure will analyze individual customer complaints , initially focusing on those from the San Joaquin Valley .
Two vendors provide the meters for PG&E : Landis + Gyr , based in Zug , Switzerland , and General Electric .
Redwood City - based Silver Spring Networks provides the communications software for the meters .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N is likely to slash its chief executive 's bonus from the record $ 67.9 million he got two years ago , but Lloyd Blankfein 's pay package could still fuel criticism the bank has been " tone deaf " in its approach to the financial crisis .

Efforts to deflect criticism and keep regulators at bay has already prompted Goldman to change its bonus strategy , curbing compensation in the fourth quarter of 2009 and eliminating cash bonuses for top managers , instead paying them in stock .
But Goldman still may face a storm of criticism when it announces the bonuses of its top executives even as it seeks to trim the headline numbers after a year of record profits .
The announcement could come at any time .
“ They have made a number of moves to try to ameliorate the issues , ” said Alan Johnson , a Wall Street compensation consultant .
“ I would be shocked if it did n’t have an impact on his and everybody else ’s total . ”
Johnson estimated that Blankfein will get a bonus of more than $ 40 million for 2009 , a year in which Goldman reported record earnings of $ 13.39 billion .
That would fall well below the $ 67.9 million he received in 2007 .
Blankfein took no bonus in 2008 during the worst of the financial crisis .
The Times of London reported on Monday that Blankfein could receive a bonus of up to $ 100 million , thumbing his nose at President Barack Obama and his recent crackdown on the banking industry .
The newspaper cited bankers who were in Davos , Switzerland , for the World Economic Forum as its sources .
Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag denied the report , calling it “ speculative nonsense , ” although he acknowledged that Goldman ’s board had yet to make a final decision on executive compensation .
A separate report in the Wall Street Journal said at least one unnamed London banker in Davos was willing to wager millions of pounds that Blankfein , a staunch defender of Wall Street , would be out of a job within two years -- an anecdote that van Praag called “ effluent . ”
SIDESTEPPING CONTROVERSY
The reports on Blankfein and Goldman ’s quick retorts underscore the sensitivities at play .
“ Underneath that cool exterior , it is apparent that there is some very great sensitivity at Goldman about executive compensation these days , ” said Scott Tangney , a consultant with public relations firm Makovsky +
Co , who added that he expects Goldman to pay Blankfein at a lower level than 2007 and other years .
“ Because of the government pressure and the public scrutiny , it has already forced Goldman to handle executive compensation in a very different way . ”
Goldman last month sidestepped controversy over its ballooning bonus pool by cutting off compensation after three quarters and giving $ 500 million to charity .
Before the shift , Goldman was on pace to surpass its record payout of $ 20 billion in 2007 .
But the actual figure was $ 16.2 billion .
While political pressure could affect high - profile executives like Blankfein , it leaves open the possibilities for outsized paydays for lesser - known executives and star traders who helped the firm set a record profit in 2009 .
In 2008 , when most of Wall Street was at death ’s door , 953 Goldman employees made at least $ 1 million apiece , according to a report by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo .
There were 21 Goldman employees who made at least $ 8 million each .
For 2009 , executives like David Heller , Harvey Schwartz , Edward Eisler , and Pablo Salame , all of whom lead units that oversee bond , stock , currency and commodity sales and trading , could see mega payouts after the firm reported $ 23.3 billion in revenues from fixed income , currency and commodities trading in 2009 , up from $ 3.7 billion in 2008 .
Paydays for them of more than $ 20 million each would not be surprising , headhunters and recruiters said .
Richard Lipstein , a recruiter at Boyden Global Executive Search , said he would expect “ a huge payout for their stars . ”
Goldman ’s bonuses are expected to come largely in stock rather than cash , following a trend on Wall Street to change pay designs and curb risk - taking .
Still , those changes are likely to fall on deaf ears to an angry public focused on the big numbers , said Sarah Anderson , a fellow with the Institute for Policy Studies , which is critical of Wall Street , and co-author of the recent study “ America ’s Bailout Barons . ”
“ They are claiming to have made changes , but for the ordinary taxpayers who have contributed very much to the recovery of the markets , they are n’t seeing it as substantial change , ” Anderson said .
“ They are seeing it as business as usual . ”
Muslim suicide bombers in Britain are set to begin a three - day strike on Monday in a dispute over the number of virgins they are entitled to in the afterlife .
Emergency talks with Al Qaeda have so far failed to produce an agreement .
The unrest began last Tuesday when Al Qaeda announced that the number of virgins a suicide bomber would receive after his death will be cut by 25 % this May from 72 to only 60 .
The rationale for the cut was the increase in recent years of the number of suicide bombings and a subsequent shortage of virgins in the afterlife .
The suicide bombers ' union , the British Organization of Occupational Martyrs ( or B.O.O.M. ) responded with a statement that this was unacceptable to its members and immediately balloted for strike action .
General Secretary Abdullah Aziz told the press , " Our members are literally working themselves to death in the cause of Jihad .
We do n't ask for much in return but to be treated like this is like a kick in the teeth " .
Speaking from his shed in Tipton in the West Midlands in which he currently resides , Al Qaeda chief executive Osama bin Laden explained , " We sympathize with our workers concerns but Al Qaeda is simply not in a position to meet their demands .
They are simply not accepting the realities of modern - day Jihad in a competitive marketplace .
Thanks to Western depravity , there is now a chronic shortage of virgins in the afterlife .
It 's a straight choice between reducing expenditure and laying people off .
I do n't like cutting wages but I 'd hate to have to tell 3000 of my staff that they wo n't be able to blow themselves up . "
Spokespersons for the union in the North East of England , Ireland , Wales and the entire Australian continent stated that the strike would not affect their operations as " There are no virgins in their areas anyway " .
Apparently the drop in the number of suicide bombings has been put down to the emergence of that Scottish singing star , Susan Boyle - now that Muslims know what a virgin looks like that they are not so keen on going to paradise .

On the seaside hills of Titanyen , where Haiti ’s dictators discarded the bodies of political opponents , the dead have been dumped by the thousands among the thorn bushes , piled in towers of russet - colored soil and debris .
Shocked by television footage of the site , Port - au - Prince businessman Daniel Rouzier hired two backhoes over the weekend to dig three long , deep rectangular ditches .
Growling and beeping , they scooped up 2,500 earthquake victims and buried them in communal graves .
“ You have to understand that it ’s completely un-Haitian to dump bodies like this , ” Rouzier said as he watched , a white mask covering his face .
“ We have extreme respect for the dead .
And these people deserve a decent burial . ”
The Jan. 12 earthquake killed an estimated 150,000 , about 1 in 13 residents of the Port - au - Prince area .
Since then , the capital has hummed with determined international efforts to attend to the living with food , water , shelter and medical care .
But handling the massive numbers of dead has at times overwhelmed the government .
Many bodies remain trapped in collapsed homes , businesses , schools and even a fancy shopping mall .
And , three weeks later , the choking smell of decomposition still hangs in the air .
Family members of victims continue to chip away at collapsed homes , slowly retrieving the dead for private burial .
But at many locations , including government buildings , stores and schools , the bodies are retrieved , along with debris , by government bulldozers .
Last week , several thousand bodies were trucked , often at night , to Titanyen and dumped in the vast public cemetery .
“ We did n’t know what to do , there were just so many , ” said Oman Oberilise , 26 , who works as a gravedigger at Titanyen , about 20 miles north of the capital .
Some of the gravediggers , seeing so many bodies , “ were afraid that they were still alive , ” he added .
Rouzier , local chairman of the charity Food for the Poor , heard about the bodies piling up at Titanyen , called a local Roman Catholic priest , hired the backhoes and enlisted volunteers to go to the site .
As the bulldozers worked , one of the volunteers , 73 - year - old Hilaire Polycarpe , brushed white paint on a cross , one of three that was later placed atop the mass graves .
He had bought the paint himself that morning .
“ I just thought it was important that people know where the bodies are buried , ” Polycarpe said .
No one knows the names of those buried here .
But , Rouzier said , “ the point is to make spiritual peace with what ’s happened .
And burying people is step one . ”
After the burial , the priest offered prayers for the dead and Rouzier placed holy water on the soil .
“ Now is not the time to point fingers , ” Rouzier said .
“ Now is the time to make things right . ”
Since the quake , more than 10,000 bodies have been buried in Titanyen and another nearby cemetery , where bodies from the Port - au - Prince morgue have been taken to be interred in mass graves .
The cemeteries occupy a rocky landscape above National Route 1 , overlooking the water .
Titanyen , known locally as the “ valley of death , ” has a central place in the collective psyche of Haiti .
During the dictatorships of Francois Duvalier and his son , Jean - Claude , the bodies of thousands of political prisoners and executed government opponents were dumped there .
Even today , it is scattered with skulls from that era .
The death toll from the earthquake has been so massive that , for most , the rituals once followed after a death have gone by the wayside .
For those able to recover and identify family members , funerals and burials have been swift .
The pressure to find places to bury the dead is evident in small cemeteries in Port - au - Prince .
One burial ground in the Delmas area last week was strewn with coffins that had been dug up and opened , and the bones of the original occupants removed so that earthquake victims could be interred .
Still , as the days pass , the capital ’s survivors are , to a remarkable degree , focusing on the future .
Even with all the challenges of daily life in a community devastated by loss , they walk the streets in freshly washed clothes .
Many men headed to church on Sunday were wearing ties .
And street - side car wash businesses were busy , washing the white dust off vehicles .
“ People have this impression of Haitians being in a constant state of upheaval and violence , ” U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten said in an interview .
“ But 90 % of the people living in Port - au - Prince have been handling a very difficult situation in a stoic and dignified fashion . ”
By Sunday , the bodies at Titanyen were underground , the freshly turned soil marked with the crosses that Polycarpe had painted .
“ We hurt all the way to the bone to see these people dying , ” said Oberilise , the gravedigger .
“ But we have to bury them . ”

The Shell Game Continues …
Monday , April 5 , 2010
Executive Summary
Record - breaking
Treasury auctions continue to go off without a hitch , thanks to massive foreign participation .
However , the amounts reported to be bought in the auction results do not match the Custody Account or TIC report amounts .
The Fed is allegedly all done buying MBS and Treasury paper .
This cuts off an important source of liquidity for the Treasury , commodity , and stock markets .
How will these markets respond to a liquidity drought ?
The end of March is upon us .
I need to take a moment to re-analyze the data to see what might happen now that the stimulus money has worn off , and , more importantly , now that the Federal Reserve 's massive Mortgage Backed Security ( MBS ) purchase program is over .
This is important for a variety of reasons .
The first is that the enormous flood of liquidity that the Federal Reserve injected into the financial system has found its way into the Treasury market , supporting government borrowing and also lowering interest rates for the housing market .
How will the Treasury market respond once the liquidity spigot is turned off ?
The second is that this flood of liquidity has supported all sorts of other asset markets along the way , including the stock and commodity markets .
What will happen to these when the flood stops ?
Will the base economy have recovered enough that the financial markets can operate on their own ?
Will stocks falter after an amazing run ?
Or will the whole thing shudder to a halt for a double - dip recession ?
Back in August of 2009 , I wrote that the Federal Reserve was basically just directly monetizing US government debt by buying recent Treasury issuances as well as Mortgage Backed Securities ( MBS ) .
Here 's the conclusion from that report :
The Federal Reserve has effectively been monetizing far more US government debt than has openly been revealed , by cleverly enabling foreign central banks to swap their agency debt for Treasury debt .
This is not a sign of strength and reveals a pattern of trading temporary relief for future difficulties .
This is very nearly the same path that Zimbabwe took , resulting in the complete abandonment of the Zimbabwe dollar as a unit of currency .
The difference is in the complexity of the game being played , not the substance of the actions themselves .
When the full scope of this program is more widely recognized , ever more pressure will fall upon the dollar , as more and more private investors shun the dollar and all dollar - denominated instruments as stores of value and wealth .
This will further burden the efforts of the various central banks around the world , as they endeavor to meet the vast borrowing desires of the US government .
My surprise at all of this has been twofold .
The shell game has continued this long without the bond market calling the bluff , and I am baffled by the extent to which the other world central banks have both enabled and participated in this game .
Part of the explanation behind this unwavering support for the dollar and US deficit spending by other central banks lays in the fact that other Western and Eastern governments are equally insolvent .
It 's possible that they feel they really have no choice but to play along , because the alternative would be to inflict a vicious and deeply unpopular austerity program on their own country , while everybody else is partying on thin - air money .
Who 's going to be the first to do that ?
Nobody , that 's who .
The Size of the Problem ( or is it Predicament ? )
Let 's begin by noting the massive growth in the Treasury auctions over the past few years .
Where once we required a few hundred billion per year of new , incremental borrowing to fund the fiscal gaps , we are now borrowing more than a trillion each year .
Where the total size of all auctions ( including roll - overs ) was a couple of trillion each year , it is now approaching ten trillion .
The way I prefer to track this is at the source .
The media does an especially poor job of communicating accurate government deficit figures .
They simply relate the cash deficit , which is how the government reports it .
However , the true borrowing needs due to the deficit are best , and most easily , tracked by simply noting the increase in the " debt held by the public " portion of the federal debt .
Why the press misses out on this year after year is beyond me .
We know that in 2009 , the incremental borrowing needs of the federal government ( give or take a few billion , due to timing ) must have been equal to the reported growth in the " debt held by the public " portion of the federal debt .
That figure for 2009 was $ 1,491 billion ( or $ 1.49 trillion ) :
Recall that the total federal debt consists of the two components in the table above ; ' debt held by the public ' and ' intragovernmental holdings . '
The former represents the size of all outstanding Treasury debt , and the latter represents money that the government has borrowed from itself but owes to various retirees and entitlement beneficiaries .
When the value of ' intragovernmental holdings ' rises , it means that cash was borrowed from the entitlement programs and used to fund government operations .
If it rises , as we see above in 2009 , then more money is coming in than going out .
If it is stagnant , then money coming into the programs is being equaled by money leaving .
If , heaven forbid , it falls , that means that the programs are now cash - flow negative to government coffers and more money is being paid out than is being taken in , which is our current situation here in 2010 ( see next table below ) .
At any rate , for our purposes , we need to try and figure out where a record - shattering $ 1.49 trillion in fresh Treasury issuances went in 2009 .
Who bought them ?
How much went to foreign buyers , and can we expect them to buy more ?
And so far in 2010 , we see that we are on track for another ~ $ 1.5 trillion round of fresh borrowing :
Taken together , this means that in only two short years , 2009 and 2010 , as much new Treasury debt will be auctioned off to the public as was outstanding in 1995 .
Since government borrowing never gets paid down , at least in modern history , it means that the last two years have seen as much borrowing as happened over the period in which electricity was strung to every house , the highways were built , and our population tripled .
What can we point to that was created over the last two years to rival those accomplishments ?
Even more interestingly , we note something quite extraordinary in that table above :
Through the middle of March , the intragovernmental holdings have not increased , which indicates that expenditures are equal to revenues for the entitlement programs .
This has not happened for decades .
It means that from a cash - flow standpoint , the US government has lost an important source of liquid operating cash .
This is an enormous inflection point in the data series .
Instead of providing cash to government operations , the entitlement programs are now on the verge of draining cash .
The importance of this shift cannot be overstated .
Which brings us to the most important question of them all , which concerns the continued ability of the US and various other world governments to fund their deficits .
It is my contention that too few people are thinking about the possibility that the US government could face a funding crisis at some point , which means that it's a clear and present danger .
US Treasury Auction Results
Let 's look at the Treasury auction data since 2009 to see what it can tell us .
To begin with , an auction may do a couple of things .
It may sell brand - new debt to raise new cash , it may " roll over " past debt that is maturing , or both .
So where 2009 saw $ 1.49 trillion in new debt sold , the total volume of the Treasury auctions was far larger , when we add up all the roll - over activity .
Here 's the data for the total activity 2009 and some of 2010 :
( Note : This data excludes TIPS and cash management bills , so these numbers are actually smaller than the complete total . )
The table above tells us that while $ 1.49 trillion in new debt was issued in 2009 , more than $ 8.5 trillion in total activity took place .
That 's how much cash had to flow through the Treasury auction market for it to function .
This illustrates why a failed Treasury auction will be avoided at all costs .
Any interruption to the trillions and trillions of dollars flowing through the Treasury market each year would cause an immediate and enormous train wreck that would ripple through the entire world 's financial system ( and trigger an avalanche comprised of hundreds of trillions of dollars of interest - rate derivatives ) .
A failed auction is simply not an option for the Fed or the Treasury Dept .
In 2010 , more than $ 1.5 trillion in total activity had already occurred by March 10th .
Once we mentally add in this year 's likely borrowing , we might expect a grand total of some $ 10 trillion in total activity to take place by the end of the year .
In 2003 , the total activity of this market was only some $ 3.4 trillion .
If you plot out the growth in activity , it looks like an exponential chart .
With government deficits in the trillions stretching as far as the eye can see , and with an ever - increasing reliance on short - term debt , this trend is set to increase going forward .
Where It All Went
So now we know that nearly $ 1.5 trillion of new Treasury debt went out the door in 2009 , along with another $ 371 billion in 2010 .
But where did it all go ?
Who bought it ?
Can we count on them to keep buying ?
Here the data is not as clean and clear as I would like .
There is quite a bit that is difficult to determine , based on the way that that data is collected and reported .
While it may not be the intent of the data gatherers to hide anything , that is the result .
In terms of the disposition of the $ 1,491 billion in Treasury bonds bought in 2009 , here 's what we do know :
The Fed bought $ 300 billion of them , all long - dated securities .
According to the TIC report , foreigners bought $ 617.6 billion .
The rest , ' the plug factor , ' was assigned to " households " by the Federal Reserve , accounting for more than $ 530 billion .
There are many who have questioned whether " households " were in any position to park more than 100 % of their entire personal savings into Treasury instruments , but even the Fed tells us that this is a plug category , meaning anything not identified as going to itself or foreigners is assigned to this category .
The Fed has no idea how many Treasuries " households " bought in 2009 ; it only knows how many are not otherwise officially accounted for and that it should assign the difference to " households . "
The truth is , we have no idea where that half - trillion in Treasuries went .
My best guess would be that they mainly went to large banks ( probably even the primary dealers themselves ) to a large degree , especially those that sold MBS to the Fed .
In keeping with the " shell game " concept , the only entities out there with a half - trillion lying around in 2009 probably got it from the Fed .
An asterisk in this story of where those Treasuries went concerns the difference between what the Treasury reports that foreigners bought ( in the TIC report ) and what the Fed says foreigners accumulated in the Custody Account .
Unfortunately , these two reports overlap to a large degree , but not completely .
This is a critical bit of investigation to perform , because it is so important that foreigners continue to buy US Treasury debt .
In 2009 , the Custody Account holdings of Treasuries increased by $ 572 billion , while the TIC report said foreigners bought $ 617.6 billion , and we are unable to account for the whopping $ 45 billion difference between the two numbers .
The Custody Account
I described the Custody Account in some detail back in August of 2009 in The Shell Game , so I wo n't rehash how it operates here , except to say that it is basically a gigantic brokerage account held by the Fed on behalf of foreign central banks .
In order to understand foreign buying habits when it comes to Treasuries , we need to peer into both the TIC and the Custody Account .
When we did this last August , here is what we found for the Custody Account :
The story in August of 2009 was one of rapid , uninterrupted growth in the Custody Account , seemingly without any concern or regard for the financial crisis happening then .
Today we find that during 2010 , the Custody Account has not grown very robustly :
I am immediately drawn to the fact that the foreign Custody Account has been , well , a little flat lately ( as marked at the end by the blue line at the top right ) .
However , it 's also been a little flat at other times , which I have marked with dark horizontal lines , so perhaps this is a relatively normal occurrence .
Overall , perhaps we should be most impressed with the > 250 % growth over the past seven years ( ! ) .
Think of this $ 3 trillion debt as the portion of US government debt that is owed to a foreign credit - card firm .
Someday that 's going to have to be paid back , and , no , it does n't bode well for the future prosperity of the US .
Here 's the Custody Account in table form , which reveals that 2010 is shaping up to be the weakest year in a long time :
I 'm sorry , but a 5 % growth in the Custody Account just is n't going to cut it for a country with a multi-trillion - dollar borrowing habit .
So far , the Custody Account has only increased by a paltry $ 26.5 billion in 2010 .
That 's a real cause for concern , and it makes me wonder about the recent upward volatility in Treasury yields .
Now , the Custody Account consists of both Treasuries and Agency debt .
Teasing this apart into its components , we find that total Treasury accumulation into the Custody Account has been a quite anemic $ 24.6 billion in 2010 , which is more or less the same amount that was accumulated during a single week back in 2008 and 2009 .
Let 's compare this $ 24.6 billion to the $ 371 billion of new Treasury debt sold in 2010 - it 's only 7 % of the total .
But we are told , week after week , that foreigners ( via the " indirect bid " ) have bought on the order of 40 % of each auction , or nearly $ 150 billion .
What gives ?
Like here in this recent auction , where 39 % of a single auction totaling $ 16.6 billion went to the indirect bidders :
What we are seeing here is a very large ( and growing ) disconnect , between the proportion of Treasuries that are said to be bought by foreigners in the Treasury auction result announcements , and what 's showing up in their official TIC and Custody Accounts .
I am increasingly concerned that this gap reflects a growing accumulation of Treasury issues by entities funded for this purpose by the Fed 's magic thin - air checkbook .
If so , then the danger would be the response of the market and the reaction of various countries when that becomes common knowledge .
For now , it is clear that 40 % of US Treasury auctions are not being bought by foreigners , at least if the TIC and Custody Account reports are to be believed .
Perhaps the growth in the Custody Account will resume and my concerns will amount to nothing , but the first quarter of 2010 is shaping up to be somewhat of a gigantic disappointment in that department .
Unfortunately , the TIC report is lagged by a couple of months , so we wo n't have the March numbers for comparison until the middle of June .
My guess is that the TIC report will also show weakness in the foreign accumulation of Treasury debt , but we 'll also be taking a look then , just to be sure .
The concern here is that the Custody Account is reflecting early signs of waning foreign interest in US debt .
If ( or when ) we finally reach the point of saturation in this story , everything will change rather dramatically .
From Zero Hedge , we have this nice summary of the debt auctions coming up for next week :
The Treasury just announced the auction schedule for next week : a total of $ 165 Billion in gross issuance of which $ 74 Billion in coupons , and $ 8 billion in a 10 Year TIPS reopening .
$ 28 billion in 3 Month Bills , Auction date April 5
$ 29 billion in 6 Month Bills , Auction date April 5
$ 26 billion in 52 Week Bills , Auction date April 6
$ 40 billion in 3 Year Bonds , Auction date April 6
$ 21 billion in 9 Year 10 Month ( reopening ) , Auction date April 7
$ 13 billion in 29 Year 10 Month ( reopening ) , Auction date April 8
$ 8 billion in 9 Year 9 Month TIPS ( Reopening ) , Auction date April 5
The fact of the matter is , the US government is now conducting weekly Treasury auctions that are as large as quarterly auctions were just a few years ago .
Exponential increase , anyone ?
$ 165 billion in a single week is an enormous pile to unload .
What I Am Always Looking Out For
Long - time readers know that I am constantly on the lookout for a specific pair of market signals above all others , because its arrival will signal that a new game has begun .
That pair comprises a simultaneously falling US dollar index and rising Treasury interest rates ( signaling falling Treasury bond prices ) .
In essence , this pair will signal to me that some major player , perhaps China , has decided to sell its Treasuries and take its money home , thereby driving down the dollar .
This is critical to me , because it will mean that the US will have begun its long date with funding difficulties .
Either interest rates will have to rise dramatically to attract new lenders ( thereby killing the nascent recovery of the housing market and our entire credit - fueled economy ) , or the Fed will have to begin monetizing at an even faster rate than before .
In short , we 'll be facing a period of profound austerity , raging inflation brought about by currency devaluation , or both .
In truth , I cannot imagine any possible way for the US to pay off its current official debts in current dollars , so I feel this outcome is merely a matter of time .
However , it could be a long time , and we must also be prepared for that .
In the past week , there was a bit of excitement over in the Treasury market because there were two days of hard selling in a row .
This led to Treasury yields spiking and possibly breaking out over a two - year trend line :
The Treasury market immediately settled down right after these two days of selling , but something significant had clearly happened .
During this period , the dollar also rose quite handily , so my " signal pair " was not in play and I did not issue an alert , nor did I become overly concerned .
However , I did sit up and take notice and am following bond market signals with just a bit more focus these days .
A rapid rise in long - term interest rates here would be just about the last thing the Fed would want , as that would put pressure on stocks and commodities , and harm the housing recovery , such as it is .
So I doubt that the rate rise was planned or welcomed .
I am keeping a very close eye on the Treasury market right now and will alert you if anything breaks suddenly or crosses the threshold to actionable news .
One Possible Scenario
Although I am not convinced that I have access to good data , it would seem that China is in a serious bubble .
Or , rather , a series of bubbles , including real estate in several metropolitan locations and manufacturing overcapacity .
Several recent commentators have been adding up the facts as we know them , and it seems plausible to suspect that China is deep into bubble territory .
China also happens to hold $ 890 billion of US Treasuries ( as of January 2010 ) , as well as some amount of MBS stashed in the Fed 's Custody Account ( I do n't have access to the necessary detail to say how much ) , so we'd be close if we estimated that China held $ 1 trillion of official US debt .
One scenario that I think has a chance of upsetting things would be for China to experience a bubble - bursting crisis , the mitigation of which would necessitate a need for liquid cash .
By this , I mean an event ( or set of events ) that would essentially force China to begin unloading their Treasury holdings .
Under this scenario , we 'd see immediate selling pressure in the Treasury market , leading to lower prices and higher yields .
I think this event would be sufficient to rip the cover off the Treasury market and expose the extent to which the market has been supported by central banks more than legitimate market players and expectations .
So another thing I am keeping an eye out for is any sign that China is experiencing a bubble - bursting event .
Here I track the Chinese stock market , the Baltic Dry Index ( as a crude measure of export activity ) , and the news .
Conclusion
With a stagnant Custody Account reading and underwhelming TIC reports , it seems unlikely that that foreigners are going to be able to digest the volume of Treasury auctions that are coming up this year .
We 've already seen a nice breakout on yields .
With everything I know about Fed policy at this point , I can assure you that a sudden jump in rates on the long end was not in the Fed 's plans for last week .
My concern is that the mysterious indirect and direct buyers that have been showing up at Treasury auctions lately may be none other than the Fed itself or its proxies , hidden by some slight shell game or another .
There simply seems to be no other explanation , given the perilous state of the global economy .
Where is all this capital coming from , if not central banks ?
From earnings ?
From exports ?
From legitimate economic savings ?
From private individuals ( during a major stock bull run ) ?
None of these explanations matches the volume of borrowing that we are seeing in the US Treasury market , let alone worldwide .
The simplest explanation is that central banks are somehow providing the necessary liquidity to support the various governmental bond auctions that are happening around the world .
The US story does not add up and provides enough of a smoking gun to suggest that there are ( at the very least ) non-transparent buyers for the massive , record - breaking Treasury issuances we 've been seeing lately .
If , or when , these deceptions are revealed , I predict that we will experience a pretty significant market dislocation that will take the form of a chaotic bond market , with yields that rapidly gyrate higher , currency perturbations that will shake markets , and an extended banking holiday , with capital controls imposed until a nightmarish derivative mess is unsorted .
Of course , these are just my hunches at this point .
Something is very much ' not right ' in this story , but over the years I have learned that strange market conditions can last longer than you think possible and that things always seem to unfold more slowly than you might initially suspect .
So I am prepared for two possible scenarios : 1 ) a sudden change in the markets , and the alternative , 2 ) no change at all for ten years or more .
The first requires active financial and physical planning , while the second requires developing the right sort of mental patience .
It is a tricky psychological balancing act , to be ready for anything and nothing at the same time .
I imagine that being on patrol in Baghdad during hostilities was sort of like this , where nothing happened for 99 % of the time , but then IEDs made the other 1 % of the time very , very interesting .
What will happen next ?
Nobody knows .
My advice remains the same as always : Stay tuned to the world 's markets and happenings for clues about what 's unfolding , but make the necessary preparations to increase your resilience to whatever might happen next .
The current market environment , where everyone is seemingly convinced that a recovery is now all but assured , is both encouraging and concerning .
Encouraging because that 's most likely true .
Concerning because sharp breaks almost always happen during periods of complacency , when everybody seems to be looking the other way .
In short , when everyone is complacent , I get concerned , and when people get concerned , I try to remain calm .
For now , there 's a level of complacency about Treasury auctions that I find very disturbing .
There 's really no way to make the story add up properly - I mean , how could it , with $ 1.5 trillion in new borrowing for two years in a row during economic weakness ?
- yet almost nobody seems to be concerned about the implications of that line of thinking .
That is exactly the territory where great fortunes are made and lost .
At the very least , my wish is for you to preserve what you have and to be able to maintain an even keel and positive outlook , no matter what the future brings .
For myself , this means putting in 25 fruit and nut trees on my property ( accomplished this past weekend ) , followed by expanding the garden and installing solar and energy efficiency improvements .
We shall see if these turn out to be good uses for my capital and time .
For now , they provide me with the psychological sense of forward movement and improvement , both of which are very important to me right now and worth every penny to me all on their own .

“ I ’m not going to waste any more time of the American people , ” Mr. Reid said .
But it was the unusual use of video clips that was most striking about the Democrats ’ aggressive posture .
First they showed Mr. McConnell repeatedly denouncing the legislation , saying it would encourage , rather than prevent , future taxpayer - financed bailouts of big banks .
Both sides agree the bill is intended to end bailouts .
“ This bill not only allows for taxpayer - funded bailouts of Wall Street banks , it institutionalizes them , ” Mr. McConnell says on the video in a speech on the Senate floor .
In another clip , Mr. McConnell says , “ It provides for an endless taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks . ”
Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois , the No. 2 Democrat , accused Mr. McConnell of ignoring the legislative text .
“ If you listen to this comment by the minority leader of the United States Senate you wonder if he has read the bill , particularly if he has read the section between pages 110 and 295 , which is entitled ‘ Orderly Liquidation Authority , ’ ” Mr. Durbin said .
“ Liquidation is the end of the bank , ” Mr. Durbin said , “ not a bailout that it could continue in business .
It describes all the steps that would be taken under the bill to liquidate the bank .
The management team is fired .
The shareholders are wiped out .
The firm ’s assets are sold off to pay any firm debts .
Once the money is gone , the creditors are wiped out .
The taxpayers do n’t pay for any part of this , and at the end of it , the company is gone .
There is nothing to bail out . ”
Then , the Democrats showed clips of the No. 2 Republican , Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona , saying the legislation would interfere with auto dealers , dentists or optometrists who allow their customers to pay off bills over time .
“ Senator Kyl says that the bill would regulate your dentist or your optometrist or your butcher if they let you pay over time — once again , not true , ” Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , said .

After everything that has been said on all sides of this issue , there is little new that is left to be said .
I was going to say that one thing on which everybody has agreed is a need for more money for research - especially for the research we ourselves do -- but I like to be contrary so I will express a disagreement with that .
If on any subject whatsoever we waited until all the research we wanted to do was done , we would never do anything .
If we are going to act , we have to act on the basis of the evidence that there is .
I do not agree with those like my good friend , Ed Meese , who say that you need a detailed and well - reasoned alternative before you do anything about the present system , that the burden of proof is upon those who want to change the system .
If the system is making a mess , it is a good thing to do something to change it even though you may not have a fully detailed alternative .
One thing that needs to be kept in mind is that we are fundamentally all on the same side .
We all have the same objectives .
We all recognize that drugs are currently doing a great deal of harm .
What divides us is our judgment about the best means to minimize the harm done by drugs .
We must not let ourselves get diverted from trying to reach reasonable , sensible conclusions by attributing bad motives to those who disagree with us .
There is a famous statement , which I have used many times , made by Pierre S. du Pont almost precisely two centuries ago ( September 25 , 1790 ) to the National Assembly in revolutionary France in which he said , " Gentlemen , it is a disagreeable custom to which one is too easily led by the harshness of the discussions , to assume evil intentions .
It is necessary to be gracious as to intentions ; one should believe them good , and apparently they are ; but we do not have to be gracious at all to inconsistent logic or to absurd reasoning .
Bad logicians have committed more involuntary crimes than bad men have done intentionally . '
I am obviously not going to add any arguments to the large number already presented .
I want to use my limited time simply to try to bring a little order out of the discussion and to add a little evidence .
People tend to discuss the issue of drugs on two levels .
One level was well described by one of the speakers as Plato versus John Stuart Mill :
The philosophical disagreement between Plato 's view that it is right for some of us ( " philosopher kings " ) to tell others of us what they must do because it is good for them , and the doctrine of John Stuart Mill that the role of government is simply to prevent people from doing harm to others and that it is not right for government to try to force people to do anything simply for their own good .
The philosopher - king perspective and the libertarian perspective , if you will .
No doubt there is a wide disagreement on that level , and as many of you know my own sympathies are on the side of John Stuart Mill .
That consideration is not decisive in this issue , however , as it is not in many .
Nonetheless , it does affect people 's attitudes and the way in which they look at things .
I think that it is worth recognizing .
Why is it not decisive ?
Because even the libertarians justify interference to prevent harm to others .
In my opinion , the most basic distinction that needs to be kept in mind in this discussion is between innocent victims and self - chosen victims .
That has come out again and again in many discussions .
As everyone recognizes , self - chosen victims may and do harm others as well .
Even if there were no laws against drugs whatsoever , if they were completely legal , there would still be innocent victims .
The most obvious , of course , are the crack babies .
I do n't know how many there are - that is for you medical people to decide - but insofar as there are any they are obviously innocent victims of their mothers .
So legalizing drugs would not eliminate all innocent victims .
Even a strict libertarian might argue for prohibiting certain drugs , or putting strict limits on them , on the ground that interference with individual behavior is more than offset by the prevention of harm to innocent victims .
That brings the real issue to the second level - the level of expediency .
We now have a system to control drugs .
Is it working ?
Is it doing more good or more harm ?
If it is doing more harm , let 's stop doing that harm and let 's not wait until we have a fully worked - out , detailed plan for exactly what we are going to put in its place .
Let 's eliminate those features of it that are clearly and obviously doing the most harm .
Again , everybody agrees on this level that the present methods are doing a great deal of harm .
Dr. Clarke movingly and effectively presents one of the most important components of that harm ( in Chapter 25 ) .
The attempt to enforce the prohibition of the use of drugs is destroying our poorer neighborhoods in city after city , creating a climate that is destructive to the people who live there .
This phenomenon is perhaps the greatest disgrace in the United States at the moment .
I say " perhaps " because an alternative is what we are doing to other countries - a subject discussed in Chapter 20 .
Can anybody tell me that the United States of America is justified in destroying Colombia because the United States can not enforce its own laws ?
If we enforced our laws , there would be no , problem .
I do n't mean to say we could not enforce our laws .
In principle , there is no doubt that we could completely eliminate drugs if we were willing to use the methods that Saudi Arabia is willing to use :
If we were willing to cut off the hands of a drug offender ; if we were willing to impose capital punishment on drug dealers .
We are not , and all of us without exception are proud of the fact that we are not willing to use those methods .
Those are cures that are clearly worse than the disease .
Given that we cannot enforce our own laws , I believe that there is no way to justify behavior by the United States that leads to the destruction of other countries .
We are destroying the poorer neighborhoods in central cities , but at least we are doing that to ourselves .
I do n't justify it - do n't misunderstand me - but I see even less justification for destroying other people 's countries .
I have asked this question of many people who are in favor of our present policies .
I have never had what I regard as a halfway satisfactory answer .
In discussing the issue of drugs , I , like many others , have cited the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s as an obvious example of the evil effects of prohibition , as does Dr. Morgan ( Chapter 24 ) .
In response , I have received a good deal of correspondence .
Those who object to my conclusions tend to make two arguments in response , and the little bit of data that I would like to add is in response to these arguments .
Everyone recognizes that the prohibition of drugs makes drugs into a profitable illegal activity and creates a class of criminals .
However , the proponents of prohibition answer , if you legalized or decriminalized drugs , or in any other way changed the situation , these people would still be criminals ; they would just go on to other crimes .
Look , they say , what happened after prohibition .
You had Al Capone and the gangs , and after prohibition ended they just shifted over to other sectors .
Unquestionably , there is some truth in that .
The building - up of a criminal class is going to leave a hangover , and the hangover is going to mean more criminality .
How serious is it ?
I have a graph ( Figure 3 . 1 ) .
The series that goes all the way back to 1910 is the homicide rate .
Its scale is on the left .
It goes to 1987 , which is as far as the data were readily available .
From 1910 on , there is an almost explosive growth in the number of homicides .
The first part of the explosion is during World War 1 , and one phenomenon you observe over and over is that wars tend to lead to a rise in crime .
What happened after the end of the war ?
The homicide rate kept on going up very rapidly and reached a peak in precisely the year in which prohibition was ended , 1933 .
It then fell drastically , and it stayed down throughout the forties and the fifties , except for a rise during World War II .
Since 1933 was also the end of the great contraction , it can be argued that the Great Depression was also a stimulus to crime and to homicide .
Throughout the prosperous 1920s , however , homicides per hundred thousand persons were very much higher than throughout the prosperous forties and fifties , let alone in the late thirties which were not so prosperous .
I believe that no one who looks at the evidence can doubt that ending prohibition had a significant and prompt effect on the homicide rate .
Homicides started to go up early in the 1960s and rose very rapidly after Nixon introduced his drug war .
More recently , the rate has come down a little , but it is still at the same level as in 1933 .
I believe one can have great confidence that if drugs were decriminalized the homicide rate would fall sharply , most likely back to the level that it maintained throughout the fifties .
That is no small matter :
A reduction in the homicide rate from its average during the eighties to its average during the fifties would , with our current population , mean a saving in excess of 10,000 lives a year !
As another bit of evidence I have plotted the number of prisoners ( per 10,000 population ) received into all prisons - federal , state , and local - year by year .
Those data , at least in the sources readily available to me , only went back to 1926 .
From then on , the number of prisoners received went up very sharply until 1931 .
It then went down , then rose again to 1940 , went down sharply during the war , rose thereafter to a peak in 1961 and came down sharply to 1969 .
From 1970 on , the number of prisoners received rose dramatically , to a level in 1987 more than twice as high as in 1931 .
The increase in the number of prisoners received coincides with the beginning of Nixon 's drug war , and received an additional boost when the Reagan drug war started .
To say the least , those are disheartening figures .
Most discussions of innocent victims , including those I have heard here , leave out what I regard as one of the most important classes of innocent victims , those of us who are not protected by the police because the police are too busy trying to do something about drugs and are being corrupted by the drug industry .
The destruction of the atmosphere of law enforcement , of the whole climate of law obedience , adds greatly to the list of innocent victims .
Personally , I find it hard to see how anyone can deny the enormous importance of the innocent victims who have been produced by making possession of specified drugs and dealing in them a crime .
Few persons do deny the importance of such innocent victims .
Those who nonetheless defend drug prohibition reply that decriminalizing drugs may well reduce the number of such innocent victims , but the price society pays for that gain will be a large increase in the number of addicts .
Again they go back to alcohol and its prohibition for evidence .
They claim that the end of alcohol prohibition was followed by a tremendous increase in the fraction of the population consuming alcohol and in the number of alcoholics .
The next two charts from my trusty computer are designed to answer that claim .
The first ( Figure 3.2 ) shows the fraction of total consumption expenditures spent on alcoholic beverages .
It is available only for legal alcoholic beverages ; that is why it starts in 1933 .
Unfortunately , all estimates of alcohol consumption during the prohibition era are necessarily highly indirect and uncertain , so I have chosen to stick only to the figures for legal beverages .
Dr. Morgan refers to some data on consumption during prohibition , and it is clear that consumption did not disappear .
Incidentally , among the innocent victims of prohibition are the addicts themselves , because of the factors that Dr. Morgan brings out .
In an illegal market , there is bound to be adulteration and impure substances , which shows up in people dying .
Indeed , it has always seemed to me that the greatest beneficiaries from the decriminalization of drugs would be the present addicts .
They are made to become criminals .
They can't ask for help without admitting that they are criminals .
The argument in favor of the present method , thus , has to be that if drugs were decriminalized , you would have a vast increase in the number of addicts .
What does our experience after alcohol prohibition tell us ?
In the first three years , as legal beverages were being substituted for illegal beverages , it is not surprising that the reported percentage of all consumption expenditures spent on alcoholic beverages went up sharply .
It peaked in 1937 , then went down to 1940 , then rose during the war until 1945 .
Thereafter it went down gradually but persistently .
I am old enough to be a veteran of that period myself .
I remember a few months after prohibition had been repealed going to a Swedish restaurant in New York City with a Swedish friend of mine , a fellow graduate student at Columbia .
It was a restaurant in which he had been able to buy Aquavit all during prohibition and he tried to get Aquavit for us .
I had never tasted the stuff , and he thought that I ought to have that experience .
They said , oh no , they could n't serve it now because they had n't received their license yet .
He talked Swedish to them and finally was able to persuade them to take us back into the kitchen and give us a little taste of Aquavit .
Anyone who believes that during prohibition there was any difficulty in getting alcohol in most of the United States should look at the evidence .
I was n't very old and was not much of a drinker but there was no difficulty in finding speakeasies .
To return to the chart , the skeptic may reply , and correctly , that it is a percentage .
Total consumption is going up .
Perhaps the smaller percentage of a larger total conceals a very large increase in the amount of alcohol consumed .
Figure 3.3 shows the expenditure on alcoholic beverages expressed in constant 1982 prices between the same dates .
As you will see , absolute expenditures , like the percentage spent , went up to 1937 and then fell briefly .
During the war , expenditures went up sharply , peaking this time in 1946 .
Expenditures then fell and remained fairly constant during the forties and fifties and then , beginning in 1961 , there was a sharp increase in expenditures on alcoholic beverages .
For our purposes , however , the important lesson from the chart is that the legalization of alcohol clearly did not stimulate alcoholism .
The legalization of alcohol was followed by a plateau in the consumption of alcohol .
The kinds of things that many people have talked about as occurring during the sixties produced the sharp increase in expenditures on alcoholic beverages from 1961 to 1980 .
Since then expenditures have been falling in absolute terms and not only as a percentage of total consumption .
The obvious implication is that if currently illicit drugs were decriminalized and handled exactly the way alcohol is now handled , there is no reason to suppose that there would be a vast increase in the number of addicts .
That is by no means a certainty , but every statement that I have seen asserting the contrary is based on pure conjecture and hypothesis .
I have seen no hard evidence .
The closest to it that I have come across is reference to the opium craze in China .
Given the evidence we have - not only from alcohol prohibition but also from Holland , Alaska , and others - the burden of proof , it seems to me , is on those who maintain that there would be a completely unacceptable increase in the number of addicts .
One thing we really do know for certain is that what we are now doing is not working .
There is a wider measure of agreement on that proposition than appears on the surface .
It is natural for people to exaggerate their differences .
It is hard to impress people without overstating one 's case .
I suspect , for example , that on the issue of marijuana that Dr. Grinspoon addresses so movingly ( Chapter 21 ) , few people believe that dealing in marijuana ought to be a capital offense .
I suspect that almost everybody would agree that there is no case whatsoever for treating marijuana the way we do .
It seems to me that we ought to recognize the harm that we are now doing , and not let the tyranny of the status quo prevent us from making some changes that can stop the killing in the slums , and ghettos of our cities .
We can stop destroying the possibility of a decent family life among the underprivileged in this country .
I do not agree with many people who would agree with me on that point about the role that government ought to play in the treatment of addiction .
I do not agree either with those who say that the tragedy of the slums is really a social problem , that the underprivileged do not have enough jobs and therefore government has to provide them with jobs .
I want to tell those people that government performance is no better in creating jobs and solving other social problems than it is in drug prohibition .
just as a very large fraction of our crime is , in my opinion , caused by government measures , a very large fraction of our poverty is caused by government measures .
If those of you who have studied the drug situation were to study as carefully the effects of government measures in the areas of welfare , social services , housing , and so on , you would not have any difficulty in recognizing that there is at least a little bit of sense in what I am saying .
That is a different subject , however , and we ought to separate those subjects .
Let 's not draw ideological lines on this issue because , although there is no doubt an ideological element , the expediential considerations are so strong and so overwhelming that it seems to me they really dominate the situation .
DISCUSSION Q . I just wanted you to comment on some of the precedent that has been set by the fact that nicotine is legal and a great amount of education has gone into it recently and I believe nicotine consumption is going down on a per capita basis .
Friedman : I know nicotine consumption is going down on a per capita basis just as alcohol consumption is going down on a per capita basis .
Q. And the second part of that is what about the drug enforcement agencies .
If we do legalize it , how do we respond to their losing their income or their financing from the government .
If we legalize it we have to have something for the enforcement agencies ... Friedman : Nonsense .
Why ?
The taxpayers are wasting their money now .
Why should they continue to waste it ?
Q. I am in 100 percent agreement , but how do we convince them not to ?
How do we turn the funds off ?
Friedman :
We can't convince them .
We cannot get a change in procedure by convincing the people who have a strong interest in continuing the present methods .
There is no area in our government in which we can do that .
We can not get rid of tariffs by trying to convince the people who are being Protected by tariffs .
We can't get rid of farm subsidies by persuading the farmers .
It 's the rest of us as citizens who have to be convinced .
I do n't believe that maintaining a full - employment policy for bureaucrats ought to deter us from taking the right measures .
Q. ( Kildare Clarke )
The question you state that it is more of a medical problem , which I do agree with because if we legalize or decriminalize drugs , even if we increased the number of addicts , it is a medical problem .
Right now as a physician I think God has given me the privilege to cure someone who is an addict , but he has not given me the power to raise Lazarus from the dead .
When a man is dead with a gunshot wound to his head ...
Friedman : I could n't agree with you more .
Q. ( Kildare Clarke )
Therefore , based on that factor , would you comment a little about whether we should be looking at this as strictly a medical model as I state in my paper ?
Friedman : I am not sure what that means and I do n't think we want to draw hard and fast lines .
For example , I believe that you would agree that we should make the sale of all drugs to youngsters under the age of 18 illegal , as we now do for cigarettes and alcohol .
The question of advertising is a very difficult question .
I must confess that my libertarian instincts lead me not to want to prohibit advertising , and yet I am repelled at the notion of seeing a pretty young lady on the television screen saying , smoke my brand of cocaine instead of his , or my brand of smack or crack .
So I am very much torn on the question of advertising , but again we do n't have to decide all those issues .
We now prohibit much advertising of hard liquor , and that is why I tried to say let 's treat drugs the way we treat alcohol now , which is a mixture of regarding it primarily as a medical problem , but on the margins , on the fringes , as a criminal problem .
Q. ( Robert Millman ) I would like you to belabor a point .
I do n't think that legalization of drugs will cure the problem of the inner city .
Friedman :
It wo n't .
Q. ( Robert Millman )
And you act as if there is nothing that government can do , or that anyone can do , and I disagree .
I think we can do enormous amounts to change the educational system .
I think we have to start sooner , doing more along the way .
My point is that there is a tendency to think that a technologic answer like legalization will alter suicides or alter crime or change the American dream in those areas , and that worries me .
Friedman : I do n't call it a technological change .
But whatever you call it , legalization of drugs will improve the conditions of the inner cities enormously , even if it does not completely cure the problem .
In my opinion , the most important thing we can do to improve the inner city beyond that is to get the government out of doing most of what it is doing and into something else , which is privatizing the school system .
The most destructive area of government intervention in the inner cities , other than the prohibition of drugs , is in the school system .
What we have to do is to privatize the school system .
This is something that I suggested doing thirty years ago through unlimited vouchers for schooling which could be used in any governmental or private school .
In New York City it is also easy to see that you need to eliminate rent control , which has been a major factor in destroying housing in the inner cities .
Q. ( Joseph McNamara ) Professor Friedman , what do you think realistically is the political potential for decriminalizing drugs , given what we have seen for seventy years ?
Friedman : Unfortunately , very small , but you know that does n't mean we should n't keep trying .
For example , in education , I have been working on the voucher system for thirty years , even longer , and I have participated in one unsuccessful attempt to get one experiment started after another - in New Hampshire , in Connecticut , in Michigan , in Oregon - but that does not mean we should give up hope .
I have also seen cases in which things that were said to be politically unfeasible became politically feasible almost overnight .
They are not in this area , but I could cite you examples .
Q. ( Joseph McNamara ) I have a personal example .
I have been trying to get some reasonable firearms control for twenty years .
Friedman : I understand we 're all in that position , and the one thing we must not do is to give up the fight .
If we do , we are through .
Q. Professor Friedman , you described it as mere conjecture that consumption of the currently illicit drugs would go up under legalization .
If cocaine were made legally available and taxed at the same rate per dose as alcohol is now taxed , the price of cocaine would fall to approximately 10 percent of its current value .
Do you think it is mere conjecture that the price elasticity for demand of cocaine is likely to be unity , more or less ?
Friedman : No , no .
Do n't misunderstand me .
I did not deny that consumption might go up .
There is a high likelihood that it would .
But there are offsetting forces that I will come to in a moment that might keep that from happening .
What I designate as conjecture is the notion that there would be a manifold multiplication of the number of addicts , that the number of drug addicts would become comparable to the number of people consuming alcohol .
That I believe is pure conjecture .
If you make something lower in price , it is likely that more will be purchased .
There is price elasticity .
But there are two offsetting forces .
One is the effect of the forbidden - fruit kind of thing , especially on the young to whom doing something illegal has a certain value in and of itself .
But , second ... Q. But under your proposal it would remain illegal .
So the forbidden fruit would n't change .
Friedman : I beg your pardon .
It would remain illegal for the children , but consuming drugs would not be doing something that in a sense was sneering at social values .
That is what they want to do .
Second , and more important , under present circumstances drug dealers have a financial incentive to create addicts .
If they can create an addict , they have a captive customer .
Under a legalized system , you do n't see anybody on the street corners giving away bread .
It does n't pay you to give away bread because if you create somebody who loves bread he can buy it at the cheapest place .
It would not pay anybody , for financial reasons , to create addicts .
Q. Unless people create brand - name drugs as , for example , R. J. Reynolds does hand out free examples of their cigarettes .
Friedman :
They do hand out cigarettes , that is right .
If there were brand - name drugs of that kind , the same thing would happen .
But it would be on a much smaller scale .
I am not questioning for a moment that the number of drug addicts is likely to go up .
What I am saying is that the innocent victims created by even a much higher level of addiction would be vastly smaller than the number now created by drug prohibition .
There have been cost - benefit analyses such as Rich Dennis published in the Atlantic Monthly in which he tried to estimate the financial costs and benefits from decriminalizing drugs .
He establishes a highly persuasive case that the benefits are far greater than the costs .
However , I am inclined to rest the case much more on the human innocentvictim aspect than on the financial consequences .
With respect to the notion that drugs should be taxed , I believe that we overtax alcohol now , in the sense that we tend to generate an illegal black market in alcohol .
Very likely , the same thing would occur with drugs .
We probably would end up overtaxing them .
Everyone of us has a different law he would write , and no one of us is going to be able to write the law .
What we can do is to agree that the present system is a mess and is n't working and that we should at least move to some extent in a direction that will reduce the major harm now being done .
On the political level , I want to cite one example that offers a bit more hope .
Back in the 1940s and 1950s we had a military draft .
And I may say , I was just as opposed to the military draft as I now am to the prohibition of drugs .
It looked as if you could n't get rid of it .
It was politically unfeasible to get rid of the draft .
We had a conference like this at the University of Chicago ; I have forgotten the exact date -- sometime in the fifties or early sixties .
It was one of the few conferences in which opinions were changed .
I hope this will be another .
We took a poll at the beginning of the draft conference .
We had , just as here , people in favor of the draft , people opposed to the draft - a much wider group than here , including politicians , academicians , and so on .
At the beginning of that conference the vote was one - third in favor of the volunteer army and two - thirds in favor of the draft .
After three days of the conference , the vote was precisely reversed .
Two - thirds expressed themselves in favor of the volunteer army and one - third still in favor of the draft .
I believe that was a major factor in starting the ball rolling , which ultimately got rid of the draft in 1973 .
1 believe that this is the same kind of an issue .
The evidence is highly persuasive to those who are willing to look at it from the point of view not of one extreme or the other , but of the sensible middle that everybody is looking for .
We must change the present policy .
I am not without hope that something will happen .
At least , the vigor of the attempt at enforcement will lessen .
Q. The thing that concerns me , of course , is exactly the issue that you do n't say much about , except to say it is speculative , how much the user pool would increase .
But let me ask you this .
just make the assumption now that the use of cocaine , particularly crack cocaine which is smoked , that is a socially acceptable way to take things .
Just suppose we ended up with as many crack smokers as we have nicotine users today .
So that the expansion would be that great .
Would that change your views at all about the issue of legalization ?
Friedman :
It probably would , not about the legalization of marijuana or some other drugs , but about crack .
However , I believe that the likelihood of that happening is extremely small .
I cannot claim to be an expert on this , but I have looked at a great many studies .
I find the evidence of anything like that explosion in usage occurring very underwhelming .
Q. But that is the central issue , is n't it ?
Friedman :
No , it is not the central ... Q. Since you would change your position if that were true , then it is important to get a better estimate of whether that is true .
Friedman : Yes , and let me ask you a question .
In the meantime , should we allow the killing to go on in the ghettos ?
Perhaps 10,000 additional murders a year ?
In the meantime , should we continue to destroy Colombia ?
Let me ask you a question .
Suppose we succeeded in legalizing drugs and the smoking of crack went up 5 percent .
Would you change your position ?
Q. Probably .

Thanks to adam , Shea and Josh , who all got their cars washed , drove straight through a Dagobah swamp , then came back for another .
( CNN ) --
On a chilly morning in February 2009 , state police found 26 - year - old Kenzie Houk in her bed with a bullet though her head .
She was eight months pregnant .
The search for her killer ended with the most surprising murder suspect residents of Wampum , Pennsylvania , had ever seen : 11 - year - old Jordan Brown , the son of the victim 's fiancé .
He is one of the youngest suspects in the country to be charged with homicide , legal experts say .
There are two counts of homicide , one covering the fetus .
He pleaded not guilty to the charges in May .
In Pennsylvania , there is no lower limit for the age someone can be charged as an adult with criminal homicide .
If convicted , Jordan , now 12 , faces life in prison without the possibility of parole .
The question of age is being raised in the Supreme Court this year where the practice of sentencing young people younger than 14 to life in prison without parole is being challenged .
After nearly a year of silence , Jordan 's family , friends and attorney are bringing attention to the case as more court hearings loom .
They say Jordan is innocent and should be tried in juvenile court .
This month , they will launch the Jordan Brown Trust Fund to raise money for his defense .
A decertification hearing , at which Jordan 's attorneys will ask the judge to move the case to the juvenile system , began this month .
A decision on whether the case will be tried in the juvenile system or adult courts will likely be made in March , attorneys say .
The suspect 's father has not publicly discussed the case , and CNN has been unable to reach him for comment .
" Our first step is decertification , because we feel like he is amenable to juvenile rehabilitation , " said attorney Dennis Elisco of New Castle , Pennsylvania .
" Not only do I know he 's amenable , but I know he 's innocent . "
In almost half the states across the country , children can be prosecuted and tried in adult court , according to the University of Texas ' Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs .
Many of the laws passed were passed during a time when juvenile crime spiked in the 1980s and 1990s .
But sentencing experts say a majority of homicide cases involving children as young as Jordan are tried in juvenile courts , where the records remain sealed and sentences are less harsh .
At the time of the slaying , Jordan was a chubby fifth - grader with dark brown hair and an energetic smile .
He liked riding bikes and reading Harry Potter books .
Since the third grade , he played quarterback in his community 's football league .
Family and friends describe him as an " all - American boy . "
On weekends , Jordan hunted alongside his father , Chris Brown , who purchased the youth - sized 20 - gauge shotgun state police believe was the murder weapon .
The gun was given to Jordan as a present for Easter , and the boy 's lawyers say he only used it for hunting .
Jordan 's family friends say they never saw him exhibit any violent behavior .
And he had no prior brushes with the law .
" He always got along with everybody , and he was always smiling , " said Lonnie McConahy , 43 , a co-trustee of the Jordan Brown Trust Fund .
" It was always ' yes , sir ' and ' no , ma'am . ' "
After his arrest , Jordan was placed in the Lawrence Country Jail , a facility for adults .
But authorities transferred him to a juvenile center in March after his attorneys argued that the adult jail could n't accommodate an 11 - year - old .
Most juveniles who enter the Edmund L. Thomas Adolescent Detention Center come and go within a few weeks .
But Jordan has spent a birthday and Christmas there .
He missed a much - anticipated fifth - grade overnight field trip to Gettysburg and did n't get to play his final year on the junior football league .
His attorneys say Jordan is still unable to grasp the magnitude of what is happening to him .
He is doing well in counseling , his attorneys and family say .
Jordan 's detention facility locker holds his books and board games .
His school friends and football teammates shower him with letters , cards and magazines .
He is showing signs of reaching puberty .
He has grown several inches and has gained about 20 pounds .
He 's starting to look like a teenager .
Although it is rare to charge someone so young as an adult in the United States , the prosecutor in the case says Pennsylvania law left him with little choice .
In the case of homicide , " my choice is either to charge him as an adult , or do n't charge him , " said John Bongivengo of the Lawrence County District Attorney 's Office .
" Not charging him at all was n't feasible . "
It also is rare for an 11 - year - old to commit a violent crime .
In his 30 - year analysis of juvenile homicides , Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox found about 500 cases of children younger than 11 who were suspected of murder .
Brain science has been central to the debate on whether juveniles should be punished as adults .
It 's only in the past decade that there 's been any significant scientific research on the adolescent brain . .
Laurence Steinberg of Temple University explained why juveniles lack control .
" The teenage brain is like a car with a good accelerator but a weak brake , " wrote Steinberg , who is considered among the foremost experts in the field .
" With powerful impulses under poor control , the likely result is a crash . "
The U.S. Supreme Court took into account the growing body of adolescent brain research in 2005 when it banned the death penalty for juveniles .
" For all of the reasons the Supreme Court has rejected imposing the death penalty on children and all the new brain research , those reasons are magnified when thinking about a child as young as 11 , " said Marsha Levick , director of the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia .
Jordan 's defense argues that there are no witnesses to connect him to the crime , but prosecutors are relying on the statements of the victim 's oldest daughter , who was 7 at the time .
She told authorities she heard a loud boom before leaving for school with Jordan .
That sound , prosecutors say , was the noise of a 20 - gauge youth shotgun that state police believe is the weapon responsible for Houk 's slaying .
But Jordan 's attorneys say the witness , now 8 , is unreliable because she did n't say she heard a " boom " the first two times police interrogated her .
It was n't until a third round of questioning that she told them about the noise .
The victim 's body was discovered by her youngest daughter , just 4 .
Prosecutors allege there was tension between Jordan and Houk , who had moved into the father 's farmhouse .
They say Jordan was jealous of Houk and her two daughters .
The unborn child was a boy .
" There are no signs of forced entry , " Bongivengo added .
" No signs of a robber or burglar . "
Jordan 's supporters deny any rivalry or bad feelings between the boy and his would - be stepmother .
Prosecutors also allege that there is strong physical evidence linking Jordan to the crime .
Police found gunshot residue on Jordan 's shirt .
A state trooper testified that the gun smelled like it had been freshly fired .
His defense team argues that many of Jordan 's shirts and guns had residue because he frequently hunted with his father .
Also , police said they discovered a blanket covering the gun with a quarter - sized hole burned into it .
With outcome of the decertification hearing still months away , there is little consolation for the victims ' family .
The victim 's family wants Jordan to be charged as an adult for taking two lives , they say .
They remember Kenzie Houk as beautiful , friendly and popular .
Family members say they miss attending weekly bingo nights , cooking dinner and watching Steelers games with her .
" She 'd give her last penny to everyone , " said her mother , Debbie Houk .
" She loved everyone and did n't have a mean bone in her body . "
Debbie Houk , said she never expected to be a mother again .
But after her daughter was slain , she now cares for her grandchildren .
" The day Kenzie was murdered , the whole family was served with a life sentence , " she said .
" There are a 4 - year - old and 7 - year - old who are serving life right now .
They are never going to see their mom . "
Look at the photo with this column .
It ’s of an audio microcassette I found in my desk drawer yesterday while madly looking for something else in my overgrown office .
As you may be able to read on the picture , it is an interview with Bill Gates from June , 1998 .
That ’s the interview I did for my ill - fated Vanity Fair piece on the relationship between Bill Gates and Steve Jobs .
It is almost sixty minutes entirely devoted to Bill talking about Steve .
Quite a historical document , especially since its contents have never been published .
And they wo n’t be here , either , except for one short quote that stood out when I listened to the tape today after almost 12 years .
“ What I ca n’t figure out is why he ( Steve Jobs ) is even trying ( to be the CEO of Apple ) ? ” wondered Bill .
“ He knows he ca n’t win . ”
It is easy to see what Gates meant if you look at a comparison of the two companies in June , 1998 .
Microsoft stock was around $ 29 with a market capitalization of $ 250 billion .
Apple ’s stock was at $ 7.25 , triple what it had been a year before when Microsoft had stepped - in to bolster Apple with a $ 150 million investment , but still worth a market cap of only $ 6 billion .
In terms of products , market share , cash flow , and general strategy Microsoft had it all over Apple in 1998 and the idea that Jobs would ever catch up to Gates was , at the time , ludicrous .
But look at the two companies today .
Jobs is still running Apple despite cancer and a liver transplant while Gates has moved on to saving the world at the Gates Foundation .
Microsoft is worth $ 240 billion , a tiny drop from 12 years ago , with the shares now around $ 27 ( down from $ 29 ) .
Nothing gained in more than a decade .
Apple shares , on the other hand , have gone from $ 7.25 to almost $ 240 , Apple ’s market cap has risen more than 33X from $ 6 billion to $ 220 billion .
And Cupertino ’s cash hoard today is almost exactly the same as Microsoft ’s at around $ 40 billion .
It ’s pretty easy to argue that Jobs did win .
Certainly Apple has the mojo lately with its string of home run products like the iMac , iPod , iPhone , and now the iPad .
Even Mac market share is up in the double digits and Apple ’s profit margins are the best in the industry .
The trend line is definitely up for Apple and mildly down for Microsoft .
What Bill Gates did n’t count on when he declared Jobs a loser back in 1998 , was the Californian ’s tenacity .
It took 12 years to do it , but Apple is well positioned now to take Microsoft ’s crown .
I mean it .
Look at the downward price erosion of Microsoft Office caused by a combination of Open Office and iWork , which is down to $ 30 on the iPad .
How long will it be until Apple is giving iWork away to sell hardware — an option Microsoft does n’t have ?
Not long .
By then a bit more of Redmond ’s goose will have been cooked .
Digital market leadership is now Apple ’s — not Microsoft ’s — to lose .
Can there be any woman between 17 and 30 who does n't secretly ( or not even that secretly ) want , with shivers of yearning , to be Karen Gillan at this moment ?
Plucked , she freely admits , from obscurity , she 's the new girl , Amy Pond , in the life of the new Doctor , as Matt Smith replaces David Tennant this Easter , and Steven Moffat comes back to the writing .
There is , I regret to inform those of you who like a bit of grit in the oyster to mitigate yellow jealousy , not a bad bone in this story .
Karen is , truly and annoyingly , a lucky , pretty , talented , happy , smart , leggy , ordinary , honest , laughing girl , from a very loving family .
Born in Inverness 22 years ago , she toyed for a while with a career in music before being told her acting was better than her singing , and heading to London 's Italia Conti school , which she soon quit to take her first TV job , in an episode of Rebus .
Suddenly she found herself out of work , out of college , having to take a job in a pub ( The Pilgrim in Kennington , you fans might like to know ) just to survive .
But before long she was talent - spotted for a modelling job , and that was her career for the next couple of years , while trying furiously to get back into acting .
She thought she " had n't a hope in hell " of securing Amy , so just went for it , without fear .
" Then I got the recall , the second audition .
That was when I started sweating .
This huge thing .
And it was so secretive I could n't even tell BBC reception where I was going , had to pretend it was for something called Panic Moon , which is an anagram of companion . "
She was the last auditionee , and got the call later that same night that 's still changing her life .
" To be honest , I was n't really a huge follower of Dr Who before I got this part .
I mean I knew it was huge , but … I was nothing like my mum , who 's a proper diehard Whovian .
She 's got a Tardis money - bag , and Dalek bubble - bath .
But having read the first episode I was utterly smitten , and with the character .
Amy 's a sassy lady , funny and passionate , and her relationship with the doctor has a really interesting dynamic . "
She kisses him this series : does she love him ?
Karen ( who is in real life in a relationship ) , answers carefully .
" She has a love for him , a really deep love for him .
But not romantic .
" It 's been an education in itself to work with Matt , who 's so endlessly inventive , bringing something new to it every day rather than falling into the easy default scared - face .
That 's one of the challenges ; you 're faced with life - threatening situations every episode , but you can't just widen your eyes all the time .
Yes , this doctor is preeeetty good .
As , I 've said , is Amy , and she gets to wear all these small skirts , which I will admit was very cold , but also very cool .
They originally wanted to put me in trousers , but I did say I 'd like to wear a skirt because – you 'll understand when you watch it .
Actually I think I love Amy .
I 'm in love with her .
I want to be her . "

The charity will visit primary schools to deliver workshops on bullying Emma says she was " dragged out of the closet " when she was just 14 years old .
It was not her choice that everyone at her school in Kirkcaldy , Fife , knew she was a lesbian .
However , when one person at the school found out , it did not take long before everyone else did .
As a result , her remaining years at secondary were spent being bullied and fearing for her safety .
Now at university , Emma 's experience has left her determined to speak out .
The 21 - year - old said the bullying she suffered was not just confined to one or two people .
" From the 11 - year - olds , all the way up to the 17 - year - olds , I was having things thrown at me in the corridors at lunchtimes and break times .
I was being bullied by an entire school and so the only thing that they could really do was allow me to hide in an office .
They did n't know how to deal with it
Emma " Unless I was in the middle of my friends , I would spend [ break time ] in a guidance office because it actually was n't safe , " she said .
After being verbally abused by her classmates , Emma sought the help of a guidance teacher who allowed her to use his office when she felt threatened .
She added : " I was being bullied by an entire school and so the only thing that they could really do was allow me to hide in an office .
They did n't know how to deal with it .
" I was being yelled at .
There was snidey comments being made behind teacher 's backs .
" The problem was , it was n't just two or three people bullying me .
It 's not like you can just turn round and suspend everyone . "
' Section 28 ' According to Stonewall Scotland director Carl Watts , Emma 's experience is not unusual .
The organisation has found that more than two thirds of young gay Scots are bullied at school .
Stonewall Scotland says Emma 's case is not unusual
Out of those youngsters , 60 % have no adults to turn to .
The group has produced a DVD called FIT focussing on the impact of homophobic bullying , which is being sent to every school in Scotland .
Mr Watts said : " This film is going to be a resource which teachers will be able to use .
" The problem I think mostly is that since the legacy of Section 28 , there 's a generation of teachers who have not been trained in tackling homophobic bullying and they do n't have the resources to do that . "
Recent YouGov research for Stonewall has found that nine in 10 secondary school teachers said pupils at their school were regularly experiencing homophobic bullying .
The same proportion of teachers also said they had never received any specific training on how to tackle the issue .
Emma has moved on with her life and is now studying to be a mechanical engineer .
However , she is keen that those who are currently suffering at the hands of school bullies should seek help .
She said : " I would say to people to get in touch with your guidance teacher but there is also organisations that can help like Stonewall Scotland and LGBT Youth Scotland are also fantastic and can offer great advice on how best to tackle what 's happening to you . "

A few days before Apple 's iPad went on sale , Apple launched a new section on their website showcasing a list of websites that they call " ipad ready " .
Clearly , part of their reason for doing so was to combat a lot of the people , including myself , who think the lack of Flash support on the iPad makes for a bad user - experience on the device .
What Apple did n't say is that many of these sites , including the New York Times , Reuters , Time and MLB , are n't truly iPad ready .
After spending a lot hours over the past few days on the iPad , many of the websites I have visited on Apple 's list of " iPad ready " websites , simply do n't work .
While videos on the home page work or featured content works , many times when you go a layer down , you can't get the content .
For instance , on the New York Times site , all it takes is clicking on a few links to get blank pages that tell you , " In order to view this feature , you must download the latest version of flash player here " .
What ?
According to Apple , I thought the New York Times site was " iPad ready " .
No , Apple wants you to believe it is , but when a lot of the content I am trying to view on the New York Times tells me to download Flash , that 's not my idea of " iPad ready " .
It 's simply Apple 's being fast and loose with their words , thinking we wo n't notice .
" Some " content on these sites works on the iPad , but to imply the " site " is iPad ready is a flat out lie .
On Reuters and Time , while a lot of the content is viewable on the iPad , some of it is n't .
It 's also interesting to note on the Apple site , in reference to the Reuters site it says that " most of " their content is viewable .
Define " most of " .
On all of the news sites they use a lot of Flash graphics , not just videos , for all of the interactive elements like showcasing election results or applications that have a lot of photos .
None of those work on the iPad amongst all of the news sites I visited .
And even on Apple 's own site , they use the word " video " when talking about these " iPad ready " sites , not the word content .
Flash is used for all kinds of content , not just videos .
While MLB.com is listed by Apple as one of the sites that works on the iPad , it does n't .
When visiting MLB.com or any of the team pages , in every video window you get a message that says " click here to learn how to get video highlights on the iPad " .
That link then takes you to an MLB page that links to the MLB iPad app that you can download for $ 14.99 .
While there is nothing wrong with a content owner creating an app specifically for the iPad , no where does Apple say that on their website .
In fact , Apple lists the MLB.com URL on their website , which is completely deceptive .
Maybe MLB and others plan to change this over time and it is possible that " iPad ready " sites , as defined by Apple , plan to make more content available down the road .
But for all the folks who are quick to comment about how all these main - stream websites have agreed to support HTML5 and think Flash is doomed , you better pick up and iPad and use it for a few days before you make any comments .
You can't argue with a message that says " please download Flash to see this content " .
Anyone who buys something from Amazon and can't get a product video , is looking to adopt a pet and can't see content on Petfinder or is trying to watch a video on NFL.com is going to be very disappointed .
Apple is shooting itself in the foot by not supporting Flash on the iPad because as much as they want to try and argue or convince us that the " experience " is better without Flash , anyone who actually uses an iPad will tell you it is n't .
Apple needs to quit with the hype , stop trying to make an Apple business decision into an Adobe technical problem and should focus on giving iPad users a REAL browsing experience and not Apple 's own defined limitation of what they think a browsing experience is .
Note :
Whenever I write about Apple , I get a lot of comments from folks who own Apple stock , think the company can do no wrong or leave me comments about how Flash wo n't survive because they had a problem with their Acrobat reader , which is n't even relevant to the conversation .
You want to debate the points I raise above , lets do it .
But do n't expect a reply from me if all you want to say in the comments section is " I do n't like Flash " .

The citizen has the right to be able to walk the street without constantly being photographed
The authors of section 44 of the 2000 Prevention of Terrorism Act did not intend to mandate the systematic harassment of photographers .
The law gives police the power to stop and search people , without suspicion of criminal intention , in any area considered a possible target for terrorist attack .
Since al - Qaida targets civilians , an area vulnerable to attack can plausibly be defined as a place where people gather .
Predictably , that interpretation is the one police seem to prefer when using their power .
They are also zealous in following guidance that identifies photography of public buildings as one possible stage in the chain of planning a terrorist act .
So anyone taking a picture anywhere can be stopped by the police as a potential terrorist .
The New Review today reports how a rising tide of suspicion is threatening the art of street photography .
Anti-terror law is only part of the picture .
Concern about paedophiles has lead in many public places to a ban on photography where children might be caught in the frame .
Many streets and shopping centres that appear to be public spaces are run by private companies with their own rules on photography enforced by security guards in pseudo - police garb .
Meanwhile , CCTV cameras belonging to private and state bodies are constantly capturing images of the public , with no obligation to respect privacy or seek consent .
The ubiquity of the camera , whether mounted on government buildings or in a mobile phone , is a defining feature of our lives , but we have yet to settle the laws and protocols that should govern their use : what is public , what is private , what is fair game for a snapper .
It is clear , however , that the balance is currently skewed the wrong way .
Moral right gives citizens possession of the streets .
Governments and corporations should ask permission to take our pictures if they must , not the other way around .

Vancouver Olympic organizers are fending off criticism about a chain link fence that surrounds the Olympic cauldron to keep visitors from getting too close .
People are flocking to the flame and have resorted to hoisting each other up or shooting through the links to get that perfect picture .
" I wish that you could go closer it's hard to get a picture with a giant fence around it , " said Kasia .
The fence keeps visitors back about 100 metres from the flame and is reinforced with concrete barriers .
VANOC says it has heard the complaints and will consider changing the fence .
BETHPAGE , NY–Preparing for the arrival of dinner date Amanda Raskin , area resident Randy Thaler conducted a thorough porn sweep of his one - bedroom apartment Monday .
Randy
Thaler purges his apartment of all visible pornographic material .

" I almost forgot to do it , actually , " the 24 - year - old graphic designer said .
" But while I was clearing off the kitchen table , I saw the box for A Fistful Of Dolores sitting out and thought , ' Oh , shit . ' "
As a pot of spinach fettuccine boiled in the kitchen , Thaler swiftly moved through the apartment , racing to collect all traces of print - and video - based female objectification before his date 's 7 p.m. arrival .
First , he headed to the bathroom , where he removed from the top of the toilet a copy of last month 's Playboy and a November 1999 issue of the non-pornographic but sexist Maxim magazine .

Thaler then proceeded to the living room , where he found a copy of Girls Gone Wild : Best Of Mardi Gras sticking out of the VCR .
Sliding the tape safely underneath the couch , he turned to the nearby video shelf , upon which rested a copy of Butt - Fuck Sluts Go Nuts , Vol. 31 , a tape Thaler received " as a total joke from the guys " for his birthday last year .
He promptly hid the hardcore anal - sex video behind a New York Giants 1998 season - highlight video .
" I almost blocked Butt - Fuck Sluts with When Harry Met Sally … , but then I realized Amanda might pick that one up and see what was behind it , " Thaler said .
" So , not wanting to take any chances , I decided to block it with a sports video instead of a regular movie . "

More disaster was averted when , at the last minute , Thaler decided against excluding the kitchen from his porn sweep , remembering that a postcard featuring a row of G - string - clad posteriors and the phrase " Cancun 's Natural Assets " was taped to his refrigerator .
While disposing of the postcard , Thaler also noticed the partially completed Vivid Video mail - order form that had been sitting on his phone table .
Some of the items uncovered during the sweep .

Moving to the bedroom , Thaler sifted through the stack of periodicals on the floor next to his bed , removing all of them with the exception of a single issue of Details .
Thaler then took the 16 - ounce tube of Astro - Glide he keeps on his nightstand and hid it in the top drawer of his dresser .
A semen - encrusted sock lying next to the bed was also removed from view .
With scant minutes to go before his date 's arrival and numerous non-porn - related matters still requiring his attention before the apartment could be considered romance - ready , Thaler was forced to conclude the sweep .
Tossing a copy of Perfect 10 magazine onto his top closet shelf , he returned to the kitchen to light a candle , dim the lights , and strain the fettuccine .

" It 's not like I 'm some perverted , freako porn - hound , " Thaler said .
" It 's just that I have n't really dated anyone in a while , and sometimes you need , you know , visual aids . "
Added Thaler : " You do n't realize how much porn you have until a woman 's about to come over . "

Raskin , a 23 - year - old social worker who was set up with Thaler by a mutual friend , complimented the apartment upon arriving , calling it " a very nice place . "

According to the CIA ’s favorite newspaper , The Washington Post , a lot of money is leaving Afghanistan and it is confounding U.S. officials .
“ The cash , estimated to total well over $ 1 billion a year , flows mostly to the Persian Gulf emirate of Dubai , ” reports the newspaper .
Before the CIA ’s covert war against the Soviets in Afghanistan , the country produced zero percent of the world ’s opium .
“ The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , for its part , is trying to figure out whether some of the money comes from Afghanistan ’s thriving opium trade . ”
Some of the money ?
Afghanistan is the largest producer of opium in the world .
A whopping 93 % of all the opiates in the world originate in Afghanistan .
The Taliban banned opium cultivation after they were installed by the CIA and Pakistan ’s ISI intelligence service .
Since the defeat of the Taliban in response to their intransigence and lack of business savvy , opium production has skyrocketed .
Before the CIA ’s covert war against the Soviets in Afghanistan , the country produced zero percent of the world ’s opium .
During this covert war instigated at the highest levels of the U.S. government , the CIA - supported Mujahedeen rebels ( later known popularly known as al - Qaeda ) engaged heavily in drug trafficking .
“ The Agency ’s principal client was Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , one of the leading druglords and a leading heroin refiner , ” writes author William Blum .
Back in October of 2009 , The New York Times reported that Ahmed Wali Karzai , the brother of the installed president of Afghanistan ( a former CIA - ISI operative and Unocal employee ) , is on the CIA payroll .
“ Officials quoted by The Times described Karzai as a Mafia - like figure who expanded his influence over the drug trade with the aid of U.S. efforts to eliminate his competitors , ” writes Paul Joseph Watson .
“ The New York Times exposé pins the blame on Karzai , but fails to explain that one of the primary reasons behind the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan was the United States ’ agenda to restore , not eradicate , the drug trade . ”
Al Jazeera piece on Afghanistan ’s opium trade .
In 2002 , a U.S. foreign intelligence official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , told NewsMax.com about the CIA ’s involvement in the international illegal drug business .
“ The CIA did almost the identical thing during the Vietnam War , which had catastrophic consequences — the increase in the heroin trade in the USA beginning in the 1970s is directly attributable to the CIA .
The CIA has been complicit in the global drug trade for years , so I guess they just want to carry on their favorite business , ” the official said .
Former Managing Director and board member of Wall Street investment bank Dillon Read , Catherine Austin Fitts , has long alleged that the banksters launder imponderable amounts of drug money .
“ According to the Department of Justice , the US launders between $ 500 billion – $ 1 trillion annually .
I have little idea what percentage of that is narco dollars , but it is probably safe to assume that at least $ 100 - 200 billion relates to US drug import - exports and retail trade , ” writes Fitts .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
Fitts ’ assertion was underscored by Antonio Maria Costa , director of the Vienna - based UNODC ( United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ) , who said in January of 2009 that the illicit drug trade has been used to keep banks afloat during the global financial crisis .
“ In many instances , drug money is currently the only liquid investment capital , ” Costa said .
“ In the second half of 2008 , liquidity was the banking system ’s main problem and hence liquid capital became an important factor . ”
The CIA “ is the active force that puts the plans and schemes of the most powerful Wall Street , armaments and oil interests into operation .
Within the CIA the lines between the state and private , corporate power are totally blurred , in fact have melded into one , ” writes Max Kolskegg ( 9/11 In Context : Plans and Counterplans ) .
U.S. officials , according to The Washington Post , claim “ this money magically appears from nowhere ” and ends up in Dubai banks .
In predictable fashion ( since the Post is the CIA ’s crown jewel of Operation Mockingbird propaganda ) , the newspaper fingers the Ansari Exchange , an Islamic hawala , for the tremendous amount of money departing the country .
Once again , Muslims play the fall guy .
As noted above , there is a long and sordid history of the CIA and Wall Street dominating the illegal drug addiction and death business .
Muslims , at best , play an insignificant and peripheral role in Wall Street ’s international drug business .

I was recently involved in a car accident in which I managed to smash the front end of my Chrysler — one consolation is the fact that it was a Chrysler and so was not much of a loss .
I sat around for a minute or two , trying to figure out what had just happened .
Finally , I got out of my car to talk to the driver of the truck I had hit .
While filling out the claims report and talking to my insurance company , I could not help but examine my experience through the lens of Austrian economics and the free market .
I was thinking about how much this ordeal would end up costing me .
While my insurance covered the damage done to the truck , my car was totaled .
Also , my insurance rates were bound to be jacked up ; that would be hundreds of dollars more every year .
If I were a diehard and dedicated government pundit , I would demand that Obama set up some type of coverage program for young students like myself to deal with automobile accidents .
It makes sense , does n't it ?
The government pays for at least part of our schooling and our housing , and , if you are needy enough , will even pay for your daily " necessary " expenses .
It is about time that the government step in and help defenseless college students pay for these mishaps !
As much as I would enjoy this " free " service ( at the expense of other taxpayers ) the fact is that social - insurance and welfare programs do not benefit the economy — or the recipient — over the long run .
The welfare state has eroded the concept of personal responsibility , and for affected industries it has replaced the free market with a central economic system that promises higher costs and lower quality .
The welfare state accomplishes the exact opposite of what it intends to do .
It is a bane to the general wellbeing of society .
The welfare state has a long history in the United States ( see Murray N. Rothbard 's Origins of the Welfare State ) .
One can trace it back to the early 19th century , and those well acquainted with the topic could probably trace it back even further .
The Progressive movement , or the socially " left - of - center " movement , began to push for the expansion of the welfare state in the early 20th century .
The modern welfare state in the United States was born out of Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal .
Many of our current social - insurance programs , such as social security , were founded during that era .
Since then , there have been a number of generations who have known nothing but the welfare state .
The era of instilling the virtues of responsibility seems to be slipping away , and new generations are becoming fixated on " government support . "
The new culture has become more about the " right " to have opportunities made available for you , rather than the right to make opportunities for yourself .
The old culture has been washed away by the rising tide of government interference and welfare .
The notion of self - accountability is being eliminated by so - called " progressives " who believe it unfair to struggle .
Instead , they push for a society in which everything should be made free and plentiful .
The proponents of such a utopian and egalitarian society are those same individuals who consider the government an omnipotent force capable of providing these services without negative externalities .
" The notion of self - accountability is being eliminated by so - called ' progressives ' who believe it unfair to struggle . "
Few have stopped to consider the moral and economic arguments against welfare and government - sponsored egalitarianism .
It even seems as if the concepts of self - accountability and responsibility have completely slipped their minds .
If there are people receiving money for schooling or individuals having their medical bills for broken bones and other avoidable accidents fully paid for by the government , then I have the right to have my automobile insurance and damage costs paid for as well .
After all , there are millionaires who drive expensive cars , and I risk not being able to drive at all because I barely make enough to pay for the basic costs associated with driving .
Why do n't I deserve their luxuries ?
Dubious Morality
What moral rights can the poor claim on the property of those who own plenty ?
If one man owns ten automobiles and I own none , do I have the right to claim one of those ten automobiles as my own ?
Is the government justified in forcefully redistributing an automobile to me in order to ( seemingly ) raise my standard of living ?
Do the rich have a moral responsibility to give the poor what they would otherwise have to work for ?
Whether it is security or health care or our own exaggerated example , universal car insurance , the morality of forceful redistribution of property is dubious at best .
The bottom line is that taxation is theft .
It consists of an entity ( government ) or an individual ( the tax collector ) forcefully expropriating another 's property .
" Voluntary " tax collection is nothing more than an oxymoron :
While the Internal Revenue Service boasts of a " voluntary compliance " system of tax collection , the fact is that taxation is carried out at the point of a gun .
If you choose not to pay — for whatever reason — armed men will seize you and forcibly take you to jail .
If you resist , violence will be used against you .
This is not " voluntary compliance . "
It is theft . [ 1 ]
The case for taxation is oftentimes based on the utilitarian argument that a degree of redistribution is necessary for the good of society as a whole .
The analysis itself is flawed given that while the recipient of the redistributed capital is temporarily wealthier , the original owner is now that much poorer .
More importantly , the incentive to invest is reduced , which makes society as a whole much poorer over the long run . [ 2 ]
If you apply this to the case of universal car insurance , then while the recipients of said car insurance would be that much wealthier , those who had to pay for it would be poorer by the same amount .
Furthermore , an increase in the wealth of one person at the expense of another supposes that all other factors remain the same , which is simply untrue .
Universal car insurance would make society as a whole poorer than it would otherwise be .
The same remains true for universal healthcare and other social - insurance programs .
It 's Just Bad Economics
The entrepreneurial and moral case against social - insurance programs , like our hypothetical universal car insurance , has already been established .
A loss of entrepreneurship , however , is not the only economic loss that results from a forceful monopolization of an industry .
Less abstract than the relationship between liberty , property rights , and economic growth are the direct negative consequences of the monopolies that arise out of public insurance systems :
rising costs ;
opportunity for an infinite increase in quantity demanded ;
incentives to reduce quality .
Imagine a public car - insurance system devised by the government to cover " essential automobile - related necessities . "
The government could cover collision damage and maintenance checkups ; and , if you are particularly needy , you could also opt for coverage of necessary parts when yours wear down ( only if you meet the necessary income requirements , of course ) .
If we are to believe government , all of this can be delivered in an affordable package — let us put a price tag of $ 800 million on it ( not to worry , the Federal Reserve can just " loan " the state the money ) .
The truth is , however , that a monopolistic insurance program is anything but affordable .
Insurance companies , in a free market , work through competition .
They compete by offering better prices or better services to their customers .
Over time , different firms will devise different ways of lowering production costs , allowing them to offer lower prices to their customers and still maintain profit margins .
They do this to gain larger shares of the market and , therefore , to earn greater revenue .
" Universal car insurance would make society as a whole poorer than it would otherwise be .
The same remains true for universal healthcare and other social - insurance programs . "
In a government - organized monopoly , this does not remain true .
Insurance companies no longer compete for multiple clients , but for just one — this is called a monopsony .
The amount of eligible insurance companies quickly dwindles .
First , some companies will immediately become unprofitable , given that if they fail to quickly gain a government contract they no longer take in an income .
Second , insurance companies have to be able to meet certain government - set requirements .
Limiting the amount of suppliers raises prices , as there are fewer buyers competing against each other .
Third , once contracts are offered , those who were not awarded contracts will cease to exist , and thus a legal monopoly is created .
With no potential competitors , these firms can now raise prices almost at will .
What is the danger of getting into an accident ( other than to one 's health , of course ) ?
What would result in higher insurance costs in a free market — and therefore serve as a disincentive to drive carelessly — is free of cost in a world of universal coverage .
Rising costs do not equal rising quality .
While government may be investing in research programs to develop better automobiles that have longer life spans , insurance companies themselves will work toward lowering costs of production in order to garner higher profit margins .
When the only client is the government , insurance firms have no incentive to maintain their clientele by offering better services or by lowering costs .
The exact opposite will happen .
Over the long run , government - sponsored monopolies tend to become more expensive , and , eventually , fiscally untenable , while quality diminishes .
Thus , a universal car - insurance program is bound to fail .
Virtues of Responsibility
An insurance industry can only work to everybody 's benefit if it is operating in a free market .
Insurance companies must compete for clients , while the client must bear the fiscal responsibility of his actions .
Making the individual liable and responsible gives an incentive to lower costs .
It logically follows that government should not interfere in the market by disallowing certain suppliers to enter or by transferring responsibility from the consumer to the state .
These distortions cause shortages of coverage , making those who suffer the consequences of those distortions that much poorer .
The concept of a universal car - insurance program is absolutely silly .
But it is a great illustration of why social - insurance programs inevitably fail over the long run .
The built - in free - market " regulations " that ultimately benefit the consumer simply do not exist outside of a free market , because the government has effectively nullified their relevance .
Few people believe a universal car - insurance program would be tenable .
Those who agree with the argument presented here , however , must accept its application to other social - insurance programs .
This includes the health - insurance market .
A government monopoly in healthcare would suffer from the same economic factors as a monopoly in automobile insurance .
The lapse in logic occurs when emotion overrides reason .
There is a utilitarian impulse to support a measure that claims to provide all with the means to " guarantee " their health .
But when we look beyond the surface of the issue , we see that there is nothing less utilitarian than a universal healthcare system .
* Lib Dem leader Clegg seen as winner in election debate
* Opposition party support rises 3 points nationally
LONDON , April 16 ( Reuters ) - Support for Britain ’s Liberal Democrats jumped after a historic television debate in which the leader of the second - largest opposition party emerged as a clear winner with viewers , a poll for the programme said on Friday .
The ComRes survey for ITV News put national support for the Lib Dems up three points on 24 percent , behind the opposition Conservatives on 35 percent and ruling Labour on 28 percent ahead of an election on May 6 .
It was the highest score for the LibDems in a ComRes poll since the last election in 2005 .
The poll of 4,000 viewers was conducted immediately after the broadcast of Britain ’s first televised election debate between the leaders of the main three parties .
The results were adjusted to make them nationally representative .
If the ComRes result was repeated uniformly across Britain on polling day it would lead to a hung parliament with the Conservatives as the largest party , according to a results predictor on the Sky News website .
Surveys released after the ITV debate found Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg had found most favour amongst viewers .
Pollster YouGov said 51 percent of respondents thought Clegg performed best , ahead of Conservative leader David Cameron on 29 percent and Labour Prime Minster Gordon Brown on 19 percent .
Clegg has refused to say whether he would support a minority Labour or Conservative government after the election .
The Conservatives have led polls since January 2008 , with the Lib Dems , who only hold 63 of parliament ’s 646 seats , consistently in third place .
The Lib Dems polled 22 percent of the vote in the 2005 election , and their support has ranged around 20 percent in surveys conducted in the following five years .

MCV can confirm that the Doctor Who title for the Wii rumoured to be in the works by The Sun this morning is real .
Furthermore , it will be released in the UK this October with Koch Media handling sales and marketing duties , though when asked by MCV the firm declined to comment .
The Sun reports that the game is based around new Doctor Matt Smith and will include appearances from classic villains such as the Daleks , Cybermen and Silurians .
The paper quotes an ‘ insider ’ as saying :
This has been in the pipeline for years .
We ’re delighted to have finally nailed down a deal .
We went with Nintendo as they have huge appeal for families and Doctor Who is very much a family brand .
The Wii console is key for us as it ’s something families play together . ”
The news follows MCV ’s exclusive reveal in January that BBC Worldwide is working on producing an ‘ array of new games ’ based on the lucrative sci-fi licence .
Head of multimedia development at BBC Worldwide Dave Anderson said at the time :
We ’re having a lot of interesting discussions for a variety of ideas around Doctor Who that are complementary to each rather than in competition with each other – boxed product console games , virtual worlds and other experiences .
The deals we are looking at are in different spaces , probably looking at overlapping but different audiences and are certainly delivering a different kind of experience . ”

Breakthrough in Electron Spin Control Brings Quantum Computers Closer to Reality
Research allows control of a single electron without disturbing other nearby electrons
Optical beam splitter method compared to new method of controlling single electron spin .
February 26 , 2010
Researchers from two National Science Foundation ( NSF ) - funded Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers at Princeton University and the University of California , Santa Barbara made a significant breakthrough in the worldwide pursuit of quantum computing .
They engineered a method to control the spin of a single electron within a magnetic field without disturbing other nearby electrons .
The method developed by a team of researchers led by Jason Petta , assistant professor of physics at Princeton University with partial support from his NSF Faculty Early Career Development Award , traps one or two electrons in microscopic corrals created by applying voltages to minuscule electrodes giving them an ability to control spin orientation .
The accomplishment overcomes a major challenge to creating scalable semiconductor - based quantum computers that use the intrinsic spin of individual electrons to store and manipulate information .
Previous methods , namely electron spin resonance or ESR , unselectively sprayed microwave radiation on a sample , causing all the electrons in the sample to adopt the same spin orientation .
This defeated the goal of having distinct electrons work together to represent data .
In their latest research , Petta and his team control electron spin using a method similar to splitting a beam of light .
The path length of one of the resulting two beams is carefully adjusted so that when they recombine , their peaks and troughs either reinforce or cancel out each other .
By doing this , researchers can control the constructive or destructive outcome of the resultant beam after recombination .
Likewise , by carefully adjusting how the peaks and troughs of two quantum spin waves align , Petta 's team is able to constructively or destructively manage the condition of an electron 's spin and control its orientation .
What 's more , the new method controls the spin of electrons in approximately one - billionth of a second .
" This is nearly 100 times faster than conventional electron spin resonance , " said Petta .
The spin of an electron forms a quantum bit , also called a qubit .
Qubits are to quantum computing what " bits " are to conventional computing -- a basic unit of information representing either a 1 or 0 .
But in quantum computing , a qubit can represent 1 and 0 at the same time making way for a dramatic increase in computing speed for certain types of computation .
Researchers ultimately would like to have a quantum computer consisting of many densely packed single electron spins .
But in order to make this new type of computer a reality , they would need to control the spin orientation of a selected qubit without disturbing the other nearby spin qubits .
The challenge has been achieving the fast single spin rotations that are required to control a spin qubit without allowing the system to suffer " decoherence " or loss of quantum mechanical behavior .
" Think of a spinning top , " said Petta .
" Sooner or later it falls down due to friction .
Our quantum system in some sense does the same thing .
In order for a qubit to be technologically relevant , we need to be able to manipulate its state many times before it loses its quantum coherence . "
Regarding future research , Petta explained that " the next big step for the spin qubit community is to coherently couple two spin qubits , implementing what is called a " two - qubit gate . "
Our work demonstrates single qubit control .
In the long run , it is necessary to couple adjacent qubits and have them interact . "
Researchers anticipate that quantum computers would enable a range of new possibilities from greatly improved quantum sensors that could impact mineral exploration to improved medical imaging and perhaps even a revolutionary computational paradigm that could lead to the creation of computing devices capable of efficiently solving problems that can not be solved using conventional computer systems .
Professors Art Gossard and postdoctoral fellow Hong Lu with the Materials Research Laboratory at the University of California at Santa Barbara also assisted with this research .
The researchers reported their findings in the journal Science .

A ground - breaking investigation into Shakespeare ’s later life is due to start in Stratford - upon - Avon on 26 March 2010 , as archaeologists prepare to excavate the remains of Shakespeare ’s house in Stratford - upon - Avon , and the public are invited to come along and watch as the latest story about the world ’s most famous writer unfolds …
The archaeological dig will take place at New Place , the house that Shakespeare owned for 19 years and occupied at the time of his death in 1616 .
The ‘ Dig for Shakespeare ’ will see a team of archaeologists from Birmingham Archaeology , along with a hardy crew of volunteers , excavate three locations within the grounds of New Place in a dig where visitors will be able to interact with the archaeological team .
A special scaffolding walkway and viewing platform is being installed so that visitors can have a close view of the trenches and will be invited to talk to the archaeologists as they work .
Shakespeare ’s house at New Place was built on three sides of an open courtyard on the corner of Chapel Street and Chapel Lane .
The largest trench to be dug will stretch from the servants ’ quarters in the Chapel Street wing – where the foundations of the later 1702 building will be uncovered - across the courtyard to the rear wing , which is where Shakespeare and his family would have worked and lived .
A further trench will explore the area thought to have been his pantry and brewery , and one quarter of the 19th Century knot garden will be dug – into what would have been Shakespeare ’s backyards .
This is where archaeologists believe they might find defunct wells , filled in with refuse and waste when they ceased to be used .
Archaeologists often find that old wells hold all kinds of secrets , with the anaerobic ( waterlogged ) conditions preserving organic waste and detritus .
It is hoped that these will give the Trust a real insight into the lives of the property ’s occupants .
The public will be able to watch every stage of the dig from the start of the Easter holidays ( 27 March 2010 ) to October 2010 .
Archaeologists from Birmingham Archaeology working alongside a team of volunteers and staff from the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust will be explaining what they are doing , and showing visitors the artefacts that they are finding .
“ Once the turf is lifted , our archaeologists will start work to dig down to foundation level and beyond with trowels ( not a shovel or a JCB in sight ) so that we can monitor closely anything hidden within the spoil .
Six test pits excavated last October gave us confidence that this will be a productive dig , ” adds Dr Diana Owen , Director of the Trust .
“ Who knows , we might find one of Shakespeare ’s shoes , some of his discarded correspondence or even some of his personal effects – only time will tell ! ”
“ We know a lot about Shakespeare ’s work , but relatively little about his later life , particularly when he started to spend far more time back in his home town , ” says Professor Stanley Wells , Chairman of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust .
“ We are hopeful that this dig will represent one of the most significant research opportunities for Shakespeare fans through the world , revealing and confirming many details of his later life about which we had previously only speculated . ”
Indeed , alongside the practical archaeology , a team of academic experts , chaired by Dr Paul Edmondson of the Trust and including Shakespeare scholars , historians , local experts and archaeologists will meet regularly through the dig process to interpret and discuss the significance of any finds .
The Trust already holds an extensive archive of Shakespeare - related items , and is highly regarded as one of the world ’s leading authorities on Shakespeare ’s life .
Archaeologists will be working on the dig seven days a week .
Visitors access the dig through Nash ’s House on Chapel Street .
Admission prices , which include access to Shakespeare ’s Birthplace and exhibition , Nash ’s House and New Place , and Hall ’s Croft are £ 12.50 for adults , £ 8.00 for children and £ 11.50 for concessions .

The pilot falsely accused of training the hijackers responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks has won his almost decade - long miscarriage of justice battle .
Lotfi Raissi , an Algerian living in Britain who lost his career as an airline pilot , suffered wrongful imprisonment and damage to his health , will now be eligible for up to £ 2 m compensation .
Raissi became the first person to be accused of participating in the 2001 attack in New York and Washington .
He was held for five months in Belmarsh high security prison in London and told he would be charged with conspiracy and murder in the US where he could face the death penalty .
Today he described the last nine years as " hell " but said he was delighted with the decision by Jack Straw , the justice secretary .
" I have suffered such a great injustice , I 'm grateful for this verdict .
They took almost 10 years of my life and now I 'm starting to breathe again . "
He added : " I 've been exonerated , not just by a court , but by the British government .
Now I can turn the page , but I can never forgive them for what they did . "
Raissi's solicitor , Jules Carey , said : " The ministry of justice has formally notified me that the justice secretary has found that Mr Raissi is ' completely exonerated ' of the allegations of terrorism .
The allegations of terrorism were utterly ruinous to him both personally and professionally . "
Carey said the decision to compensate Raissi on the grounds of " exoneration " rather than " serious default " by a public authority was " extremely unfortunate " as it meant that mistakes made by the CPS and the Metropolitan police in the case , identified by the court of appeal in 2008 , would now not be investigated .
James
Welch , legal director at human rights charity Liberty , said : " The shabby treatment of this innocent man is a chilling reminder of why we all need the protection of the courts . "
Raissi's arrest , at his home in Colnbrook , Berkshire , 10 days after the 9/11 attacks , followed an extradition request from the FBI .
In court , where he awaited extradition to the US on a holding charge , he was described by British lawyers representing the US as one of the lead instructors of the four hijackers .
A judge threw the case out in 2002 and said there was no evidence against him .
Since then , Raissi has sought an apology .
In 2008 , in a judgment that exonerated him , three court of appeal judges condemned the Met and the CPS for abusing the court process , presenting false allegations and not disclosing evidence .
Today , a Ministry of Justice spokesman said : " After careful consideration of all the relevant material available to him , the justice secretary , Jack Straw , has notified Mr Raissi that he is eligible for compensation . "

Lava Lamp Centrifuge
Would a Lava Lamp work in a high - gravity environment such as Jupiter ?
Would the wax still rise to the surface ?
Would the blobs be smaller and faster ?
With broad disagreement on the answers , I built a large centrifuge to find out .
[ Music credit : Riverdance by Bill Whelan . ]
The centrifuge is made of Meccano , spans a diameter of 3 meters , weighs about 50 kilograms and rotates at 42 RPM .
At one end is the payload container which holds the lava lamp and data recorders .
At the other end is a set of counterweights .
The payload container pivots freely so that it is always facing ' down ' .
In the middle is a 20 oz Motion Lamp from Google .
Next to it is a Nexus One Android phone which runs G - Force to monitor the current gravity conditions ( in the photo below the Android is not present since it was being used to take the photo ) .
Recording both the lamp and the gravity monitor is a digital camera set to record a movie .
A set of counterweights are at the other end of the arm .
These are very carefully configured to eliminate any lateral forces on the main bearing .
The heaviest counterweight is a big steel cylinder borrowed from the equatorial mount of my telescope .
Enclosed within the girders are two rectangular juice bottles filled with glass marbles and topped off with water .
A set of steel bars lashed to the top of the girders offer the ability to fine - tune the total weight .
The turntable is a large 25 cm thrust bearing using eight roller wheels .
Suspended in the middle of the turntable is a 1/ 4 " mono audio connector .
This connector can rotate 360° continuously and is wired to 120 volts AC thus allowing uninterrupted power to flow to the lava lamp at the end of the arm .
The entire centrifuge is driven by one 12 volt motor in the base .
The motor draws somewhere between 15 amps and 33 amps ( far beyond the upper range of my multimeter ) .
The centrifuge is a genuinely terrifying device .
The lights dim when it is switched on .
A strong wind is produced as the centrifuge induces a cyclone in the room .
The smell of boiling insulation emanates from the overloaded 25 amp cables .
If not perfectly adjusted and lubricated , it will shred the teeth off solid brass gears in under a second .
Runs were conducted from the relative safety of the next room while peeking through a crack in the door .
Despite the technical hurdles , the centrifuge performed its job well .
It turns out that the accelerometers in the Nexus One are badly mis-calibrated ; although 0.0 G and 1.0 G are both properly reported , what it reports as 2.0 G is actually 3.0 G ( Googlers can view the resulting bug : # 2485924 ) .
As one can see in the video above , the lava lamp continues to operate well at three times the force of gravity .
That 's slightly higher than Jupiter 's gravity ( 2.3 G ) and it is equivalent to launching in the Space Shuttle .
Below are some raw source videos of the operation :

A top Senate Republican on Thursday accused the Obama administration of misleading taxpayers about General Motors ' loan repayment , saying the struggling auto giant was only able to repay its bailout money by dipping into a separate pot of bailout money .
Sen .
Chuck Grassley 's charge was backed up by the inspector general for the bailout -- also known as the Trouble Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
Watchdog Neil Barofsky told Fox News , as well as the Senate Finance Committee , that General Motors used bailout money to pay back the federal government .
" It appears to be nothing more than an elaborate TARP money shuffle , " Grassley , the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , said in a letter Thursday to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner .
GM announced Wednesday that it had paid back the $ 8.1 billion in loans it received from the U.S. and Canadian governments .
Of that , $ 6.7 billion went to the U.S. treasury .
But Grassley said in his letter that a Securities and Exchange Commission form filed by GM showed that $ 6.7 billion of the tens of billions the company received was sitting in an escrow account and available to be used for repayment .
He called on Geithner to provide more information about why the company was allowed to use bailout money to repay bailout money , and how much of the remaining escrow money GM would be allowed to keep .
" The bottom line seems to be that the TARP loans were ' repaid ' with other TARP funds in a Treasury escrow account .
The TARP loans were not repaid from money GM is earning selling cars , as GM and the administration have claimed in their speeches , press releases and television commercials , " he wrote .
Vice President Biden on Wednesday called the GM repayment a " huge accomplishment . "
But Barofsky told Fox News that while it's " somewhat good news , " there 's a big catch .
" I think the one thing that a lot of people overlook with this is where they got the money to pay back the loan .
And it is n't from earnings .
...
It 's actually from another pool of TARP money that they 've already received , " he said Wednesday .
" I do n't think we should exaggerate it too much .
Remember that the source of this money is just other TARP money . "
Barofsky told the Senate Finance Committee the same thing Tuesday , and said the main way for the federal government to earn money out of GM would be through " a liquidation of its ownership interest . "
Grassley criticized this scenario in his letter .
" The taxpayers are still on the hook , and whether TARP funds are ultimately recovered depends entirely on the government 's ability to sell GM stock in the future .
Treasury has merely exchanged a legal right to repayment for an uncertain hope of sharing in the future growth of GM .
A debt - for - equity swap is not a repayment , " he wrote .
Earlier this week we noted how Janet Porter was praying that God would “ take power and influence in the media of this country and of this globe from the unrighteous and give it to righteous people ” so that Christians could gain total control over the media outlets in this nation .
But , as it turns out , Porter does n’t just want to take “ dominion ” over the media ; she wants to “ take dominion in every area ” and that is what her upcoming “ May Day 2010 : A Cry to God for a Nation in Distress ” prayer rally at the Lincoln Memorial is hoping to accomplish .
As Porter explained recently , the rally is designed to break the curse this nation is under , as represented by President Obama and the Democratic agenda , so she is bringing together a group of Religious Right leaders like James Dobson and others to engage in a day of penitence and prayer as they beseech God to redeem America .
Porter and company will also be unveiling a “ Christian manifesto ” which will lay out their positions on how this country ought to be run ( apparently the recent Manhattan Declaration and the Mount Vernon Statement are insufficient ) and yesterday she explained her ultimate purpose :
We ’ve heard the conservative manifesto that ’s just been done ; we want to declare what we believe as Christians , what we ’d like to see .
As the Humanists gathered and they put down their list , they ’ve had undue influence in the country and the school systems ever since .
What we want to do it take it back , in every area of influence and this is , well , occupy until Jesus comes , to take dominion in every area .
Allow me to also point out that Porter regularly has Republican members on Congress on her radio program – in fact , right before she made this statement , she was interviewing Senator John Barrasso ( R - Wyoming ) about health care , and the day before , she had Senator Mike Johanns ( R - Nebraska ) on her program to discuss the same issue .
LIKE radicchio and other bitter , tough greens , escarole can survive the winter in many places and appear early in spring .
But unlike radicchio , escarole is inexpensive .
And it ’s more versatile : it tastes better cooked than does its round , red cousin .
In fact , escarole is at its most appealing when sautéed or braised , as the flavor becomes softer and even a bit buttery .
It ’s especially excellent with loads of garlic , and this traditional Italian soup  one of my go - to comfort recipes  is a prime example .
Though you might try other bitter vegetables here ( watercress , curly endive , even celery come to mind ) , you definitely want short - grain rice , the kind used for risotto  arborio being the most familiar , though any short - grain rice , including those from Asia , will work well .
All have a high starch content , so they turn creamy when they absorb liquid ( which , by the way , should be homemade chicken stock , if at all possible ) .
My second choice would be good vegetable or mushroom stock .
The soup takes a while to cook , so the rice has time to release its starch .
The finishing touch is four or five cloves of garlic , thinly sliced and cooked in olive oil until just golden and crisp .

Every October , New Mexico Tech ( located in Socorro , New Mexico ) puts on an alumni reunion called “ 49ers . ”
As a Tech alumnus myself , my part of 49ers usually involves playing bass at a three - night gig with our alumni bluegrass band , the Vigilantes , at local watering hole the Capitol Bar .
In 2009 , however , a little something new was added to my 49ers mix .
Alumna Kathy McGrade from California attended this year and requested in advance an opportunity to address other alumni on the topic of the causes of the collapse of the World Trade Center towers on September 11 , 2001 .
Soon , McGrade was asking that California architect Richard Gage be allowed to make the bulk of the proposed presentation , which was said to provide convincing evidence that controlled demolitions , not structural failures caused by burning jet fuel , toppled the towers .
Gage has produced a voluminous Web site , “ Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth ” , which calls for examination of “ the 3 WTC high - rise ‘ collapses , ’ ” and demands of Congress a “ truly independent investigation . ”
Having developed a reputation for my investigations of the Bible Code , the Roswell UFO incident , and other fringe beliefs , Tech officials asked me to present an opposing view at the upcoming event .
The debate was on .
I started reviewing numerous articles on Gage ’s Web site and scoured many other sources for more information .
Soon , a picture emerged of a massive pseudoscientific movement based on faulty physics , cherry - picked data , and demonization of opponents as complicit in the “ conspiracy . ”
I ’d long been dubious of 9/11 “ controlled demolition ” claims , and my perusal of Gage ’s site left me even more skeptical of “ Truth Movement ” arguments .
On October 24 , about thirty people assembled in the student union building for the debate .
Before things got started , Gage asked for a show of hands on these three questions : “ Believe fires brought down buildings ” ( seventeen raised their hands ) , “ Unsure ” ( eight ) , and “ Believe in explosive controlled demolition ” ( six ) .
Then , alumna McGrade made a short presentation that mentioned only things agreed upon by both points of view , such as the width of the Towers , timing between the jet impacts and the collapses , and so forth .
Gage followed with his thirty - minute presentation , which focused primarily on World Trade Center building 7 ( WTC 7 ) , which collapsed at approximately 5:20
pm on the afternoon of September 11 .
Gage argued that there are ten reasons WTC 7 , which was not hit by an airplane , was intentionally demolished :
Rapid onset of ‘ collapse ’ Sounds of explosions at ground floor — a full second prior to collapse Symmetrical ‘ collapse ’ — through the path of greatest resistance — at free - fall acceleration Imploded , collapsing completely , and landed mostly in its own footprint Massive volume of expanding pyroclastic dust clouds Several tons of molten metal reported by numerous highly - qualified witnesses Chemical signature of Thermite ( high tech incendiary ) found in solidified molten metal , and dust samples by physics professor Steven Jones , PhD FEMA finds rapid oxidation and intergranular melting on structural steel samples Expert corroboration from the top European Controlled Demolition professional Foreknowledge of ‘ collapse ’ by media , NYPD , and FDNY
After Gage ’s presentation , he asked for another show of hands .
This time , the results were : “ Fires brought down buildings ” ( seven hands ) , “ Unsure ” ( twelve ) , and “ Explosive controlled demolition ” ( nine ) .
Then I spoke for about half an hour .
I began by giving a Big Picture of the differences between science and pseudoscience with several examples that I ’ve studied ( Bible Codes , UFO conspiracies , Chemtrails , etc. ) .
None of the 9/11 “ Truth ” claims really hold up under scrutiny .
For example , regarding the Twin Towers ’ collapse “ through the path of greatest resistance — at free - fall acceleration , ” Gage often uses a demonstration using three cardboard boxes to make his point .
He holds two small boxes in either hand , representing the topmost floors of either Twin Tower .
He then drops both boxes ; one is dropped on top of a thirty - inch - high strong cardboard box that represents the base of the towers ( below where the planes struck ) , and the other is dropped onto empty air , whence it falls the thirty inches to the table top .
In his online videos with this demonstration , Gage announces that “ The one that had no resistance under it falls at freefall speed … .
The one that has 80,000 tons of structural steel on it
— it does n’t even give .
It resists .
As met by an equal and opposite reaction known as the conservation of momentum .
It does n’t fall . ”
Gage then cites the supposed “ freefall ” speed as evidence that the towers were demolished with explosives .
I mentioned this demonstration , citing it as an excellent example of pseudoscience .
What ’s actually relevant here is load vs. structure : the fact that dynamic loads are not the same as static loads .
A plate can easily support the weight of a hammer carefully placed on it , but if the hammer is dropped on the plate , the dynamic load is more than it can bear , and it can crack .
Once the top floors of the towers fell even one floor ’s height , the horrifying “ piledriver ” collapse became inevitable .
I also showed simulations of why the towers fell , focusing on the interlocking structural components that reinforced the towers .
I showed how WTC 7 had been severely damaged by debris from Tower 1 and showed evidence ( routinely ignored by “ Truthers ” ) of the severe fires that burned for many hours in Tower 7 .
I discussed the claims that thermite was used and showed a test filmed at Tech in which a large quantity of thermite failed to cut a large steel beam .
A twenty - minute question and answer period followed my talk .
As the meeting was adjourned and everyone was poised to leave , I asked for one more show of hands .
This time , the results were almost the same as when the afternoon began : “ Fires brought down buildings ” ( sixteen hands ) , “ Unsure ” ( eight ) , and “ Explosive controlled demolition ” ( six ) .
A few days after the talks , Gage posted only the first two votes on his Web site , misreporting the second vote severely ( making his 56 – 44 percent margin of victory into an 86 – 14 percent landslide ) .
After I protested , Gage corrected his numbers and even included the third vote , while dismissing it as “ useless ” because of the brevity of the presentations and the fact that some audience members arrived late .
Gage wants to debate me again , on Denver public television station KBDI .
While I normally prefer not to provide platforms for conspiracy theorists to push their cases , in this instance KBDI has already been running Gage ’s 9/11 “ Truth ” documentaries during fundraising specials .
No counter - programming has been offered during these showings ( the NOVA episode on why the towers fell would have been an excellent antidote ) .
Negotiations for a debate in the spring of 2010 are underway .
Finally , I offer this caution for readers : do n’t smugly assume this conspiracy is confined to the lunatic fringe .
After years of polishing and refinement , 9/11 “ Truth ” efforts have persuaded many citizens , including some of my relatives and close friends , to consider the attacks of 9/11 an “ inside job . ”
Galactic redshift surveys show a regularity in the spacing of galaxies a quarter of the way to the time of the supposed big bang .
This is totally different from a big bang expectation which would have them closer together as they get closer to the time of the big bang .
How do galaxies collide if they are flying away from each other ?
Mature galaxies are found near the time of a supposed big bang that have not had enough time to develop .
There are also some great problems with the " singularity " of the big bang .
What happened before the big bang ??
The big bang theorists can't answer this question and just say it 's a meaningless question .
( They like to say it 's like asking " What 's north of the North Pole ? " -
Actually it 's not like asking that at all .
North is a direction ; time is a measure of change .
If there was no change before the big bang , then how could it have started ? )
If there was a big bang , the temperature of the background radiation would have had to be much higher in the past .
Yet there are observed cosmic ray particles , that are protons or nuclei of atoms that are traveling through space at speeds approaching the speed of light .
These particles can't plow through the background radiation field at these higher temperatures without interacting with the photons of such a high temperature background and being stopped .
But the highest energy cosmic rays are observed at energies beyond this theoretical cutoff energy .
The temperature of intergalactic space was predicted by Guillaume , Eddington , Regener , Nernst , Herzberg , Finlay - Freundlich and Max Born based on a universe in dynamical equilibrium without expansion .
They predicted the 2.7 degree K background temperature prior to and better than models based on the Big Bang .

See also their other paper : " Redshift revisited " ( Unfortunately , their second paper misses the greater number of collisions a longer wavelength photon has when the red shift is comprised of multiple Compton interactions . )
Pierre - Marie Robitaille shows problems with the big bang interpretation of the Cosmic Background Radiation maps in this " YouTube video . "
There are many other discrepancies in redshift observations that are much better explained by non-Doppler shifts .
Hubble , of course , did n't agree that the redshift was Doppler ( see his book " The Observational Approach to Cosmology " or Allan Sandage 's discussion of Hubble 's beliefs ) .
There were several difficulties with this interpretation that he pointed out .
Not the least of which is that if it were Doppler , then not only should each photon be stretched out by the Doppler effect , but also the distance between each photon .
Because the photon flux is reduced , this causes the object undergoing a Doppler redshift to appear less bright than a corresponding object undergoing a non-doppler redshift .
Hubble knew his observations were not in agreement with this brightness correction .
He also knew that a simpler , non-curved - space cosmology resulted from a non-Doppler interpretation , and he felt that simpler was better .
He did n't know what causes the photons to lose energy as they travel through space , but he felt that it is some " new principle of nature " that I think is the Compton effect .
I came across these letters of correspondence between Grote Reber and Edwin Hubble .
1939 Reber to Hubble
1939 Hubble to Reber
1942 Reber to Hubble
The 1942 letter describes Reber 's suggestion that the red shift would be due to the interaction of light with a medium of free electrons in intergalactic space along with a magnetic field .
Grote later came to the conclusion that the red shift was the Compton effect from light travelling through intergalactic free electrons in order to explain his southern sky observations at 144 meters and 500 meters wavelength .
See
his 1968 paper
This is the same conclusion that I independently made in conjunction with Dr. Brooks Sharp to explain quasar intrinsic red shifts and the solar red shift , published at about the same time as Reber 's above paper .
As big bang theorists attempt to solve the age problem by making the time to the big bang longer , they exacerbate the quasar problem .
Quasars become even farther away and intrinsically brighter .
Yet their temperature remains that of ordinary stars as exhibited by emission spectra of metallic ions that can only exist at a limited range of temperature .
They are known to be about stellar size since they vary in brightness on a scale of a few minutes to seconds .
How do they stay so bright at such a low temperature in such a small volume ?
They can't .
They must have an intrinsic non-Doppler redshift and be nearby to be explained .
If neutrinos have mass about 1 ten millionth the mass of the electron , their Compton Effect red shift would be 10 million times that of that of the electron .
The probability of a neutrino Compton Effect remains to be determined .
( Update 2017 ) JEAN - PIERRE VIGIER
Back in the days when I was working on the Skylab Astronomy and Space Physics experiments at Martin Marietta and teaching a course called " Anti-Gravity " at the Denver Free University ( not to be confused with Denver U. ) , I went to a lecture given by Jean - Pierre Vigier at Denver U. I spoke with J - P after the lecture and told him my ideas about the Compton Effect causing the cosmological red shift .
He was excited by the ideas and arranged for us to meet at DU to discuss this further .
We talked for the entire next afternoon .
I had published the article in Solar Physics with Brooks Sharp explaining the center to limb variation in solar red shift and quasar red shift in terms of the Compton Effect and also become friends with Grote Reber who explained his hecto-metric wavelength cosmic background brightness observations similarly as being caused by the Compton effect .
J -P had been selected to be Einstein 's assistant at Princeton , but the State Department would n't allow him to get a visa because J- P was a French Communist .
( Sorta the Bernie Sanders of his time imo . )
( Einstein could n't get a clearance because he was a pacifist . )
I think physics might have been different if J - P had been granted the visa .
J - P explained to me that he believed that photons had a tiny mass - like the neutrino is now thought to have .
He believed this explained the Einstein gedanken experiment for the principle of equivalence of inertial mass and gravitational mass and helped explain gravitational lensing .
He also believed this explained the photon and electron double slit experiment : the electromagnetic wave interference went through both slits and the photon or electron only went through the slit where the mass particle was .
It also explained the slowing of light in a transparent medium with reconstruction of the electromagnetic wavefront and Compton scattering without blurring .
Some of his ideas are summarized here
But the most exciting part of our discussion was that J - P believed the cosmological red shift was due to photon - photon interaction with the photon having a Compton effect exchange with mass of the second photon .
I was worried that this should cause as much blue shift as red shift .
I had explained to him my ideas about the Compton effect causing electron and other free particles to increase in mass from simultaneous collisions from all directions causing the velocity vectors to cancel and the energy to convert to mass from E=mc^2 .
( See Part 5 of my YouTube video below . )
He said a similar thing would happen to the photon mass and only a red shift would result .
We believed the mass of the electron and photon could increase until it reached a stable mass ( e.g. the mass of a neutron plus original mass of the electron or photon as the case might be . )
Then new massive particles would be created .
These could be the source of cosmic ray particles or even " dark matter " .
Photon - photon interactions are now being observed !
I am coming around to Vigier 's ideas .
It really helps explain how a Compton effect red shift would not result in scattering of the EM wave in the far field while allowing the Compton effect to occur and produce a red shift in the near field .
An interesting effect of the Compton effect causing the cosmological red-shift and the consequent target electrons or anti-electrons getting heavier ( Or Jean - Pierre 's photon masses getting heavier ) is that explains why the universe is overwhelmingly full of ordinary mass rather than anti-particle mass .
When the Compton effect target mass has increased to the mass of the target mass plus a neutron , then a neutron is created .
This then would decay into a hydrogen atom ( proton plus electron ) .
This is true for both an increasing mass of an electron or a positron .
So the new mass is an increase in ordinary particles over anti-particles .
Both the increased mass of an electron or a positron ( or a photon ) would become ordinary hydrogen .
Hydrogen need not be created in a " big bang " as suggested here .
Update Jan 17 , 2020
Fred Hoyle almost got it right .
He originally suggested that light would convert to mass .
He had an explanation for a static stable universe , but unfortunately he did n't see that the conversion of the light caused the red shift .
His paper " A New Model for an Expanding Universe " is found here : https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/108/5/372/2601825
He later updated it with Tom Gold .
( Coincidently my granddaughter ( Courtney Young ) and Hoyle 's granddaughter are both PhD 's doing biomedical research at UCLA . )
EXPANDING EARTH
In the late 1980s I had some correspondence with S. Warren Carey .
He sent me the manuscript of his book Theories of the Earth and Universe .
He asked me to comment on it , so I made some minor typographical and grammatical re-wordings which he accepted .
The earth 's continents fit together , like puzzle pieces , on a smaller diameter globe .
His book makes a very good case for the idea that the earth has been expanding .
The major comment I gave him was to suggest that the Compton effect caused mass to be being created where the mass already is by the mechanism I gave in the video and discussed with Vigier .
This would be the cause of the creation of mass , in agreement with the conservation of energy and momentum , at the center of the earth .
Unfortunately , while Carey agreed that mass was being created where the mass already was , he chose to follow the cosmology of Fred Hoyle and Tom Gold : the steady state universe with the cosmological red shift being Doppler and mass being created by an unknown mechanism to keep the density of an expanding universe constant .
I gave a poster paper at an AGU meeting in San Francisco , ( near where Carey had been a Stanford visiting Professor ) , with my mechanism for the expanding earth .
The main objection I got from Pangea geologists was , " Where does the water in the oceans come from ? "
Apparently comets and volcanoes and ice age melt does n't satisfy them .
The late Paul Marmet has presented ideas very similar to the idea that the Compton effect causes the red shift and presents additional evidence against the big bang at his web site .
( I introduced Grote Reber to Paul Marmet .
Marmet worked to help Reber attempt to convert an old radar to a hecto-metric radio astronomy antenna .
They wanted to map the Northern sky from Canada , but the radar was in far too much disrepair to be ready for the next solar minimum viewing opportunity . )
Hellboy 's del Toro , Shutter Island 's Kalogridis brought manga to Cameron 's attention
Producer Jon Landau told the MTV Splash Page website that director James Cameron is planning his film adaptation of Yukito Kishiro 's Battle Angel Alita ( GUNNM ) manga after the sequel to the # 1 all - time blockbuster , Avatar .
He also noted that it was another auteur director , Guillermo del Toro ( Hellboy , Pan's Labyrinth , The Hobbit ) , who actually brought the manga to Cameron and Landau 's attention .
Landau explained how screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis ( Shutter Island , Ghost in the Shell ) expanded Cameron and Landau 's awareness of the manga after she was brought onboard the project .
Cameron and Landau were already familiar with one of the manga volumes and the anime adaptation , but Kalogridis " opened us up to the other nine books that exist , and how rich that world is . ”
As a result , Cameron decided to make Avatar first .
Landau added , “ We really wanted to take our time in developing a large arc-ing story that really encompasses the whole world [ of Battle Angel Alita ] .
We were very close to doing that movie before we did Avatar , and I think you 'll see that resurface .
That 's a story in our minds about :
What does it mean to be human ?
What does it mean to fall in love ?
Are you human if you have a heart ?
Are you human if you have a mind ?
Or are you human if you just have a body ?
It 's a journey of self - discovery for a young girl . ”
[ 5/20 Update : Fox canned this show a couple weeks ago ( before it became a series ) . ]
( Los Angeles , CA ) – In 1983 , Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas starred in a comedy film called Strange Brew , focused around the fictitious Elsinore Brewery in Canada . 27 years later , Fox Broadcasting Co. has lined up a pilot for a small brewery - centered sitcom of the same name .
The Hollywood Reporter , the Beernews.org equivalent of the hollywood world , broke the news in late January .
“ Strange Brew ” is about a small but successful family - owned brewery and the family ’s struggles with working and living together .
The announcement was met with mixed reactions in the beer community .
Brewers Association Director , Paul Gatza , was the most outspoken about his concerns for the concept :
“ I guess if they are going to get many aspects of technical brewing wrong and misrepresent the industry , I hope they are really funny in doing it .
Each week a different malfunction to overcome .
Please let the brewer wear rubber boots . ”
“ Will and Grace ” creators , David Kohan and Mitch Mutchnik , are behind the new “ Strange Brew . ” “ Will and Grace ” was nominated for 27 Golden Globes and won 51 awards per IMDB so these guys know how to run a television show . . . but what do they know about small breweries ?
That remains to be seen .
One interesting note is that the writers are working with Warner Brothers on this project .
Warner Brothers happens to be partnered with Beer Wars as well .
This is most likely a coincidence but maybe one of the execs is a diehard craft beer lover .
THR reports that Marc Buckland will be sitting in the director ’s chair for the pilot .
Buckland won an Emmy for directing “ My Name is Earl ” and was nominated for another for “ Scrubs . ”
Laurie Metcalf , a.k.a.
Jackie from “ Roseanne , ” will be starring as the mother of the family .
‘ Memba her ?
She won a few Emmy ’s for her role on the show .
Here is the official description for her character , Janie , per Entertainment Weekly :
“ In her 40s , Ted ’s attractive and high strung wife , mother to Clay , Kyle , Lizzy and Michael , she ’s newly sober , and being newly sober at a brewery with a family of brewery workers is not a happy or easy thing .
She ’s also trying to stop swearing , and it ’s a toss up which vice is more difficult to shed .
Though dealing with her own issues , she is still a source of strength to her husband and family . ”
THR also reports that Jere Burns will be starring opposite of Metcalf as the father and President of the brewery with Aya Cash , Skylar Astin and Mo Mandel cast as the children .
The actors , none of which I am familiar with , all appear to be in their early - mid 20s so do n’t expect this to be another “ Home Improvement . ”
Here is a description of their roles from The Futon Critic :
“ He ’ll play Ted , the patriarch of the Forrest clan , who was ‘ once a weathered ourdoorsmen [ however ] the last 10 years has turned him into a withered indoorsmen . ’ [ … ]
Cash will play ‘ beautiful , highly - intelligent , highly - underachieving ’
Lizzy , the eldest sibling who works as Ted ’s secretary .
Astin and Mandel then are believed to be playing fraternal twins Kyle , ‘ the alpha twin , ’ and Clay , ‘ the sweeter , gentler one . ' ”
So who is going to be the Head Brewer ?
Remember that the project is still in the pilot stage so it may not even bloom into an actual television series but there is certainly enough star - power behind this for it to be a contender .
Shooting will begin soon .

( CNN ) -- Icelandic authorities evacuated about 800 people early Wednesday when a volcano erupted beneath the Eyjafjallajokull glacier , an emergency spokesman said .
The first evacuations began at 2 a.m. ( 10 p.m. ET Tuesday ) , according to Rognvaldur Olafsson , chief inspector at Iceland 's Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management .
He said everyone in the area was safe .
" We have located the fissure that is erupting under the glacier , " Olafsson told CNN .
He said scientists are currently doing aerial reconnaissance of the area and that officials would know more when they return .
So far , he said , the eruption has created a large hole in the glacier .
Lava is not a big concern but flooding is , he said .
i Report : Are you there ?
Send your images , videos
" The volcano is under the glacier , and it 's melting parts of the glacier , " Olafsson said .
" The rivers will rise and potentially make some damage . "
i Reporter captures footage of eruption
Rivers closest to the glacier have already started rising , he added .
The glacier is the sixth - biggest in Iceland , just to the west of the bigger glacier , Myrdalsjokull .
It is about 100 miles ( 160 km ) east of the capital , Reykjavik .
A map from the Icelandic Meteorological Office showed seismic activity of between 1 and 2 magnitude in the area around the glacier Wednesday morning .
THE Federal government will scrap its controversial new rules on foreign investment in real estate , and instead tighten both the rules and their enforcement to head off a damaging political storm .
In a stunning about - face , Assistant Treasurer Nick Sherry has announced that temporary residents will now have to seek approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board ( FIRB ) to buy any real estate in Australia .
Temporary residents will also be required to sell their Australian property when they leave Australia .
And for the first time , the FIRB will be given the means to ensure that the laws are enforced .
In a surprising move , the crackdown will also target vendors and real estate agents .
Senator Sherry said they would face civil penalties if they were involved in transactions that breached the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act .
His spokesman could not explain how vendors and real estate agents are expected to know the immigration status of buyers .
The move comes barely three weeks after Senator Sherry denied that foreign investors were a factor in the Australian real estate market .
ltrace (1 ) - Linux man page
Name
Synopsis
Description
ltrace - A library call traceris a program that simply runs the specifieduntil it exits .
It intercepts and records the dynamic library calls which are called by the executed process and the signals which are received by that process .
It can also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program .
Its use is very similar to strace ( 1 ) .
Options
-a , -- align column Align return values in a specific column ( default column is 5/8 of screen width ) .
-c
Count time and calls for each library call and report a summary on program exit .
-C , -- demangle Decode ( demangle ) low - level symbol names into user - level names .
Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system , this makes C++ function names readable .
-d , -- debug Increase the debugging level .
Use more ( ie. - dd ) for greater debugging information .
--dl
When a dlopened library is mapped in the process address space , put breakpoints to all symbols in the dynamic symbol table of that library .
-e expr A qualifying expression which modifies which events to trace .
The format of the expression is :
[!] value1 [ , value2 ] ...
where the values are the functions to trace .
Using an exclamation mark negates the set of values .
For example -e printf means to trace only the printf library call .
By contrast , -e ! printf means to trace every library call except printf .
Note that some shells use the exclamation point for history expansion ; even inside quoted arguments .
If so , you must escape the exclamation point with a backslash .
-f
Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced processes as a result of the fork ( 2 ) or clone ( 2 ) system calls .
The new process is attached as soon as its pid is known .
-h , -- help
Show a summary of the options to ltrace and exit .
-i
Print the instruction pointer at the time of the library call .
-l , -- library filename Display only the symbols included in the library filename .
Up to 20 library names can be specified with several instances of this option .
-L DON'T display library calls ( use it with the - S option ) .
-n , -- indent nr Indent trace output by nr number of spaces for each new nested call .
Using this option makes the program flow visualization easy to follow .
-o , -- output filename
Write the trace output to the file filename rather than to stderr .
-p pid Attach to the process with the process ID pid and begin tracing .
-r Print a relative timestamp with each line of the trace .
This records the time difference between the beginning of successive lines .
-s strsize Specify the maximum string size to print ( the default is 32 ) .
- S
Display system calls as well as library calls -t Prefix each line of the trace with the time of day .
- tt
If given twice , the time printed will include the microseconds .
- ttt If given thrice , the time printed will include the microseconds and the leading portion will be printed as the number of seconds since the epoch .
- T
Show the time spent inside each call .
This records the time difference between the beginning and the end of each call .
-u username Run command with the userid , groupid and supplementary groups of username .
This option is only useful when running as root and enables the correct execution of setuid and / or setgid binaries .
-X extern Some architectures need to know where to set a breakpoint that will be hit after the dynamic linker has run .
If this flag is used , then the breakpoint is set at extern , which must be an external function .
By default , ' _start ' is used .
NOTE : this flag is only available on the architectures that need it .
-x extern Trace the external function extern .
This option may be repeated .
-V , --version
Show the version number of ltrace and exit .
Bugs
It has most of the bugs stated in
Manual page and documentation are not very up - to - date .
Option -f sometimes fails to trace some children .
It only works on Linux and in a small subset of architectures .
If you like to report a bug , send a notice to the author , or use the reportbug ( 1 ) program if you are under the Debian GNU / Linux distribution .

A dog in the US caused his owners a panic after swallowing a diamond worth $ 20,000 in a jewellery shop .
A diamond dealer had brought the precious stone to the store but dropped it and Soli the golden retriever wolfed it down .
Owners George Kaufmann and Robert Rosin had to wait for nature to take its course before returning the diamond to the dealer .
Jenny Wivell reports .
A
has caught fire on the Internet through the social - networking site Facebook is now the target of a $ 750,000 lawsuit by the company .
The
has gained more than 4,200 members since Justin Kurtz launched it in February after his car was towed from the apartment complex where he lives .
T & J Towing last week sued Kurtz seeking $ 750,000 in damages and requesting a court order that he “ immediately cease and desist any further libelous and slanderous written claims ” about the company .
The suit filed on behalf of T & J Towing President Joseph Bird says the company has lost numerous business accounts since Kurtz launched the Facebook group .
“ I ’m not losing sleep about it , ” Kurtz said Tuesday .
The WMU aviation student from Yorkville , N.Y. , said he decided to start the Facebook group during the first week of February , just a few days after his Saturn SL2 was towed from a parking spot at The Arboretum apartment complex west of campus .
He claims his car was legally parked and that he had his complex - issued parking sticker displayed , but that the sticker was missing and the front end of his car was damaged when he reclaimed the vehicle from T & J Towing for a $ 118 fee .
Kurtz says on his Facebook group that he believes his car was broken into and his parking sticker removed so that his car , locked and guarded by an alarm , could be towed , assertions he reiterated Tuesday to the Kalamazoo Gazette .
Numerous messages posted on Kurtz ’s Facebook group allege others ’ vehicles were legally parked when they were towed by T & J , including some who also say their parking stickers had been removed from their windows .
In the two - page complaint filed April 5 in Kalamazoo County Circuit Court , the company alleges Kurtz is using the Facebook group in a “ crusade to post verbal and written claims ... with allegations that are untrue and / or dishonest and without merit ” and that a “ continual onslaught of libelous and slanderous claims ” has caused the towing company to lose business .
A woman who answered a call to T & J Towing Tuesday said that the company was directing questions to its attorney , Richard K. Burnham , of Paw Paw .
The Kalamazoo Gazette was unable to reach Burnham for comment .
The Better Business Bureau of Western Michigan , meanwhile , has given T & J Towing an overall rating of “ F . ”
A bureau report on the company shows a pattern of “ complaints in which consumers allege the company towed vehicles in error when either the vehicle had the required parking pass , or the vehicle was not parked in a designated no parking area . ”
“ In addition , ” the report says , “ there is also a pattern of complaints alleging that the company only accepts cash as a payment method , but refuses to provide change if the consumer does not have the exact amount . ”
T & J Towing has failed to respond to 17 of 20 complaints filed against it over the last three years , according to the bureau .
“ The grade says it all , ” Ken Vander Meede , president of the Better Business Bureau of Western Michigan , said of T & J Towing .
“ I do n’t do business with ‘ F ’ businesses and we encourage people not to do business with ‘ F ’ businesses .
This is a company that has had a number of inquiries and a number of complaints and their record stands on its own . ”
Kurtz said he planned to speak with an attorney today , but that he is n’t worried by the lawsuit and has no plans to take down his Facebook group .
He ’s watching , in the meantime , as the number of members in the group continues to grow .
It jumped by 800 between Monday and Tuesday afternoon after news of the T & J lawsuit spread .

Gist , Plaxo and Xobni all aim to cut through the social media cloud and pull together a comprehensive digital address book .
Although each tool has its pluses , none has a magic formula making it the must - have contact manager organiser .
Gist filters your in - boxes putting incoming messages in a single place .
Its strong point is sorting things in order of importance .
It works with email , Twitter , Linkedin and Facebook .
Gist does n’t always get this right , but it ’s an improvement on the usual overloaded in - box .
Gist is free at the time of writing .
Plaxo does a reasonable job of syncing to contact management applications .
It can also pull in some of your social networking messages .
Plaxo is free , but you need to buy the premium service to sync with Microsoft Outlook and mobile phones .
My Plaxo account is full of duplicate entries – annoyingly you can only merge these if you pay for the premium version .
Xobni looks good , but it ’s an Outlook add - on and does n’t replace the contact manager .
It provides better index cards and links entries so you can quickly find a contact ’s colleagues .
Google ’s contact management tool – part of Gmail – is second - rate .
It provides little information and adds no value .
Of the three tools looked at here , I recommend Gist as a way to cut through the noise .
But for now , Outlook remains the smartest contact manager .

In 2009 , Green Day confirmed ( twice ) that there would be a stand - alone Rock Band game devoted to their music .
After some confusion , it was confirmed in February of this year that the title would be distributed by EA sometime in 2010 .
It was , apparently , not all downhill after Dookie .
That release window has now been further narrowed , as EA and MTV Games today confirmed that the title would be launching across the globe on June 8 , 2010 , on the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 and Wii .
In the United States , the standard editions will retail for $ 59.99 on the Xbox 360 and PS3 and for $ 49.00 on the Wii .
A premium edition will also be available exclusively for PS3 and Xbox 360 owners in the US and Canada and will retail for $ 69.99 in the former territory .
The premium edition will feature six bundled Green Day downloadable content tracks , special packaging , and a voucher allowing for free export of all the game 's songs to Rock Band 1 , 2 , or 3 .
Pricing for other regions was not announced , while EA confirmed that exporting the songs from the standard edition of the game would cost $ 9.99 .
Those DLC tracks -- which are already on the Rock Band store -- will be jazzed up for use in Green Day : Rock Band to fit in with the game 's visual style .
The game will feature 47 tracks from across the San Francisco punk - pop outfit 's career , as well as the playable likenesses of the band 's three current members Billie Joe Armstrong , Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool .
The game will also make use of the vocal harmony feature that debuted in The Beatles : Rock Band .
Additionally , Green Day : Rock Band will feature 100 images to unlock throughout the course of the game as it runs through Green Day 's history , as well as 40 minutes of " rare and unreleased video . "
Unlike the recently released Beatles : Rock Band , no instruments are planned for this iteration of the franchise .
The Port of Los Angeles has put into service the world 's first all - electric port truck , a behemoth capable of hauling 60,000 lbs. of freight .
That 's just over 22 Teslas , or a 40 - foot shipping container full of televisions from Korea or furniture from China .
Built locally in Harbor City , CA , the Balqon XE20 has a 50 mile range , a 6 - 8 hour standard full charge and a one - hour quick charge that brings the lithium - ion batteries up to 60 % of capacity .
Those specs are ideal for a truck that makes lots of short trips during a two - shift workday and sits idle for long stretches at night .
The trucks are part of the historically smoggy Port of Los Angeles ' efforts to clean up its act and comply with California 's strict air quality regulations .
Where diesels used to idle , a bevy of locally - built electric vehicles now haul trailers .
The XE20 is the latest from Balqon Corportation , joining the on - road XE30 that debuted last year .
Though most people will never see a port truck , their impact on the environment is unmistakable .
At the Port of LA alone , trucks made 1.2 million trips between ships and a local railyard , according to Arley Baker , the Port 's director of communications .
If electric vehicles had made those trips , the Port estimated , it would have eliminated 35,606 tons of tailpipe emissions .
Other ports have taken note of L.A. 's electric trucks : Baker said around 40 drivers and terminal managers showed up at the XE20 's debut last week .
That 's good news for the Port of L.A. , who gets a royalty for every Balqon truck sold .

Russia reacted with horror today over the heartbreaking story of a seven - year - old Siberian boy adopted by an American family who was sent back to Moscow alone - because his U.S. mother did n't want him any more .
Little Artem Saveliev was last year taken from a grim orphanage and given a new life in Tennessee last year .
But his adoptive mother Torry - Ann Hansen , a 34 - year - old nurse , yesterday put him on a ten - hour flight as an unaccompanied minor with a note ' to whom it may concern ' saying : ' I no longer wish to parent this child ' .
In his rucksack , she had placed sweets , biscuits and colouring pens for the journey .
Instead , she and a grandmother that he was going on an ' excursion ' to Moscow .
In the typed note , which the blond boy was clutching when Moscow police picked him up , she said she wanted the adoption annulled .
The Russians angrily denied this , saying he was stubborn but that his only disability was that he was ' flat - footed ' .
Officials said they have never witnessed such cruelty to a child after promising a ' new life ' .
Unwanted Artem , eight next week , looked confused and bewildered as he was taken into care by Moscow social services .
The Kremlin 's children 's rights commissioner Pavel Astakhov lambasted the Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying the ministry would recommend that the U.S. and Russia hammer out an agreement before any new adoptions are allowed .
'We have taken the decision ... to suggest a freeze on any adoptions to American families until Russia and the USA sign an international agreement ' on the conditions for adoptions and the obligations of host families , Lavrov was quoted as saying .
He also said he was ' indignant ' at the way the child was treated ' as a parcel ' .
Lavrov said the Russian officials also refused the U.S. consul access to the child saying : ' If his American parent kicked out him from the country on a plane like a sack of potatoes , then we will look after the boy .
' Our care system will take up the case .
After a full medical examination , he will be placed into one of our orphanages .
' Ashtakhov questioned howNormally , stringent checks are applied on minors travelling without parents .
It appears the child was also alone when he flew from Tennessee to Washington before boarding the flight to Moscow .
'
The adoptive mother broke all the rules and procedures by sending an adopted child back , ' he said .
Ashtakhov , who said he played with the child and talked to him , said the mother had another son called Logan .
'
Artem said he made good friends with Logan , ' he said .
' He was talking quite calmly about the family , but In a shocking typed letter she gave to her seven - year - old ' son ' to take with him to Moscow , she revealed how she adopted the boy in September 2009 .
She claimed he is ' mentally unstable ' and that his problems were hidden from her by Russian orphanage officials before she adopted him .
'
He is violent and has severe psychopathic issues / behaviour .
I was lied to and misled by the Russian orphanage workers and director regarding his mental stability , ' she wrote .
'They chose to grossly misrepresent those problems in order to get him out of their orphanage . '
The letter - addressed ' to whom it may concern ' at the Russian Ministry of Education in Moscow - said : ' After giving my best to this child I am sorry to say that for the sake of my family , friends and myself , I no longer wish to parent this child .
'As he is a Russian national , I am returning him to your guardianship and would like the adoption disannulled .
'Adoption officials in Partizansk , near Vladivostok were stunned , saying that the U.S. woman had made a good impression on them when she went through adoption procedures last year .
She spent four full days with Artem watched by adoption workers before she was allowed to become his mother .
'
It was clear that there was mutual affection , and it was good , ' said Vera Kuznetsova , chief adoption officer in the region .
'She seemed a nice , kind woman .
Artem immediately reached out to her .
She even learned a few Russian words to communicate with her future son , ' said one official .
Recent follow - up reports from America on the boy did not detect any strains in the family , it is claimed .
Russian officals deny Hansen 's claims about Artem having severe behavioral problems and being mentally unstable .
' We are shocked by how the American family has treated our child .
Artem grew up as a completely normal , relatively advanced child for his age , and healthy .
Does she count being flatfooted as a disability ?
' No other medical abnormalities were found .
American psychotherapist Joe Soll told Russian media that the boy 's rejection from his adopted family would have a serious impact .
' When you remove a child from a family , no matter what the circumstances are , it 's a trauma , ' he said .
' We do n't look at children who have been adopted as tramuatised , but they are .
I do n't think people are educated at all to understand what adoption is really about .
'The child 's real mother Ekaterina was deprived of her parental rights because she was an alcoholic , officials said yesterday .
She gave birth to the child at 19 and cared for him until he was six .
He was adopted by Hansen on 18 September 2009 in Russia and eleven days later she formally changed his name to Artem Justin Hansen .
Astakhov said
The boy spoke of a grandmother who shouted at him .
' Artem is a very nice kid .
We drew pictures together and had nice chat , ' said Astakhov .
Officials say they want action against the mother for child abuse .
The Moscow media angrily denounced the ' cruelty ' inflicted on the seven - year - old .
In one case , a two - year - old boy died after his American father left him alone in a car in 30 C temperatures .
The cases led to a public outcry and new curbs on adoption .
The case was highlighted on a day when U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev signed an historic nuclear arm reduction treaty in Prague .
Bank of Scotland / Halifax shook up the Irish mortgage market in 1999 but is now trying to exit it
ONE of the biggest mortgage lenders in the country is offering its customers € 1,000 to switch their home loans to other banks or building societies .
The unprecedented cash offer by Bank of Scotland / Halifax is a desperate bid to offload its loss - making tracker mortgages .
And the Irish Independent has learned the move is set to be followed by other lenders offering even larger financial incentives to tempt mortgage holders to give up their valuable trackers .
However , financial experts and consumer watchdogs last night urged customers not to be tempted by the cash offer .
It is estimated more than 400,000 homeowners currently have trackers , which can only rise when the European Central Bank ( ECB ) rate rises .
Trackers are the only mortgage types that are not rising at the moment .
Shake -up
Bank of Scotland ( Ireland ) shook up the domestic mortgage market in 1999 when it broke up the cosy cartel operating between Irish banks , resulting in dramatically cheaper rates for customers .
But the troubled lender is now offering customers a cash incentive to quit the bank as it seeks to withdraw from the scandal - hit Irish banking market .
The bank , and its Halifax retailing banking division , is thought to be losing money on its mortgages as the vast majority of them are trackers .
The Scottish bank was the first to introduce low - cost trackers to this market , prompting all other lenders to follow its lead .
Halifax and Bank of Scotland ( Ireland ) wrote to all its mortgage customers telling them it was closing its operations in this country on June 18 next .
The move is expected to be followed by other lenders desperate to convince customers to abandon their valuable tracker mortgages , which have escaped the spate of recent interest hikes .
The letter -- seen by the Irish Independent -- added : " If you wish to switch your mortgage from Bank of Scotland ( Ireland ) in order to avail of a top - up or further advance facility with another service provider , we will contribute € 1,000 towards the cost of your legal fees , and € 150 towards the cost of your valuation fee , to help enable you to switch . "
Tracker mortgages are based on a commitment by lenders to only increase rates when the ECB moves its rates .
However , head of Compliance Ireland , Peter Oakes , warned lenders ' lawyers were looking to see if they could find ways to change the terms of tracker deals .
Some tracker contracts have clauses allowing the rate charge to track the Euribor , or wholesale bank lending rate , instead of the ECB rate .
Warned
Financial advisers last night warned customers who have a tracker mortgage with Bank of Scotland / Halifax not to accept the offer .
And many of its customers are already in negative equity and could not make the switch , even if they wanted to .
Karl Deeter of Irish Mortgage Brokers predicted the move would prompt other lenders to seek to buy mortgage holders out of their tracker mortgages .
Some people have tracker mortgage rates as low as 1.5 pc as their tracker is set at 0.5 pc above the ECB rate , which means banks are losing money on them at a time when the cost of wholesale money has shot up .
" Others will now start to offer bigger and bigger inducements to get you off your tracker because lenders are losing money on trackers , " Mr Deeter added .
" Lenders will go further and knock several thousands off your mortgage if you clear it . "
A spokesman for the bank denied its move to introduce trackers here in 2001 started a spiral of reckless lending .
" I would not say it was reckless lending .
It was good for consumers , " he told the Irish Independent .
The spokesman insisted that most of the bank 's mortgage holders were on trackers , but denied it was paying borrowers to go away .
Consumer watchdogs last night urged customers to stick with their tracker mortgages .
" If a bank is paying you money there must be something in it for the bank -- do n't be tempted , " Consumers ' Association of Ireland chief executive Dermott Jewell said .

The entire family of devices built on the iPhone OS ( iPhone , iPod Touch , iPad ) have been designed to run only software that is approved by Apple — a major shift from the norms of the personal computer market .
Software developers who want Apple 's approval must first agree to the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement .
So today we 're posting the " iPhone Developer Program License Agreement " — the contract that every developer who writes software for the iTunes App Store must " sign . "
Though more than 100,000 app developers have clicked " I agree , " public copies of the agreement are scarce , perhaps thanks to the prohibition on making any " public statements regarding this Agreement , its terms and conditions , or the relationship of the parties without Apple 's express prior written approval . "
But when we saw the NASA App for iPhone , we used the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) to ask NASA for a copy , so that the general public could see what rules controlled the technology they could use with their phones .
NASA responded with the Rev. 3-17-09 version of the agreement .
UPDATED : we are now also posting the most recent version of the agreement , dated January 2010 .
This " license agreement " is particularly relevant right now , given the imminent launch of the iPad and anytime - now issuance of the U.S. Copyright Office 's ruling regarding jailbreaking of the iPhone .
So what 's in the Agreement ?
Here are a few troubling highlights :
Ban on Public Statements :
As mentioned above , Section 10.4 prohibits developers , including government agencies such as NASA , from making any " public statements " about the terms of the Agreement .
This is particularly strange , since the Agreement itself is not " Apple Confidential Information " as defined in Section 10.1 .
So the terms are not confidential , but developers are contractually forbidden from speaking " publicly " about them .
App Store Only : Section 7.2 makes it clear that any applications developed using Apple 's SDK may only be publicly distributed through the App Store , and that Apple can reject an app for any reason , even if it meets all the formal requirements disclosed by Apple .
So if you use the SDK and your app is rejected by Apple , you 're prohibited from distributing it through competing app stores like Cydia or Rock Your Phone .
Ban on Reverse Engineering : Section 2.6 prohibits any reverse engineering ( including the kinds of reverse engineering for interoperability that courts have recognized as a fair use under copyright law ) , as well as anything that would " enable others " to reverse engineer , the SDK or iPhone OS .
No Tinkering with Any Apple Products : Section 3.2(e ) is the " ban on jailbreaking " provision that received some attention when it was introduced last year .
Surprisingly , however , it appears to prohibit developers from tinkering with any Apple software or technology , not just the iPhone , or " enabling others to do so . "
For example , this could mean that iPhone app developers are forbidden from making iPods interoperate with open source software , for example .
You will not , through use of the Apple Software , services or otherwise create any Application or other program that would disable , hack , or otherwise interfere with the Security Solution , or any security , digital signing , digital rights management , verification or authentication mechanisms implemented in or by the iPhone operating system software , iPod Touch operating system software , this Apple Software , any services or other Apple software or technology , or enable others to do so
Kill Your App Any Time : Section 8 makes it clear that Apple can " revoke the digital certificate of any of Your Applications at any time . "
Steve Jobs has confirmed that Apple can remotely disable apps , even after they have been installed by users .
This contract provision would appear to allow that .
We Never Owe You More than Fifty Bucks : Section 14 states that , no matter what , Apple will never be liable to any developer for more than $ 50 in damages .
That 's pretty remarkable , considering that Apple holds a developer 's reputational and commercial value in its hands — it 's not as though the developer can reach its existing customers anywhere else .
So if Apple botches an update , accidentally kills your app , or leaks your entire customer list to a competitor , the Agreement tries to cap you at the cost of a nice dinner for one in Cupertino .
Overall , the Agreement is a very one - sided contract , favoring Apple at every turn .
That 's not unusual where end - user license agreements are concerned ( and not all the terms may ultimately be enforceable ) , but it 's a bit of a surprise as applied to the more than 100,000 developers for the iPhone , including many large public companies .
How can Apple get away with it ?
Because it is the sole gateway to the more than 40 million iPhones that have been sold .
In other words , it 's only because Apple still " owns " the customer , long after each iPhone ( and soon , iPad ) is sold , that it is able to push these contractual terms on the entire universe of software developers for the platform .
In short , no competition among app stores means no competition for the license terms that apply to iPhone developers .
If Apple 's mobile devices are the future of computing , you can expect that future to be one with more limits on innovation and competition ( or " generativity , " in the words of Prof. Jonathan Zittrain ) than the PC era that came before .
It 's frustrating to see Apple , the original pioneer in generative computing , putting shackles on the market it ( for now ) leads .
If Apple wants to be a real leader , it should be fostering innovation and competition , rather than acting as a jealous and arbitrary feudal lord .
Developers should demand better terms and customers who love their iPhones should back them .

Football used to be an easy game .
The big lads played at centre - half and centre - forward , the hard lads played at full - back , the bright lads played at inside forward , the hard lads who were a bit bright and the bright lads who were a bit hard played at wing - half , and the little , quick lads played on the wing .
Left - footers played on the left and right - footers played on the right .
And the one with no mates went in goal .
Eight decades on , and it's all rather more complicated , and not just because not all goalkeepers these days are entirely socially dysfunctional .
Wingers disappeared for a while , and became a luxury item , almost a museum piece , but now they 're back , all over the place , and the tendency is for them to play on the opposite flank .
There have always been a handful who did that .
Tom Finney , for instance , played as a right - footed left - wing in the greatest English forward line there has ever been – along with Stanley Matthews , Stan Mortensen , Tommy Lawton and Wilf Mannion – but that was only because Matthews was already installed in his preferred position .
Later , players such as Dennis Tueart , Chris Waddle , Marc Overmars and Robert Pires , operating on the opposite side through preference , were highly effective coming in on to their stronger foot .
But now these inside - out wingers are everywhere .
At Barcelona , Leo Messi is proving himself probably the greatest individual talent since Diego Maradona , cutting in from the right on to his stronger left foot .
Arjen Robben has resurrected Bayern Munich 's season doing much the same .
Cristiano Ronaldo is right - footed and plays on the right , but is so strong with his left that he too is constantly shifting inside , looking for shooting opportunities .
It 's the same in England .
Ashley Young is a right - footed left - winger .
Adam Johnson is left - footed but has made an impact at Manchester City on the right , while Craig Bellamy , a right - footer on the left , has arguably been their best player this season .
Niko Kranjcar plays on the left but drifts infield on to his right .
Damien Duff spent most of his career on the left but has prospered on the right for Fulham .
At Wigan , the left - footed Charles N'Zogbia is having a decent season on the right .
Steed Malbranque has been a revelation in recent weeks on the left for Sunderland .
At national level , Steven Gerrard has become the preferred choice on the left of the attacking midfield trident when Fabio Capello opts for 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 .
So why is the tactic so effective , and why has it suddenly become so widespread ?
The death of the traditional winger
Herbert Chapman , who foresaw most developments , was suspicious of the winger even before the 1925 change in the offside law prompted the shift away from 2 - 3 - 5 to W - M .
His Huddersfield team that won the FA Cup in 1922 and went on to lift three successive league titles featured two wingers in George Richardson and Billy Smith who eschewed the touchline - hugging stereotype .
Inside passing , Chapman argued , was " more deadly , if less spectacular " than the " senseless policy of running along the lines and centring just in front of the goalmouth , where the odds are nine to one on the defenders " .
Chapman 's Arsenal side that itself completed a hat - trick of championships was thoroughly modern in the sense of having wingers who regularly drifted infield , making the most of the long , accurate passing of the inside - forward Alex James .
Yet for all their success , the image of the winger , isolated , bandy - legged , sashaying his way past the full - back and crossing , remained to English eyes the creative ideal .
Perhaps the hurly - burly of English midfields , or the fact that from autumn onwards the only firm ground was to be found out wide , meant flair was necessarily pushed to the flanks .
Perhaps it was simply nostalgia .
In the year immediately following the World War Two , there was a great flowering of the English winger with Matthews , Finney , Len Shackleton , Bobby Langton , Jimmy Mullen , George Robb , Johnny Hancocks and Charlie Mitten .
The problem was that they emerged just as the collectivist football of the Communist bloc was demonstrating the outmodedness of the English focus on the individual .
Mikhail Yakushin , the manager of the 1945 Dinamo Moscow tourists , for instance , was scornful of Matthews .
" The principle of collective play is the guiding one in Soviet football , " he said .
" A player must not only be good in general ; he must be good for the particular team .
His individual qualities are high , but we put collective football first and individual football second , so we do not favour his style as we think teamwork would suffer . "
It took the 6 - 3 mauling at home to Hungary in 1953 to bring that message home – six months after what many saw as the apogee of wing - play , Matthews 's performance in the 1953 FA Cup final .
What really did for the old - school winger , though , was the shift from the three at the back of the W - M to a back four , a process which began in Hungary , the Soviet Union and Brazil in the 1950s and was universalised after Brazil 's successes in the 1958 and 1962 World Cups .
The back three of the W- M operated on a pivot ; the ideal for attacking teams was to switch play rapidly from one flank to the other , so " turning " the defence , and providing space for the winger so he could be travelling at speed by the time he reached the full - back .
Add an extra defender , and that acceleration room simply is n't there any more .
It was that realisation that led Alf Ramsey and Viktor Maslov to develop the 4 - 4 - 2 ( or , more accurately in both cases , the 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) in the mid-1960s .
As their ideas took hold , the winger became a wide midfielder , a shuttler , somebody who might be expected to cross a ball but was also meant to put in a defensive shift .
The lop - sided 4 - 3 - 3s of the 1970s could still accommodate something approximating to a winger , but by the 1980s they had become increasingly rare , evolved out of existence by the dominance of 4 - 4 - 2 and 3 - 5 - 2 – which Johan Cruyff described as " the death of football " precisely because it militated against wing - play .
The reinvention of the winger
As 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 and 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 came to vie with 4 - 4 - 2 , so the winger could be introduced .
Dribbling was a way of disrupting the predictability that 4 - 4 - 2 often seemed to engender , and the deployment of two holding midfielders provided the platform that enabled the incorporation of dribblers again .
Why , though , do so many prefer to turn infield rather than doing what wingers used to do , trying to get to the goal - line and sweep in a cross ?
With a lone centre - forward , of course , there is a need for the advanced midfielders to provide goals ( and conversely , it may be that many of the players now operating as wide forwards would in a previous age have been second strikers ) , particularly if that forward operates as a false nine , so that perhaps , to an extent , explains the modern directness .
But it also seems hard to explain the idea that the most lethal cross was a ball dragged back from the goal - line .
It can be dangerous of course , raising doubt in a goalkeeper 's mind as to whether he should come to claim or not , but there seems no reason why it should be more threatening than an inswinger delivered at pace ( I 'm not sure any stats exist to prove or disprove this , but if they do , please post a link ) .
In fact , intuitively , it would seem a ball whipped towards the far post that requires just a touch to divert it in or that will sneak in if nobody touches it is more dangerous .
It also feels as though that sort of goal has become more common over the past decade or so .
That may itself be a result of an increasing number of inside - out wingers , or it may be a result of the increased spin that can be imparted on modern balls , or even perhaps of the liberalisation of the offside law which forces teams to defend deeper – an inswinger curving into the far post is obviously more dangerous if players are running into it six yards out than 15 yards out , both in terms of angle and the time a goalkeeper would have to react to a touch .
There are other advantages to a wide player coming inside .
For one thing , given most full - backs still play on the traditional side , a winger taking him on on the inside is attacking his weaker foot .
For another , a wide player drifting infield is opening space for an overlapping full - back , of whom there are an increasing number .
The link - up of Pires and Ashley Cole at Arsenal was an early example of that ; more recent examples include Ivan Rakitic and Danijel Pranjic for Croatia , Gerrard and Cole for England and , most obviously , Messi and Dani Alves for Barcelona .
And then there is the issue of acceleration room .
A full - back pushed tight on a wide forward does not allow him to accelerate down the line , but by cutting inside on to his stronger foot , the forward opens up room on the diagonal .
It is that , for instance , that allowed Messi to score his first against Stuttgart last week .
It was rapidly obvious what he was going to do as he turned inside but the best efforts of four defenders could n't stop him because of the pace he was going at by the time he got within shooting range .
The two types of inside - out winger
Not that the wide forward has to use the room to dribble into .
Darren Bent 's second goal for Sunderland against Birmingham on Saturday , for instance , came because Malbranque checked inside , and had space to measure an angled pass to the forward with his stronger foot .
Earlier in the season , playing on the right , Malbranque looked past it , too slow to beat his full - back on the outside , so right - footed that when he came inside he resembled a canoe with only one paddle , turning always in a circle away from goal .
Switching to the left means the lack of pace no longer matters , and he effectively becomes a playmaker who happens to operate wide .
That certainly has been the role occupied by Kranjcar and Luka Modric at Spurs ; in their case , the flank becomes an area where a playmaker can still be accommodated in the English game .
Others , though , such as Ronaldo and Bellamy , are more obviously forwards , who just happen to start wide .
Wayne Rooney 's aerial ability perhaps means that centre - forward is his best position , but previous seasons have suggested that he too could occupy that role .
And in between , both playmaker and forward , is Messi , a genius for all the ages .
It is hard to believe any player starting wide has had such an impact on games so regularly since Matthews ( and even then you wonder whether British pundits , conditioned to see greatness in wingers , were n't seeing what they wanted to see ) .
Wide forwards can be stopped , but it takes a major change for the defending team .
Alvaro Arbeloa 's marking job on Messi for Liverpool in 2007 shows how effective it can be switching a right - footed full - back to play on the left flank , and Young 's slightly stuttering form for Aston Villa earlier this season shows what can happen when full - backs get used to showing a player outside rather than inside .
But then a player of the class of Ronaldo or Messi ( as he is today ) will simply go outside ( could that , in fact , be why Barça bought Zlatan Ibrahimovic , to give them an aerial presence if Messi were forced into crossing more often ? ) , and playing a right - footer at left - back or a left - footer at right - back immediately impairs their capacity to overlap .
So , the wide forward is hard to combat , scores goals , can operate as a playmaker and creates space for attacking full - backs .
All he does n't do is get to the by - line and curl in away swingers .
He seems such a potent threat that the real puzzle is why he did n't emerge earlier .
Nanodots Breakthrough May Lead To ‘ A Library On One Chip ’
A researcher at North Carolina State University has developed a computer chip that can store an unprecedented amount of data – enough to hold an entire library ’s worth of information on a single chip .
The new chip stems from a breakthrough in the use of nanodots , or nanoscale magnets , and represents a significant advance in computer - memory technology .
“ We have created magnetic nanodots that store one bit of information on each nanodot , allowing us to store over one billion pages of information in a chip that is one square inch , ” says Dr. Jay Narayan , the John C. Fan Distinguished Chair Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at NC State and author of the research .
The breakthrough is that these nanodots are made of single , defect - free crystals , creating magnetic sensors that are integrated directly into a silicon electronic chip .
These nanodots , which can be made uniformly as small as six nanometers in diameter , are all precisely oriented in the same way – allowing programmers to reliably read and write data to the chips .
The chips themselves can be manufactured cost - effectively , but the next step is to develop magnetic packaging that will enable users to take advantage of the chips – using something , such as laser technology , that can effectively interact with the nanodots .
The research , which was funded by the National Science Foundation , was presented as an invited talk April 7 at the 2011 Materials Research Society Spring Meeting in San Francisco .
NC State ’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering is part of the university ’s College of Engineering .

“ Self Assembly of epitaxial magnetic nanostructures ”
Author : J. Narayan , North Carolina State University
Presented : April 7 , 2010 , 2011 MRS Spring Meeting , San Francisco
Abstract :
This talk focuses on self - assembly processing of magnetic nanodots such as Ni , Ni-Pt , Fe- Pt during thin film growth by pulsed laser deposition .
This self - assembly can be extended from two - dimensional to three - dimensional structures by controlling stresses / strains in the layers of composite structures .
Magnetic properties are found to be a strong function of size , shape , orientation and chemical ordering .
The primary focus of this talk is on epitaxial orientation of nanodots and integration of microelectronic / nanoelectronic devices on Si( 100 ) ( 1 ) .
The epitaxial orientation is controlled by TiN buffer layer grown epitaxially on Si( 100 ) , and results compared with randomly oriented nanodots formed using amorphous alumina buffer .
The epitaxial structures ( Ni , Ni- Pt , Fe - Pt ) / TiN / Si( 100 ) involve lattice misfit ranging from 8 % to 22 % , which can be handled by our domain epitaxy paradigm ( 2 ) .
The DME paradigm involves matching of integral multiples of lattice planes across the interface , as the strain relaxation occurs by dislocations which represent either missing or extra planes ( 2 ) .
We discuss the optimization of structure and atomic ordering in Ni-Pt and FePt structures and correlations with magnetic properties by controlling thin film processing parameters and annealing conditions .
DTIの仮想専用サーバServersMan@VPSを借りてみました。
Entryプランはメモリが256MBでまあ足りるだろうと思っていたのですが、ServersMan@VPSではOpenVZという仮想化ソフトウェアを使っていて、なんとスワップの利用が禁止されているのだそうです。つまりなにがなんでも総メモリ使用量を256MB以下に抑える必要があります。ちょっと難しそうです。
とりあえ ずMySQL 5.1.45をインストールして、すべてデフォルトで起動するとこんな感じです。

One of the many stresses of being a billionaire is the difficulty in choosing between purchasing a yacht or an island .
Happily , designers this week unveiled plans for a " moving island " that renders the conundrum redundant .
Designs for the WHY 58x38 were unveiled at the Abu Dhabi yacht show this week .
The vessel is the result of a collaboration between Monaco yacht brand Wally and Parisian fashion house Hermès .
" Everybody 's dream is to live on an island , in complete freedom , without constraint , with the independence that only self sufficiency can provide , " said Wally 's president , Luca Bassani Antivari .
" A piece of land with a beautiful villa partly fulfils this aspiration because it is static .
A yacht offers the freedom to move , but does not have the space of a property .
WHY has it all . "
The motor yacht is , as the name suggests , 58 metres long and 38 metres wide , providing a total guest surface area of 3,400sq metres , and weighs in at 2,400 tonnes .
It boasts a maximum speed of 14 knots , and a price tag , when built , of $ 160 million .
Upon completion the yacht will be capable of catering for up to 12 guests , enjoying 280sq metres of space each – perfect for an intimate getaway .
Its dozen passengers , attended by a crew of 20 , will be able to congregate across three floors , consisting of the " master space " , " guest space " and " common space " .
The 200sq metre master area covers the entire third floor , while the guest space , incorporating five bedrooms , spans the second tier .
The common space , at the bottom of the ship , has a 25 - metre swimming pool , cinema , music room , dining room , and what the designers call " a perfect 30 m beach " .
Although work is yet to begin on the WHY its website does boast a snazzy promotional video – featuring a scale wooden model .
" I love the sea , " said Antivari , " and so I also love all of the different ways to enjoy the sea , whether by sail boat or by motorboat .
" Being an extremist , when I sail , I like to be both comfortable and sail at speed .
If I 'm on a motorboat then I want it to be the fastest .
If I 'm on a comfortable boat , then it has to be the most comfortable . "
In addition to comfort , the craft 's creators are keen that their yacht is environmentally friendly , and anticipate the yacht generating 500kw of solar energy a day through 900sq metres of photovoltaic panels covering its roof and hull .
According to the designers , the WHY should use far less energy than a yacht of the same size , saving up to 200 tonnes of diesel per year .
Frugal fuel consumption will enable it to cross the Atlantic four times without refuelling , according to the designers .
New York Times fashions “ egalitarian ” defense of Obama health plan
By Alex Lantier
25 March 2010
The passage of the Obama administration 's health care bill has unleashed a barrage of media self - congratulation .
This campaign has a large propaganda component : some polls find 59 percent opposition to the bill , amid popular suspicion that this " reform " is not what it is said to be .
For the Democratic Party , the question of how the public reacts to the bill is — to cite the eloquent words of Vice President Joe Biden — a " big f___ing deal . "
As the press moves to dispel popular anxiety , the New York Times ' David Leonhardt has received one of the more sleazy assignments — presenting Obama 's health plan as part of a struggle for social equality .
In his article , published on the front page of Wednesday ’s Times ( " In Health Bill , Obama Attacks Wealth Inequality " ) , Leonhardt praises the bill as " the federal government 's biggest attack on economic inequality since inequality began rising more than three decades ago . "
He describes the bill as part of a " deliberate effort to end what historians have called the age of Reagan " — that is , the dominance of right - wing , free market policies in the 30 - year period since the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 .
This assessment of the bill and of the Obama administration is a cynical lie .
It is hardly a secret that Obama 's health plan entails huge cuts to US social programs .
One day before the publication of Leonhardt ’s article , the Times noted : " Central to the health care changes are hundreds of billions of dollars in reductions in Medicare spending over time and expansions of Medicaid …
That leaves Social Security , the other big entitlement benefits program and one that Mr. Obama has suggested in the past that he is willing to tackle . "
To avoid this point , Leonhardt does not spend much time discussing the content of the bill .
He notes in passing , " Much about the health reform remains unknown . "
As proof of the health bill ’s alleged egalitarian character , he selects two points from the legislation : lower - income workers ' access to insurance subsidies or Medicaid , and plans to increase payroll taxes on the wealthy .
This hardly exhausts the examination of a bill which , in its current form , runs to 2,409 pages and includes extensive , confusing references to other bills .
Even a summary reading of the bill suggests that it is driven by an agenda of cutting costs , and thus , inevitably , the quality of health care for large sections of the population — something that will , of course , increase social inequality .
The bill creates a universal individual obligation to buy health insurance from private companies on health insurance " exchanges " set up by the government .
Employers who do not cover their employees will have to pay a $ 2,000 fine for each worker , past the first 30 , without health insurance .
Individuals who do not buy insurance also face fines .
A few questions that Leonhardt does not take the time to ask should be raised :
(1) What will workers have to pay as " cost - sharing " with insurance companies , and what services will they receive under Medicaid as the federal and state governments push for more spending cuts ?
(2) If the bill is designed to ensure equality in access to health care , as Leonhardt suggests , why does it create multiple gradations of plans — platinum , gold , silver , bronze , and sub - bronze plans — based on the percentage of the " full actuarial value of the benefits " that various plans in fact provide ?
(3) A small business employing 50 workers and currently paying $ 5,000 apiece for health care coverage could scrap coverage for all of its employees and , under the terms of the bill , pay a $ 2,000 fine on 20 workers .
Its health care costs would drop from $ 250,000 to $ 40,000 .
As companies face further credit crunches and possible bankruptcy , how many will go this route and force their workers to individually purchase inferior coverage on the exchanges ?
Ultimately , with such a massive and unwieldy piece of legislation , clear answers are unlikely to be found in the text of the bill — whose implications will be fought out by armies of lawyers and businesses .
However , the questions themselves point to the huge political issues hiding in the thousands of pages of fine print .
Leonhardt writes that " the central question that both the Reagan and Obama administrations have tried to answer — what is the proper balance between the market and the government ?
— remains unresolved .
But the bill signed on Tuesday certainly shifts our place on that spectrum . "
This is simply absurd .
Obama 's health bill does not involve a clash between " the market " and " the government , " i.e. , between private and public interests , but rather the use of government authority to limit liabilities and guarantee profits for business in general and private insurers , pharmaceutical companies and hospital chains , in particular .
In that , it is of a piece with the Obama administration 's bailouts , which handed over trillions in government funds to the banks .
Such policies produce not a new dawn for social equality , but the entrenchment of a financial aristocracy at the expense of the working population .
In describing the intervention of the government , Leonhardt completely suppresses the question of which class the state is acting to defend .
He undermines his own false dichotomy by quoting Obama 's favorable views of Reagan .
" Reagan 's central insight — that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic -- contained a good deal of truth , " according to the current president .
As for Leonhardt himself , he is on the record as supporting health care rationing and opposing equality of access to health care .
In a June 17 , 2009 article ( " Health Care Rationing Rhetoric Overlooks Reality " ) he wrote : " Even in the United States , the richest society in human history , we are constantly rationing .
We ration spots in good public high schools .
We ration lakefront homes .
We ration the best cuts of steak and wild - caught salmon .
Health care , I realize , seems as if it should be different .
But it is n’t . "
Such comments express the outlook of a privileged , insulated class that views the living conditions of masses of people with indifference and contempt .
Leonhardt recounts a telling anecdote about Lawrence Summers , the former president of Harvard University and now Obama 's top economic advisor .
Leonhardt writes that Summers was " helping his daughter study for her Advanced Placement exam in American history .
While doing so , Mr. Summers realized that the federal government had not passed major social legislation in decades .
There was the frenzy of the New Deal , followed by the GI Bill , the Interstate Highway System , civil rights , and Medicare — and then nothing worth its own section in the history books . "
Is it too much to suggest that an administration whose top economic adviser could remain oblivious to the 45 - year social retrogression in the US did not start from the problems facing masses of people when it drafted its health care bill ?
Lambda - style anonymous functions for C++ in less than 500 lines of code
I prefer functional languages like Scheme , Scala or Haskell over C++ for most tasks .
So , when I 'm forced to program in C++ , I write functional C++.
Fortunately , it 's possible to add the most important ingredient in functional languages - - lambda - style anonymous functions -- to standard C++.
For example , the expression
lambda<int > ( x ) --> 3*x + 7
< int >
represents a function that multiplies by 3 and then adds 7 .
( Themeans that the anonymous function returns an integer . )
These anonymous functions are first - class ; that is , they can be assigned to variables , passed as parameters or returned from functions ; for instance :
f = lambda< int > ( x , y ) --> x + y ;
f( 2,3 ) == 5
( lambda<int > ( z ) --> z*z ) ( 9 )
so that .
Or , they can be applied directly , as in : which is just another way of saying 81 .
These functions can also map over data structures ; for example :
B = ( lambda<int > ( x ) --> 3*x + 1 ) .map( n , A )
B
B[i ] == 3 * A [ i ] + 1
produces a new arrayin which
Lambda terms can also capture free variables and perform Currying ; for instance , given the function definition
Function2 < int , int , int > h( int a , int b ) { return lambda < int > ( x , y ) --> a*x + b*y ; }
h ( 3,4 ) ( 1,1 )
the value ofis 7 .
To pull this off , the implementation exploits templates , operator overloading and function pointers ( but , remarkably , not a single macro ) to construct a type - safe domain - specific embedded language ( DSEL ) for describing anonymous functions .

Mother siskin and her chick
This little siskin made a beautiful nest out of moss , lichens and old leaves under the roof of my veranda .
She has sat religiously on it throughout very cold and windy conditions .
Her determination to sit and hatch is stronger than her fear of me , constantly peering to see what is happening .
The egg has hatched .
The chick is alive .
She has been successful .
Nature surviving in glorious simplicity makes me very happy .

White I replaced my black cycle helmet with a bright pink one .
People used to look a bit scared when I cycled up to them , now the sight of a fat lady on a bike makes them smile .
Sue , Wales I 'm 49 years old and a company director with far too much to worry me .
I went for a mind - clearing walk through a wood the other day and , in a clearing , I spotted a home - made swing slung from the high branches of an old oak tree .
After a quick check to be sure no - one was watching , I got on board and had the best 10 minutes of fun I 've had all year .
I left feeling astonishingly happier .
I hope it 's still there this weekend !
Neil Hardie , Scotland
Wake up in the morning take a deep breath and appreciate the fact you 've woken up to another day .
For many , the journey ended before you woke up .
Be thankful for what we have , not what we do n't have .
Quit blaming others .
Take a bit more responsibility for things in your life .
Nobody owes us , we owe ourselves .
Take a bit of time for inward reflection , it does wonders for the soul , simple and easy , does n't cost anything but rewards greatly .
Drugs not required .

How to be happy - this advice was given to me many years ago by a man I consider to be a genius at being happy : Cultivate a passion
Be part of something bigger than yourself Avoid introspection Do n't resist change Live for the moment Audit your happiness
Play the part and be happy !
Bob Yeldham , Wales I 've discovered that a good deed can benefit me as much as the person I do it for .
For example , I recently had an opportunity to help someone use a public network PC at the library to retrieve pics of their newborn great granddaughter in Australia .
They were thrilled and I felt cheery for the rest of the day .
Heather Jones , UK A good pork pie and maybe some Lincolnshire sausage .
Tony Wood , Canada
In the ancient Indian scripture Mahabharata there is a passage which says " That person who lives in their own home , eats and lives simply and has no debt to anyone ; they are truly happy in this world " .
Therein I think lies the clue to real happiness .
Simplify !
Forget the mad notion that wealth equals happiness and live moderately in all things and have no debt to anyone .
How much misery is there due to debt ?
The " have it all now ( pay later with interest ) " culture is an insane course which our society promotes and praises .
Even the government wants our children to be thousands of pounds in debt before they even start work .
More and more materialism will not make us happy .
I 'm moving to Bhutan !
David , UK
Andy 's four - month - old daughter Aly Here are some of the things that make me happy : walking the dog ; seeing other people very happy ; making other people laugh , especially my baby daughter ( see photograph ) ; helping other people ; meeting up with friends and family .
Andy , Teddington
Last weekend I travelled for 4 hours for my niece 's Christening , and just the sight of her made me feel immensely happy .
The sight of my sister and her husband enjoying their little girl made my heart sing .
The fact that their first son died stillborn at 38 weeks does n't seem to reduce our joy , rather it makes us all cherish the new baby even more .
If I ever become a mother I know that I will be better for sharing the awful experience of my sister .
That is the sort of thing that keeps my temperament happy - the knowledge that out of a tragedy can come something positive eventually .
Also , will feeling unhappy actually change anything ?
I do n't think I 've ever found that to be so .
Sarah , UK I met a bloke wearing a full diving suit and waders , walking down by the river when I took my dogs out today .
He was about to plunge into a muddy bog , in the pouring rain , because he " just fancied a paddle " .
He was very happy .
There 's a message in there somewhere ...
Wen , UK Grandad and grandson Being a grandparent , having a loving family ... that 's happiness .
Jim Callaghan , Bury I spent years struggling with depression and low self esteem when a friend 's advice changed my perspective dramatically .
" It 's hard work to be happy you know " .
Until then I had always felt it was the world 's fault I was so unhappy .
Since actively taking this advice I overcame much of my discontent .
It 's crucial to make happiness your goal and do whatever it takes to achieve it .
Linda O'Sullivan , Ireland Reading these comments has made me feel happy !
Thank you !!
Sue Alfie and Lyn My Jack Russell
Alfie helps keep me happy .
I'm a freelance editor and could easily sit at my desk all day long , but Alfie needs a walk every day so I get one too !
He 's made friends at the park so I get to chat with their owners .
It 's a nice enforced break in the working day .
Lyn I just love getting out and kiting on land or on water .
I push myself to land new tricks but when you just have a perfect session it is the most amazing feeling .
A good wind , nice weather and a good group of friends is all I need to stay happy .
It is all these exams and pressure from school that makes me unhappy .
I just feel when I 'm kiting or even just sat on a beach I am the happiest I have ever found myself .
I know not many people kite but it is the same with any hobby like it , and many people just use these things to escape from their everyday lives .
Find a hobby you love , then get out and do it !!
Zac Andrews , UK Sometime ago I had a successful career , earned more money than I needed , was driven and career - orientated , worked long days and nights .
But I was n't fulfilled .
I now earn half as much , focus on helping businesses by using the knowledge and experience I gained in the past and work mainly from home .
Life is now balanced .
I cuddle my husband daily , have time to play with my dog , do more ( but still maybe not enough ) exercise and eat well .
I also love " random acts of kindness " and try to give myself a challenge and to learn or experience new things regularly .
Yes , I 'd still like that cottage in the country where I can bake bread and have chickens , but would n't life be dull if all your dreams were fulfilled ?
Kathy , UK Somebody once told me " It is not the position in which you stand , but the direction in which you look " .
When I am sad about something I think about where I want to be and work at getting there .
This makes me happy again .
Tracy , UK I am revising for my A - levels next week .
Happiness is when your family make a huge barbecue and picnic extremely quietly , sneak into the house and burst into the room shouting " surprise ! " and brandishing a cold beer !
Katy , UK Happiness to me , can be ever so lasting , when I am connected to my creator .
When I am in touch , I am rewarded , I am reminded always , of love , kindness , forgiveness , compassion , generosity , humility , understanding , tolerance , curiosity , humbleness , beauty , of peace .
In those moments I can see what life is all about .
In those moments I have glimpsed the whole picture .
Nourel , UK Christian Ellwood 's " big sisters " Nostalgic photos of my family always me happy without fail .

Christian Ellwood
What makes me happy ?
I absolutely love spending time with my young niece .
She is such a treasure and brings me immense joy and laughter in my life .
Ultimately happiness comes in all shapes and sizes , for me it 's being with my close family and friends .
Laugh and smile and those around you will to .
Appreciate and show gratitude to everyone and the pleasure and joy will come to you .
Bina Paw , West London Happiness is what everyone looks for .
Everything we do is primarily for happiness .
I would like to share something I came across on a poster which goes something like this ...
" This is the time to be happy and this is the place to be happy .
The way to be happy is to make others happy . "
I 've tried and it works !!
Anoop , India Happiness for me is seeing my baby daughter 's face beam with delight as I walk through the door , after a long day at work .
Jennifer Nash , UK Spontaneous , effusive dancing with friends and family !
And , especially , dancing with my Mum every run up to Christmas to The Pogues ' Fairytale of New York , and collapsing in an exhausted , grinning heap at the end .
Louise , UK Happy to be given a beanie baby I have sent a photo of our recent mission trip to Cape Town where we worked with children with Aids .
We took the whole of December off from work and spent Christmas giving of our time and abilities to help these people .
They have so little and we have so much , we should be happy with our lot here in the UK as we do n't know how lucky we are .
It made me extremely happy that we could give of our time .
Jesus tells us to be joyful in all situations , he is the reason for my happiness , he wants us all to know his peace which brings happiness .
The photo shows two boys in a township who we gave a beanie baby to , this gave them so much happiness .
Tim Walker , UK
Here are some things that make me happy : becoming a Grandma is an almost certain recipe for happiness ; having a funny old husband to cuddle up to , to find your glasses and keys when you lose them , and put a lovely warm wheat bag in the bed at night ; three friendly Labradors to welcome you home in the evening ; hanging out the washing on a fine sunny day ; having a job working with teenagers where every day produces lots of laughs and plenty of challenges , a glass of Waipara Springs Reserve Pinot Noir , friends coming to stay ; and , of course , chocolates .
Ros Rossiter , New Zealand
I am only 13 but I constantly wish I could do something to help people feel happier .
I think it would be good for schools to encourage more youth groups that go into the communities and help out .
I would love to have a youth group in my town where people can make friends and work hard to make their community better , but people just can't be bothered to help without getting anything in return .
Amy , UK An Indian Swami gave me this equation of happiness .
Happiness = number of desires fulfilled / number of desires created .
The happiness increases if you increase the numerator , as one feels happy as soon as one 's desire is fulfilled , or you decrease the denominator ie create fewer desires .
As the mind is capable of increasing the denominator endlessly and there are practical limitations in increasing the numerator , it is better to train the mind to generate fewer desires .
A person with no desires is the happiest person on earth .
Manmohan Sehgal , USA Happiness comes with inner peace .
Having realistic goals in life .
Having good health , and sufficient funds for shelter and food and having no debts .
Respecting your fellow neighbour and peers .
A sense of humour and an appreciation of different points of views , and respecting nature .
Finally be happy with your lot , and do n't be greedy , is the recipe for happiness .
Annette , Co. Armagh Mr Smile enjoys a good book I find happiness when I walk along the Thames from the Millennium Bridge towards Westminster , then cross Westminster Bridge towards St James Park , cross the mall and walk through Green Park and sit down on the grass ( during spring and summer ) or on a bench during winter time .
Just too many people complain about the weather .
There are just too many options in London to enjoy life .
Lying on the grass underneath a tree is my best one with a nice book to read , a bottle of water , maybe a packed lunch too .
Mr Smile ( Sergio Sandes de Sa ) I vouch for exercise as an important factor .
The reason why so many people are unhappy is because we are made to sit at a desk all day long , slaves to the technology around us .
People really put in a days work in the 50s , how I envy them .
James , UK Vez and her ketchup Happiness is whatever you want it to be , for me it is ketchup , my friends , family , my psychotic one eyed cat and my hairy boyfriend Rhys .
Never forget the magic you believed in when you were a child , anything is possible if you believe it .
Vez Hudson , Leeds Instead of trying to define what happiness is , my suggestion is to identify what makes you unhappy first and get rid of , or move away from it .
Happiness , whatever it may be for you , will emerge in the process .
Keith , USA
There are many ups and downs in life and it is how we react and deal with these on a day to day basis , that shows our true colours .
I have found that true happiness and fulfilment comes only from knowing Jesus Christ .
It is a joy that cannot be measured , but having faith in Him and feeling His presence gives me a peace that can't be explained .
Beverly , UK Julie Cookson 's family
My partner , John , my wonderful twins , Chloe and Will , and the beautiful place we live in - British Columbia in Canada , make me grateful and happy every day !
Julie Cookson , British Columbia
The one thing that makes me the happiest is sleeping !
Of course family and friends ( including my cat ) come first , but sleeping is the best .
Just being able to naturally wake up , refreshed and relaxed with no alarm going off like a war siren in your ear .
It makes me sooo content with myself all day ... I love it !
Anyone that does n't get enough sleep , go to bed earlier , try it for a week and see how you feel .
Michelle , England
My cat makes me happy .
Anne Sinclair , Aubiere , France I keep a picture on the wall , from an old Buddhist Calendar .
It illustrates a Buddhist proverb that I try to remember at the start of every day .
There is no way to happiness : happiness is the way .
Works for me !
Phil Bishop , UK Just yesterday I was telling someone that I am very contented and do n't seem to need anything more .
I am considered poor by most peoples ' standards but attribute my happy feelings to : being healthy , having enough money to meet my basic needs , living in a beautiful area and not envying other people .
I am also single and a senior which does n't seem to affect how happy I am .
Jo Wodz , Canada Sunshine on my skin !
Isabelle , UK Happiness is enjoying getting older .
When I was young I dreaded getting old .
Now I 'm in my 60s I focus on the fact that life is getting better , I 'm improving in my job as a local radio presenter - and I love living by the sea !
Pat Holness , UK Always try to be positive .
My son says he loves it that my glass is always half full , and of course , having a great sense of the ridiculous and the ability to laugh at oneself really helps .
But , there again I was born an incurable optimist , so I have a head start anyway !
Mavis , UK Julie Williamson 's cat Nurturing and loving someone or something special is a key to happiness .
So too is unconditional acceptance .
This little one makes me happy and she asks for very little in return .
Julie Williamson , London
It 's certainly true that the best things in life are free - the thing that makes me most happy is tickling the armpits of my cat Pliny .
However bad life gets , it never fails to make me smile .
Jayne , UK
The things that make me happy are my friends and family .
I love to laugh , I do n't think I could live without laughing .
Alysa , Wales I really enjoyed the article on Happiness , thank you !
It is the most important part of our lives that often gets overlooked .
I think recognising we have CHOICE is a major contributor to happiness and very empowering .
It 's all about the way we want to see things .
If we want to see things negatively they will be negative , if we want to see things positively they will be positive .
Being grateful everyday really helps too .
Claire Hitchman , France Ducks crossing the road Photos like this - they can make you laugh out loud which is great .
You feel much better .
Wendy Happiness is found in savouring the time and motion spent in the making of a good cup of tea .
Piping hot .
Strong .
Lots of milk .
No sugar to spoil it .
It 's a very useful beginning .
Rosy Parveen , Spain Leading a simplistic life makes me happy .
I avoid clutter and excess junk that I do n't need .
Getting outside , inhaling fresh air , listening to the birds or leaves rustle - those are things that make me happy .
No materialistic things .
Kim , USA Ahh !
There 's nothing like sitting by the fire on a cold , rainy night , with the dog at my feet , a cup of tea , and a good book to read .
That 's the life !
Aidan , England Making other people happy is very important .
The happiness you give is returned back to you through the way people interact with you .
Smiling and laughing is of course an essential aspect of happiness , although keeping yourself clean and healthy are also important .
Phil , UK Messy eaters make me smile .
Davie McIntosh , Inverness HAPPINESS FORMULA
Good health
A clear picture of what you want from life
Comfortable shelter
Sufficient food and drink
The unqualified love of a few close friends - human or animal !
Respect of your peers
A sense of humour
An appreciation of beauty Paul , Channel Islands , UK First inner peace and then true love and compassion will lead to happiness .
First you need to reach inner peace so that you can truly love , love everything and everyone - true opening of heart ; and it is only then that you can reach happiness .
Think of it that way : inner peace is the toll charge you have to pay to be allowed to travel along the road of love , and at the end of the road of love is happiness .
The whole thing can be applied to a very short span of time ( say a short daily event ) or the entire life time .
Mehran Rahanjam , UK
My tip would be avoiding debt .
Debt causes endless worry and stress , which in turn leads to unhappiness .
If you can't afford to buy it right out , do without .
Do n't put it on a credit card , or buy now pay later .
If you can't pay for it now , you can't afford it !
Lisa , Antrim Chocolate
Claire , UK " In 10 years time will it really matter " .
This is what I consider when things are n't going right .
Okay so I lost that earring but in 10 years time will it really matter ?
So I 'm running late but in 10 years time will it really matter ?
It helps keep perspective as to what is important .
Cherylanne , England
The smell of wild mountain air under the hot western sun of this beautiful land .
Watching Stella and Lola clown around ( my dogs ) , a cold juice late at night , playing ball at the park with the crows and flowers .
Ian Paulston , U.S.
The research seems to me to confirm my own experience .
I'm a Christian , married ( with four wonderful children ) and I feel that life can't get any better .
I 've never bought a lottery ticket because I do n't want money to complicate my life .
Jason Fell , UK Forgiveness makes people live happily .
Forgiving a person who has wronged you makes you feel at home .
We should also strive to be healthy spiritually .
Inner comfort is essential for one to live happily .
Uwera Rachel Lynnate , Uganda Happiness in beauty I think in life we are all looking for beauty .
Beauty makes us happy .
So the key to happiness is to notice the beauty that is everywhere around us .
This picture is of the Parc Tete d'Or in Lyon .
I go there almost every day to take photos or just to relax .
It makes me so happy to see the new flowers , the birds , the people .
There might be loads of bad things happening in this world at the moment but there is still so much happiness and beauty left to be discovered .
Meenal Singh , France
Be a little crazy now and again , life is far too serious so let out your inner child , live life to the full and enjoy it and above all , laugh and smile , it 's infectious .
This has worked for me even when I 'm feeling blue .
Carol , UK Happiness , for me , is being able to make the most of what you have got .
Appreciating what you have while striving to achieve more , which in turn generates more appreciation , pleasure and enjoyment .
Krys Baker , UK
At the end of each day , remember what you did during that day .
Concentrate on the thoughts that make you happy .
Happiness grows when you notice it .
Learn to be happy to be happier .
Roberto Salazar , US Nattavudh Powdthavee and friends Happiness comes in all shapes and sizes , but for me it comes from spending time with close friends and loved ones , especially those who we can identify ourselves with .
Happiness is also contagious - just by being happy yourself can make others around you significantly happier too !
Nattavudh Powdthavee , UK
To be happy get an allotment !!

Allotments are even becoming trendy - just been on an up and coming band 's website and seen an amazing new music video featuring an allotment .
It 's for Sheffield band Grandadbob , who seem to love their own allotment so much that they pack it all up with them when they move - TO JUPITER .
Shed , carrots , everything .
( Wonder where I can get seed for blue carrots like theirs ? )
Lynda Taylor , UK Unfortunately many people find out too late in life that money will not reward them with happiness .
Many young people heading out into their busy lives of work , careers , mortgages and marriage , have never had the chance to think clearly about how all this may effect them .
The environment you grow up in will condition you into a certain way of thinking that can lead you on a path in life that sometimes is not where you truly want to be .
It is very important to listen to your heart , and the choices you make in life are truly your own .
I am 20 years from retirement and have average career , savings and income , but have decided to take my retirement now and not wait until I am 65 .
For a long time now I have been working 9 months a year with 3 months off to relax and travel the world .
This gives me balance in my life and what I think is happiness .
So always , always follow your heart and the rules of life can be changed easier than you think .
Paul Harris , UK
The sight of blue sky and the smell of spring makes me ever so happy .
If we got sunnier winters in Britain I am sure people would be a lot happier .
Olivia Butler , UK Reviewing my life each year is important to my happiness .
Setting myself goals each year where I can deal with any long term problems such as clearing debt or achieving something worthwhile e.g. start training for a new career .
Reading makes me happy especially philosophy I recommend meditations by Marcus Auralius as it puts every human problem and adversity into perspective .
Gavin Loft , Kent Once
I realised I did n't need all the rubbish that 's advertised around me and I saw I already had enough of everything I instantly cheered up .
I have a wonderful family and the simple joy of seeing my baby smile or giggle lightens my life immensely A cuddle with my husband and daughter , pottering in the garden , a nice meal with friends .
These are all things that make you happy .
I might hate my job , but I love my life .
Helen Fitton , UK Stop reading newspapers !
They concentrate on the negative - that is what news is .
I stopped years ago and noticed the change immediately .
The BBC news website is where I get all my news now - so much more balanced .

Why do coupons say “ do not double ” on them ?
When people start couponing , they often wonder why many coupons have “ do not double ” or “ do not triple ” written on them .
The answer to this question is pretty simple and straightforward .
The initial reaction when people see “ do not double ” on coupons is that the manufacturers are trying to stop grocery stores for offering better deals to their customers .
There must be some reason that manufacturers do n't want the coupons doubled , but what is it ?
This initial assumption has little to do with the real reason that you see “ do not double ” on coupons .
The real reason that this is written on the coupons is for manufacturers to financially protect themselves when grocery stores do decide to double coupons .
If you look at the fine print on most coupons , you will see that the the coupons says that the manufacturer will reimburse the grocery store for the face value of the coupon plus a small fee ( usually 8 cents ) .
A problem occurred when grocery stores first began to double and triple coupons .
The grocery stores wanted to be reimbursed the double amount while the manufacturers thought that they should only be reimbursed for the face value of the coupon .
To make things perfectly clear to the grocery stores , manufacturers started printing “ do not double ” on coupons so that there was no question that they would only reimburse the face value of the coupon .
Grocery stores are still free to double and triple coupons , but if they decide to do this , the grocery store is responsible for the amount that they discount above the face value of the coupon and the 8 cents handling fee .
When a grocery store doubles coupons , the store has decided that it will take a loss on the doubled portion of the coupon .
Grocery stores in certain regions decide that it is worthwhile to double coupons to bring in customers ( much like loss leaders ) to give them an advantage in competitive shopping markets .
Will grocery stores double coupons even if they have “ do not double ” written on them ?
In most cases , the answer is “ yes ” as long as that the coupon fits within the specific coupon policy of the store that is doubling it .
When the coupon is scanned , it will automatically be doubled regardless if it says “ do not double ” because of the reasons listed above .
The two big exceptions are for coupons printed off the Internet and those which are found from the blinkie dispensers in the grocery store .
These coupons usually have bar codes which begin with a 9 , while the coupons you get from the Sunday paper start with a 5 .
If a coupon begins with a 9 , it will not double in the store 's register system .
If the coupon begins with a 5 , the grocery store 's register system should automatically double the coupon even when “ do not double ” is printed on it .
There is also a specific reason why these exceptions exist .
As explained , grocery store take a hit out of their own pocket each time they double a coupon .
The coupons in the store are easily accessible to anyone shopping and get used much more often than those from the Sunday paper .
If the store had to double these coupons and frequently take a financial hit each time they did due to their convenience , the store would likely decide that it did n't want those machines in their store .
To ensure that the grocery stores allow this type of coupon advertising , they made them so they will not double .
This is all fine and dandy as long as the store register system is able to scan the coupon .
If for some reason the systems refuses to scan a coupon , you are left to the interpretation of the person who happens to be working the cash register .
The problem comes in that the person working the cash register sees “ do not double ” and thinks that is a message meant directly for them , not the store in general .
Since they are the ones that will get in trouble if they give a discount where one is not appropriate , they will often error on the side of caution and refuse to double the coupon .
A Republican Texas lawmaker plans to introduce a tough immigration measure similar to the new law in Arizona , a move state Democrats say would be a mistake .
Rep. Debbie Riddle of Tomball said she will push for the law in the January legislative session , according to Wednesday 's editions of the San Antonio Express - News and Houston Chronicle .
" The first priority for any elected official is to make sure that the safety and security of Texans is well - established , " said Riddle , who introduced a similar measure in 2009 that did n't get out of committee .
" If our federal government did their job , then Arizona would n't have to take this action , and neither would Texas . "
The Arizona law would require local and state law enforcement to question people about their immigration status -- and make it a crime for immigrants to lack registration documents .
The measure is already making an impact in North Texas .
Organizers for a rally against the immigration law said Tuesday they hope for 100,000 protesters to show up for a Saturday march in Dallas .
Leaders of various groups are planning to attend .
" What I say to the African - American community :
If they come in the morning for brown - skinned people , and we remain silent , they may come in the evening for us , " Peter Johnson , of the Peter Johnson Institute of Non-Violence , said .
" This wholesale idea of just questioning everyone who looks differently or who has an accent or whose eyes look differently than ours is not the way to address this issue , " said Cheryl Pollman , president of the National Council of Jewish Women .
The Dallas Tea Party said it will plan a counterprotest for another time .
Phillip Dennis , a member of the group 's steering committee , said states have to step up because the federal government has failed to enforce immigration laws .
He said he and his wife , who is a legal immigrant from Colombia , are familiar with the process of emigrating to the United States .
" We paid by the rules , we jumped through the hoops , and we paid the money -- thousands and thousands of dollars , " he said .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a U.S. Senate hearing Tuesday that a Justice Department review is under way to determine the constitutionality of the Arizona law .
State Sen. Leticia Van de Putte , a San Antonio Democrat and former president of the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators , called the law " extremely damaging and hateful . "
Van de Putte predicted failure for any similar measures in Texas and said the GOP would suffer politically for such a move .
Asked about the Arizona law , GOP Gov. Rick Perry and his Democratic challenger , Bill White , emphasized through spokespeople that immigration is a federal responsibility .
Jim Harrington , of the Texas Civil Rights Project , predicted any similar effort in Texas would fail because Texas has " a different relationship with the Hispanic community . "
" You can take the political temperature by just looking at Rick Perry being quiet , " Harrington said .
Stop Tim Burton Remakes

Anyone else think that Tim Burton 's remakes of movies are so unbearably shitty he should be brought up for crimes against cinema ?
Alice in Wonderland ; we already have a " dark " and " edgy " take on it .
It 's called American McGee 's Alice .
Late to the punch , very late .
People have been OMGDARK versions of Alice in Wonderland for ages now .
I 'll be pissed if Hot Topic fucks over Alice in Wonderland again .
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory : Oh god ... there are no words .
No fucking words , to describe how terrible this movie is .
Johnny Depp is no Gene Wilder , not by a long shot .
Speaking of Johnny Depp , why does Tim Burton cast him in a main role in his remakes ?
He does n't do them justice at all .
He 's there to market his movies to teenage girls .
The odd thing is , Tim Burton 's original stuff ( Nightmare Before Christmas , 9 , which apparently he barely did anything on but it still has his name on it ) ranges from okay to pretty good .
It 's not as OMGAWESOMEBESTTHINGEVER as the faux goth Hot Topic crowd likes to think , but it 's not so terrible I want to hurl up my organs like a sea cucumber .

William Shatner has been nominated to be the 28th Governor General of Canada .
Not only is he an intergalactic hero but The Shat hails from the great white north and would be a perfect candidate for the mostly ceremonial title .
He also appears to be leading in the polls , beating out Wayne Gretzky and a full list of other famous Canadians .
Heck , you can even place your vote for the next Governor General here .
Pat Tanzola is the man responsible for nominating The Shat and here 's what he had to say about the matter ; " Although William Shatner has begged off gubernatorial consideration - citing prime ministerial ambitions - there is still much promise in replacing our award - winning journalist , Michaëlle Jean , with this Emmy - winning superstar as GG . "
Not sure what exactly the title Governor General means ?
Neither were we .
Wikipedia had this to say about it :
The Governor General of Canada is the viceregal representative in the federal jurisdiction of the Canadian monarch and head of state , Queen Elizabeth II , who is equally shared with 15 other sovereign nations in a form of personal union , but resides predominantly in her oldest realm , the United Kingdom .
On the advice of her Canadian Prime Minister only , the Queen appoints the Governor General to carry out most of the monarch 's constitutional and ceremonial duties for an unfixed period of time — known as serving At Her Majesty 's pleasure — though five years is the normal convention , as is a rotation between anglophone and francophone incumbents .
Once in office , these individuals maintain direct contact with the Queen , wherever she may be at the time .
Wow !
The Shat would have direct contact with the Queen .
I guess it 's prefectly fitting for the captain of the Federation flag ship .
I mean he has made first contact with countless species and saved the galaxy numerous times .
Check out the video below for Mr. Shatner 's response

If that sounds a bit like the Da Vinci Code , it is probably no coincidence , although the film is being touted as a cross between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Clash of the Titans .

The texting pair were planning to " commit sin ' , the court said
Steamy text messages have resulted in a three - month jail sentence for an Indian man and an Indian woman in Dubai .
Judges ruled that they had planned to " commit sin " , a reference to an extramarital affair - which is illegal in the United Arab Emirates .
The unnamed pair , aged 47 and 42 , were working as cabin crew for Dubai 's Emirates airline .
Their " sexy texts " first surfaced last year , in a divorce lawsuit by the woman 's estranged husband .
Crimes of passion
The Indian pair were originally sentenced to six months in jail , followed by deportation .
But an appeals court reduced the term and gave them the option to remain in the country .
The court said there was not enough evidence to determine whether the man and the woman had actually had an affair , which could have brought a harsher sentence .
This is the latest in a series of cases where foreigners have been found to have broken Dubai 's conservative laws .
Earlier this week , a British couple said they would appeal a one - month jail sentence for exchanging a passionate kiss in a restaurant .
In 2008 , two Britons were sentenced to three months in jail for what authorities described as sex on the beach .
The sentences were later suspended .
If the idea of having a marijuana deficiency sounds laughable to you , a growing body of science points at exactly such a possibility .
Scientists have known that the active psychoactive compound in marijuana is THC , which is short for tetrahydrocannabinol .
In August 1990 , researchers reported in the journal Nature the discovery of receptors in the brain that specifically accommodate the cannabinoids in pot .
Cannabinoids bind to particular neurological sites in the brain , as though the brain was specifically designed to utilize this plant .
Did nature toss cannabinoid receptors into the brain by random chance ?
Are cannabinoid receptors part of an intelligent design for deriving maximum benefit from cannabis ?
Is cannabis a divine elixir of sacred communion for which we are ideally suited ?
Actually , a more sober answer seems likely .
When there are receptors in the brain for a particular type of compound , that compound is made in the brain .
This is true of many important agents that work to transmit brain messages of all types .
So a hunt began to find such a compound .
In that vein , in 1992 researchers in Israel isolated the cannabinoid anandamide in the human brain .
Unlike THC , anandamide is manufactured in the brain , and is therefore an endogenous cannabinoid .
This agent , anandamide , is the compound that attaches to the built - in cannabinoid receptors in our brains .
The name anandamide is based on the Sanskrit word ananda , which means bliss .
Anandamide is a bliss molcule , enhancing greater well being and emotional satisfaction .
Ever since the pioneering work of Dr. William O’Shaughnessy on cannabis and pain compiled in the 1840 ’s a growing body of science has shown that cannabis offers relief for various types of pain .
In the brain , the endogenous agent anandamide also plays a role in mitigating inflammation and pain .
So both cannabinoids from inside and outside the body play a role in pain reduction .
More recent studies show pain relief among sufferers of multiple sclerosis when cannabis is consumed .
Anandamide also plays a role in proper appetite , feelings of pleasure and well - being , and memory .
Interestingly , cannabis also affects these same functions .
Cannabis has been used successfully to treat migraine , fibromyalgia , irritable bowel syndrome and glaucoma .
So here is the seventy - four thousand dollar question .
Does cannabis simply relieve these diseases to varying degrees , or is cannabis actually a medical replacement in cases of deficient anandamide ?
At least one author , medical doctor Ethan Russo , believes in the possibility of endocanabinoid deficiency , and suggests that such a deficiency might actually be a significant cause of the types of health problems listed above .
His paper “ Clinical Cannabinoid Deficiency , ” published in Neuroendocrinology Letters in 2004 , delved deeply into the various ways that cannabinoids function in the body , and how a deficiency in cannabinoids can lead to a broad range of diseases .
Since the publication of that paper , a number of studies have further confirmed the effectiveness of cannabis for many health disorders .
The idea of clinical cannabinoid deficiency opens the door to cannabis consumption as an effective medical approach to relief of various types of pain , restoration of appetite in cases in which appetite is compromised , improved visual health in cases of glaucoma , and improved sense of well being among patients suffering from a broad variety of mood disorders .
As state and local laws mutate and change in favor of greater tolerance , perhaps cannabis will find it ’s proper place in the home medicine chest .

A 6.3 - magnitude earthquake has struck off Papua New Guinea but no tsunami alert has been issued and there are no early reports of casualties .
The US Geological Survey said it had hit at about 0915 local time ( 2315 GMT ) and was centred about 29 km ( 18 m ) east of the Pacific state 's city of Lae .
The quake was registered at a depth of 66 km ( 41 m ) .
The island Papua New Guinea shares with Papua is historically prey to volcanic activity , earthquakes and tidal waves .
Officials told AFP news agency that villagers had reported cracks in buildings and a damaged water tank in the Hidden Valley gold - and - silver mine area , near the town of Lae , but no collapsing houses .
" The earthquake was strongly felt , mostly in the Wau and Bulolo areas , " Lawrence Anton , a seismologist at the country 's Geophysical Observatory in Port Moresby , added .
" We would expect a bit of damage to village houses . "
Memo to self :
If I 'm ever on the floor of the U.S.
House , I hope that I make sure that Anthony Weiner is n't in the room before reading a hoax memo as if it were real .
There is n’t one I have n’t heard ” or so goes one of the lines in a well - known American musical .
Yet , this time the world is imbuing the words with new meaning when it comes to US / Israel relations .
The hope is that at long last the US is going to discipline Israel .
Alas , in the flurry of words , the music has not changed .
America seems as much bedazzled by Israel as a parent who is blind to the antics of an over - indulged , demanding child .
No amount of insults seems to shatter their illusion that the precious being is , in fact , a monster .
In their attempts to convince the rest of us not so enamoured , they fail to see that they have allowed their symbiotic relationships to become abusive .
Just as the parent can no longer control a child ’s obnoxious behaviour , so too America finds itself hamstrung by Israel ’s illegal settlement expansion into Palestinian territory and its determination to take and Judaise all of Jerusalem .
And while this time there have been some firm admonishments , there have been no follow - up consequences , America lapsing into the same old routine of placating Israel with promises to keep the faith .
The AIPAC conference in Washington DC provided the meeting place for the usual Israel love - in .
There , Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu plumbed the depths .
He lied when he said that Jews had built Jerusalem 3,000 years ago .
He lied when he said it was theirs to build again .
He lied when he said “ it is our capital ” .
No one pulled him up over those lies .
Instead Secretary of State Hillary Clinton waffled on about how Israel ’s behaviour exposes the daylight between them that others in the region hope to exploit – the same daylight that US Vice - president Biden vowed did not exist between the two countries – and how it endangers the proximity talks and America ’s essential role in bringing those to fruition .
But not before she had told the audience that America ’s commitment to Israel was “ rock solid , enduring , unwavering and forever ” .
Her prime concern was not that Israel ’s behaviour denies millions of Palestinians the right to live in their own homeland and cruelly oppresses those who still do , but rather that America ’s credibility as an honest broker in a long - defunct peace process might be at risk .
Nothing was said about Jerusalem being a corpus separatum under UN trusteeship since the Partition of Palestine in 1947 or that Israel does not have sovereignty over Jerusalem , despite its military conquests .
Not a mention was made that East Jerusalem is occupied territory and that Israel is in breach of international law .
Netanyahu ’s claims over Jerusalem presuppose an “ eternal connection ” between Jews and the land .
But the historical record on that is clear .
Not only are there non-Jewish groups who ruled Jerusalem for centuries rather than the brief 170 years of likely Jewish rule , but also the city existed long before Judaism took form .
On any reading , Jerusalem is no more Jewish than it is Christian or Islamic .
Yet , if anyone can lay claim to it by an “ eternal connection ” , it is the Palestinians whose history goes back millennia to the Canaanites who worshipped pagan deities and then to those who converted to emerging Judaism , Christianity and centuries later to ascendant Islam .
Thus , the three monotheistic religions believe they too have a claim .
For this reason , the 1947 UN Partition resolution sought to give Jerusalem international status as a separate body .
To this day , the international community has refused to officially recognise Israeli sovereignty of Jerusalem .
Notwithstanding this , Israel has pursued an aggressive policy of “ unification ” and “ reunification ” of Jewish Jerusalem by pushing out the boundaries of Palestinian East Jerusalem to some 73 sq km , well into the military - occupied West Bank where Israel has illegally settled some 300,000 Jews .
Secretary Clinton ’s “ no to settlements ” and “ no to natural growth ” at the end of last year were empty words .
Within days , she had eagerly announced that Netanyahu ’s guarantees of no new settlement building and no new land grabs were “ unprecedented ” concessions .
Nothing was said about the building going on in East Jerusalem , let alone the forced evictions of Palestinians , the demolition of their homes and Israeli building policies , which are deliberately skewed towards Jewish population growth .
One has to wonder what meaning words have at all when carefully considered ones are ignored .
A United Nations report of May 2009 put as many as 60,000 Palestinians at risk of eviction from their homes and called for a freeze on demolitions in East Jerusalem .
Yet , the most that Secretary Clinton could say then – 10 months ago – was that Israel ’s actions were “ unhelpful ” in advancing the peace process .
As has happened innumerable times in the past , the chiding words of US emissaries and government officials , are always quickly followed up with other words to reassure Israel of “ the unbreakable bond ” between the two countries , and more significantly , actions that belie the reprimands .
In the midst of all the recent hoo - ha about chilling relations , a $ 210 million arms deal with Israel and paid for by US military aid nevertheless went ahead with an estimated massive $ 3 billion F - 35 warplane deal still in the offing .
In other words , regardless of the song - sheet , America never misses a beat to give Israel what it wants .
It will be interesting to see if the US does withdraw support for Israel in the United Nations on any resolutions before the Security Council critical of Israel ’s settlement policies in occupied East Jerusalem .
The rumours are fulminating amongst denials from both sides .
While to many this signifies a change of heart in America ’s love affair with Israel , it may be no more than the stuff of gossip columns to re-make America ’s image as honest broker in the Middle East .
The disconnect between words and actions might please those who want peace more than they want justice for the Palestinians , but for many , the words have been done to death .
By the time proximity talks morph into full negotiations , there will be no Jerusalem left to negotiate and no Palestinians left in Jerusalem .
All words will then be meaningless .

Gay and lesbian Americans are " uniquely affected " by the relatives - only policy at hospitals , Obama said , adding that they " are often barred from the bedsides of the partners with whom they may have spent decades of their lives - unable to be there for the person they love , and unable to act as a legal surrogate if their partner is incapacitated . "
The president listed widowers without children and members of certain religious orders among those who suffer under the policy .

President Barack Obama has told the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a rule that would not allow hospitals to deny visitation privileges to gay and lesbian partners .

The biggest threat to the natural wicking action which keeps plants in your WaterMizer GrowTainers properly watered at all times is letting the potting MIX get too dry .
This brings the natural wicking action to a screaching halt and it's just a chance I do n't want to take .
It 's far too much trouble to restore the wicking action , so why not make sure it is n't lost in the first place ?
==========
I call this solution The FillTainer and it's based on a simple and reliable law of physics .
Take two glasses and fill them both about half full .
Run a tube -- also filled with water ( no air ) -- between those two glasses with both ends of the tube kept underwater at all times .
If you set one glass up on a book , you 'll notice water will run into the " lower " glass until the water level is exactly the same in both glasses .
If you take that same glass off the book and put it back down on the table , water will flow from the fuller glass until the water level in both glasses is the same again .
==========
So the idea is that our GrowTainer is one of the glasses and our FillTainer is the other one .
A 3/8 " O.D. clear vinyl tube is run between the two containers .
As long as the tube is kept filled with water , and as long as both ends are under water in their respective containers , the fuller container will flow into the less full container until the water level in both containers is exactly the same .
As a practical matter , I 've learned that it 's impossible to fill this tube AND get both ends where they need to be withOUT ending up with a bubble at the highest part of the clear vinyl tube .
My * theory * so far is that as long as the air bubble does n't occupy the full inside diameter of the tube , water will still continue to flow past it in either direction -- as needed -- to keep the water levels in both containers at exactly the same level .
Unfortunately , the clear tube also allows algae growth , but we NEED to be able to SEE to make sure the air bubble does n't get too big .
If it does get too big , it 's a simple matter to re-prime the tube to let the air out .
The best way to accomplish this is with the end of a running garden hose held up to the submerged end of the siphon tube in the FillTainer .
Use your hand as a ' coupling ' between the two loose ends and the surge of water will move the air bubble into the GrowTainer reservoir and restore the siphon action .
A wooden ' dipstick ' with a measured mark on it can be used to confirm WHEN siphon action is lost -- it 's a simple enough thing to check every two or three days .
==========
One can extend this balancing act to any number of containers which are all on the same level .
As the plants take up water through their roots , the water level in the GrowTainer reservoir drops , and water flows from the FillTainer to the GrowTainer -- incrementally and automatically -- so the water level inside the GrowTainer reservoir really never changes enough that you could see it .
All that makes the FillTainer unique is it has a float valve ( a $ 4.56 part which is commonly used on evaporative coolers -- a.k.a. * swamp * coolers ) .
The float valve is connected to a garden hose bibb with a 1/ 4 " white vinyl tube .
The float valve is adjusted to maintain a ' fixed ' water level inside the FillTainer .
Rain can cause the FillTainer to ' overfill ' slightly -- about 1/2 " -- but this added water flows into the GrowTainers too .
Once the level rises about 1 / 2 " above the ' fixed ' water level , the excess flows out the overflow holes in the GrowTainers .
==========
The FillTainer is made from a $ 6.47 tote from Lowe's .
Measure up 6 - 1/2 " to a centerpoint and drill a 3/8 " hole through one short end of the container .
The float valve is installed through this hole .
As this location is above the level at which any excess flows out the overflow holes in the GrowTainers , it does n't have to be perfectly water tight , just secure .
The fiber washer goes up against the inside wall of the tote ; the little nut tightens up against the outside wall -- tighten up snug with pliers or a wrench .
The water level in the GrowTainers is 3 - 1/ 2 " deep BUT there is 2 " of wood underneath , so measure up inside the FillTainer to make a mark at 5 - 1/2 " .
Adjust the float valve arm to maintain the water level at that depth .
Let 's move on to the next step .

Nick Bilton / The New York Times
In 2003 , while still in high school , Christopher Poole , known online as “ Moot , ” started a message board called 4 chan .
The site includes content that many people find offensive .
Nevertheless , or maybe because of it , the site has millions of users and has been responsible for many of the strange memes that have propagated on the Internet , including LOLcats .
The 4 chan site is a jumble of content , hosting anything from pictures of cute kittens to wildly disturbing images and language .
As Gawker ’s Nick Douglas described in 2008 , areas of the Web site involve people hoping to “ shock , entertain , and coax free porn from each other . ”
One of the largest Web forums in the United States , the site continues to influence mainstream culture .
Here is an edited and condensed version of my chat with Mr. Poole :
Nick Bilton :
You go by the name “ Moot . ”
Why ?
Christopher Poole :
As a teenager , I used to use the nickname “ Moo ” as a moniker online , and then I turned into “ Moot ” for fun , which I did n’t even realize was a real word at the time , and it just stuck with me .
How old were you when you started 4 chan ?
I was 15 .
I ’m 22 now .
What were you trying to do when you started the Web site ?
On my summer break , I discovered Japanese animation and I started watching a lot of anime on online forums .
I soon discovered an image - board Web forum called 2 chan , and I had never seen anything like it before .
What really struck me about it was how fast it moved .
Even back then you could sit and hit refresh on your browser and continue to see new content .
So then what happened ?
The code for 2 chan was publicly available , and I took it and translated it from Japanese to English using tools online , and I threw it up on the Web and sent it out to 20 people .
And why did you call it 4 chan ?
I wanted to keep with the 2 chan naming and the URL for 3 chan was taken at the time , so I just jumped to the next number .
No one knew you had any involvement for a long time , right ?
Yes , my parents only found out about it two years ago .
Were you living a double life ?
Yes , I was “ Moot ” online , Chris in school and with my family , and I used other real names with people I met online and told them my name was Robert .
Why did you stay quiet about your involvement for so long ?
I did n’t want my parents to know about 4 chan at first because of the adult content .
By the time I was 18 , and could talk about it , the site had become notorious for its exploits and the adult content on there .
How many users does 4 chan have ?
We started with 20 users .
Now we ’re the largest active forum in the United States , with 8.2 million unique visitors every month and 600 million page loads per month .
People are on the site are on for an average of 19 minutes at a time and look at 30 pages each .
On top of that , we ’re currently getting 800,000 new posts a day .
So do you make any money from the site ?
Technically , yes .
Functionally , no .
The site is technically profitable .
We do a little more than break even , but no - one is taking a paycheck .
You keep saying “ we . ”
How many people work on the site ?
The site does n’t have any employees .
I have a part - time developer in Georgia , and I also have 30 volunteer moderators .
So , technically , there are n’t any employees receiving a paycheck , including me .
So how do you make money ?
The site breaks even , and I do some odd jobs .
Has anyone offered to buy 4 chan ?
When I was 17 , I was approached by an online Japanese toy store and they offered me $ 15,000 for the Web site .
I told them I was n’t interested in selling , so they bumped the price up to $ 45,000 .
I said No . I have n’t received another offer in the past five years .
Would you sell the site today ?
It depends .
If someone was looking to gut it for traffic , then absolutely not .
But if they were committed to the site and its goals , then I ’d consider it .
Have the police ever contacted you ?
Yes , in late 2006 someone posted a bomb threat on the site that was a competition between some friends to propagate something into the news .
He succeeded but was bragging about it at work and was arrested .
Then , last year , a user was accused of compromising Sarah Palin ’s e-mail account and posting it on 4 chan before it ended up on Gawker .
4 chan ’s community can be very powerful .
Can they be controlled ?
Well , last year they voted me as Time ’s most influential person of the year , but the community can also be very fickle .
For example , I did n’t know about the Time magazine stunt until it was well under way .
If I asked the community to do this , they would have done everything in their power to make sure that I was at the bottom of that list — that ’s just the way they work .
I like to leave them to their own devices .
4 chan members can be a bit ruthless , too , right ?
I get a lot of e-mail messages from people who say thanks for giving them a place to vent , an outlet to say what they ca n’t say in real life with friends and work colleagues — things that they know are wrong , but they still want to say .
Is it right ?
No , of course not .
People say some disgusting , vile things .
But just because we are hosting it does n’t mean we agree with it .
I do n’t support what they are saying ; I just support that there is a site like that to say that .
Do you support anonymity online ?
Someone I recently met at the TED conference told me “ part of the magic of youth is that people are able to forgive and forget . ”
As kids , we say stupid things , and because there ’s not a record of it , nobody is going to give you a hard time at 30 years old about something you said or did when you were 8 years old .
Online , you have all these social networks that are moving to a state of persistent identity , and in turn , we ’re sacrificing the ability to be youthful .
In 10 years , everything you say and do will be visible online , and I think it ’s really unfortunate .
So what ’s next ?
I ’m working on a new project to reimagine what an image board should be today using the current technologies available .
Can you tell me more about it ?
Not really , sorry .
But our code is a decade old , the foundation is really rickety and the layout is old .
So imagine if you were to start 4 chan today , what would it look like , how would it work with a modern browser .
It ’s kind of like a reboot , but it will be something separate to 4chan .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Federal regulators said they were looking into a report of another runaway Toyota Prius , this one in Westchester County , New York , where police said a woman pulling out of a driveway zoomed across a busy street and into a stone wall .
The 56 - year - old driver sustained nonlife - threatening injuries on Tuesday when the 2005 Prius she was operating knocked some large boulders from the wall after the crash , said Capt .
Anthony Marraccini , acting police chief in Harrison , New York , which is about 25 miles northeast of New York City .
“ Toyota has expressed interest in taking the vehicle , ” Marraccini said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday .
Toyota Motor Corp officials could not immediately be reached for a comment .
It was the second straight day in which an incident of reported uncontrolled acceleration by a Prius attracted media attention , adding to product safety woes that have damaged the automaker ’s reputation and led to the recall of more than 8 million vehicles .
On Monday , a California man said his 2008 Prius sped out of control on a California freeway .
The man , 61 , said his car accelerated beyond his control after he overtook another vehicle in San Diego County .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is aware of the incident and is looking into the matter , said Olivia Alair , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Transportation .
The woman , who was not identified , was driving on a long , curving driveway when the Prius accelerated beyond her control , Marraccini said , adding that the two - lane road she sped across is a “ fairly busy ” street .
She traveled 150 to 200 feet , he said , before the Prius ’ front end struck the rock wall -- built with boulders weighing some 500 to 1,000 pounds -- with such force that it “ hurled those boulders 10 or 15 feet away . ”
“ The floor mat is not a contributing factor , ” Marraccini said , adding that it was firmly secured .
He said the car had previously been taken to a nearby Toyota dealership by the owner after the model was recalled .
Toyota recalled 2004 - 2009
Prius models last November as part of a wide - ranging safety recall to fix loose floor mats that can trap the accelerator and cause unintended acceleration .
Holy crap , this video truly is the most awesome thing ever !!11one !11 .
I know nothing about this , other than what 's on the YouTube description : " Promo for Giorgio Moroder taken from a Casablanca Records promo tape . "
I was talking with Joel Johnson about how creepy Moroder seemed in this video , with the pervo- stache and the cocaine shades .
" But he mades the trains boogie on time , " says Joel .
Mr. Moroder is still very much with us , btw : he is 69 years old , and actively composing .
Here 's his website .
When you 're done watching , go listen to this ( or buy it ) .
I think it 's my favorite Moroder track .
CHICAGO : The governor of Oklahoma is considering tough new abortion bills that would allow doctors to withhold test results showing foetal defects and require women to answer intrusive questions .
The results of the questionnaires would be posted online .
Women would also be required to have a vaginal ultrasound and listen to a detailed description of the embryo or foetus in a third bill passed by the legislature on Monday .
The requirements would be among the most '' extreme ' ' in the US and were similar to those struck down by a state court as unconstitutional earlier this year , the Centre for Reproductive Rights said on Tuesday .
'' Despite the prospect and cost of additional legal challenges , the legislature is determined to severely limit women 's ability to get an abortion in the state , approving laws with clear constitutional flaws and with absolute disregard for women 's rights and health , '' the centre said in a statement urging a veto of the bills .
gen - class – how it works and how to use it
Clojure runs on the JVM .
Sometimes you have to interface to Java libraries ( or be interfaced ) .
In such a case one supporting helper is gen-class .
However it 's use is not straight - forward .
So let 's gain some understanding in how it works and how to use it .
Why Classes ?
Java – being object oriented – is based classes and interfaces .
To leverage existing Java libraries with Clojure it is sometimes necessary to hook into the class system , eg. deriving from an existing class or by implementing an interface .
Besides proxy Clojure provides the gen-class utility for this purpose .
However using gen-class is not always straight forward .
So we have to first understand what is going on behind the scenes .
The Anatomy of `gen - class`
Let 's see how a class is defined with gen-class .
For convenience we can to this similar to :use or : require in the ns clause .
( ns some .
Example ( : gen-class ) ) ( defn - toString [ this ]
" Hello , World ! " )
This defines a class called some .
Example .
Since we did n't specify a super class the class implicitly inherits from Object .
We implement a custom .
toString method by means of the - toString function .
Huh ? „ function “ ?
Yes .
- toString is a usual Clojure function .
Note how the function gets the actual object as first argument !
user= > ( - toString ( some .
Example . ) )
" Hello , World ! " user= > ( .toString ( some .
Example . ) )
" Hello , World ! "
How does this fit together ?
The ns clause defines a class , but it also defines a namespace .
The class defined simply contains stubs , which refer to the Clojure functions in the namespace .
To find the correct functions we need some naming convention .
Here it is the prefix - .
But we could just as well choose a different prefix .
( ns some .
Example ( : gen-class : prefix method- ) ) ( defn method - toString [ this ]
" Hello , World ! " )
In fact not only the prefix is configurable .
Also the namespace itself is not tied to the class name .
So we can define several classes in a single namespace .
( ns some.name.space ) ( gen-class : name some.name.space.ClassA : prefix classA- ) ( gen-class :name some.name.space.ClassB : prefix classB- ) ( defn classA - toString [ this ]
" I'm an A. " ) ( defn classB - toString [ this ]
" I'm a B . " )
Interfaces and Classes
Just working with Object is not very exciting nor very helpful .
So let 's implement an interface .
We choose Clojure 's IDeref .
( ns some .
Example ( : gen-class :implements [ clojure.lang.IDeref ] ) ) ( defn - deref [ this ]
" Hello , World ! " )
We can test , whether it works .
user= > @ ( some .
Example . ) " Hello , World ! "
So implementing an interface is easy .
How about deriving from another class ?
( ns some .
Example2 ( : gen-class : extends some .
Example ) )
And again the test to see that some .
Example2 really inherits the deref implementation .
user= > @ ( some .
Example2 . ) " Hello , World ! "
State
So far it 's still quite boring .
We only get to see „ Hello , World ! “ .
Pff .
So let 's add some state to our class .
However we cannot add fields like in Java .
We have only on single field available called – surprise !
– state .
( ns some .
Example ( : gen-class :implements [ clojure.lang .IDeref ] : state state : init init : constructors { [ String ] [ ] } ) ) ( defn - init [ message ] [ [ ] message ] ) ( defn - deref [ this ] ( . state this ) )
Now we get some new stuff here .
Let 's see :
: state defines a method which will return the object 's state .
defines a method which will return the object 's state .
: init defines the name of the initialiser .
This is a function which has to return a vector .
The first element is again a vector of arguments to the super class constructor .
In our case this is just the empty vector .
The second element is the object 's state .
defines the name of the initialiser .
This is a function which has to return a vector .
The first element is again a vector of arguments to the super class constructor .
In our case this is just the empty vector .
The second element is the object 's state .
: constructors finally maps the arguments of the class ' constructor to the arguments of the super class ' constructor .
This is used to determine which constructor is supposed to be called .
Again the test :
user= > @ ( some .
Example .
" Hallo , Welt ! " )
" Hallo , Welt ! "
But we have still one gotcha : the state is – in typical Clojure fashion – immutable .
To change it after object creation , we have to resort to Clojure 's state managing facilities .
( defn - init [ message ] [ [ ] ( atom message ) ] ) ( defn - deref [ this ] @ ( . state this ) )
And the obligatory test :
user= > ( def o ( some .
Example .
" Hallo , Welt ! " ) ) #' user / o user= > @ o " Hallo , Welt ! " user= > ( reset ! ( .state o ) " Здравей , свят " ) " Здравей , свят " user= > @ o " Здравей , свя т "
So using an atom or a ref combined with a map we can save arbitrary things in the state of our object .
Custom Methods
Sometimes it is also required to define custom methods .
They are declared in the gen-class clause and implemented by Clojure functions in the usual way .
( ns some .
Example ( : gen-class : methods [ [ show [ ] void ] [ showMessage [ String ] void ] ] ) ) ( defn - show [ this ] ( println " Hello , World ! " ) ) ( defn - showMessage [ this msg ] ( println msg ) )
However , you should not declare methods which are already present in implemented interfaces or extended super classes .
By adding metadata – via # ^{:static true} – to a method declaration you can also define static methods .
Hints and Quirks
As long as you do n't redefine the class ' signature you have to compile the class only once .
The „ method “ functions can be re-defined as often as you like , eg. when working with SLIME or VimClojure .
If you have two generated classes where one depends on the other , you should add also a require in the defining namespace .
This resolves order issues for AOT compilation .
AOT compilation ties the generated files to the Clojure version used for compilation .
So if possible avoid gen-class and use proxy .
You have to fully qualify all classnames .
Only classes and interfaces from the java.lang package can be abbreviated .
There are abbreviations for the primitive types , eg. void instead of Void / TYPE or int for Integer / TYPE .
Further Features
There are a lot of features like expose - methods , main and others which do n't fit here .
But the above should make it easier to understand how they work .
So dive in and experiment a little .
gen -class is a bit special but still tamable .
London , England ( CNN ) --
It is one of the most abundant natural resources , providing around a quarter of the world 's total energy and powering over 40 percent of our electricity supplies .
But it 's also one of the dirtiest with the world 's 2,300 coal - fired power stations contributing around 40 percent of all man-made emissions , according to the World Coal Institute .
Their continued use enrages many environmentalists who argue that we should be phasing coal out .
But the coal industry is pinning its hopes on the rather oxymoronic - sounding " clean coal , " which has become the umbrella term for a range of new technologies that share the aim of cleaning up coal in the 21st century .
Earth 's Frontiers takes a look at the options :
Pre-combustion
According to the UK's Scottish Center for Carbon Storage ( SCCS ) , this method -- provided it is used in tandem with CO2 storage -- has the potential to create almost emission - free fuel .
Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle ( IGCC ) -- as it is commonly known -- involves capturing CO2 in three stages .
Firstly , the coal ( a hydrocarbon fuel ) is converted into hydrogen and carbon monoxide ( CO ) to form a synthesis gas .
The CO is then converted into CO2 by reacting it with water before the CO2 is separated from the hydrogen .
SCCS says the technology has been proven at an industrial scale and is low - risk but requires a high investment , and the efficiency of the coal then burned to power turbines is compromised .
Oxy - fuel combustion
Coal is burned in pure oxygen -- instead of air -- which creates an exhaust stream containing around 90 percent CO2 ( the other ten percent is water vapor ) , making it easier to separate .
The only downside to this method is that it requires a lot of energy to remove the CO2 .
SCCS says new technology called chemical looping combustion is being developed .
If done properly , there are virtually no emissions and could be retrofitted to existing coal - fired power stations .
Swedish power company Vattenfall is currently testing this method at the Schwarze Pumpe plant in Germany .
Post - combustion
This involves removing CO2 from flue gases after coal has been burned .
It 's already been installed at a few gas - fired power stations like Snohvit 's liquid natural gas facility in Norway .
One of its attractions is that it can be fitted to existing coal - fired power stations .
CO2 is removed by passing it through a solvent which absorbs it .
Another idea being developed uses quicklime ( calcium oxide ) which produces limestone .
Needless to say , the process requires additional energy which SCCS estimates would raises costs by nearly a third .
The technology is already available but is used on a much smaller scale .
The unknowns of scaling up the technology make it a less attractive proposition according to the SCCS .
Storage
Providing that carbon capture can become economically viable , vast amounts of CO2 will need to be stored .
There are a number of projects around the world where carbon sequestration are being tested , with many others at the planning stage .
According to the SCCS , CO2 can be injected into depleted oil and gas reservoirs , non-mineable coal seams , the ocean or deep saline aquifers which offer great capacity .
An impermeable cap rock above storage sites would stop CO2 leaking back out .
But some scientists remain concerned .
March Wentworth , a clean energy advocate from the Union of Concerned Scientists says questions remain about pumping CO2 thousands of feet underground .
" We 're not yet knowing where it 's going , not knowing what the liability questions are , if it should bubble to the surface , and what the health impacts are , " Wentworth told CNN .

This year people are talking about Michael Schumacher .
They are talking about Lewis and Jenson at McLaren .
They are talking about that Spanish chap , Alonso , winning for Ferrari .
They are not talking so much about Felipe Massa .
Over the past few seasons Brazilian Felipe Massa has proven himself to be a consistent race winner and in 2008 was unlucky to be beaten to the championship by a single point .
How he and Ferrari must rue the time he left the pits in Singapore with the fuel rig still attached ?
If Ferrari have produced a good car this year , and all pre-season indicators point to them having a very quick car , then Massa is surely a top contender for the title ?
A combination of the arrival of Alonso to his team and the fact he is coming back from a horrific injury , where his skull was fractured by a Brawn spring during qualifying for last year ’s Hungarian Grand Prix , means that people are unsure about Massa .
Even though he has confidence in himself , even he wo n’t really know if he still is as good he as was until he actually competes in Bahrain .
The signs are good .
Very good .
During pre-season testing he clearly demonstrated that he can drive quickly and with great skill .
Experts watching him around the track at Jerez , for example , marvelled at his smoothness , consistency and ability to get on the power early .
He is an underestimated driver whose arrival into F1 , with Sauber in 2002 , did not send shock waves through the sport .
He appeared to be quick , but prone to mistakes ( he span off several times ) and in his rookie year scored less points than his teammate Nick Heidfeld ( 4pts and 7 pts respectively ) .
The following year Sauber replaced him with Heinz - Harald Frentzen and he became the Ferrari test driver .
Frentzen retired at the end of 2003 and Sauber rehired him to partner Giancarlo Fisichella , but he only scored 12 points compared to Fisichella ’s 22
In 2005 he stayed at Sauber , this time with former world champion Jacques Villeneuve as his teammate .
He only scored 11 points , but was quicker than Villeneuve and outscored him in the championship .
Massa was improving as a driver , being quick but making less and less mistakes .
His big break was landing a seat with Ferrari in 2006 , partnering Michael Schumacher in his final season ( at least , we thought it would be his last ! ) .
This would be an extremely important season for Felipe , as for his career to continue , his driving would have to mature and develop .
Massa initially showed good speed but had a couple of spins and crashes .
As the season went on he improved .
He got his first podium at the Nurburgring , had the fastest lap in Barcelona and got his first pole position and win at the Turkish Grand Prix .
He scored 80 pts overall , 41 pts less than Schumacher but had established a bond with Michael that since then has grown into a friendship .
Schumacher stayed with Ferrari as a consultant and gave Massa great advice and support and this seems to have really helped Massa take his driving to the next level .
In 2007 he had Finnish driver and highly regarded Kimi Raikkonen as his teammate at Ferrari .
Raikkonen would win the championship ( 110 pts compared to Massa ’s 94pts ) but Felipe ’s driving impressed everyone in the paddock and knew he was unlucky not to be in contention to win the title .
He had some technical problems at the Australian GP and a bad start at Malaysia meant a 5th place was the only reward for achieving pole position .
He was disqualified at the Canadian GP for leaving the pit lane with a red light showing .
However , he did win the Grand Prix of Bahrain and Spain ( both from pole position ) and won again in Turkey .
He would have won in Brazil , but let his teammate pass so Raikkonen could win the Championship from the McLaren ’s of Hamilton and Alonso by a single point .
2008 was the season that Massa could have so easily been world champion .
His first two races , however , were disastrous and he crashed out in Australia and then spun off in Malaysia ( after achieving pole ) .
He rectified the situation in Bahrain where he dominated the weekend and won easily from his teammate .
Massa gradually reeled in the results and closed in on championship leader Hamilton .
As they went to the inaugural Singapore GP there was only one point separating them and Massa took pole by an impressive 0.6secs from Hamilton .
During a pit stop he was given the all clear to leave but the refuelling rig was still attached and he drove the length of the pitlane with it still hanging on his car .
Removing it and a consequential driver - through penalty meant he finished the race with no points .
He went into the final race at Brazil knowing if he won and Hamilton was only 6th or less he would be world champion .
This so nearly came true as Massa won and as Lewis entered the last lap he was in 6th place , but sensationally managed to overtake a struggling Timo Glock on the second - to - last corner and so Hamilton won the championship .
This must have been gutting for Massa but he had proved to everyone he was most definitely World Champion material .
In 2008 and in 2009 , up until his terrible accident , he was quicker than Raikkonen .
Make no mistake about it , he will be a force to be reckoned with in the 2010 championship and of the leading contenders certainly deserves it the most .
Look for him to be good in Bahrain , he often does very well there .
A synthetic chemical known as MDAI has already emerged as a successor to the drug mephedrone , which was banned in Britain this weekend .
Analysts at the Psychonaut Research Project , an EU - funded organisation based at King 's College London , which monitors the internet for new trends in drug abuse , said it had identified the substance as the likeliest contender to replace the former " legal high " .
Co-principal investigator Paolo Deluca said : " Websites are already starting to promote MDAI and this could become the next popular product . "
The drug replicates many of the effects of MDMA , or ecstasy , and was developed as an antidepressant by a team at Purdue University in the US during the 1990s .
Experts believe its chemical blueprint could soon be mass - produced by the Chinese manufacturers who flooded the UK with mephedrone .
Last year mephedrone became the fourth - most popular drug in Britain behind cannabis , cocaine , and ecstasy .
The many websites selling mephedrone closed down last week with the final deadline for placing online orders 3 pm on Wednesday .
At the same time , sites began advertising or offering MDAI , most describing it as a " research chemical " .
One of the most popular mephedrone websites states : " New products for April – MDAI . "
Another announced the arrival of MDAI by declaring it was " proud to introduce a new compound to our product range " .
The cost of the chemical is about twice that of mephedrone , with a gram – which users say is enough for five hits – costing £ 25 .
Other online drug stores said they would soon sell substances that could circumvent the measures recently rushed through parliament to make mephedrone and its related compounds a Class B substance .
Internet forums have surfaced in which MDAI users detail their experiences of the drug .
Positive comments included a " snug " or " comfort - cloak " feeling ; some described a " moderate serotonin burnout " , or mild comedown .
" Do n't think it would be to everyone 's tastes , there 's no rushing / stimulation / euphoria like with other legals ; it 's more of a therapeutic feeling , " one user said .
Deluca said : " Users will decide if it is worth the money .
If it is deemed not as powerful as ecstasy or cocaine , then it might not become as popular .
But because it is an antidepressant with research status , it will make it much more difficult to declare illegal . "
The Psychonaut Research Project publishes reports to help states quickly identify new trends in drug abuse .
The team identified mephedrone in 2008 , long before it hit the headlines .
Among the organisations that receive its updates is the US military so that officers can determine what drugs its personnel might be tempted to use when serving abroad .
Deluca said that researchers were examining Scandinavia , because drug takers there are more experimental and can provide an early indicator of new substances that will later become popular on a wider scale in Britain .
The first reported death involving mephedrone was in Sweden in 2008 .
Deluca said that , in addition to MDAI , it had also identified another synthetic substance – NRG - 1 – that could become popular , but which the government 's drug advisers are already looking at banning .
Professor Les Iversen , chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , recently said it intended to review NRG , which is widely prescribed in France as an appetite suppressant .
Solange Xavier ’s house in Port - au - Prince disintegrated like a sand castle when the 7.0 earthquake rocked Haiti on Jan. 12 .
The quake also killed her son .
Ms. Xavier spent last weekend in Les Cayes , some 95 miles southeast of the capital , taking a much needed respite .
But on the bus ride home torrential rains nearly carried her away .
Blind in one eye , Xavier watched in horror as livestock , suitcases , and dishes floated by .
Officials reported that at least a quarter of the town took on rivers of runoff water a meter and a half deep , damaging homes and spreading panic , particularly among those earthquake victims camped out in yards and open spaces .
At least eight people were killed .
“ If the rains could do this now – before the real rainy season – what is going to happen to those of us living in tents in Port - au - Prince ?
Or people sleeping on the street ? ” she asked .
“ We are all going to be dead . ”
That 's the issue weighing on the minds of most Haitians – and the thousands of aid workers from around the world who are helping the devastated Caribbean nation .
For weeks after the quake , Haitian authorities and international aid groups were grateful for the lack of rain as they scrambled to prepare for the torrential downpours common during Haiti 's rainy season , which usually begins in April .
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ( IFRC ) , which is coordinating shelter response , estimates that nearly 40 percent of the 1.3 earthquake victims now have some form of shelter .
But hundreds of thousands more are living in the open or under flimsy sheets tied to thin strips of wood .
Early rains pelted them , caused mudslides and increased concern that time is running out before the rainy season .
“ Some in the international community failed to understand just how crucial securing temporary shelter and sanitation systems would be , given the imminent arrival of the rainy season , ” said William G. O’Neill , director of the Conflict Prevention and Peace Forum in New York after a recent visit to Haiti .
“ Someone should take a hard look at what went wrong in the humanitarian planning system . ”
UN works on ' decongestion '
The United Nations has identified 21 of the 415 spontaneous settlements throughout Port - au - Prince as a priority for " decongestion " but that still leaves 350,000 people unaccounted for .
The new government plan , to relocate people back to their neighborhoods as opposed to establishing large camps outside the capital , has been criticized due to concerns about safety .
Partially collapsed homes sit next to destroyed ones ; chunks of cement and twisted rebar are perched precariously close to makeshift homes in the middle of the street .
Aftershocks are as frequent as the sound of cement being dumped into pickup trucks
The first of the new government settlements , a 96 - family tent camp in front of the collapsed cathedral , has relieved some of the stress for those who were among the 60,000 living on the Champs de Mars square in front of the palace .
New residents , like 26 - year old Caitlin Maurice , also received rice , beans , and cooking oil .
“ The government , finally , is starting to do something , ” said the mother of three .
“ But it ’s hardly enough .
We still do n’t have toilets . ”
The Haitian Red Cross Society has 5,000 volunteers working on providing water and sanitation .
The IRFC plans to build at least 20,000 transitional homes and the government is exploring alternative housing options .
Consultants are urging the government to use its executive power to take control of privately owned land for these settlements .
If not , they worry , people will stay where they are or return to houses that were n’t safe in the first place .
" When it rains [ hard ] , these [ tents and tarps ] will not provide much protection , and we all know that , ” said IRFC spokesman Alex Wynter .
" The real issue in Haiti is land , land , and again land . ”

Having recently found myself in need of an anecdote with which to make some allegedly clever point about man ’s track record in predicting his own technological innovations , I recalled a story that had made the rounds in the months leading up to 2000 , during which time the nation ’s periodicals were running retrospectives on the soon - to - be - completed 20th century .
Some great number of the resulting feature articles of that era ended up beginning with the same account of a U.S. patent clerk who had resigned his post in 1899 with the explanation that everything worth inventing had already been invented .
The incident seemed to me sufficiently amusing to be thrown into the essay as filler , which is the stuff that writers throw into essays when they get sick of their own writing ( unless I ’m the only one who does this , in which case the term does not actually exist ) .
At any rate , the story would serve as a fine illustration of the manner by which even attentive individuals often overlook the indications that great change is afoot .
A few moments and Google search terms later , though , I had learned that this oft - repeated anecdote was almost certainly false .
The patent clerk myth had been printed as fact in quite a few respected publications throughout 1999 — this , despite that very same myth having been debunked by the Skeptical Inquirer back in 1989 .
Ten years after the tale was shown to be false , a number of professional journalists and their fact - checkers got wind of it and determined it to be true .
Yet another ten years on , I recalled the tale and was able to determine it to be false — and after less than half a minute of thing - clicking .
This is hardly to my credit ; I was simply working in an informational landscape vastly superior to that which existed a decade ago .
For instance , humanity has made impressive strides with regards to the results one may obtain by way of thing - clicking .
Look back to 1989 , when the Skeptical Inquirer article in question was released .
Tens of thousands of people may have read the piece at that time and found it interesting , but altogether the author was unable to have much positive impact on the public understanding .
The limitations of the era made it quite unlikely anyone who read the piece would happen to be in a position to use the information therein in any significant manner ; conversely , those who could have used the information in some way that would be of measurable benefit were quite unlikely to have known that such a useful article existed , much less been able to locate it , and thus it was that some dozen or so feature editors ran the myth as fact .
In terms of its utility to the public understanding , then , the article might as well not even have existed until it existed on the Internet .
Taken together , the rise of the search engine coupled with the digitalization of vast amounts of information that would have previously been either difficult or impossible to access has provided us with unprecedented opportunities to debunk that which requires debunking , as well as to ensure that a given debunking is particularly accessible to those who happen to be looking into a given subject .
This is just as well ; the rise of such things as e-mail forwards have provided our not - so - skeptical adversaries with similarly unprecedented opportunities to perpetuate things that need to be debunked , which you ’ve probably experienced to the extent that you ’re included in the address books of people in whose address books you were not really intending to be included .
The question that naturally arises , then , concerns whether the particular dynamics of the Internet have had the overall effect of fueling nonsense or throttling it .
The reader will agree that the extent and nature of the stimuli that one takes in has some effect on the content one accumulates in one ’s mind ; the reader will just as readily agree that the Internet has some effect in turn on the extent and nature of the stimuli one takes in .
To the extent that one uses the Internet , then , one is subjected to a different array of stimuli than if one did not use the Internet .
We thus establish that the Internet does indeed have some effect on the content one accumulates in one ’s mind .
Less immediately obvious , though still fairly obvious , is the extent to which a given medium has an effect not only on the user ’s knowledge base , but even the structure of the mind itself , and thus in turn its potential products .
The adaptation of writing by the classical Greeks , for instance , appears to have brought radical changes in the nature of Greek output , allowing for a fundamentally greater degree of abstract thought than was previously possible and allowing in turn for systems of ethics and high philosophical commentary of the sort that we do not seem to find in the oral output of the pre-alphabet Greeks or any preliterate culture , in fact .
Plainly , this is an extreme example , and the transition from orality to literacy is likely of more severity in terms of the cognition of the user than is the transition from the printing press to the Internet ( both of which are merely sub- mediums by which literacy may be conveyed ) .
Even so , the severity of the former is of sufficiently high degree that the lesser severity of the latter is nonetheless potentially quite great in its own right .
The shift from a textual environment defined by the printing press to one providing for the Internet as well , then , must have some undefined impact — perhaps even a great one — on the cognitive abilities of those of us who have participated in the transition , as well as those who will have grown up in the post - transition era .
The attentive reader will notice that we have yet to establish whether or not the cognitive impact that we have determined to exist along with the impact on one ’s knowledge base is a good or bad thing in terms of the mind ’s overall functioning .
The more widely - read attentive reader will notice that my assertion to the effect that the Internet has any cognitive effect at all is itself controversial and is in fact disputed by a number of prominent neuroscientists and others whose views on the subject would presumably merit attention .
Before we continue , such objections ought to be addressed .
In January of this year , the publication Edge released the responses to a question its editors had posed to dozens of authors , journalists , artists , and scientists : “ How is the Internet changing the way you think ? ”
The results were picked up by such mainstream outlets as Newsweek , from which science editor Sharon Begley makes the following observation :
Although a number of contributors drivel on about , say , how much time they waste on e-mail , the most striking thing about the 50 - plus answers is that scholars who study the mind and the brain , and who therefore seem best equipped to figure out how the Internet alters thought , shoot down the very idea .
For instance , Harvard cognitive neuroscientist Joshua Butler responded to the question in part by way of the following :
The Internet has n’t changed the way we think anymore than the microwave oven has changed the way we digest food .
The Internet has provided us with unprecedented access to information , but it has n’t changed what we do with it once it ’s made it into our heads .
This is because the Internet does n’t ( yet ) know how to think .
We still have to do it for ourselves , and we do it the old - fashioned way .
Until then , the Internet will continue to be nothing more , and nothing less , than a very useful , and very dumb , butler .
Others , including some with backgrounds in neuroscience as well as psychology and related fields , expressed agreement with this general conclusion , if not necessarily for the same reasons .
And thus Begley is correct to note that “ scholars who study the mind and brain ” dismiss the idea that “ the Internet alters thought . ”
But as she herself makes clear later in her piece , other scholars of similar and even identical areas of expertise entirely embrace the idea , while still others identify it as a reasonable possibility .
One might wonder how Begley decided that the “ most striking thing ” about the answers is that some mind - oriented scholars dismissed the idea of the Internet ’s impact on thinking , rather than that other mind - oriented scholars embraced it .
Begley herself quotes several of the latter group and even makes her own passing reference to “ the ( few ) positive changes in thinking the Internet has caused ” after having quoted additional experts who likewise ascribe to the concept of the Internet having an effect on the thinking of its users , although considering such changes to be largely negative .
One might conclude that the truly “ most striking thing ” about the results is that mind - oriented experts are in fact split three ways on whether the Internet has positive , negative , or no effects whatsoever on the mental processes of those who use it , while others consider the truth to be undetermined .
Of those opinions expressed to the effect that Internet use has either no or negative effects , several appear not to make much sense .
Begley provides a briefer version of the following excerpt from the answer given by Foreign Policy contributing editor Evgeny Morozov :
What I find particularly worrisome with regards to the “ what ” question is the rapid and inexorable disappearance of retrospection and reminiscence from our digital lives .
One of the most significant but overlooked Internet developments of 2009 — the arrival of the so - called “ real - time Web ” , whereby all new content is instantly indexed , read , and analyzed — is a potent reminder that our lives are increasingly lived in the present , completely detached even from the most recent of the pasts … .
In a sense , this is hardly surprising : the social beast that has taken over our digital lives has to be constantly fed with the most trivial of ephemera .
And so we oblige , treating it to countless status updates and zetabytes of multimedia ( almost a thousand photos are uploaded to Facebook every second ! ) .
This hunger for the present is deeply embedded in the very architecture and business models of social networking sites .
Regardless of what one thinks of Facebook , it is difficult to see that Morozov has really shown that an obsession with photos and other records of the past somehow denotes some unseemly and unwarranted “ hunger for the present . ”
It would be even more difficult to see how the nature of the Internet , which has provided unprecedentedly facilitated access to the whole of the past at least to the extent that the past has been recorded , is of any greater detriment to man ’s collective focus on that which came before him .
Sitting in an easy chair in some unscrubbed corner of Brooklyn , I may obtain , within just a few seconds , a general summary of any known event in the history of man or nature , coupled with links to more specific and comprehensive sources of information on some great number of aspects of such an event , including those pieces of data from which the general summary was originally composed in the first place .
How long would this have taken in the 1950s , even for someone with the advantage of residing in some cultural node equipped with fine libraries , universities , and potentially accessible experts ?
It would have likely taken at least an hour even in such an optimal environment as the grounds of a university , which is the sort of place that not even a student is likely to be at any given moment , if memory serves , which it very well may not .
It would certainly not have taken a mere ten seconds , as it would today for me to learn something about , for instance , the Russo - Japanese War .
Incidentally , I just Googled that term , clicked on a link to its Wikipedia article , browsed the table of contents found at the top of that page , went straight to a subsection of that article , read the assertion that Japanese civilians were on the whole not particularly happy with the extent to which Japan pressed Russia for concessions after its victory , and then verified that this was the case by clicking on a citation which in turn led me to the text of a newspaper account of the treaty in question —
a New York Times article from 1905 , itself one of the millions of artifacts to which our predecessors would have been unable to receive access without some degree of wasted time and difficulty , if at all .
The past has never been anywhere near as accessible , nor as accessed , yet some complain that the Internet has prompted us to become “ completely detached ” from the past in the favor of the present , which itself has never been so lacking in accessible content relative to that which came before .
Naturally , other sorts of objections are raised in the responses .
University of California neurobiologist Leo Chalupa challenges the Internet ’s utility in a manner that does not seem to draw on his relevant specialty :
The Internet is the greatest detractor to serious thinking since the invention of television .
Moreover , while the Internet provides a means for rapidly communicating with colleagues globally , the sophisticated user will rarely reveal true thoughts and feelings in such messages .
Serious thinking requires honest and open communication and that is simply untenable on the Internet by those that value their professional reputation .
I know of no situation in which “ honest and open communication ” is necessarily tenable in the first place , although Chalupa is correct that there is more to lose in conveying unpopular thoughts by way of some facet of the Internet , which , as he notes , “ provides a means for rapidly communicating with colleagues globally ” and could thus be used to more widely convey some opinion that would consequently evoke some negative reaction from one ’s fellows , particularly if one ’s fellows are easily upset .
But surely Chalupa has some useful information to convey that will not enrage his colleagues , and at any rate one would expect that the majority of the information he’d be inclined to disseminate by way of the Internet would be of value , and not damage , either to the world or to his own reputation .
And surely the majority of accessible information is worth being made available to the majority of connected humans , and certainly the information to which one is likely to expose oneself on the Internet is , on the whole , accurate , and thus potentially useful .
Certainly there is misinformation to be found and in some cases believed , and certainly there is some degree of irrelevant information that one might be inclined to take in at the expense of time dedicated to other , more useful pursuits .
But the objection that the Internet ’s facilitation of information flow may damage one ’s “ professional reputation ” due to one ’s colleagues being unable to handle one ’s awesome yet edgy ideas does not strike me as a particularly damning condemnation of the communications age , although it may tell us something about neurobiology , which sounds more and more interesting .
There are certainly downsides — of both the merely potential and nearly universal sorts — to use of the Internet , particularly if the one doing the using is proceeding in an undisciplined manner .
Even its advantages are potential traps , as is known to anyone who has sought out data on some relevant thing like Chinese wheat production only to spend two hours learning the plots of various Japanese role playing games .
The potential for information addiction is real .
But upon the harnessing of fire , man must have wasted quite a bit of time staring into it even after having properly utilized it in cooking his meals .
Every new invention entails a test of our will .
Still , I will not cop out of this argument by suddenly declaring that we all have free will and what will be will be , a tact that God is always taking out of plain intellectual cowardice .
Rather , I will note again that the views expressed above regarding the Internet ’s lack of impact on the human mind are countered by views to the contrary held by individuals with just as much claim to our attention by virtue of academic background as those with whom they are in disagreement .
While the credentialed debate the subject , we may consider that the perpetuation of information has , on average , been a positive thing for humanity ’s station on the planet , where we were once in actual competition with its other inhabitants but have since outran them all and are now preparing to decide which of our old adversaries will get to accompany us to Mars .
Insomuch as the knowledge we have gained will soon allow us to spread the planet ’s life beyond the planet ’s own confines and thus to perpetuate it well beyond its earth - bound potential , and to the extent that we favor the perpetuation of life , we ought to agree that the process by which we have obtained the means to accomplish all of this — the general uptrend in the average human being ’s access to information — might very well be something worth maintaining .
And then we might remember that no one is seriously arguing that the Internet has not increased the average human being ’s access to information .
Whatever other effects it may have on one ’s mind , it is at least providing it with the unprecedented potential that comes with having one ’s mind satiated as the mind wills .
Likewise , it brings the revolutionary novelty that arises when individuals can obtain any information in any combination , individuals being to some degree defined by the information that informs their thoughts .
No biologist should object to the mixing of genes ; no humanist should object to the mixing of memes .
Though it has not been proven that the Internet has some overall cognitive effect on its users that we would deem positive , those who are convinced that the effect is largely negative or even nonexistent have yet to compile any airtight case .
But if we ask the specific question regarding whether or not the Internet assists the cause of skepticism , we may show that it assists the cause of information and trust in our collective judgment that the former has nothing to fear from the latter .

Scott Brown : Help Me Defeat Rachel Maddow , Who Might Run Against Me , According to Twitter
Created : March 23 , 2010 16:58 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The campaign of Sen. Scott Brown ( R - Mass . ) , who ’s got less of a cash problem than almost anyone running for office in 2012 ( he has millions left over from his special election bid ) , points to a fairly obscure blog to stoke fears that MSNBC host Rachel Maddow is being recruited to oppose him .
What ’s the sourcing at the blog , Universal Hub ?
A tweet from state Democratic Party chairman John Walsh , which looks like a botched direct message to Maddow and reads
Some are talking about you running vs Scott Brown in ’ 12 .
I ’m Chair of MA Dem Party .
My email is johnewalsh@Comcast.net cell-617-650-9311
Based on that , Brown ’s extremely savvy team warns supporters that Democrats want a “ rubberstamp ” for their policies .
“ I ’m sure she ’s a nice person , ” says Brown in the fundraising email .
“ I just do n’t think America can afford her liberal politics . ”
The email :
Friends ,
It ’s only been a couple of months since I ’ve been in office , and before I ’ve even settled into my new job , the political machine in Massachusetts is looking for someone to run against me .
And you ’re not going to believe who they are supposedly trying to recruit — liberal MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow .
Rachel lives in western Massachusetts , and recently it was reported that the chairman of the state Democratic Party had apparently tried to reach out to her in an attempt to coax her into a race against me .
You can read about it here .
The political season never ends , which is why I need your continued support .
While my opponents strategize on how to defeat me in 2012 , I ’m going to continue to speak out against higher taxes , more spending and greater government control in our lives .
I relish being an independent voice in Washington , one that does n’t march in lockstep with the rest of the Washington crowd .
The Democratic Party bosses in Massachusetts disagree .
They want a rubberstamp who will vote for their plans to expand government , increase debt and raise taxes .
Someone like Rachel Maddow .
I ’m sure she ’s a nice person — I just do n’t think America can afford her liberal politics .
Rachel Maddow has a nightly platform to push her far - left agenda .
What about you ?
I ’d like to encourage ordinary American citizens concerned about the future of their country to get more involved in our government .
I hope you were encouraged by my victory to become more politically active , maybe even become a candidate for office yourself .
We can continue to push our movement forward by running for office , joining in rallies and petitions that challenge President Obama and Nancy Pelosi ’s healthcare legislation , supporting campaigns against the tax - and - spenders or by donating time and money to office - holders and candidates who will restore the principles of our founders .
I ’m grateful you are with me .
Thanks again for whatever support you can provide me , and I look forward to joining in further victories with you down the line .
Sincerely ,
Scott Brown
United States Senator
England fan Garry Mann 's hopes of avoiding two years in a Portuguese jail were dashed today when human rights judges rejected a legal challenge to his extradition .
Nearly six years after being tried and convicted over a riot at the Euro 2004 tournament , the former Kent fireman had asked the European Court of Human Rights to block his removal to serve the jail term in Albufeira .
But Fair Trials International , a campaign group which has been supporting his case , said today the judges in Strasbourg had refused to intervene .
Chief executive Jago Russell said : " Garry Mann could be on a flight as soon as tomorrow , sent to serve two years in a Portuguese jail after what is widely recognised was a grossly unfair trial .
" It is a travesty of justice that the British courts , the government and now the European Court of Human Rights appear happy to sit back and let this happen . "
The group urged the UK courts or Government to step in at the " final hour " to stop Mr Mann 's extradition .
The Portuguese authorities originally agreed to deport Mr Mann instead of making him serve his sentence .
But 18 months ago they used the fast track European extradition warrant system to summon him back .
British police and courts had no choice but to agree to the request , even though Mr Mann 's trial and conviction were condemned by a senior judge as " a serious injustice " .
The European Court of Human Rights was asked to issue an injunction halting extradition pending a full hearing into whether the handling of Mr Mann 's trial and conviction amounted to a breach of his human rights .
Mr Mann , 52 , says he was drinking with friends in a bar in Albufeira when a riot involving football fans began in a nearby street .
He was arrested , tried and convicted within 48 hours .
He said he was only granted five minutes with a lawyer before trial , could not understand the proceedings and did not know what charge he faced until after he was convicted .
A British police officer at the trial described the proceedings as a " farce " .
Three days after being sentenced to two years , he agreed to be deported on the understanding that his jail term would be waived if he left voluntarily .
Back in the UK , a police chief applied for a worldwide football banning order preventing Mr Mann travelling abroad for football matches .
Justice Stephen Day refused because , he said , the trial in Portugal had been " so unfair as to be incompatible with the respondent 's right to a fair trial " .
More than four years later , in October 2008 , British police arrested Mr Mann , acting on a European arrest warrant issued by their Portuguese counterparts .
British courts reluctantly rejected appeals against extradition , with High Court judge Lord Justice Moses declaring at a hearing in January that he could not " leave this application without remarking upon the inability of this court to rectify what appears to be a serious injustice to Mr Mann " .
At another hearing in March he called for " mediation or grown - up people getting their heads together " and warned : " I can not believe anybody wants this man to go and do two years in Albufeira Jail .
It is just an embarrassment for everybody , this whole case , and it ought to disappear . "
Canadian citizen Omar Khadr is scheduled to be the first Guantanamo detainee to face a war crimes trial in the United States .
Proceedings could begin as early as this week .
As reported by the Toronto Star , Khadr ’s lawyers have appealed for an emergency stay of proceedings .
They argue that the military commission established for the cases of Guantanamo detainees “ falls far short of the guarantees of justice in civilian trials . ”
You can read the whole story at TheStar.com .
The Straight previously reported that despite a Canadian Supreme Court ruling that Khadr ’s constitutional rights have been violated , Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Conservative government are refusing to move to repatriate Khadr .
Khadr was born in Toronto and is now 23 years old .
He was captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan in July 2002 — then just 15 years old — and has been held at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay ever since .
The U.S. government claims that Khadr threw a grenade which killed U.S. Sgt. Christopher Speer .
In March 2008 , a lawyer of Khadr ’s made public U.S. government documents which contradict this narrative .
In a report dated July 28 , 2002 , a “ Lieut .
Col. W ” states that the person who threw the grenade at Speer died in the firefight , which would rule out Khadr as a suspect .
Khadr has long been the only western national to remain at Guantanamo Bay .

Creating a toy virtual machine with PyPy
Here , you can use “ virtual machine ” as in “ Java Virtual Machine ” , not as in virtualization .
We will play with the virtual machine described in the paper Tracing the Meta - Level : PyPy ’s Tracing JIT Compiler by C.F. Bolz , A. Cuni , M. Fijalkowski and A. Rigo ( it ’s a great read by the way ) .
PyPy is a fascinating project , too complex to describe here .
Among other things , PyPy can take any interpreter written in a subset of Python , translate it to C , and automatically generate a JIT compiler for this language .
Does it sound too good to be true ?
Let ’s try this .

the lines in italic are the annotations for the JIT compiler .
We need to give PyPy some insight on the interpreted language by declaring what is the instruction pointer ( the green variables ) , the beginning of the dispatch loop and the backward branches ( see the paper for full details ) .
check that you can execute this script correctly by running python target - toy. py 12 , the output should be 144
, the output should be 144 PyPy can translate this script in C .
For this , first install the dependencies and then run the following command : python translate .
py target - toy.py
this should give you an executable target - toy -c , rename it target - toy - native and check that ./ target - toy - native 12 yields 144
yields 144 now we can ask PyPy to translate target - toy . py in C and generate a JIT compiler for it .
For this , we just run python translate .
py -- opt=jit target - toy .py note : the 64 - bit backend of PyPy is not implemented yet , so if you are on a 64 - bit system , you will have to struggle a bit .
You will have to use a 32 - bit Python interpreter ( see my former post ) , create an alias for gcc - m32 ( let ’s call it gcc32 ) and then pass the option –cc=gcc32 to translate.py .
this should give you another target - toy -c executable , rename it to target - toy - jit and check that ./ target - toy - jit 12 yields 144
Ok , everything is working , so let ’s now see how all this performs by computing large squares :
~/ pypy - trunk / pypy/translator/goal$ time python target - toy.py 1000000
1000000000000
real 0m18.637s
~/ pypy - trunk / pypy/translator/goal$ time ./ target-toy-native 1000000
-727379968
real 0m0.024s
~/ pypy - trunk / pypy/translator/goal$ time ./ target-toy - jit 1000000
-727379968
[...]
real 0m0.005s
The first run is the square program interpreted by our program , itself interpreted by the Python interpreter .
Double interpretation is slow .
The second run is the square program interpreted by a native version of our interpret function .
Interpretation by native code is ok .
The third run is the square program interpreted and JIT ’ed on the fly .
It ’s super awesome :)
Final note : I must thank everybody from #pypy on freenode , for their help and resilience to stupid questions .
Thanks guys !
Tonight I watched an investigative report on a major networks late night news show Nightline that was about dairy farms .
The sensationalism used in these stories is getting harder to watch as a second generation farmer whose family has cared for our animals comfort for nearly 40 years .
I feel the media and activist groups use isolated incidents to create a sense of a major problem when quite the opposite is true .
In the video I listened to the farmer say he does not stand for the improper care of animals and has previously fired employees for just that .
I only wish he was able to express whether the employee (s ) in this incident had been let go .
If you want to see a video of animals on an average dairy you can see a video I did for Evernote .
The California Milk Advisory Board also has put together some great videos of average dairymen and dairy families throughout California .
The dairy farmers in the United States are working toward implementing a best care practices program for animal care called the National Dairy FARM Program .
when this program is in place we will have an animal care manual that all dairy farms can use to continue to provide the highest level of care for their animals .
A great friend of mine Jeff Fowle , a cattle rancher from northern California has a great post on his blog Common Sense Agriculture discussing animal rights versus animal welfare and why we should pay close attention to the difference .
In addition the post I made on this topic in September of 2009 is still pertinent as is the post referenced below from Dino Giacomazzi .
September 29 , 2009
Below is a link to a blog post by a fellow California Dairyman Dino Giacomazzi .
Dino does an awesome job highlighting the unnecessary pressure and sensationalism some Animal right groups are using to ban the docking of Cattle Tails in CA .
This is all unnecessary because no farm or dairy group opposes the ban and one group even supports the ban now that the farmer can provide prompt care for an injured animal .
I ’m not a farmer but I play one on TV !

Everything written here represents my own opinion .
Former Conservative MP
Rahim Jaffer pleaded guilty today to careless driving after charges of speeding , drunken driving and possession of cocaine were withdrawn in an Orangeville court .
Jaffer , 38 , will pay his $ 500 fine within the next month .
He has already given $ 500 to the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation .
“ I ’m sure you can recognize a break when you see one , ” Justice Doug Maund told Jaffer in court after the Crown announced it was dropping the other charges .
Outside the courthouse , Jaffer admitted , “ I ’m sorry .
I know this was a serious matter , ” adding that he was relieved by the resolution .
“ I know I should have been more careful .
Once again , I apologize for that and I take full responsibility for my careless driving . ”
Wearing a dark suit , with his hair gelled , a confident Jaffer was flanked by family and his lawyer , Howard Rubel , as he spoke briefly before being whisked away in an SUV .
Jaffer , who is married to federal Tory cabinet minister Helena Guergis , was arrested shortly pulled over just after 12:45 a.m. on Sept. 11 in the village of Palgrave , east of Orangeville .
An Ontario Provincial Police officer had clocked Jaffer going 93 km/h in a 50 km / zone .
Jaffer told the officer he was returning from Toronto , where he had consumed two beers two hours earlier .
His breathalyzer test measured more than 80 milligrams of alcohol , the court was told .
He was charged with cocaine possession and driving over the legal blood - alcohol limit .
His licence was suspended for 90 days .
However , Crown Marie Balogh told the court the prosecution dropped the more serious charges for “ legal reasons , ” saying that there was no reasonable prospect of conviction .
“ The charges of driving over the legal limit and possession of any illegal substance has always been refuted and I think the withdrawal of those charges vindicates that refutation today , ” Rubel said .
“ What Mr. Jaffer did was drive without paying to how fast he was going . ”
Jaffer had been spending the summer an hour north in Angus , the hometown of his wife , who is federal minister of state for the status of women .
He lost his Edmonton - Strathcona seat , which he first won at the age of 25 in 1997 , in the 2008 federal election .
He and Guergis , the MP for Simcoe - Grey , were married in a spur of the moment ceremony the day after his defeat .
A close friend and colleague said after the arrest that the charges were “ absolutely devastating ” for Jaffer and his family .
“ Being a public figure , the damage is already done .
This is extremely harsh for him , for his family , ” said Patrick Glemaud , CEO of Green Power Generation Corp. , an alternative energy company he co-founded with Jaffer .
“ I ’m supporting him 100 per cent , ” said Glemaud , who met with Jaffer in Ottawa yesterday .
“ The presumption of innocence must stand .
I think he ’s a great guy . ”
Jaffer was born in Kampala , Uganda , and immigrated to Edmonton with his family as a boy to escape persecution under the iron - fist rule of Idi Amin .

He offered an emotional apology in the House of Commons in 2001 after one of his aides , Matthew Johnston , was caught impersonating him on a radio show while Jaffer was busy elsewhere .
Jaffer was re-elected in 2006 and named Conservative caucus chairman by Harper .
Guergis herself had to apologize earlier this month for “ speaking emotionally ” to staff at Charlottetown airport .
According to witnesses , she arrived at the last minute , berated Air Canada officials for their slowness , screamed obscenities at security staff who asked her to take off her boots .
Speaker Peter Milliken delivers his ruling on Tuesday in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa .
( ( Adrian Wyld / Canadian Press ) )
The federal government breached parliamentary privilege with its refusal to produce uncensored documents related to the treatment of Afghan detainees and must provide the material to MPs within two weeks , Speaker Peter Milliken has ruled .
During his lengthy ruling Tuesday afternoon in the House , Milliken called on House leaders , ministers and MPs to find a " workable accommodation " to satisfy all parties " without compromising the security and confidentiality contained . "
Milliken ruled Parliament had a right to order the government in December to produce uncensored documents to members of a special committee examining allegations that detainees transferred to Afghan custody were tortured .
He said the order was " clear " and procedurally acceptable but acknowledged it had no provision to protect sensitive information within the material .
" It is the view of the chair that accepting an unconditional authority of the executive to censor the information provided to Parliament would , in fact , jeopardize the very separation of powers that is purported to lie at the heart of our parliamentary system and the independence of its constituent parts , " Milliken told the House .
" Furthermore , it risks diminishing the inherent privileges of the House and its members , which have been earned and must be safeguarded . "
On Dec. 10 of last year , the Commons passed an opposition motion ordering the government to produce unredacted documents pertaining to the Canadian transfer of detainees to Afghan custody .
But Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's Conservative government has refused to comply with that order , citing national security concerns .
In response , MPs from all three opposition parties submitted questions of privilege to Milliken last month that called for several government ministers to be held in contempt of Parliament , arguing that the House 's " supreme " power over the prime minister is a basic tenet of democracy .
Tories welcome ' possibility ' of compromise
In a brief statement to reporters shortly after Milliken 's decision , Justice Minister Rob Nicholson said the government " welcomes the possibility of a compromise while respecting our legal obligations , acknowledged by the Speaker . "
" The government will not knowingly break the laws that were written and passed by Parliament , " Nicholson said .
" Our government will not compromise Canada 's national security , nor will it jeopardize the lives of our men and women in uniform . "
The minister did not take any questions after the statement .
It is possible the Conservatives will view the ruling as an issue of non-confidence and call a vote in the House , which could trigger a snap election .
The government could also ask the Supreme Court to hear the case .
Ruling ' a clear victory for Parliament ' : Ignatieff
Speaking after Milliken 's ruling , Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff called it " a clear victory for Parliament , for the people of Canada , for democracy and a clear defeat for the Conservative government . "
He said he would instruct Liberal House leader Ralph Goodale to consult his Conservative counterpart and find a solution in the next two weeks " that vindicates the right of the Canadian people to have documents and also respects the considerations of national security . "
" I 'm absolutely convinced what the Speaker is saying to us is that you can trust an MP to respect the national security of our country , " Ignatieff said .
" What 's changed is the Speaker , the highest authority in our Parliament , has said , ' Sort it out ' . "
NDP Leader Jack Layton also hailed Milliken 's decision as a " very strong and important ruling . "
" The Speaker stood up for members of Parliament and for the people elected by the people of Canada against a Harper government that simply wanted to act in a contemptuous way towards Parliament , " Layton told reporters .
Ruling : Iacobucci's ' client ' is government
A special parliamentary committee on the Afghanistan mission and a civilian - run military watchdog have been investigating allegations that Canadian officials handed over prisoners to Afghan custody with the knowledge they would be tortured .
Government and military officials , past and present , have vehemently denied the allegations and insist Canada 's troops have always respected international law .
The government recently appointed retired Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci to review the material to determine what can be released .
But opposition parties have decried his appointment as a delay tactic to avoid potentially embarrassing revelations about what the Conservatives knew about torture allegations — and when they first learned of them .
The MPs have argued that Iacobucci 's review will likely take months and that the government is under no obligation to make his findings public .
In his ruling , Milliken said that in his view , since Iacobucci reports to the justice minister , " his client is the government . "
MacKay not in contempt
Milliken also ruled that Defence Minister Peter MacKay did not intimidate government witnesses slated to appear before the parliamentary committee on the Afghan mission when he pointed out that any information they provided to the committee must comply with the Canada Evidence Act .
The opposition had accused MacKay of trying to scare witnesses into withholding information out of fear that they might violate the Act .
Milliken said he agreed with the government 's position that MacKay 's statements , made in the House of Commons in December 2009 , constituted debate since they occurred during question period .
The Speaker expressed " concern " over a letter sent by assistant deputy minister of justice Carolyn Kobernick on Dec. 9 , 2009 , to House law clerk Rob Walsh .
In it , Kobernick said there may be " instances where an act of Parliament will not be interpreted to apply " to the Houses of Parliament or their committees .
In that case , the opposition had argued the effect was also to dissuade government bureaucrats from providing information to the committee — this time out of fear that some of the usual protections might not apply to their testimony and that what they say could end up damaging them .
Milliken said the letter could be interpreted as having a " chilling effect " on public servants who are called to appear before parliamentary committees .
But he said there does not appear to be sufficient evidence to conclude that Kobernick 's letter constitutes a direct attempt to prevent or influence the testimony of any witness before a committee .
The most immediate threat to preserving the ruins of Babylon , the site of one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , is water soaking the ground and undermining what is left in present - day Iraq of a great city from the time of King Nebuchadnezzar II .
It is also one of the oldest threats .
The king himself faced water problems 2,600 years ago .
Neglect , reckless reconstruction and wartime looting have also taken their toll in recent times , but archaeologists and experts in the preservation of cultural relics say nothing substantial should be done to correct that until the water problem is brought under control .
A current study , known as the Future of Babylon project , documents the damage from water mainly associated with the Euphrates River and irrigation systems nearby .
The ground is saturated just below the surface at sites of the Ishtar Gate and the long - gone Hanging Gardens , one of the seven wonders .
Bricks are crumbling , temples collapsing .
The Tower of Babel , long since reduced to rubble , is surrounded by standing water .
Leaders of the international project , describing their findings in interviews and at a meeting this month in New York , said that any plan for reclaiming Babylon as a tourist attraction and a place for archaeological research must include water control as “ the highest priority . ”

Tens of thousands of people attended demonstrations on Saturday aimed at protesting the German government 's plans to extend the lives of its nuclear power plants .
Demonstrators formed a 120 - kilometer ( 74 - mile ) human chain that stretched from a nuclear power plant in Brunsbuettel , through Hamburg along the Elbe River to another plant in Kruemmel .
Both reactors have been almost continuously out of service since a series of accidents in 2007 .
Police in the German state of Schleswig - Holstein told the AFP news agency that there were " clearly more than 100,000 participants . "
Organizers estimated the total number at about 120,000 .
Protesters want the government to shut down Germany 's nuclear plants
" Today over 120,000 people have signaled to the government :
You must change your pro-nuclear position , " event spokesman Thorben Becker told the DPA news agency .
Demonstrations also took place at an atomic waste storage site in the town of Ahaus in North Rhine - Westphalia and at a nuclear plant in the state of Hessen .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that her center - right coalition wants to revoke a law passed under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 's center - left coalition that promised to shut down all nuclear power plants in Germany by 2020 .
Merkel 's government has called nuclear energy a " bridge technology " that helps the country keep its commitments to lowering carbon dioxide emissions .
The protests come just days before Monday 's 24th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster .

Microsoft recommends that people upgrade to IE8 Microsoft has released a fix for a hole in Internet Explorer that was the weak link in a " sophisticated and targeted " cyber attack on Google .
Microsoft recommends that customers install the update as soon as possible or update to the latest version of the web browser for " improved security " .
Microsoft normally issues patches monthly but the high - profile nature of the attacks led it to act more quickly .
The patch - KB978207 - was released worldwide at 1000 PST ( 1800 GMT ) .
" It addresses the vulnerability related to recent attacks against Google and small subset of corporations , as well as several other vulnerabilities , " the firm said .
" Once applied , customers are protected against the known attacks that have been widely publicised . "
Microsoft has admitted that it has known about the vulnerability since " since early September " 2009 and had planned to patch it in February .
Trojan Horse Google threatened to withdraw from the Chinese market following attacks on its infrastructure .
The hacks - thought to have originated in China - targeted the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists .
Following Microsoft 's revelation that Explorer had been used in the attacks , the French and German governments advised their citizens to switch to a different browser until the hole had been closed .
The UK government downplayed the threat and said there was " no evidence that moving from the latest fully patched versions of Internet Explorer to other browsers will make users more secure " .
However , Microsoft has taken the unusual step of patching the hole nearly three weeks ahead of its regular security update .
The new patch is available via the Microsoft Update site and will also be fed out to those who have their machines set to update automatically .
All versions of Internet Explorer will receive the update .
Malicious code exploiting the weakness is known to be circulating on the web , said security experts .
If a web user were to visit a compromised site using a vulnerable browser , they could become infected with a " trojan horse " , allowing a hacker to take control of the computer and potentially steal sensitive information .
Microsoft said on 18 January that the firm had only seen malicious code that targeted the older version of its browser , IE6 and that there were " very few " infected sites on the web .
But security firms had said they had seen " copycat " sites trying to exploit the vulnerability .
The bad publicity has allowed rivals such as Firefox to gain market share .
According to web analytics company StatCounter , Firefox is now a close second to Internet Explorer ( IE ) in Europe , with 40 % of the market compared to Microsoft 's 45 % share .
In some markets , including Germany and Austria , Firefox has overtaken IE , the firm said .
Mozilla , the foundation behind Firefox has just released the latest version ( 3.6 ) of the open - source browser .

The Tampa Tribune reports from Florida .
“ The mortgage crisis is causing more than just heartburn for homeowners .
It ’s changing their moral compass .
Homeowners are walking away - even when they can afford their payments .
Some loot on the way out the door .
Others trash the home to ruin the bank ’s chances of selling it .
Today ’s homeowners are tired of watching the lenders who triggered the financial meltdown get bailed out while they suffer .
They want revenge .
They feel entitled .
‘ It went from being a shame to being behind on your mortgage to feeling like it ’s a big joke , ’ said Jim Kelly , a Tampa homeowner who said numerous neighbors of his have stopped paying .
‘ The big talk at cocktail parties is how underwater is your house and how long have you lived there for free . ’”
“ Kelly paid off his mortgage 17 years ago and never tapped his equity – even though he saw the appraised value jump a couple hundred thousand dollars .
One of his neighbors bought a house 25 years ago for $ 80,000 , took out home equity loans , and bought new furniture and went on exotic trips .
They now owe $ 250,000 and stopped paying the mortgage .
‘ It ’s a moral issue , ’ Kelly said .
‘ You borrowed the money and because of the world credit issues that have nothing to do with your house , you think you ’re entitled to something . ’ ”
“ Tampa real estate agent Paul De La Torre said he sees the entitled attitude often .
Clients who are trying to sell their homes for less than the mortgage – called a short sale – are increasingly asking to take pieces of the home with them .
‘ They want to take the appliances and other things they bought with their equity money , ’ said De La Torre .
‘ I tell people that if you did n’t pay for it with your own money , it should stay with the house .
Taking it just makes it more difficult to find a buyer . ’ ”
“ ‘ I just sold one house where they guy took the wall plates , ’ De La Torre said .
‘ Those are like 60 cents at Home Depot .
Everybody says , ‘ Look what the bank did to me , ’ De La Torre said .
‘ But when people were selling their homes for $ 100,000 profit , no one complained . ’”
The Orlando Sentinel .
“ Like a lot of Florida homeowners , Philip Becker would like to tap into the $ 418 million in federal aid the state expects to receive this year to help quell the foreclosure crisis .
He lost his construction job six months ago and is depleting his savings to remain current on the mortgage for his Winter Springs townhouse , which has lost nearly 40 percent of its value since he bought it in 2005 . ”
“ ‘ Impending doom is what I ’m facing , ’ he said .
‘ I ’m hoping to avoid messing up my credit .
I just want to try to keep the home I have and get back up on my feet , but I ’m paying for something and [ the value ] is going to take me years and years to catch up to what I owe . ’ ”
“ Becker showed up Monday at a public forum on how Florida should use its share of federal Hardest - Hit Fund dollars designated for states most severely impacted by the deteriorated housing market and economy .
He did n’t get much in the way of answers or reassurance .
He still has no idea if he ’ll qualify for whatever help Florida tries to offer .
‘ There was no sense of urgency , ’ he said after the hearing . ”
The Bradenton Herald .
“ Before the local housing market crashed , ‘ Kathy ’ had a ‘ very comfortable income , ’ a healthy savings account balance and no outstanding credit card debt .
Then came a divorce and the housing slump .
Kathy , whose last name was withheld , fell behind on her mortgage and lost her Sarasota home to foreclosure in mid-2008 .
She now lives with a friend , is barraged with calls from creditors and their lawyers , and lives in constant fear of losing her car for non-payment . ”
“ She was among hundreds of Floridians surveyed as part of The Face of Foreclosure , a Florida Realtors research study that was released Tuesday .
‘ I have found this entire experience to be devastating , ’ she told researchers .
‘ I am in total financial ruin . ’ ”
“ Its key finding : Most people fell into foreclosure not because of a single major life event — such as job loss or serious illness — but a cascading combination thereof .
Those homeowners tended to be married with children , well - educated and better - paid , the study found .
More than 90 percent of foreclosures were filed on homes owned by married couples , while 65 percent were on those owned by families with children at home .
More than half of Florida homeowners in foreclosure had attended or graduated from college .
And more than two - thirds earned at least $ 50,000 a year . ”
“ The findings show the foreclosure crisis — largely believed to have begun with defaults on subprime and other exotic loans in 2007 — was widespread and did not discriminate , a researcher said .
‘ This study really kind of debunks a few myths , ’ said Joel Searby of a Gainesville research firm that conducted the study .
‘ This is n’t an issue just for the lower - educated or those with lower incomes . ’ ”
The Herald Tribune .
“ A few years ago , during the real estate boom that you may remember , a developer ran a newspaper advertisement that said something like , ‘ Drive an extra 20 miles and save an extra $ 20,000 . ’
It ’s certainly not news that home buyers are willing to drive a while to find cheaper housing .
We have built nearly our entire country on this concept .
But at what cost ?
A new report by Chicago ’s Center for Neighborhood Technology quantifies it . ”
“ The report , ‘ Penny Wise and Pound Fuelish , ’ indicates that when the costs of purchasing , insuring , maintaining and fueling a car ( $ 7,000 or more a year ) are factored in , most of those so - called ‘ affordable ’ communities become unaffordable , especially for ‘ working families ’ making less than $ 50,000 annually . ”
“ The center ’s report is based on the high gas prices of 2008 .
The cost of buying , maintaining and insuring vehicles is included in its interactive Housing + Transportation Index .
The number of neighborhoods considered unaffordable under the H+T Index grows by about half in the Sarasota - Manatee metro , and more than 80 percent in the Punta Gorda MSA .
‘ Housing affordability in the United States is currently being drastically overestimated , and many families could be susceptible to foreclosure as gas prices rise , ’ according to the report . ”
My Fox Tampa Bay .
“ To offer buyers the convenience of touring dozens of homes for sale in one weekend , the Florida Association of Realtors and their member clients will be hosting open houses on April 10 and 11 .
It ’s the first - ever statewide open house weekend .
The Florida Open House Weekend comes just before the April 30 deadline for the federal homebuyer tax credit .
Homes need to be under contract by that date and closed on by June 30 in order to take advantage of up to $ 8,000 in tax credits for first - time buyers .
A $ 6,500 credit is also available for those who have n’t owned a home in the last three years . ”
“ Blue balloons , featuring the Realtor ’s ‘ R ’ in white , will denote those homes that are part of the statewide open house campaign .
Balloons will be on display simultaneously at open houses from the Panhandle to Key West . ”

“ New Treasury Department rules to streamline short sales go into effect Monday , giving sellers , buyers and Realtors hope that the grueling process of getting bank approvals will soon ease .
‘ The biggest problem we ’ve had in the past is lack of cooperation from the lenders and no uniform set of rules , ’ said Realtor Craig Fialkowski in Palm Beach Gardens .
‘ Nobody does anything the same . ’ ”
“ Five years ago , Fial­kowski had no short sale listings .
Now they make up half of his business , he said .
“ Because property values dropped so dramatically in Florida , said West Palm Beach Realtor Jared Dalto , who deals almost exclusively in short sales , it ’s difficult to get lenders to take substantial losses , even with small monetary incentives .
‘ When the losses are so big , it ’s like climbing Everest , ’ Dalto said .
‘ When negotiations happen in short sales , it ’s all about money . ’ ”
The Naples News .
“ Just as the 2010 census got under way , the U.S. Census Bureau released population estimates from the past year that showed how the recession has affected growth in various parts of the nation .
For the year ending July 1 , 2009 , Collier ’s growth rate ticked up slightly though still nowhere near the huge gains from earlier in the decade .
Lee County lost population for that time period in 2008 - 09 , the first time that happened in the past decade . ”
“ Armando Nargi , president of the Lee County Chamber of Commerce , said he was n’t surprised by the numbers .
‘ Right now there ’s no growth and no stability in our economy in Lee County , ’ Nargi said .
‘ It changes month - to - month , day - to - day … employment opportunities are severely limited . ’ ”
“ The 5 - foot alligator lurking in the algae - green waters of the community swimming pool was not the worst thing code - enforcement officers have found in recent years at AAA Apartments in Cocoa .
Bathrooms infested with mold .
Walls with gaping holes where air conditioners had been ripped out .
Garbage and trash strewn about the 52 - unit complex .
The city began issuing code-violation fines in 2007 , back at the beginning of the housing slump , and the apartments ’ co-owners soon owed the city $ 1.8 million — more than three times the current list price of the property , and enough money to motivate the now - former co-owners to try bribing a code - enforcement officer . ”
“ As home foreclosures continue to mount throughout Central Florida , code - enforcement officers say apartments , condominiums and other commercial buildings are being abandoned by their owners and repossessed by banks in growing numbers .
‘ The coming wave is the commercial foreclosures , ’ said Mike Rhodes , code - enforcement division director for the city of Orlando . ”
“ As it turns out , the two co-owners of the troubled complex on Fiske Boulevard took a different approach in trying to make the problem go away .
Lindsie Pham and Timothy Buu , both of Orange County , Calif. , pleaded guilty last month to attempting to bribe a Cocoa code - enforcement officer in hopes the officer would overlook more than 50 violations . ”
“ The fines did n’t go away when , in May 2009 , Deutsche Bank National Trust took over the complex .
Robert Hold , president of Hold Thyssen Inc. in Orlando , was hired by the bank to serve as the property ’s receiver and manager .
Hold , a veteran receiver for bank - owned commercial properties , proposed that the city drop the fines to $ 100,000 .
One Cocoa official said the city could really use the entire $ 1.8 million , though it soon became apparent that the city had little leverage . ”
“ ‘ In one of the meetings , I believe it was the board of adjustment , one of the board members asked , ‘ How can we give up $ 1.8 million ? ’
Hold recalled .
‘ And I said , ‘ The owners are prepared to give you the keys . ’ ”
The News Journal .
“ Many area real - estate professionals understand the area ’s housing market will not really improve until the situation gets better up North .
Much of the local housing market has depended on retirees selling homes in New England and the Midwest before they can buy a home in Volusia and Flagler counties . ”
“ ICI Homes was pitching its upscale and gated Plantation Bay Golf and Country Club community in Ormond Beach , which straddles the Volusia and Flagler county line .
It offers town houses starting at $ 169,000 , single - family houses staring at $ 195,000 and multimillion dollar estates .
About 30 percent of its 4,500 lots are developed , and there are no more spec houses available around the three golf courses . ”
“ ‘ It took us awhile to clear out the inventory , but we have done that and the last ones we did , we did not have to lower the prices any more , ’ said Rosemary Messina , ICI vice president of sales and marketing .

Homeowners realize the truth about what their homes are worth up north and that it ’s the right time to buy in Florida . ’ ”

“ An ongoing noise complaint from one Cape Harbour resident caused dozens of his high - rise neighbors to pack council chambers to defend the mixed use development , which has quickly become one of the more popular places for not only residents but the general public .
Just as quickly , the battle between the two sides has grown heated , as it fast approaches litigation . ”
“ Jim Stevens wants to tone down Tuesday evenings at Cape Harbour , which feature a combination of motorcycles and live music .
The noise , Stevens said , is far removed from what he thought he was getting when he purchased his condominium , which he assumed was a quiet , peaceful setting for his retirement .
‘ I ’m not trying to put anyone out of business , ” Stevens said , an oil and gas producer from Michigan .
‘ All I ’m asking is to take the music inside and pipe it outside so people can dance , and to move the motorcycles . ’ ”
“ Stevens has even gone as far to say he was duped when he purchased his condominium , something Laura Straus from Realmark Development adamantly refutes .
She said that Realmark offered him another unit , even urged him that Cape Harbour might not be the best fit for him .
Straus said that Stevens knew all along that live music was part of Cape Harbour ’s goal .
‘ We started the live music before his closing , ’ Straus said , who closed on Stevens ’ condo .
‘ We even told him we did n’t think he would enjoy living at Cape Harbour . ’ ”
“ Stevens said he ’s had the noise level professionally tested , and it reaches levels of 90 decibles .

With a glut of unsold homes and condos , and rising foreclosures putting downward pressure on prices , home building will likely be depressed for years . ”

Yes , I decided to actually add the parenthetical ( mostly ) .
I sweated how to word the signing of it for some time last night , and finally concluded that " Your Supporters " was too limited and self - evident , while " The American People " is too presumptuous and , let 's face it , obviously not completely true .
Besides , some non-Americans chipped in for the roses as well .
" A ( mostly ) Grateful Nation " struck me as covering all the bases while still admitting tacitly ( in a tongue - in - cheek manner ) that no , the entire country is n’t jumping for joy at the moment .
But this , too , shall pass ...
While many people obviously contributed to this effort , I 'd like to give a shout - out to four dKos members in particular who donated their own daily diaries to help keep the campaign on the radar : wide eyed lib , AntKat , DruidQueen and brigitsmom .
I 'd also like to thank mayrose for posting the " Bread & Roses " song ( as well as everyone who encouraged me to use it in the letter ) .
Please help keep this diary on the Rec list at least until after the roses have been delivered to the Speaker , thanks !
Update : Final tally just released : 2,616 roses are on the way !
Update x2 : Posted at the request of Coast to Coast Florist :
Sorry , the cut - off time for adding your own roses to the order was last night at 10:00 pm !!
If you were n't in time to be included in the rose campaign , may I suggest doing the following instead :
Join the facebook group wishing Speaker Pelosi a happy birthday and thanking her for healthcare reform .
( Must log in after following link . )
Write her a thank you note .
Donate money to her reelection fund .
Donate to other tight - race candidates that supported HCR .
Update x3 : Regarding media coverage : I 've been assured that it 's being taken care of .
Update x4 : Open message to anyone who plans on contacting the press :
If you send out any " formal " press releases , please do not mention my name as part of the backstory .
Obviously my name is all over the diaries and comments on this , and I even sent an email or two myself , so I 'm not trying to keep my identity a secret or anything , but at the same time , I 'd prefer not to push it as a significant part of the story , either .
Case in point : San Francisco's NPR affiliate called me yesterday to interview me for a short piece they aired this morning about the rose campaign -- but they did n't end up mentioning me at all , which is fine with me ( they included a brief sound bite from the DC florist doing the actual delivery ) .
In other words , if the media really wants to interview me , I do n't mind doing so , but I do n't want to push for it either , ok ?
Thanks much :)
Oh , by the way , here 's the link to the NPR piece ; you have to scroll in to around 5:58 -- the whole thing is only about 30 seconds .
( h/t to Eloise below for the link ! )
Update x5 : I just received the following note from the florist :
I have word that the delivery has been made ; we are waiting on the photos .
Update x6 : Just to clarify one point : Someone stated that whoever took their order told them that they 've received orders from as far away as Australia and even from soldiers serving in Iraq .
At this time , neither I nor the florist can verify that claim -- all they have are the billing addresses to go by , all of which are U.S. based .
Of course , I 'm sure any U.S. soldiers ' credit cards would still keep their domestic addresses , so that does n't mean much one way or the other .
I just wanted to make it clear that I do n't personally know if that statement is true or not .
Update x7 : OK , I 'll try to re-lighten the mood here with the following pic , reposted with permission from Scarce 's own diary ( also currently on the Rec list ) :
Update x8 : Coast to Coast ( the florist ) just reported :
Nancy was in the office today and received the roses !
She has also instructed delivery of some of the roses to Walter Reed Military Hospital .
Regarding photos , etc : Yes , I 'll be posting them as soon as they 're made available .
In addition , Coast to Coast will be posting pics on their Facebook page as soon as they can as well .
Beyond that , be on the lookout for pics as well as , potentially , video and / or press coverage later on this afternoon / evening and into tomorrow - - Mike Stark is on the case !
Update x9 : I just wanted to reiterate the title , especially given the latest domestic terrorism activities being reported on the Tea Party / GOP side of the aisle ( including threatening messages to Gary Peters ( MI - 09 ) and Mark Schauer ( MI - 07 ) and even wingnuts deliberately plowing SUVs into cars with children in them for the crime of ... having a bumper sticker .
So , for anyone for whom this needs to be spelled out , let me make it as clear as I can :
THEY THROW ROCKS .
WE SEND ROSES .
THE CONTRAST COULDN'T BE CLEARER .
Update x10 : Additional photos and video should be added later , but for the moment :
Thanks to the community at Daily Kos , and others who joined in , Speaker Pelosi received thousands of roses this morning for her 70th birthday .
She sent half of the roses to Walter Reed Army Medical Center and is distributing the other half to hill staff to thank them for all their hard work on the health reform legislation .
THANKS AGAIN – she was overwhelmed ( and our office smells glorious ) !
Update x11 : I decided to remove some unnecessarily negative " lessons learned " stuff from the most recent update ; I 'll post this and some other follow - up thoughts in tomorrow 's diary ; hope you 'll indulge me one more day !
I 've also replaced the text of the letter with the actual letter itself !
I think it looks quite a bit nicer in context ... you can see it in the 4th pic down as well .
Update x12 : FYI , aside from KQED ( the San Francisco NPR station mentioned earlier ) , I think this is the first " mainstream " coverage -- Politico has picked it up !
I 'm not gonna post every single link , but please feel free to post whatever coverage you come across over the next day or so :)
WARSAW , Poland —
A frightened , shivering dog was rescued after floating at least 75 miles on an ice floe down Poland ’s Vistula River and into the Baltic Sea , officials said Thursday .
Now his saviors have to figure out who owns him .
Rescuers have named the miracle dog Baltic .
The dog ’s odyssey came as Poland suffers through a winter cold snap , with temperatures dipping to below minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit .
The thick - furred male dog was found adrift Monday 15 miles out in the Baltic Sea by the crew of the Baltica , a Polish ship of ocean scientists carrying out research .
A firefighter in Grudziadz , on the Vistula River , said the dog was spotted Saturday floating through the city .
The dog did n’t welcome three would - be owners on Wednesday and Thursday .
Two others were coming to Gdynia for a possible reunion .

Zachary Young ’s acceptance letters to Harvard , MIT and Caltech arrived early at his Upper East Side apartment last month .
Two years early .
Not even having finished his sophomore year at the city ’s elite , public Stuyvesant HS , the 15 - year - old wunderkind has already secured seats for himself at three of the country ’s brainiest colleges .
For a while , it was a mailbox flurry of good news .
“ I was pretty shocked .
I had n’t really pictured myself getting a letter , ” the brainiac said of his first acceptance — from Caltech .
But it was the MIT green - light that shot him over the moon .
“ That was much more exciting , ” he gushed .
“ I had my mom , my sisters and my girlfriend , and they all screamed . ”
Young says he still has n’t decided which university to attend .
“ I ’m still totally not sure , ” he admits .
“ I flip - flop like every day . ”
Young ’s aptitude was obvious from preschool , although he also once read an “ Idiot ’s Guide to World War II ” — when he was in third grade .
His passion for math began at age 2 , when he finished a puzzle — and then did it upside down to make it more challenging .
“ He ’s very intense and driven , ” said his mom , Lisa Young , who works in the office at the Anderson School for the intellectually gifted on the Upper West Side .
“ My only reservation is that I wish he could know that he ’s only going to be a kid once .
He ’ll have plenty of time to be a grown - up . ”
But Young is impatient , especially with those folks who just do n’t get math .
“ A lot of people have the misconception that it ’s plugging and chugging , ” he said .
“ That ’s not real math .
Real math is basically proving things and solving problems . ”
Young has already taken every math and science class Stuyvesant has to offer .
“ I was n’t sure what classes I ’d be able to take next year , ” said Zach , who attended the private Ethical Culture Fieldston School through fifth grade before switching to the Anderson School in sixth .
“ I really just applied to college to give myself options . ”
Zach is a two - time national chess champion who does n’t watch TV or listen to music .
“ If I have a choice between math and almost anything else , I choose math , ” he said .

April 21 , 2010 : Warning , the images you are about to see could take your breath away .
At a press conference today in Washington DC , researchers unveiled " First Light " images from NASA 's Solar Dynamics Observatory , a space telescope designed to study the sun .
" SDO is working beautifully , " reports project scientist Dean Pesnell of the Goddard Space Flight Center .
" This is even better than we could have dreamed . "
Launched on February 11th from Cape Canaveral , the observatory has spent the past two months moving into a geosynchronous orbit and activating its instruments .
As soon as SDO 's telescope doors opened , the spacecraft began beaming back scenes so beautiful and puzzlingly complex that even seasoned observers were stunned .
For instance , here is one of the first things SDO saw :
takes a while to download , but it is worth the wait .
A high - res is also available .
An erupting prominence observed by SDO on March 30 , 2010 .

" We 've seen solar prominences before — but never quite like this , " says Alan Title of Lockheed Martin , principal investigator of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly ( AIA ) , the observatory 's main telescope array .
" Some of my colleagues say they 've learned new things about prominences just by watching this one movie . "
SDO is the first mission of NASA 's Living with a Star ( LWS ) program .
The goal of LWS is to understand the sun as a magnetic variable star and to measure its impact on life and society on Earth .
Program scientist Lika Guhathakurta of NASA headquarters envisions big things for the new observatory :
" SDO is our ' Hubble for the sun ' , " she says .
" It promises to transform solar physics in the same way the Hubble Space Telescope has transformed astronomy and cosmology . "
" No solar telescope has ever come close to the combined spatial , temporal and spectral resolution of SDO , " adds Title .
" This is possible because of the combination of 4096 x 4096 - pixel CCDs with huge dynamic range and a geosynchronous orbit which allows SDO to observe the sun and communicate with the ground around the clock . "

Reds are relatively cool ( ~60,000 K ) ; blues and greens are hotter (> 1,000,000 K ) .

One of the most amazing things about the observatory is its " big picture " view .
SDO is able to monitor not just one small patch of sun , but rather the whole thing -- full disk , atmosphere , surface , and even interior .
" We 're going to make connections that were impossible in the past , " says Title .
As an example he offers the events of April 8th :
With SDO looking on , decaying sunspot 1060 unleashed a minor " B3 - class " solar flare .
A shock wave issued from the blast site and raced across the surface of the sun ( movie ) .
SDO images clearly show magnetic loops and other structures rocking back and forth when the wave passes over them .
Eventually , the wave disappeared over the sun 's horizon -- but the show was n't over .
Four hours after the initial blast , and some 200,000 km away , a massive prominence erupted .
Coincidence ?
Not according to Title .
" As the wave swept across the surface of the sun , it de-stabilized magnetic fields it encountered en route .
I believe the magnetic underpinnings of the prominence were upset by the wave , and this led to the eruption . "
A seemingly insignificant B - flare triggered a massive prominence eruption halfway across the sun .
This is the sort of unexpected connection that , when fully understood , could lead to big advances in space weather forecasting .
On April 8th this active region unleashed a B3 - class solar flare .

So far , SDO 's prettiest pictures have come from the bank of telescopes called AIA .
Other instruments on the spacecraft are working just as well — and they promise similarly exciting results .
" The Helioseismic Magnetic Imager ( HMI ) is performing splendidly , " reports HMI principal investigator Phil Scherrer of Stanford University .
" We 're getting very high - quality , high signal - to - noise data . "
HMI is designed to look inside the sun using a technique called helioseismology .
Just as geologists use seismic waves to map the interior of our planet , solar physicists can use acoustic waves to map the interior of our star .
On the sun , acoustic waves are generated by the sun 's own internal motions .
HMI detects the waves pulling the sun 's surface back and forth , revealing indirectly what lies within .
" We 're processing the data now , " says Scherrer , " and soon we expect to have some nice maps of the sun 's interior . "
In addition to mapping the solar interior , the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager can also map magnetic fields on the sun 's surface .
This bipolar sunspot was observed by HMI on March 29th .
White and black trace opposite magnetic polarities .
The sunspot 's main core ( white ) is about the size of Earth . [ 2 MB movie ]

The Extreme UV Variability Experiment ( EVE ) is online , too , " and we 're getting great data as well , " says principal investigator Tom Woods of the University of Colorado , Boulder .
EVE monitors the sun where it is most variable — in the extreme UV part of the electromagnetic spectrum .
At these wavelengths , the brightness of the sun can rise and fall a hundredfold in the blink of an eye , heating and " puffing up " Earth 's upper atmosphere , and dragging down satellites .
EVE measures these changes with unprecedented time and spectral resolution .
" EVE has already detected a number of very interesting solar flares , " says Woods .
" We 're excited ; the flares evolved in a way we did n't expect .
This is something we would n't have seen without the capabilities of EVE . "
He plans to offer more details at a later date when the EVE team has had time to fully analyze the data .
Mission scientists stress that all of this is preliminary .
The observatory is still being commissioned , and a good deal of testing and calibration remains to be done before regular , daily images become available in mid-May .
Even more effort must be put in before hard science appears in refereed journals .
" First Light is just a first look , " says Pesnell .
" The best is yet to come . "

The exploding demand among the needy for food banks is rapidly expanding to desperate pet owners who can no longer afford to feed their animals , according to the Humane Society of the United States .
Animal shelters around the country are being flooded with hungry pets , and to tackle the problem , charitable organizations are setting up pet food banks , with products offered within regular food pantries .
“ One of our goals is to keep pets in their homes if we can , ” said Jane Hoffman , president of the Mayor ’s Alliance for NYC ’s Animals , a nonprofit that works to find ways of limiting the number of animals in New York City that are euthanized .
“ It ’s heartbreaking when an animal has to go to a shelter simply because its family does n’t have the money to feed it . ”
She compared it to City Harvest , a nonprofit group in New York that distributes excess food from the city ’s restaurants to the needy .
This is Groggle.com , an Australian price - comparison Web site that hunts down the cheapest alcohol for your pleasure ( and pain , the following day ) .
It ’s just been sent a cease - and - desist letter by Google .com –for those of you not in the know , it ’s an online search engine firm based in the U.S. which is diversifying into other markets .
And it ’s all to do with the Groggle founders ’ choice of name .
Cameron Collie and Alec Doughty registered the name with the Aussie trademark office last year , and it was approved in February .
Tens of thousands of dollars later , Google pounced , asking the dipsophilic startup to withdraw its trademark , change its name , transfer the domain name–groggle .com.au to Google , acknowledge in writing that it had been a very naughty boy , that it had committed the tort of passing off , and so on and so forth .
Talk about using a piledriver , a few tons of plastic explosive , and an army of Macgyvers to open a screw - top bottle of wine .
The Mindboggled blog has got something interesting to say about the episode .
It notes that there are already a bunch of search engines that go by the names of Doogle , Joogle , and Toogle .
I even found one called Moogle .
Search engines .
Not price comparison sites .
Search engines .
Now then , surely that is more of an infringement on Google ’s business than a place that lets you find the cheapest booze around and then , if not use it as antifreeze on your car , drink the stuff ?
The smart money ’s on Google backing down over the affair .
When far - reaching , tech - savvy , and , it must be argued , visionary company makes an ant - stampingly pathetic gesture like this , it ’s magnified by Hubble - sian proportions .
The only thing that happens is that the behemoth looks like a toogle–sorry , tool – the plucky underdogs get Facebook pages and Twitter hashtags , and publicity campaigns led by slightly tragic politicians .
It ’s non-news made nonsense .
Continuing on the trail of exposing what is rapidly becoming one of the largest frauds in commodity markets history is the most recent interview by Eric King with GATA 's Adrian Douglas , Harvey Orgen ( who recently testified before the CFTC hearing ) and his son , Lenny , in which the two discuss their visit to the only bullion bank vault in Canada , that of ScotiaMocatta , located at 40 King Street West in Toronto , and find the vault is practically empty .
This is a relevant segue to a class action lawsuit filed against Morgan Stanley , which was settled out of court , in which it was alleged that Morgan Stanley told clients it was selling them precious metals that they would own in full and that the company would store , yet even despite charging storage fees was not in actual possession of the bullion .
It appears that this kind of lack of physical holdings by all who claim to have gold in storage , is pervasive as the actual gold globally is held primarily in paper or electronic form .
Lenny Organ who was the person to enter the vault of ScotiaMocatta , says " What shocked me was how little gold and silver they actually had . "
Lenny describes exactly how much ( or little as the case may be ) silver was available - roughly 60,000 ounces .
As for gold - 210 400 oz bars , 4,000 maples , 500 eagles , 10 kilo bars , 10 one kilogram pieces of gold nugget form , which Adrian Douglas calculates as being $ 100 million worth , which is just one tenth of what the Royal Mint of Canada sold in 2008 , or over $ 1 billion worth of gold .
As Orgen concludes : " The game ends when the people who own all these paper obligations say enough and take physical delivery , and that 's when the mess will occur . "
Also note the interesting detour into what Stephan Spicer of the Central Fund Of Canada , said regarding his friend at a major bank , who wanted access to his 15,000 oz of silver , and had to wait 6 - 8 weeks for its to be flown in from Hong Kong .
It is funny that central bankers thought they could take the ponzi mentality of infinite dilution of all assets coupled with infinite debt issuance , as they have done to fiat money , and apply it to gold , in essence piling leverage upon leverage .
They underestimated gold holders ' willingness to be diluted into perpetuity - when the realization that gold owned is just 1 % of what is physically deliverable , you will see the biggest bank run in history .

Declining patient volume due to the economic crisis forced workers at MetroHealth to accept some concessions in a new three - year contract that was ratified Feb. 12 .
“ People are forgoing elective procedures and preventive care , ” said Julie Albers , president of AFSCME Local 3360 at the hospital , which is largely funded by Cuyahoga County .
Previously , she said , private hospitals in the area , including Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals , encouraged patients on Medicare and Medicaid to use MetroHealth .
But now , with so many people out of work and losing medical coverage , the private hospitals are competing for those with public health insurance .
MetroHealth has tried to save money by contracting out services but this has met with strong opposition from both community and labor .
In the recent negotiations , the hospital pushed for privatizing laundry and transportation departments as well as removal of patient financial services from the bargaining unit .
“ We absolutely refused to go along .
That would have opened the door to further privatization , ” Albers said .
The union ’s stand was seen as a victory by many in both the union and community who fear the management would like to completely privatize the last major public hospital in Ohio .
The new contract , covering nearly 2000 employees , includes paying 10 per cent of the cost of medical procedures that were previously fully covered .
However , the rate charged to employees is discounted 70 % so the actual cost is greatly reduced .
For example , a $ 1000 CT Scan would be discounted to $ 300 with the employee paying $ 30 .
In addition , the union agreed to forgo a wage increase in the first year , with a 2.75 % raise in the second year and 3 % in the third year .
While no one was happy with the concessions , Albers said the alternative would have been going to a fact - finder and re-opening the possibility of privatization or else a strike .
“ We did what we could under the circumstances , ” she said , “ and we ’re here to fight another day when hopefully times get better . ”
My favorite example :
case class Board ( length : Int , height : Int ) { case class Coordinate (x : Int , y : Int ) { require ( 0 <= x && x < length && 0 <= y && y < height ) } val occupied = scala.collection.mutable.Set[ Coordinate ] ( ) } val b1 = Board ( 20 , 20 ) val b2 = Board ( 30 , 30 ) val c1 = b 1.Coordinate ( 15 , 15 ) val c2 = b 2.Coordinate ( 25 , 25 ) b1.occupied += c1 b2.occupied += c2 //
Next line does n't compile b1.occupied += c2
So , the type of Coordinate is dependent on the instance of Board from which it was instantiated .
There are all sort of things that can be accomplished with this , giving a sort of type safety that is dependent on values and not types alone .
This might sound like dependent types , but it is more limited .
For example , the type of occupied is dependent on the value of Board .
Above , the last line does n't work because the type of c2 is b2.
Coordinate , while occupied 's type is Set [ b 1.Coordinate ] .
Note that one can use another identifier with the same type of b1 , so it is not the identifier b1 that is associated with the type .
For example , the following works :
How Much Processing Power Does it Take to be Fast ?
First , watch this .
It 's Defender , an arcade game released thirty years ago .
I went out of my way to find footage running on the original hardware , not emulated on a modern computer .
( There 's clearer video from an emulator if you prefer . )
Here 's the first point of note : Defender is running on a 1MHz 8 - bit processor .
That 's right ONE megahertz .
This was before the days of pipelined , superscalar architectures , so if an instruction took 5 cycles to execute , it always took 5 cycles .
Here 's the second :
Unlike a lot of games from the early 1980s , there 's no hardware - assisted graphics .
No honest - to - goodness sprites where the video processor does all the work .
No hardware to move blocks of memory around .
The screen is just a big bitmap , and all drawing of the enemies , the score , the scrolling mountains , the special effects , is handled by the same processor that 's running the rest of the code .
To be fair , the screen is only 320x256 with four bits per pixel .
But remember , this was 1980 , and home computers released up until mid-1985 did n't have that combination of resolution and color .
Now it 's 2010 , and there 's much amazement at the responsiveness of the iPad .
And why should n't it be responsive ?
There 's a 32 - bit , gigahertz CPU in there that can run multiple instructions at the same time .
Images are moved around by a separate processor dedicated entirely to graphics .
When you flick your finger across the screen and some images slide around , there 's very little computation involved .
The CPU is tracking some input and sending some commands to the GPU .
The GPU is happy to render what you want , and a couple of 2D images is way below the tens of thousands of texture - mapped polygons that it was designed to handle .
Okay , JPEG decompression takes some effort .
Ditto for drawing curve - based , anti-aliased fonts .
And of course there 's overhead involved in the application framework where messages get passed around to delegates and so on .
None of this justifies the assumption that it takes amazing computing power to provide a responsive user experience .
We 're so used to interfaces being clunky and static , and programs taking long to load , and there being unsettling pauses when highlighting certain menu items , that we expect it .
All the fawning over the speed iPad is a good reminder that it does n't have to be this way .

A multi-center study led by a researcher at Rhode Island Hospital has determined that long - term elder care , HIV - infected and hemodialysis patients are at increased risk of carrying methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) in their nose .
The study also found that patients have vastly different quantities of MRSA in their noses , a potential indicator for their risk of developing an infection after surgery .
The study appears in the June 2010 edition of the journal Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology and appears online in advance of print .
In order to better understand the prevalence of MRSA in different patient populations , lead author Leonard Mermel , DO , ScM , worked with researchers at The Cleveland Clinic , Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions , Emory University and other organizations to obtain specimens from the noses of a variety of patients .
Mermel is the medical director , department of epidemiology & infection control at Rhode Island Hospital .
In general , one in three individuals is colonized with Staphylococcus aureus , most often involving the nose .
In the US , approximately 1 percent of people carry MRSA in their nose .
Carrying MRSA in the nose increases the risk of developing an invasive MRSA infection such as bloodstream infection , pneumonia , surgical site infection , etc .
Staphylococcus aureus is the second most common pathogen causing health care - associated infections in the United States , and 49 percent of those infections are caused by the highly antibiotic - resistant bacteria MRSA .
A strain called USA100 is the most common type of MRSA involved in health care - associated infections in U.S. hospitals .
In this study , 444 nose cultures of 2,055 patients from 13 enrollment centers resulted in growth of MRSA .
The researchers found that 14 percent and 15 percent of inpatient and outpatient hemodialysis patients , respectively , carried nasal MRSA , as did 16 % of HIV infected patients , and 20 percent of long - term elder care residents .
Based on these findings , Mermel , who is also a professor of medicine at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and a physician with University Medicine , recommends , " Hospitals performing active surveillance for MRSA should consider such patient populations for screening cultures . "
The researchers also found different strains of MRSA in different patient populations .
For example , while USA100 was the most common MRSA strain detected , the USA 300 strain was much more commonly found in HIV - infected patients .
The researchers also detected some MRSA strains not previously identified in the US , such as an MRSA clone common in Brazil .
Mermel and his colleagues also found dramatic diversity in the quantity of MRSA colonizing the noses of people .
Some people had as few as 3 colonies of MRSA in their nose detected with a nasal swab whereas others had as many as 15 million colonies of MRSA .
Mermel notes , " This finding is important because heavy MRSA colonization of the nose is an independent risk factor for the development of a surgical site infection . "
Mermel says the study findings identify patient populations at increased risk for MRSA carriage and infection .
Future studies can use this information to determine a biologic explanation for differences in strains and quantities of MRSA that some people carry in their noses .
Today we ’d like to announce SunSpider 0.9.1 , a new version of the popular SunSpider JavaScript benchmark that improves accuracy of results .
We recommend that anyone using SunSpider to test JavaScript performance should migrate to the new version .
A little over two years ago , we announced the SunSpider JavaScript benchmark .
We originally created SunSpider for our own use , to help us speed up WebKit ’s JavaScript implementation .
Since then , SunSpider has become a widely respected metric of JavaScript performance , and has been cited frequently in performance comparisons .
But we ’ve had some suggestions for SunSpider that could make it more accurate on fast systems and cross - browser comparisons .
We were hesitant to change the SunSpider content or harness much at all , since it ’s been used for cross-version and cross - browser comparisons for so long .
But it seems important to address the most significant issues .
With that in mind , we have made a limited number of changes to the test harness and to the test content itself .
Dealing with Power Management
Computers and JavaScript implementations have gotten much faster over the past two years .
If you look at the comments on the original SunSpider announcement , you can see that most people were reporting results around 10,000ms .
Now it ’s common for high performance JS engines on fast hardware to get scores around 300ms .
Along with this speedup , we ran into an unanticipated problem with the test harness .
By design , the SunSpider harness has significant pauses between each test , to give browsers a chance to settle down after the load .
But with fast browsers on modern hardware , this gives enough time for power management to kick in and ratchet down the CPU clock rate .
As a result , most of the benchmark does not run at full speed .
This issue , originally reported by Mike Belshe of the Chrome team , has more impact on faster JavaScript engines .
This resulted in our first SunSpider harness bug fix : bug 32505 : In - browser SunSpider suffers excessive penalty under power management .
In addition to lowering the delay between tests , we also greatly reduced the amount of loading that happens during the benchmark .
All of the content is in one page .
This further reduces the variability between test runs .
And as an added bonus , the SunSpider test suite is now much faster to complete , as it no longer waits half a second between every single test .
Test Content Bug Fixes
SunSpider ’s test content has some oddities .
Out of the various problems reported , two stood out as affecting the accuracy of the test to some extent .
First , the string - base64 test had a bug that made it incorrect in Internet Explorer .
The test has been updated , and should now give more accurate results in IE .
Second , the regexp - dna test had an issue specific to Gecko - based browsers such as Firefox .
It too has been updated and should now be more accurate in Firefox .
Versioned Test Content
Since we changed the test content , we thought that some might be interested in running the “ classic ” SunSpider 0.9 content set under the new harness .
We ’d also like to be prepared to handle multiple versions of the test content in general , so we did just that .
For this release , we made sunspider - 0.9.1 the default content set ( both command - line and hosted ) .
Minor Test Harness
Tweaks
In the course of implementing these fixes , we decided some cleanup was in order .
First , we made sure all of the HTML files in the browser - hosted version are valid HTML5 .
With HTML5 advancing and becoming more popular , it seemed like the right thing to do .
The test will still work fine in older browsers .
In addition , the older SunSpider harness processed JSON strings using somewhat ad - hoc techniques .
We updated to use json2.js or browser - native JSON .
parse , where available .
Try it Out
Last but not least , try it out , report your scores , any problems you run into , or any other interesting comments .
You can run it with the latest content set right from that page , or visit the all versions page if you want to test an older content set .
BNP three use ' troops out ' name in three Welsh seats
The list of nominees showing the alternative name used by one candidate Three British National Party ( BNP ) candidates in Wales will not be using the party 's name on ballot papers at the general election , it has emerged .
Instead BNP candidates in Swansea East , Swansea West and Gower will appear as " Support Our Troops Bring Them Home " .
The BNP said they had not intended just to use that name , but Swansea council said it was the party 's decision .
The Electoral Commission said candidates can use a different name under the regulations .
It confirmed the move was legal , as the alternative name is a properly registered description for the BNP .
Voters will be able to tell that the three are official BNP candidates only from the party logo on the ballot paper .
' Misled ' claim A spokesperson for the commission said : " Our advice to voters is always to scrutinise the ballot paper very carefully . "
A BNP spokesperson confirmed all three candidates are standing for the party , and not as a splinter group .
The spokesperson said a Swansea council official misled them when they filled in the candidate forms , which was why he said the three candidates were registered under the " Support Our Troops Bring Them Home " name .
He also said the forms used by the council were more complicated than those used by most other UK local authorities .
In response , the council said : " It was the BNP representative 's decision to take [ to put Support Our Troops Bring Them Home on the ballot paper ] and he was in no way misled by Swansea council . "
The council also said nomination papers filled out by the BNP were in a standard form produced for use across the UK .
" There is no material difference between the form used by the BNP and one produced by the Electoral Commission , " it added .
' Deeply concerning ' Welsh Conservatives said : " Although these candidates are not breaking the law in appearing under this alternative name on the ballot paper , it is undoubtedly misleading for voters .
" It is deeply concerning and a cynical ploy by a party that thrives on hatred and division in our communities . "
Plaid Cymru called it a " deceitful attempt by the BNP to hide the real message of their offensive manifesto .
" The communities of Swansea and Gower will be voting for hope , not hate and will see through this cynical stunt , " said Plaid .
Liberal Democrats said they condemned " this disgraceful attempt at hoodwinking the people of Swansea and Gower by the racist BNP " .
Lib Dems said candidates " should have the decency to admit who they are standing for " and were confident that voters would " see through this shameless con by a party of unreformed racist thugs . "
A Welsh Labour spokesman said : " Any representative seeking to stand for public office has a duty to ensure they make it clear who they are standing for , those who do not are clearly misleading the voters .
" These tactics are an insult both to the brave young men and women who currently serve our armed forces and to our Welsh veterans . "

U.S. gamers spent $ 3.8 billion on massively multiplayer online games in 2009 , almost 15 times more than other substantial MMO markets in Europe , according to a new study .
Consumer data from Today's Gamers MMO Focus Report by Gamesindustry.com and TNS indicates that the number of MMO players in the U.S. has reached 46 million , 46 percent ( 21 million ) of which paid to play online games ; the rest , around 25 million gamers , play MMOs without spending any money .
The average paying MMO player spent around $ 15.10 per month on their games .
The report points out that Blizzard ' shas the most number of players in the U.S. out of all the MMOs it tracked , just in front ofand .
Other MMOs in the top five includeand
The study also breaks down the $ 3.8 billion total spent on MMOs in 2009 : 47 percent ( $ 1.8 billion ) was spent on monthly subscriptions , 15 percent ( $ 580 million ) on annual subscriptions , 19 percent ( $ 740 million ) on virtual currency , 8 percent ( $ 280 million ) on direct microtransactions , and 11 percent ( $ 400 million ) on the initial boxed product or client download .
Consumers in the UK , which has the second highest total measured by the report , spent only $ 270 million on MMOs in 2009 .
However , the country 's total had the highest percentage of revenues from direct microtransactions , 19 percent ( $ 51 million ) .
Germany ( $ 250 million total ) , France ( $ 220 million ) , and the Netherlands ( $ 65 million ) had the biggest 2009 revenue percentages from virtual currency , each pulling in at least 26 percent from that source .
Belgium 's ( $ 55 million ) revenues had the highest percentages for monthly and annual subscriptions , at 53 percent and 20 percent respectively .
Today 's Gamers MMO Focus Report adds that it expects growth in MMO revenues from countries such as Italy , Spain , Russia , Turkey , Poland and Sweden .
D’Agostini , 23 , has played in 40 games this season with Montreal , recording four points including two goals and two assists to go along with 26 penalty minutes .
Last season , the 6 - 0 , 198 - pound forward appeared in 53 games for the Canadiens collecting 12 goals and nine assists for 21 points and 16 penalty minutes .
The Sault Ste. Marie , Ontario , Canada native was originally drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the sixth round , 190th overall in the 2005 entry draft .

Baroness Jenny Tonge , a former Liberal Democrat member of the British parliament , said this week that Israel should set up an inquiry to disprove allegations that its medical teams in Haiti “ harvested ” organs of earthquake victims for use in transplants , The Jewish Chronicle ( JC ) reported Thursday .
According to the report , the organ theft claims were published last week in the Palestine Telegraph , an online journal based in Gaza of which Baroness Tonge is a patron .
Tonge told the JC that IDF forces were “ to be commended for their fantastic response to the Haitian earthquake , " but added , “ To prevent allegations such as these — which have already been posted on YouTube — going any further , the IDF and the Israeli Medical Association should establish an independent inquiry immediately to clear the names of the team in Haiti . ”
Ed Fordham , the Lib Dem candidate for Hampstead and Kilburn , was quoted by the JC as saying , “ It ’s abhorrent that anyone should suggest that something as perverse and sick as this should be investigated . ”
Monroe Palmer , chairman of Liberal Democrat Friends of Israel , added , “ Whilst I welcome Tonge ’s approval of Israeli actions in Haiti , she is misguided to call for any investigation .
On this basis , there could be calls for an investigation to discover the ‘ truth ’ in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion . ”
Matthew Harris , Lib Dem parliamentary candidate for Hendon , called it “ perverse in the extreme to suggest that there needs to be an investigation of allegations to which she gives no credence ” .
According to the JC , an Israeli Embassy spokesman dismissed the allegations as “ not fit to grace even the sickest of publications ” .
The allegations came in an article titled Focus on Israel : Harvesting Haitian Organs by an American researcher , Stephen Lendman , who accused Israel of a “ crime against humanity ” .
Lendman referred to a “ damning ” YouTube video uploaded by an American resident of Seattle , Washington , accusing soldiers in the IDF delegation to the earthquake site in Haiti of being involved in stealing organs from their patients .
To watch the defamatory video – click here
The man , who calls himself T. West , fronts a group called AfriSynergy Productions , whose declared goal is to empower the black man .
The video purports to present something to think about while exploiting the horrible tragedy that has befallen Haiti to recycle false claims that IDF soldiers engage in organ trafficking .

General relativity fits survey observations but there 's still room for its rivals .
General relativity has passed its most rigorous test yet .
Sloan Digital Sky Survey
It 's another victory for Einstein — albeit not a resounding one .
General relativity has been confirmed at the largest scale yet .
But the galactic tests used to put the theory through its paces cannot rule out all rival theories of gravity .
General relativity has been rigorously tested within the Solar System , where it explains the motion of planets with precision .
But its reach between galaxies has been harder to verify and should not be taken for granted , says cosmologist Alexie Leauthaud , at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California .
" It 's actually a tremendous extrapolation to assume that general relativity works on cosmic scales , " she says .
If general relativity does break down at large scales , it could help cosmologists to explain away one of their biggest headaches : dark energy .
In the 1990s , astronomers were surprised to discover that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating .
That runs counter to the predictions of general relativity , which suggests that gravity 's grip should be slowing the expansion .
To explain this , cosmologists now invoke a ' dark energy ' , a force that makes up almost three - quarters of the matter and energy in the Universe and pushes it apart .
But the origin of dark energy remains a mystery .
The accelerated expansion could be explained without dark energy , however , if general relativity is wrong and gravity weakens at cosmic scales .
Several candidate ' modified gravity ' theories take this line but , until now , no one has come up with a way to test them at large scales .
Relative success
Now , Reina Reyes at Princeton University in New Jersey and her colleagues have compared some of these models using data on the position , velocity and apparent shape of 70,000 distant galaxies mapped by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey1 .
The rival theories make different predictions about the degree to which light travelling to us from distant galaxies will be bent by the gravity of intermediate galaxies .
This process , called ' gravitational lensing ' , distorts the apparent shape of the galaxies .
The theories also make different predictions for both how fast galaxies grow and how they cluster together .
Data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are in line with the predictions of general relativity .
M. Blanton and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
No single prediction can be used compare the theories directly , says Reyes .
Because all the models include assumptions about whether dark matter — the invisible substance thought to make up the bulk of matter in the Universe — exists and if so , how it clumps together , relative to visible matter .
Instead , the team had to combine all three measures — gravitational lensing , growth and clustering — into one ratio , called E G , in such a way that any uncertainty introduced by dark matter assumptions cancels out .
The team found a value for E G of about 0.39 – a good match to the general relativistic prediction of around 0.4 .
Scott Dodelson at the Fermilab Center for Particle Astrophysics in Batavia , Illinois , who was part of the team that proposed2 the E G test in 2007 , says that the work is " exciting and important " .
" It 's impressive that the team has shown we can rigorously test general relativity at large scales with data we have now , " he says .
Open question
General relativity 's rivals , however , returned mixed results .
The team 's test rules out a version of the tensor - vector - scalar , or TeVeS , model , proposed in 2004 , which modifies gravity using a set of interacting fields to mimic dark matter .
This model was already struggling to explain observations of galactic collisions that seem to show direct evidence of dark matter3 , says Reyes .
" Our test is another blow to TeVeS , " says Reyes .
However , she notes , more complicated versions of TeVeS could well pass the test .
The team also failed to rule out the set of so - called ' f ( R ) models ' that slightly tweak the parameters of general relativity at large scales to explain away dark energy .
" The question of whether modified gravity or general relativity will ultimately prevail is still very much open , " says Dodelson .
ADVERTISEMENT
Glenn Starkman , a cosmologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio , says that E G " will be a useful addition to the battery of tests that modified gravity theories are already subjected to " .
Starkman and his colleagues have been testing the viability of a third modified gravity model , dubbed ' Einstein - Aether ' theory , which uses a single new field to replace both dark matter and dark energy .
Their analysis concludes that Einstein aether cannot explain the patterns seen in the cosmic microwave background4 .
Leauthaud thinks that within the next two decades various planned experiments will have collected enough observational data to discriminate between general relativity and its competitors using E G .
" Either we 'll find general relativity is wrong , or we 'll discover a new type of physics to explain dark energy , " she says .
" We 're looking at a paradigm shift , either way . "

Hewlett - Packard formally announced that it has reached an agreement to sell Palm to HP for $ 5.70 per share , or around $ 1.2 billion total .
The deal came as a surprise to Silicon Valley gossips who were sure HTC or Lenovo would acquire Palm .
( VentureBeat writers suggested that RIM and LG consider Palm , but we did n’t expect either of those deals to happen . )
HP , the world ’s largest technology company with over 300,000 employees worldwide , plans to use Palm ’s technology to “ enhance HP ’s ability to participate more aggressively in the fast - growing , highly profitable smartphone and connected mobile device markets . ”
So far , HP has never sold a mobile phone .
HP conducted a webcast with investors at 2 PM Pacific Time , hosted by Todd Bradley , the head of HP ’s Personal Systems Group — and formerly Palm ’s CEO himself .
Update :
Here ’s our story on the conference call .
The big message :
The deal is n’t just about smartphones , but tablets and netbooks too .
In our other coverage of the acquisition , we ’ve also looked at what the deal says about Palm investor Elevation Partners ( with some math showing how Elevation made $ 25 million ) , its impact on the broader mobile landscape , and how the deal makes sense given Todd Bradley ’s history with HP and Palm .
We also discuss what the deal says about HP ’s tradition of innovation .

Queensland councillors have been urged to demand immigration cuts in order to preserve the " Australian way of life " .
Former NSW premier Bob Carr today led calls for a national policy on population growth , saying measures needed to be taken to save Queensland 's coastline environment from further damage .
Speaking at the Local Government and Infrastructure Planning Symposium in Brisbane today , Mr Carr said Australia 's population needed to be " stabilised " .
The population in South - East Queensland is expected to increase from 2.8 million to 4.4 million people by 2031 .
Mr Carr told local councillors it was their responsibility to lobby the federal government to cap Australia 's population at 28 million .
Sometimes , even The A.V.
Club is n’t impervious to the sexy allure of ostensible cultural garbage .
Which is why there ’s I Watched This On Purpose , our feature exploring the impulse to spend time with trashy - looking yet in some way irresistible entertainments , playing the long odds in hopes of a real reward and a good time .
Cultural infamy : Virtually none .
The 2008 movie Passengers was n’t screened for critics , and barely made it to theaters — it blew through Chicago in a week .
It was such a hit - and - run release that The A.V.
Club did n’t even have a chance to do a review .
Apparently other media outlets had the same problem : Metacritic logs only a sad eight reviews by major publications ; by comparison , the site logged 36 for Up In The Air .
Rotten Tomatoes , which is far less picky about which review sources it considers noteworthy , logged 232 reviews for Up In The Air , and a mere 28 for Passengers .
And according to Box Office Mojo , it made a whopping $ 292,437 in theatres .
In other words , just about no one saw this film , even though it stars oh - so - bankable actor Anne Hathaway , and came out the same year as her hugely critically lauded film Rachel Getting Married , which earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress .
Worse yet , among the few critics who saw it , almost none of them liked it ; Metacritic has it at a 40 rating , with quotes like this one from The New York Times ’ Stephen Holden : “ A supernatural thriller so mechanically inept and lacking in suspense that it does n't even pass muster as lowbrow Halloween - ready entertainment . ”
Rotten Tomatoes has it at a mere 21 percent “ fresh ” rating .
Given that it was barely advertised and barely released , and it recently slipped out on DVD without fanfare , it ’s safe to say it pretty much lacks fame , infamy , or notice of any kind .

Curiosity factor : I confess I had n’t even heard of Passengers before my sister asked me to send her a copy via my Netflix account .
My sister is like some sort of dowsing rod of crap cinema .
She has the magical power to detect hilariously dubious movies that no one else has heard of , she loves terrible films , and I love watching them with her , because she ’s so very vocal in her lack of appreciation for them .
So when she asked for this one , and I realized it was a recent Anne Hathaway / Patrick Wilson supernatural twist - ending thriller that had somehow all but evaded the viewing public , I told her she ’d have to wait until so we could watch it together .
I was n’t going to miss out on anything that promised to be so awful that the studio tried to hide it from the world .
Besides , who does n’t love a good twist ending ?
The viewing experience : Back in 2007 , a terrible Halle Berry film called Perfect Stranger taught me something about twist - ending films that I ’d never fully absorbed before :
It does n’t matter how shocking , colorful , or even clever the last act is if the viewers have already given up on the film — or become completely enraged with it — by the time they get there .
A good twist - ending film like The Sixth Sense , say , distracts viewers with a story that ’s intriguing in its own right .
The twist should be a cherry on top of a sundae , not a truffle hidden at the bottom of a dung heap .
It helps if the story has some sort of internal coherence and a purpose for existing , and is n’t just a life - support system for a sudden surprise .
Like Perfect Stranger , Passengers fails this simple guideline in every way .

Passengers starts like Fearless ends , with the depiction of an airline crash from which passenger Patrick Wilson ( Nite Owl from Watchmen and the co-lead in Little Children ) emerges , dirty but miraculously unhurt .
Therapist Anne Hathaway is quickly summoned to debrief and work with the paltry few survivors of the crash , and to be given some exposition by Andre Braugher , whose job and relationship to her go unexplained .
Nonetheless , he informs her that she needs to be jarred out of her comfort zone .
She protests that she is n’t in a zone , and he reminds her that she has “ two masters degrees already [ and ] a Ph.D. that never ends . ”
Apparently this is what it takes to make someone comfortable ?
At any rate , she does n’t argue , and she heads to the hospital to meet the survivors , including Wilson , who greets her naked and entirely unselfconscious about it .
He refuses therapy and promptly starts hitting on her , setting up the pattern for his behavior throughout the film : a mixture of left - field compliments , inappropriate intimacies , offhanded dismissal of everything she says , and discomfiting non sequiturs .
From the start , he ’s emotionally inaccessible , yet proprietary and controlling , which any decent therapist should regard as an immense , significant red flag .
But Hathaway just seems vaguely flattered .
Tee - hee , the cute guy who treats her like a dumb but pretty child might like her !
Advertisement
Eventually , Hathaway sits down for a group - therapy session with plane - crash survivors Clea DuVall , Ryan Robbins , Don Thompson , and Chelah Horsdal , who do n’t entirely agree on what happened — Robbins remembers maybe seeing fire before the plane went down , but the others do n’t .
DuVall ’s memories do n’t entirely make internal sense either .
Also , when Hathaway brings up Robbins ’ memories with airline employee David Morse — whose job , like Braugher ’s , is vague and unexplained — he insists that the plane crash was caused by pilot miscalculation .
But … why does he have a folder in his briefcase labeled “ maintenance ” ?
And why is there a guy standing around outside Hathaway ’s group - therapy sessions ?
Also , if Hathaway only has masters ’ degrees , why does everyone keep calling her “ doctor ” ?
One of the three major problems with Passengers is that director Rodrigo García downplays the issues that might actually point to a mystery , while turning up the drama knob on mundane details .
It actually is n’t surprising that an airline guy would have a “ maintenance ” folder , so why do we get ominous music and a forced - perspective shot as Hathaway notices it ?
Why is there similarly worrisome music when Wilson wakes up from a nightmare , and looks out his window to see a barking dog ?
( Hint : because there ’s a big twist ending coming . )
Advertisement
In addition , the film wanders abominably as each of these new mundane details flares up and peters out .
For instance , Hathaway is deeply disturbed by the fact that Wilson somehow magically knows how she takes her coffee .
She goes to the library and reads up on ESP , and tells Braugher she ’s researching it because the crash somehow might have made Wilson psychic .
Then it ’s never mentioned again .
So why does this come up at all ?
( Hint again : because there ’s a big twist ending coming ! )
The movie ’s second major problem is that none of its mysteries are particularly mysterious , since the entire cast is working overtime to explain them away .
Some evidence suggests that the airline is trying to whitewash the crash — but as crash survivor Don Thompson points out , that makes perfect sense , since they have a lot to lose if the crash was provably caused by an ongoing faulty standard of maintenance .
Thompson himself fears that he ’s being followed , but Hathaway reasonably explains that trauma survivors tend to feel paranoid , that it ’s a natural reaction , but not worth concerning himself over .
For her part , Hathaway is worried because her therapy patients keep “ disappearing ” — which is to say , they stop showing up for therapy one by one .
But as Braugher reminds her , it ’s not that surprising for people to miss therapy sessions .
( What he does n’t say is that it ’s especially unsurprising in this case , since Hathaway is a timid , hesitant , unhelpful therapist with no particular focus , except her annoyingly intrusive attempts to get details out of her patients that might prove the airline ’s culpability in the crash . )

So with all those potential mysteries patched over with entirely sensible explanations , the only problems left in the movie are tiny ridiculous ones : Hathaway ’s neighbor Dianne Wiest is mysteriously pushy and nice !
The mysterious guy who was mysteriously standing around Hathaway ’s therapy session is still standing around !
Hathaway ’s sister , whom she has n’t spoken to in a long time , mysteriously does n’t call her back after Hathaway leaves an unpleasant passive - aggressive message !
Dun dun DUNNNN !
But above all , the most mysterious element of the film — and the film ’s third major problem — is Hathaway ’s relationship with Wilson .
He ’s unsettlingly contemptuous of her — when she deflects his flat flirtations and persists in trying to talk to him as a therapist , he snaps “ You ’re like a dog with a bone ! ”
He repeatedly compliments her appearance , though usually while shaking his head disapprovingly , as though it annoys him that she ’s pretty .
And even though he ’s an unlikeable control freak — either shutting down any attempts to talk about himself , or repeatedly battering her with random demands like “ Help me randomly slather paint on my wall , ’ cause I ’ve decided to be an artist ” — she starts to fall for him .
And presumably he ’s falling for her , even though she ’s a freak herself .
Check out her wildly overreacting to a wind - blown newspaper at the beginning of this clip .
And then check out his abusive - boyfriend behavior throughout the rest of it , as he orders her around , makes excuses to put his hands on her , alternately compliments and belittles her , then totally loses his temper over that barking dog outside :

Most of the rest of the film , in fact , is n’t about the airplane non-mystery , it ’s about the supposedly deepening relationship between the two of them , which is largely characterized by his alternating bossiness and petulance — when she asks if they can meet again , he hands her his apartment key , then gets impatient and snotty when she refuses it — and her profound lack of professionalism .
Her entire character is bound up in what a friend of mine calls “ I do n’t want to .
Okay ! ” syndrome , where a supposedly capable female character makes a token protest against something she really should refuse , but then immediately and unconditionally gives in , because , y’know , a man wants her to .
Everything about Wilson is a giant warning siren — “ Dangerous !
Broken !
In denial !
Stay away ! ” — and every time Hathaway tries to re-establish her therapist role , he ignores her and crosses the boundaries of their relationship .
In one case , she delivers a lengthy talk about how they are n’t dating and are going to maintain a proper emotional distance , and he nods and smiles and pretends to listen , then leans over to brush a stray strand of hair out of her mouth .
Creepy !
Though not as creepy as Dianne Wiest as that too - friendly neighbor .
I ’ve been a huge fan of Wiest ’s since Parenthood , and I think she really nails the “ Judi Dench in Notes On A Scandal ” vibe here .
She never says anything too blatantly strange or inappropriate , she ’s just … disturbing .
This may well be the best scene of the movie , where she ’s weirder than anything else in the film , without visibly working to be :
Advertisement
But where her inappropriate efforts to force her way into Hathaway ’s life are strange enough to be comic , Wilson ’s are just unpleasant .
Dig this scene , where he scares the shit out of Hathaway , again aping Jeff Bridges in Fearless with a little casual roof - walking :
Advertisement
Notice that whenever she ’s frightened , he laughs at her .
Whenever she refuses him , he mocks her or mechanically repeats himself until she gives in .
This continues as he does increasingly outrageous and illegal things .
And she , like any good therapist … um … lets him bully and control her .
Then they have sex .
Then she starts using him as a therapist , baring her tiny soul to him .
Then he starts acting even more erratic , and doing even more dangerous things .
And finally , something happens that is n’t easily shrugged off as coincidence , and Passengers starts to feel like it might be both supernatural and a thriller .
It never really loses that sleepy , understated feeling , and Hathaway and Wilson never become easier to believe in or care about as characters , but at least something happens .
But again , it ’s too little too late .
After an hour of seemingly random encounters , during which crucial facts are missing and the focus is entirely on micro-investigations that go nowhere , the accrual of random details , and a horribly unhealthy relationship between an abusive bastard and his terrible weak - willed therapist , it ’s really difficult to care about the next steps .
Especially when the big reveal comes in the form of a massive , clumsy core - dump from a tearful Morse , followed by a series of flashbacks .
Advertisement
Granted , those flashbacks are assembled with more care and art than anything else in the film , and the ending of Passengers is actually touching .
Director Rodrigo García ( Nine Lives , Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her ) gives much of the film a striking look and a hypnotic flow , such that events melt musically into each other , in a way that ’s again appropriate to the big twist — it just is n’t appropriate to the pretense that there ’s a reasonable , concrete , worthwhile story going on before that big twist .
Want to know what the twist is ?
This is your spoiler alert ; feel free to skip from here to the last paragraph if you do n’t want to know .
It ’s like this : Hathaway was on the plane that crashed .
She and Wilson and Morse and Braugher and Wiest and all the rest are all dead .
DUN DUN DUNNNN !
Morse was actually the pilot whose bad decision took the plane down , and Hathaway and Wilson were seatmates — that ’s how he knows how she takes her coffee .
And they ’re all hanging out in a posthumous sort of limbo while Wilson , Hathaway , and the other “ survivors ” come to terms with their deaths .
Wiest , Braugher , and others are guides and guardians , hovering solicitously but unhelpfully over the proceedings and making up the details of this fake world while waiting for Hathaway and the others to twig .
That ’s why Hathaway ’s patients keep disappearing — once they realize they ’re dead ( usually by having dead relatives suddenly show up to say hi ) , they move on to whatever ’s next .
That ’s why the details of Morse and Braugher ’s jobs are so fuzzy — they ’re made - up roles for a made - up world .
That ’s why Hathaway ’s sister never returns her calls — the sister is still alive .
That ’s why the barking dog freaks Wilson out so much — it ’s his dog , a dog that died a long time ago .

And so forth and so on , as all the jarring little things that seemed like bad writing or forgotten loose threads or insignificant distractions suddenly fall into place .
But by that time , who cares what exactly is up with these horrible people ?
And even after all becomes clear , Passengers leaves behind a much larger final mystery :
Why in heaven ’s name ( so to speak ) would anyone think that this clumsy , hole - riddled mockup of a world would gently ease victims into the afterlife ?
Instead , it mostly seems to terrify and traumatize them , right up until they ’re abruptly forced to confront reality in the form of their dead loved ones .
In any other supernatural mystery , this would be hell : a faulty , frightening world where nothing makes sense , you have to turn to a terrible person for a modicum of comfort , and then corpses start turning up .
How much of the experience was n’t a total waste of time ?
Strictly speaking , about three of the film ’s 93 minutes were n’t confusing , irritating , dull , or all three , for a fairly appalling 3.22 percent return on investment .
For what it ’s worth , though , I had the pleasure of seeing this film with my sister , who was so utterly , entertainingly disgusted with it that we had a great time watching it .
Lovers of bad cinema , step on up .
I know this is an old thread , I just came across this problem myself when I was moving my files back to PC from Mac .
Here is the approach I took :
# Check to see what files are in the directory , you may want to save this to a variable or CS
ls - Recurse - force | Where - Object {$_ .
Name - like " ._*" } | Select Name , Directory , Length
# See how many files exist that meet the criteria
ls - Recurse - force | Where - Object {$_ .
Name - like " ._*" } | Measure - Object
# Use the - Force switch to get past the permissions restrictions on the hidden files
ls - Recurse - force | Where - Object {$_ .
Name - like " ._*" } | Remove - Item - Force
# Rinse and repeat for the .
DS Store files
ls - Recurse - force | Where - Object {$_ .

Robert Bookman from the restaurant industry was quoted as saying that it would violate the free speech rights of restaurant owners if they had to post a health department grade of their cleanliness in the window .
More and more , businesses and businesspeople talk about their rights .
It seems , though , that organizations and individuals that focus more on their responsibilities and less on their rights tend to outperform .
You 're responsible to your community , to your customers , to your employees and to your art .
Serve them and the rights thing tends to take care of itself .
Another thought :
If I worked at Pepsi , I 'd be actively lobbying for the obesity sweet soda tax ( a penny an ounce ) being proposed in New York .
Instead , in a no-surprise knee jerk reaction , almost everyone in the industry is lobbying like crazy to stop it .
This is dumb marketing .
The benefit of a tax is that it affects you and your competitors at the same time , so you all benefit from doing the right thing , as opposed to having to compete against someone who does n't care as much as you do .
Once people realize that excessive use of your product makes them sick and then die a long and painful death , it 's probably time to stop lobbying and time to start doing something about it .
This industry should stop thinking it is in the corn syrup delivery business ( which brings nasty side effects along with it ) and start focusing on delivering joy in a bottle .
Lots of interesting ways to do that without giving up profits .
If your success depends on sickening the poorest and least educated portion of your customer base ( and the ones that buy the most from you ) , it 's time to redefine success .
An Interview With Ron Paul
While I was covering CPAC for PJTV , I set up an on camera interview with Ron Paul .
Unfortunately , due to circumstances beyond our control , we were n’t able to actually do the interview .
So , when I got back , I pursued an interview with Ron Paul for Right Wing News .
I was n’t sure the interview would happen because not only do I have some differences of opinion with Ron Paul , I was very hard on him during the 2008 elections .
Still , despite whatever differences we may have , I sincerely appreciate the fact that he was willing to talk with me and was also willing , without the slightest complaint , to answer all the questions I had for him , some of which were pretty tough .
What follows is a slightly edited transcript of the conversation I had last Friday with Ron Paul .

First of all , let ’s assume Obamacare is n’t repealed and we continue to run massive deficits as far as the eye can see , just as the Obama administration is predicting right now .
What are the consequences of that in a decade or two ?
If it lasts that long , it just means that there will be a lot of inflation .
Interest rates have already started to go up and we have price inflation in medical care as well as all the other problems .
With interest rates rising and inflation coming back , this will lower the standard of living of all Americans .
Actually , the standard of living has been going down for over 10 years and real wages have gone down over these past 10 years .
So a program like this on top of our problems just makes things much worse , just hastens the day that the dollar will lose a lot more value — maybe to the point where they will destroy the dollar completely .
Now , you ’re a doctor — so you ’re especially qualified to speak on the health care reform bill that just passed .
If one of your constituents came up to you and asked what to expect from this bill over time if it remains in place , what would you tell him ?
They ’re going to get a lot worse care , there will be more between the doctor and the patient –already there ’s way too much interference between the doctor and patient .
We have the insurance company and the medical management companies already , but this will add to the government ’s bureaucrats , it will indirectly have the drug companies involved , and the insurance companies will stay involved .
It just will become more bureaucratic , doctors will become more frustrated , and there will be less doctors available because the ones who have been on the verge of quitting will probably quit .
Eventually , the amount of care will have to be rationed because the cost will go up , the government will always see shortfalls , and because of the shortage of doctors , care will be rationed .
It will make our patients a lot more unhappy .
OK , let me ask you a couple of tougher questions .
You think it ’s been proven that Barack Obama was born in Hawaii or do you believe his real birthplace is still in doubt ?
Oh , I do n’t have a strong opinion about that .
I would say that until they prove otherwise , that he was born in Hawaii .
One more question along those similar lines .
During the campaign in 2008 , there was a lot of talk about the North American Union .
It sort of dropped off the radar after Bush left office .
Post - Bush , what do you think about that ?
I think it might be a very bad sign because there had been talk about the North American Union and currency for this hemisphere .
But I think what has happened is that the United States internationally has become such a powerhouse with their empire that they more or less have taken over the United Nations .
Instead of them being on the short end of votes , I think they have literally become the owners .
So therefore , I ’m more concerned about a world currency rather than a hemispheric currency … .
But the move away from sovereign nations is still ongoing .
There ’s still this effort to take advantage of this crisis and move toward an international agreement or a world government .
So I see the fact that they talk less about regional government is probably … is not a good sign .
Now one idea that you ’ve championed that ’s gained a lot of support in both parties is auditing the Fed .
Can you explain the idea to someone who says , “ I do n’t know why we need to do this ? ”
What would you say to him about why we need to audit the Fed ?
Well , fortunately , I do n’t get many questions like that .
Most of the time I get questions like , “ Why in the world are n’t we auditing the Fed ? ”
That , of course , is the better question because we should know .
During the financial crisis , the Fed created $ 2 trillion , they passed the money out to their friends , and they refused to tell us , the Congress , and the American people where this money has gone .
So this sort of set the stage for the American people to demand that we have an audit .
I ’ve been working on that for years , but there was no interest .
But , the crisis has gotten a lot of people interested in the subject and I think that ’s the reason that all the Republicans in the House have supported this .
Well over 100 of the Democrats support it , too ; so I think we ’re certainly moving in that direction — but it ’s important to know , just for transparency ’s sake , and who gets the benefits and which people , which companies are allowed to drop through the cracks .
Now one of the things that has most contributed to the perception that Congress is corrupt , is earmarking .
We regularly see cases where campaign contributors receive earmarks or earmarks seem to be traded for votes .
Now many Republicans support a ban on earmarks for that reason , but you do n’t .
Can you talk a little bit about why that is ?
Yes , I see this in a constitutional manner and think that one of the problems that we have faced in the last 50 years has been the steady erosion of constitutional power , the giving up of the prerogatives to the executive branch , as well as to the judicial branch .
I do n’t want a strong executive branch .
I do n’t want presidents to be able to go to war without declarations .
I do n’t want presidents to write executive orders , signing statements , because that gives them way too much power .
We ’ve allowed the executive branch to write regulations , which have the force of law .
This is just another example of the Congress giving up their prerogatives because when you have a chance to vote against an earmark , you do n’t save any money .
You say that this money ca n’t be earmarked for somebody ’s district to build a highway .
Well , the money came out of the district , so why should we let the bureaucrats or the executive branch decide who gets the money ?
The President comes back and says , “ Oh , ok , I can put it in the budget if you do A , B , C , & D for me . ”
So , it gives the executive branch that much more power .
So , I see this in a very strict constitutional sense .
I defend strongly the responsibility of the Congress to designate every penny they spend .
Yet , I think all the spending is too much ; so I vote against all the appropriations .
Besides , the definition of earmarks is different .
When they talk about earmarks , they are these special things that might go to a person ’s district .
It ’s less than one percent of the budget .
But the way I look at earmarks — I think earmarking $ 1 billion to build an embassy in London — it makes no sense whatsoever .
I do n’t want that either ; so that ’s my reason for opposing the ban on earmarks .
I want the Congress to designate where every penny should be spent .
Now there ’s a debate among some Libertarians whether it ’s better to support a third party or to come into the Republican Party and try to make changes from within .
Where do you come down on that ?
… I ’d say work within , but that ’s my personal decision .
There was one time in my life when I was trying to do it outside the Republican Party , but ….
I get the question all the time and I just tell the people to do what you feel like , do what you want to do .
Do what you ’re most comfortable with and where you think you can do the most good .
Some people do n’t want to work within the Republican Party ; so they should do whatever they ’d like to do .
There ’s no one answer for everybody .
I do point out to people , though , that the election laws are controlled by the Republicans and Democrats ; so that ’s one thing they agree on .
If you exclude any opposition outside the two party system philosophically , then that squeezes people because philosophically , there ’s not a whole lot of difference when you look at history .
Government keeps growing regardless of which party is in power .
So I just think that with the way they pass laws , like the getting into debates , getting on ballots , and the way you ’re treated by the media , it ’s just very , very difficult to have any democratic competition in this country .
Now there was a debate question you were asked that I remember .
It had to do with eliminating both the CIA and FBI .
Those were n’t the only agencies the question mentioned , but it did mention those two .
You seemed , as I remember , to be answering that if you had your way , yes , you would do that .
Do n’t both those agencies , despite their flaws , serve vital roles ?
Can you elaborate on your views there a little bit ?
Yes .
I think intelligence gathering is very , very important .
Matter of fact , there was somebody on TV just recently , an ex-CIA agent who has just written a book on this subject .
He thinks the CIA is totally inept and has never produced worthwhile information .
Even when they ’re given good information , like on the underwear bomber , they do n’t know what to do with it .
So on intelligence gathering , there ’s a military and I think there are certain things that the FBI ought to do , but I do n’t think the FBI should ever be spying on groups of people like they did in the anti-war movement in the ’ 60 ’s — like they do when they infiltrate the right to life groups or the pro-gun groups .
Spying on the American people is not part of the American process ; so that ’s what I object to .
The CIA is involved in way too much .
Not only do we fight undeclared wars , but it ’s the CIA operating their computers who decide who gets bombed and who does n’t get bombed in Pakistan and in Yemen .
To me , it is just totally bewildering that we put up with this .
There ’s no real oversight for the CIA .
There have been so many CIA agents who have left the department and wrote about this .
They get involved in foreign elections .
They get involved in killing people .
I just do n’t think that the CIA has proved themselves to be worth very much .
We could still deal with intelligence gathering without the intrigue of the CIA being involved in so much secret activity involvement in other countries as well as in our own country .
Now as I ’m hearing it , it sounds like you ’d maybe reform both agencies instead of getting rid of them .
Is that basically what you mean ?
Well , I ’d probably lean more on the gathering of information with the military and the FBI .
But I ’d curtail their activities once they do this blanket spying on people .
Of course , since we ’ve had the Patriot Act , this gives them license to watch anything and everything all American citizens do , whether it ’s their telephones , their faxes , their e-mail , or whatever .
Now what would you say to the argument that illegal aliens contribute to the tax base and do jobs that Americans wo n’t do ?
Plus , what about the idea that people should be able to go wherever they want across the border — so we should allow them to come into the United States and be citizens ?
Well , I disagree with it .
Citizenship should be restricted and it should be kept legal .
It is true that illegal aliens will have some benefits and they will be productive to some degree .
But if you add the pluses and the minuses , actually there ’ve been some studies on this to show that it ’s actually a negative — because if they know and anticipate that they will get citizenship , then they bring their families in .
Their families use our emergency rooms and our schools .
If you add it all up , it is a tax .
It is a burden .
What we need to deal with is how do we get back to a thriving , healthy free market economy ?
( If we were ) more lenient on our immigration laws , they should not qualify for any freebies and they should certainly not be rewarded by citizenship .
Getting down to the last two questions here ….
Most people consider Abe Lincoln to be one of our greatest presidents , if not the greatest president we ’ve ever had .
Would you agree with that sentiment and why or why not ?
No , I do n’t think he was one of our greatest presidents .
I mean , he was determined to fight a bloody civil war , which many have argued could have been avoided .
For 1/100 the cost of the war , plus 600 thousand lives , enough money would have been available to buy up all the slaves and free them .
So , I do n’t see that is a good part of our history .
Besides , the Civil War was to prove that we had a very , very strong centralized federal government and that ’s what it did .
It rejected the notion that states were a sovereign nation .
The people who disagree want to turn around and say , “ Oh , yes , those guys just wanted to protect slavery . ”
But that ’s just a cop -out if you look at this whole idea of what happened in our country because Lincoln really believed in the centralized state .
He was a Hamiltonian type and objected to everything Jefferson wanted .
Ok , and the last question .
If somehow you were allowed to make three changes to the law or amendments to the Constitution , any three you wanted , what would they be .
I ’ll qualify this with the statement that the Constitution is not all that bad .
Our problem is people ignore it .
I mean , you take the proper interpretation of the interstate commerce clause and the general welfare clause — and we know what it means , but people want to read something else into it so the words have no meaning .
The words only depend on the character of the people whom we elect .
In the last 100 years , the character of those individuals has been very , very sloppy in watching out for our rights .
I guess , if you wanted to try a little harder to protect against that , you could write in some more prohibitions .
They thought for sure if they just said this is what you ’re allowed to do , you ca n’t do anything else , the people would be able to read into that .
It looks to me like in this day and age , you almost have to write down and say what the government is not allowed to do .
So , writing some prohibitions that say you ca n’t develop the welfare state and you ca n’t go to — we already have it in there , you ca n’t go to war without a declaration , but I think I would write into the Constitution , the guarantee for nullification of laws .
I imagine you could write the Second Amendment a little bit better to make that very , very explicit , but unfortunately , better language could be helpful — but the only thing that is going to improve things is better people being in charge .
Ron , I really appreciate your time .
Thank you .
Thank you .

If you 're in Arizona and look even remotely like some policeman 's idea of an illegal immigrant , a law signed today says you will have to produce papers showing you 're in the USA legally whenever and where - ever an officer requests this -- and so will anyone else with you .
Now , faith leaders are calling this new law , signed by Gov. Jan Brewer this afternoon , a sin against God and man and at least one says believers should not comply .
Faith in Public
Life rushed out a press release round up of major faith groups calling this " an affront to moral conscience " and urging comprehensive national immigration reform .
A sampling :
Rev. Jim Wallis , the evangelical leader of Sojourners , says ,
The law signed today by Arizona Gov. Brewer is a social and racial sin , and should be denounced as such by people of faith and conscience across the nation .
It is not just about Arizona , but about all of us , and about what kind of country we want to be .
It is not only mean - spirited , it will be ineffective and will only serve to further divide communities in Arizona , making everyone more fearful and less safe .
This radical new measure , which crosses many moral and legal lines , is a clear demonstration of the fundamental mistake of separating enforcement from comprehensive immigration reform .
Enforcement without reform of the system is merely cruel .
Enforcement without compassion is immoral .
Enforcement that breaks up families is unacceptable .
This law will make it illegal to love your neighbor in Arizona , and will force us to disobey Jesus and his gospel .
We will not comply . "
New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good says :
Throughout the Bible , God commands us in no uncertain terms to show kindness and hospitality to the foreigner and the stranger ...
We join with Evangelicals and people of conscience everywhere in denouncing this wholly unbiblical and immoral law . "
Gideon Aronoff , head of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society , says :
The Jewish community has long called on our national leaders to reform our immigration laws to ' welcome the stranger ' and to create an effective federal immigration system characterized by the rule of law and the humane treatment of newcomers .
In the meantime , Arizonans are now living in a world where police may impound vehicles transporting anyone found to be an undocumented immigrant , which means that Arizonans who do n't check the papers of the kids they drive to Sunday school may now be engaging in illegal activity .
Arizona has taken itself out of the mainstream of American life and has betrayed the proud history of a nation built by immigrants .
Are you going to pack your passport or papers for your next trip to Arizona ( particularly if you are brunette or brown skinned or anyone 's stereotype of someone from south of the border ) ?
Or will this prompt you to add the Arizona governor to your prayer list ?
Or do you want to see your state do the same ?
Would your church approve ?
The number 13 had a bad reputation long before 1970 , but it only got worse on April 13 of that year .
Just eight months earlier , Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon .
Apollo 12 had a successful mission to the moon in November .
But Apollo 13 had that number .
Lift off two days earlier was at 1:13 PM , or 13:13 in military time .
Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell noticed the coincidence of the time , but he is not a superstitious man .
Besides , lift - off was on April 11th .
He , Jack Swigert , and Fred Haise were on their way to the moon to explore the Fra Mauro highlands and bring back moon samples .
On the 13th , two days into the flight , there was a loud bang .
Lovell and Swigert looked at Haise , who had startled the crew members before by actuating a lunar module relief valve .
But this was no prank .
A liquid oxygen tank had exploded , which blew out the side of the service module .
Power went down .
Oxygen leaked out .
Swigert and Lovell radioed Mission Control with those understated words , " Houston , we 've had a problem . " 
The crew at Mission Control who had complained of boredom over the previous two days would never do so again .
The original mission was aborted ; the new mission was to get the three crewmen back to earth alive .
Flight director Gene Kranz and his team hunkered down to figure out how to stretch the spaceship 's available resources .
To conserve energy , all but essential systems were shut down .
The astronauts moved into the lunar module , which had enough resources for two days for two men .
Now , those resources would have to last four days for three men .
There was backup oxygen on board , but power and water had to be conserved .
And carbon dioxide buildup would be a problem .
Mission Control worked on the filter problem .
The canisters of lithium hydroxide used to filter carbon dioxide in the lunar module were a different size from the available canisters in the command module .
On directions from Houston , the crew rigged up a system using duct tape and hosing , to adapt the command module 's canisters for lunar module use .
The contraption they built was called the " mailbox " .
Also to conserve energy , on board television cameras were turned off , and NASA used miniatures and animations to keep the public informed of Apollo 13's progress .
With critically low resources , there was no way the crew could land on the moon , but they continued on the trajectory to the moon in order to pass around it and gain momentum from the moon 's gravity to coast back to earth .
This picture was taken from Apollo 13 's lunar flyby .
On approach to earth , the crew jettisoned the damaged service module , then moved into the command module and jettisoned their " lifeboat " , the lunar module .
They splashed down in the Pacific on April 17th , four days after the tank explosion .
An investigation into what went wrong with Apollo 13 found that a heating wire inside the liquid oxygen tank had lost its insulation , which led to the explosion .
The cause was a combination of mistakes in design , testing , and implementation .
The report is available online .
The entire Apollo 13 operations team was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom as a group .
Mission number 13 may have been unlucky to have experienced the explosion , but an entire series of lucky breaks and intelligent decisions contributed to the crew 's safe return .
Lovell wrote a book about the mission , Lost Moon in 1994 .Â
It became a best seller .
Ron Howard made the book into the 1995 movie Apollo 13 .
Tom Hanks was nervous about his role as commander Jim Lovell , because an actorÂ rarely gets the chance to play one of his childhood heroes .
But the movie introduced a new generation to the real - life suspense of the Apollo 13 mission .
Jim Lovell and Fred Haise got together yesterday with Gene Krantz and other members of the Apollo 13 team at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago to mark the 40th anniversary of the flight .
Jack Swigert died in 1982 .
Jim Lovell , now 82 , owns a restaurant in Lake Forest , Illinois .
Fred Haise , now 76 , is building a science museum in Mississippi .
See a video of the two retired astronauts speaking about the mission .

When asked at a forum last night by Media Matters if it was appropriate for Fox News to be so openly supporting the Tea Party , the CEO of Fox ’s parent company Rupert Murdoch said that Fox should not be supporting any party , and that he wanted to investigate the matter , so as an attempt to help along Rupert ’s “ investigation ” here are some videos of Fox ’s Tea Party advocacy .
Here is Murdoch from last night :
Advertisements
In case you could n’t understand the video , Murdoch said , “ No . I do n’t think we should be supporting the Tea Party or any other party .
But I ’d like to investigate what you are saying before condemning anyone . ”
If Rupert is serious about an investigation , he should probably start with his best boy Glenn Beck who referred to the tea parties last April as , “ FNC Tax Day Tea Parties . ”
Ouch :
Here is video of Fox promoting the Tea Party rally in Searchlight , NV :
And more Fox News Tea Party promotion during the 2 pm news hour :
Here is Neal Cavuto promoting his Tea Party coverage on Fox News :
It would seem that his cubs have been up to some mischief if you believe the explanation provided by papa bear Rupert Murdoch , who could very well “ investigate ” Fox News , but his investigation is certain to come to the conclusion that his network is only providing legitimate coverage of the Tea Party .
In Rupert Mudoch ’s alternate reality , Fox News really is fair and balanced , and they do n’t support any political party or ideology .
On its surface Murdoch ’s statement is correct , Fox News should not be supporting any political party .
He did n’t bother to address the fact that they are .
Interestingly enough , the above clips also shatter the idea that Fox News is composed of both a news and an opinion division .
If FNC is composed of two divisions , why is the news division promoting Tea Party events ?
The answer is that all areas of Fox News get their talking points from management , and that is what will be talked about for the day across both news and opinion programming .
Remember , Rupert Murdoch said that Fox News should not be supporting the Tea Party .
He did n’t say that they would stop .
In the continuing “ Eastern Conference Playoff Preview ” series , I ’ll take a look at the Pittsburgh Penguins , who lead the Atlantic Division with 95 points .
The defending champions have had an up and down season , including dropping all six games to the Devils .
Can the defending champions repeat their performance and hoist Lord Stanley again ?
Forwards :
When healthy , the Penguins have arguably the best two lines in the N.H.L .
The top two centers , Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby , consistently rank near the top of the league in scoring .
As of today , Sidney Crosby leads the scoring race , tallying 47 goals .
But it ’s not only the top two lines who can score .
Jordan Staal continues to improve year in and year out , and has 21 goals on the season .
Deadline day acquisition Alex Ponikarovsky can move the puck and set up teammates , leading to his 29 assists .
And he plays on the fourth line .
This depth is one of the strengths of the Penguins .
Good scorers , like Chris Kunitz and Bill Guerin , fly under the radar because of their depth .
I believe that , without a doubt , the Penguins arguably the best depth among their forwards , ranking with Washington atop the conference .
Defense :
The blueline is where things get interesting .
Sergei Gonchar , one of the Pittsburgh ’s best defenseman , has only played in 57 games this season .
Gonchar , who ’s one of the leaders on the powerplay , has far underperformed the team ’s expectations .
After finishing sixth in goals against last season , they ’re currently ranked in the 20th .
Kris Letang has taken a backseat this year , and the rest of the defense is underwhelming .
They also do n’t have a big , physical presence on the blueline .
The Penguins lack of depth could hurt them in the playoffs .
They ’re going to lean on their forwards to succeed , and this strategy is n’t the best .
Goalie :
Marc -Andre Fleury is one of the solid goaltenders in the N.H.L .
In 62 games , Fleury is 35 - 19 - 6 , with a 2.65 goals against average and a .906 save percentage .
Fleury can always make the great save , and his presence in net brings a calming influence to the defensive zone .
In the past few years , he ’s began to deal with injuries .
It seems that Fleury is good for at least one injury per season , which is an added worry in the playoffs .
When healthy , Fleury can steal the Penguins a few games .
But he needs to remain healthy to give the Penguins an added edge .
So , what can we expect from the Penguins come playoff time ?
The team is going to play hard , gritty hockey .
They ’re forwards are clearly the strength , but they do have questions along the blueline .
They ’ve also struggled against the top teams , losing all six games to the Devils and struggling against the Capitals .
Not only that , but significant players have missed time with injury .
But they are the defending champions , and the will still be champs until someone knocks them out of the playoffs .
Even with their problems , Pittsburgh will be a tough opponent in any playoff series .

One of the businesses booming ( along with the medical profession and pharmaceuticals thanks to the " hepatitis C-tattoo " alliance ) as a consequence of the tattoo - craze is the dermatology industry .
According to the American Society of Dermatological surgery , over 50 % of everyone receiving a tattoo wants it removed .
Tattoo removal via laser surgery is among the fastest growing areas of the dermatology industry .
Depending on the size of the tattoo and colors used , the laser tattoo removal surgery can be very painful and very expensive .
Tattoos performed by commercial tattoo parlors are much more difficult to remove because the tattoo is deeper , the ink more complex and thicker .
It normally takes between 10 and 15 laser surgery sessions to remove the average tattoo , but 25 - 30 sessions are not uncommon , depending on the complexity of the tattoo .
When you consider the average single session costs between $ 400 - $ 800 , the removal surgery can be very expensive , costing as much as $ 20,000 .
That $ 25 tattoo might cost $ 5000 to remove .
And may I remind you , health insurance does not cover tattoo removals – this is strictly out of the pocket expenses .
And yet despite this enormous personal cost , most people are so disgusted with their tattoo they ’ll literally pay any cost to have it removed .
Plastic Surgeon Tolbert S. Wilkinson , of San Antonio , Texas , who has removed tattoos warns : " If people only realized how difficult it is to remove a tattoo , understood how costly and how painful tattoo removal is , and recognized that society as a whole still views tattoos as a stigma , maybe they would think seriously before getting one .
Laser removal costs a minimum of $ 7,000.00 ( national average ) per tattoo , and takes at least 10 to 15 treatments , spread out over two or more years .
Even with this treatment , the tattoo is still visible . "

Tattoo author Laura Reybold , writes that " . . .an ever rising number of people are so unhappy with their tattoos that they are willing to pay anything to have them removed . "
" Yet an ever rising number of people are so unhappy with their tattoos that they are willing to pay anything to have them removed .
Tattoo removal laser surgery is becoming big business for the dermatologists who perform it . "
( Laura Reybold , Everything you need to know about the dangers of tattooing and body piercing , p. 30 ) Ronald Scutt , says in Art , Sex and Symbol that even among sailors in the Royal Naval , over 50 % regretted ever getting a tattoo .
And among the married it rose to over 70 % " From the statistics of the Royal Naval survey , the most significant factor to emerge was almost certainly the incidence of regrets .
Out of the whole sample , more than half admitted that they wished they had never been tattooed .
In the married group , the figure rose to around 70 per cent . "
( Ronald Scutt , Art , Sex and Symbol , 1974 , p. 179 )
One article claims that as many as 80 percent of people with tattoos regret their tattoo .
( www.spacecom.af.mil/hqafspc/News/News_Asp/nws_tmp.asp?storyid=02-93)
We receieved the following email shortly after we published this article on the web .
( Used with permission ) .
I 've just completed reading your article on tattooing and the truth of it all deeply troubled me .
I am a Christian , and like most I 've back - slidden several times throughout my life .
During one of these times , I recieved two tattoos .
One is a " tribal " band on my left arm , though it does n't fully circle the whole upper-arm .
The other is on my right shoulder , the letters " MSC " in cursive writing signifying the names of my best friend , his wife , and their little daughter .
Even though I love my friend and his family , I deeply regret getting their initials tattooed onto my body .
Moreover , I seriously and gravely regret with all my heart getting my other tattoo ( the tribal band on my left arm ) .
Being a few years older now ( 29 and married ) there is not a day that goes by that I do n't regret getting these tattoos .
When I dress , I 'm forced to see them in the mirror .
When I shower I 'm forced to see them .
What makes matters worse , is that I knew all along that it is was wrong .
I justified it with a back - slidden mind by thinking such things as " God only considers the heart and mind " , " physical sins do n't compare to spiritual sins " , and so on , and so on .
With my depraved and back - slidden mind , I justified an abomination to God Himself , who instructs us through His divine law not to print any marks on our bodies ( Leviticus 19:28 ) .
If this is the law that will be used to rightly judge the world , how much more should we as Christians observe and uphold it ?
The woman doing my first tattoo ( the tribal band ) had to stop several times for mysterious reasons .
She was visibly shaken and could not concentrate .
She kept saying , " man , I need a break . "
Though
It was n't for my sake , I hid the pain very well and tuned it out for the most part -- but this woman could not wait to get me out of that chair .
She claimed that she drank quite a bit the night before ( I was getting the tattoo on a saturday afternoon ) , and this seemed to be the most logical reason that she was having such a tough time .
I can't help but wonder , however , if there was more to it .
Even then my diminished discernment was working , and I sensed a spiritual conflict taking place .
When the woman had finished , she made a disturbing remark that will foever echo in mind , " there ya go , you 're no longer a virgin . "
Of course , she spoke not of physical sexuality , but of spiritual defilement against God in the form of marking my flesh .
Now I was " one of the gang " , one of the " cool people " , and one of the rebels who shakes their fist at the law of God .
I 'm still troubled , even knowing that I 'm forgiven .
My only hope is for the glorification of the body , when the Lord shall raise us uncorruptable .
My tattoos stand as constant reminders of my past depravity when I forsook truly walking with God , and only rendered Him lip - service .
They will continue to be my marks of shame for the rest of the time appointed .
Thank you for your article .
Hopefully this message will get out and all the right people will hear it , and save them from the fate of my shame and regret .
It would bring great solace to know that another person would read your article and avert my mistakes -- which I would take back in a second if only I had the chance .
Through my own research , I 've drawn all the same conclusions you have concerning tattooing , body modification , and other self - destructive practices .
May the Lord bless you and grant you peace and understanding , Before you let that ink " mark " you for life you ’d better think very careful about the possible health , spiritual and social consequences .
Most people later regret , and even hate , their tattoo .
The cost of getting a tattoo can be very high among social and health risks .
" Emotional risks include negative feelings you might have as a result of getting a tattoo or piercing .
Social risks are those that could damage your relationship with others , including friends , parents , teachers , and employers .
. .
For example , body modification can affect your chances for future employment .
Certain jobs are not available to people who have visible body art . "
( Bonnie B. Graves , Tattooing and body piercing , p. 43 ) " The fact that so many people change their minds should lead you to think carefully about whether you want to lock yourself into a fashion statement that might cause you a lot of aggravation and heartache later in life . "
( Laura Reybold , Everything you need to know about the dangers of tattooing and body piercing , p. 32 ) " What so few realize , tragically , is that such a mark [ tattoo ] becomes the albatross around the neck for all time . "
( Ronald Scutt , Art , Sex and Symbol , 1974 , p. 181 ) 21 Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good .
22 Abstain from all appearance of evil .
23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly ; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .

In regions like these , where dairy - making might be difficult , expensive or untraditional , the stability and reliable sweetness of condensed milk has earned it a lot of fans .
“ It is hard to explain the relationship people have with it in Latin America , ” said Leticia Moreinos Schwartz , a cooking teacher in Connecticut who grew up in Rio de Janeiro .
“ Leite moça came when life was hard and there were not many treats , ” she said , using the generic Brazilian term that means “ milk of the lady , ” a reference to the Swiss milkmaid on cans of Nestlé condensed milk , introduced to Brazil in 1921 .
It is one of the three milks in Mexican tres leches cake , and can be caramelized right in the can to make dulce de leche .
( Put the can in a pot and boil for three hours ; keep the can covered with boiling water or it will overheat and may explode . )
Sweetened condensed milk came on the United States market in 1856 , the brainchild of Gail Borden , a chronic culinary inventor .
( He had already patented a prototype of a complete nutrition bar , which he called a “ meat biscuit . ” )
Mr. Borden began experimenting with sterilized milk after a series of “ swill milk ” scandals that revealed the true contents of much of the milk then for sale in American cities : chalk powder , molasses and vermin .
His process  a combination of vacuum pressure , heat and added sugar  produced a dairy product that is nearly indestructible , with a shelf life of years .
Mr. Borden made his fortune supplying condensed milk to the Union Army in the Civil War .
It was airlifted into Berlin in the 1940s , and more recently has opened up Asia as a major market for American milk .

“ We grow up with it , ” said Kathy Wong , an owner of Laut restaurant , one of few places in New York that serves real Malaysian pulled tea , or teh tarik .
It is a thick brew of strong tea  preferably Boh brand , grown in the cool Cameron Highlands north of Kuala Lumpur  and condensed milk .
( Fresh - squeezed ginger juice can be added to make teh halia , reminiscent of Indian chai . )
The mixture is poured vigorously back and forth from one pot to another : this is the “ pulling ” process , which makes the drink smooth and gives it a frothy top .
“ The higher the pour , the thicker the top , ” said her partner Camie Lai , who said that hawkers compete for customers by pulling the tea behind their backs , or from ever - greater heights .
Among those who see cooking as an ongoing science experiment or craft project , condensed milk can do the work of milk , sugar and eggs combined  and can often stand in for all three .
Jessica P Lin , who has a blog , epicuriouseateries.blogspot.com , where she posts recipes and restaurant reviews , long tinkered with recipes for ice cream that would n’t require an ice cream maker .
“ At the time , I was a culinary student , but all I had at home was a $ 10 hand mixer , ” said Ms. Lin , who grew up in Dallas and now lives in New York .
She has often visited Taiwan , where her parents were born , and where condensed milk is a popular topping for dessert , or bread .
Groups Blast Westlands Attempt to Use Aqueduct as Sewerby Dan BacherEvery time that you think that corporate agribusiness can't stoop any lower than they have already in their campaign to destroy imperiled fish populations and fishing jobs , they always manage to reach a new low in their race to the bottom .
In the latest surrealistic episode in the California water wars , Westlands Water District , the " Darth Vader " of California water politics , is now seeking a permit to pollute the drinking water supply for millions of Californians , according to a coalition of environmental , fishing and tribal groups .
"
Westlands has proposed a project to discharge up to 100,000 acre feet of groundwater into the State Water Project California Aqueduct , a drinking water supply for approximately 20 million people , " revealed Bill Jennings , executive director of the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance .
The CSPA and other organizations on March 2 submitted comments regarding Westlands ' proposed discharge and conveyance of polluted groundwater into and through the California Aqueduct of the State Water Project .
The organizations submitting the comments include the California Water Impact Network , Sierra Club , Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen 's Associations ( PCFFA ) , AquAlliance , Restore the Delta , Planning and Conservation League , Friends of the River , Southern California Watershed Alliance , Salmon Water Now , Crab Board Owners Association , Winnemen Wintu Tribe , Save the American River Association , Southern California Watershed Alliance and North Coast Rivers Alliance .
"
Westland 's groundwater is highly contaminated with selenium , boron , and salts , " said Jennings .
" The California Aqueduct is a water of the nation and supplies drinking water to more than 20 million people in Southern California .
The aqueduct also has identified recreation and wildlife habitat beneficial uses and its waters supply reservoirs and streams that support significant fisheries habitat .
" Jennings accused Westlands of " essentially attempting to dilute polluted wastes , created by irrigating impaired soils , with relatively good quality aqueduct water .
"
The coalition letter raises numerous issues , including the fact that the project would require Clean Water Act discharge permits and that the Department of Water Resources and not Westlands is the proper lead agency to prepare the EIR under the California Environmental Quality Act .
The groups said the EIR ( Environmental Impact Report ) for the project should include evaluation of the proposed action ’s impact on the following : 1 . The SWP water supplies caused by the introduction of degraded groundwater into the California Aqueduct .
2 .
The variability over time and among wells in the quality of ground water , and changing impacts on the California Aqueduct over time .
3 .
The quantitative assessment on California ’s water supply , including increased treatment costs and public health costs , due to increases in selenium , salts , boron and other contaminants that will persist during the twenty five year term of the proposed action .
4 .
Subsidence impacts to the aqueduct from pumping up to 100,000 acre feet annually .
5 . The bioaccumulation of contaminants in the sediments of the aqueduct .
6 .
The precedent - setting significance of degrading the quality of water in the California Aqueduct .
" This proposed action of allowing up to 100,000 acre feet of groundwater to be discharged into the California Aqueduct annually will export pollution costs from Westlands to other water districts or drinking - water suppliers and result in a direct public health risk , " according to the groups .
" Assurances that the groundwater quality does not exceed drinking water standards will not adequately protect public health because many contaminants , such as the most commonly used pesticides in the area , do not have drinking water standards .
Nor are many of the pesticide contaminants even monitored .
These risks and a full environmental impact analysis need to be included in this environmental analysis .
" This underhanded attempt by Westlands to discharge tainted water into the aqueduct takes place as Westlands , agribusiness tycoons Stewart and Lynda Resnick of Paramount Farms , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Senator Dianne Feinstein have launched an unprecedented war against salmon fishermen , Delta farmers , California Indian Tribes and Central Valley salmon and Delta fish populations .
The most recent battle in this war took place over the past few weeks when Feinstein , the " Patron Saint " of corporate agribusiness , sponsored an amendment to bypass Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) protections for Delta smelt , Sacramento River chinook salmon , Central Valley steelhead , green sturgeon and the southern resident population of killer whales in order to increase Delta water pumping .
Fortunately , a successful campaign by environmentalists , tribes , fishermen and Delta residents - and a better water supply outlook - forced Feinstein to withdraw her amendment for the time being .
" We are deeply grateful to Senator Dianne Feinstein and to Congressmen Jim Costa and Dennis Cardoza for their diligent and persistent efforts to secure this relief for our communities , " said Tom Birmingham , general manager of the Westlands Water District , after the Bureau of Reclamation issued its press release on Central Valley Project water supplies on February 26 .
" Their continued attention to these critical issues will be required in the days and months ahead to ensure that everything that can be done is being done .
"
As Feinstein was launching her attack on salmon and salmon fishermen , the North Coast Rivers Alliance , Friends of the River , Save the American River and Winnemem Wintu Tribe filed a suit in Fresno Superior Court on February 8 demanding " full public disclosure " of the impacts of backroom contract renewals that are being quietly negotiated between Westlands and the Bureau of Reclamation .
The groups want a full environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act ( CEQA ) of the pollution and potential harm that " locking in " such massive water exports from the Delta estuary would cause to waterfowl and shorebirds along the Pacific Flyway and collapsing Central Valley salmon and Delta fish populations Feinstein , Schwarzenegger , agribusiness and their " environmental " collaborators such as the Nature Conservancy are also sabotaging efforts to restore the Delta , the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Americas , by pushing plans to build a peripheral canal and new dams .
The canal / tunnel fiasco would cost the state $ 23 billion to $ 53.8 billion , indebting generations of future Californians .
The peripheral canal , if constructed , is also likely to result in the extinction of Sacramento River salmon and Delta fish populations , as well as the destruction of thousands of jobs in the recreational and commercial fishing industries .
As Mark Franco , headman of the Winnemem Wintu Tribe , said , " The peripheral canal is a big , stupid idea that does n’t make any sense from a tribal environmental perspective .
Building a canal to save the Delta is like a doctor inserting an arterial bypass from your shoulder to your hand – it will cause your elbow to die just like taking water out of the Delta through a peripheral canal will cause the Delta to die .

After eight years of development , remote gaming service OnLive is scheduled to roll out on June 17 .
After eight years of development , remote gaming service OnLive is scheduled to roll out on June 17 .
The company also announced its service pricing : users will need to pay $ 14.95 per month , which will allow them access to the service .
However , the company did not disclose the price to rent or purchase games .
The first 25,000 users who preorder via the OnLive preorder site will receive their first three months of service free , the company said in a blog post .
( Preregistration does not require a credit card , at least initially . )
In addition , loyalty programs and special deals at the June E3 show ( when OnLive launches ) will also add other discounts , the company said .
" Everyone here at OnLive is just incredibly excited about this milestone , " Steve Perlman , the company 's chief executive and founder , said in a blog post .
" It 's the realization of a dream that we knew would be a huge undertaking , but also one that would change everything . "
OnLive 's claim to fame is that it puts PC users closer to console gamers in terms of hardware investment .
Instead of being forced to constant shell out hundreds of dollars in CPU , graphics , and memory upgrades , OnLive completely abstracts both the game as well as the processing power required to run it , placing both inside a remote server .
The service turns the user 's PC into something like a dumb terminal , meaning that , at least theoretically , even an older laptop with a high - speed broadband connection should be able to run the latest games .
The service will be enabled via a PC browser plugin ; later , a " MicroConsole " TV adapter will allow users to play them on their HDTVs .
Because the service is video - based to begin with , normal features -- gamertags , friends , and chat -- are supplemented with live spectating , so - called " Brag Clips " video recordings , and instant game demos , which can be instantly accessed and shared , Perlman said .
Users will also be able to pause and resume , even on a different platform .
Users will be able to buy and rent " instant - play , top - tier , newly - released games , " but OnLive will announce the actual prices closer to E3 , Perlman wrote , adding that he expected prices to be " competitive " with retail offerings .
OnLive has put up a page with games it expects to support ( including " Borderlands , " " Crysis Wars , " " Mass Effect 2 , " and " Dragon Age : Origins " ) although whether or not all of them will be available at launch is unknown .
Previous demonstrations of the technology have worked well , although it 's unclear how the network will hold up under strain .
Perlman has said previously that the OnLive service will render games at about the equivalent of 720 p , so games on high - resolution PC screens may look a little fuzzy .
The OnLive technology could seemingly pose a threat to companies like AMD , which manufactures both CPUs and graphics chips .
But AMD invited an OnLive competitor , OTOY , to a Sept. 2009 launch event where it announced its Eyefinity technology .

Following in Switzerland 's Footsteps International Right - Wingers Gather for EU - Wide Minaret Ban
Delegates from right - wing populist parties from across Europe are descending on Germany this weekend for a conference looking into the possibility of an EU - wide minaret ban .
The hosts , an anti-Muslim German group , hope to use the gathering as a springboard to success in local elections .
The " velvet " in the title alludes to the chicken 's texture after it emerges from the pot .
While some poached chicken recipes can come out stringy and tough , this one is cooked in a liquid that 's barely simmering for 15 minutes .
After that things get interesting .
Instead of removing the chicken from the pot , it gets left in the liquid with the heat off for 45 minutes .
The result is perfectly cooked chicken that 's beautifully tender and aromatic thanks to a particularly flavorful cooking liquid .
The cooking liquid can do no wrong .
It 's made from soy sauce , ginger , scallion , clove , star anise , red chile , and Sichuan peppercorns , just to name a few of the ingredients .
It 's rich , aromatic , and lovingly seeps into every pore of the chicken over the course of its long bath .
But it 's also good enough for all kinds of other uses .
I tossed some cheap ramen in it for a side dish and used it to boil rice for lunch the next day .
Think of this as a relative of Hainanese Chicken Rice .
It 's a chicken dish that keeps on giving .
Are Jews Treated any Fair in Prison ?
Anti-Semitism inside Prisons
Anti-Semitism inside Prisons
Prison is not the best place for anyone !
It affects each person differently ; but always has an impact on a person 's life .
For Jews in prison , their reality comes in two - fold .
First , as a Jew , prison is a source of embarrassment for the whole community , a source of shunda .
Thus , Jews in prison are written off by their community and left alone to the prison system .
What 's worse , even their families get shunned in the community .
Second , an incarcerated Jew is a lonely person , mistreated within the prison walls by the legions of anti-Semites , and shunned by their people , such that they have nothing to go back to .
This article will take a keener look at the life of a Jew in prison , and the measures put in place to help them continue with their lives , during and after incarceration .
Jewish Experience inside Prison
Prison provides
Jews with unique challenges based on their skin color , stereotypes surrounding them , and a large group of people dedicated to hating and stigmatizing them .
This , in turn , creates some other problems , making it harder to identify Jews inside prisons .
To understand this , we must first understand how the American prison system works , to find out the unique position most Jews find themselves in .
It is important to note that prison beliefs still hold Jews to the ancient stereotypes of stingy and selfish people with control over the American culture and money , creating and sustaining the current global systems .
It is also worth noting that prison anti- Semitism is not mild and nuanced as you may find it in the public sphere .
Here , people will celebrate their hate , with bold swastikas and anti- Semitic words tattooed across their bodies .
They will beat and maim you for nothing other than being a Jew , which being a small population in prison , you can rarely do anything about it .
It is normal for most Jew prisoners to experience insults and other kinds of mistreatment for being Jews .
Jews and Prison Gangs - Prison System Set up
Most prison systems will impose a strict segregation rule to try to keep the piece .
This means that people from different races will rarely be allowed to mix .
According to Ms. Bach , the spokesperson for the California corrections department , ' inmates like to be housed with people familiar to them .
They want people from the same neighborhood , geographic area , and the same racial background . '
David Arenberg , an inmate , describes the level of segregation experienced inside prisons .
According to him , the prison hierarchy of supremacy starts from white supremacist groups such as the skinheads and the Aryan brotherhood , the blacks , American - born Mexicans , Mexican - born Mexicans , and the rest of the prison population .
According to David Arenberg , he was at the bottom of the totem pole in the prison system .
The irony of David Arenberg while in prison was related to his skin tone .
Since Jews look like white people , most prison systems that impose a segregation rule will place David together with white people in prison , the odd thing is that the white population of prisons is a majority of racist anti-Semites , mainly composed of skinheads and Arian brotherhood .
According to Arenberg , the way the segregation works is such that different groups may participate in group games , be in each other 's cell but not sit on each other 's beds , or share the TV .
Wait !
It gets worse !
When it came to food and cafeteria rules , different races cannot share a meal , eat at the same table , or touch each other 's food .
All these could lead to a severe beating or even death .
Being a Jew meant that Arenberg looked white , but was hated by a majority of the white population , making his daily life a risk .
He could not eat at the same time other white people ate ; neither could he be seen joining other races ’ tables or meals .
Luckily for Arenberg , he was a trained lawyer , and thanks to a successful piece of advice that helped out one of the members of the Arian brotherhood reduce a 21 - year jail stint to zero , he got to survive .
The advice he proposed helped him get a deal allowing him to survive among the white population , where he ate after they had left the table .
It also afforded him some protection as a Jew , as he could not get beat up , or worse , killed .
However , for most Jews , being locked up together with people who hate you , and glorify the regime that was out to exterminate your race is a traumatizing time .
Jews have been beaten to death and gone through harrowing experiences while in prison .
According to Stefan Leeb , an inmate of the California Department of Corrections , being segregated with skinheads and white supremacists was the riskiest thing that could happen to his life .
It was putting him together with people that hated him the most and would not flinch while taking his life .
He did not mind being housed with other races ; however , the segregation system left him stuck with the worst kind of people .
Jews Behind Bars - The Judaic Diet
Another problem Jews experience is the ability to practice their faith through a strict diet most Jews follow .
This is what is known as kosher food , and is a special diet practicing Jews adhere to and is associated with what the Torah describes as clean food fit for consumption .
The kosher diet is considered a special kind of diet in prison , which will see the prison administration rejecting it and prisoners faking religion to access it .
It may be understandable why prisons cannot provide kosher meals , due to the way it is prepared , and the fallout it may have with other inmates .
If statistics are anything to go by , food is one of the leading causes of prison strikes .
Although the free exercise of religion is a clause in the first amendment of the US constitution , most prison facilities still operate under their own rules , and they will not provide kosher meals for their Jew prison population .
There are , however , States with better treatment of its prison population .
New York is one such State , which has put some effort into accounting for its prison population 's religious freedoms .
As long as it does not pose a security threat , it is easier to acquire certain religious permissions than most states .
New York also offers kosher meals to its Jewish population ; however , this is done after an inmate passes a certain test , which shows they 're Jews .
However , individuals such as Friedman are helping add some information about Jews into the prison system , through the book , ' the handbook for religious beliefs and practices . '
The book outlines the needs of Jewish people when it comes to religion , as most of the time , the mistreatment of Jews comes from a lack of knowledge and understanding .
Religious Practices and Traditions
Apart from the religious diet involving Jews , another reason they experience a lot of discrimination is how they handle their religious practices .
For one , a Jew requires a couple of tools for their religious practice .
These include a teffilin , a cubic black leather box with a strap used by orthodox Jewish men to wear on their arms , and head for weekend morning prayer .
A siddur is a Jewish prayer book that comes with their entire liturgy .
A talit is a garment used as a symbol of faith for devotion to God .
A kippah is another thing Jews use , which they wear on their heads .
Prisons have been known even to restrict religious freedoms for Jews to wear their religious attires .
According to Neil Steinhorn , a member of the Jewish big brother and sister in Maryland , the problem is only getting worse .
Previously , it was easier to bring in religious tools of worship and even kosher food for special events such as Passover .
However , he is now required to request for clearance months in advance , and he is limited to catering for only one meal per ceremony annually .
As previously stated , New York is the only state that has made decent strides towards providing for Jewish religious practices .
Besides providing kosher meals , they also have religious leaders as part of their payroll , including a rabbi .
How to find Jewish Prisoner in the US - The Problem with Identifying Jews
Due to the way Jews get treated inside prisons , by the time a Jew is sent to prison , most of them prefer to change their names and miss - identify themselves to avoid any problems inside prison .
On the other hand , things like kosher foods have resulted in huge numbers of ' fake Jews ' identifying with the prison system specifically for kosher food benefits .
This means an inmate search may give you a non-Jew pretending to be a Jew , or a jaw pretending to be non-Jew .
Another reason why most Jews fail to identify with their religion is a shame they may feel for failing their religion and spirituality or the fact that they were not raised in the strict fellowship of the Judaic way .
This is why it is hard to get an accurate read of the exact number of incarcerated Jews in America .
There are approximately 4000 - 6000 Jews in prisons across America .
This is only a mere 0.25 % of the general prison population of America .
Being a minority population , you get to understand why their issues are trivialized .
To find out who are real Jews inside prisons , most facilities will use several sincerity checks , which include , as previously stated , a written test .
Other religions also try to convert Jews into their religion , and this seems like a decent offer owed to the lack of support most Jews experience while in prison .
The little support for Jews has overtime seen an emergence and increase in the number of volunteers dedicated to providing a religious environment for Jewish inmates .
The Aleph and Jewish Prisoner Service ( JPSI )
The number of organizations dedicated to assisting incarcerated Jews is only two in number , which provide support across the whole of the United States .
The organizations function through volunteers and funding from well - wishers and the B'nai Brith .
However , money is a problem , as no one is willing to invest in the religious or physical health of inmates .
These two organizations will provide anything related to Jewish spirituality for their members .
If allowed , they will bring worship tools , lead in prayer , provide advice , and provide kosher .
They will also teach the Judaic way to inmates not raised in their faith .
The Aleph currently has a couple of hundreds of volunteers , while the Jewish Prisoner Service International ( JPSI ) comes with around 700 volunteers .
These are the people that transverses across America and ensure they reach as many Jews as possible , providing for their religious ceremonies and where acceptable , some kosher dietary needs .
According to the chair of the JPSI , the government employs only around 250 Jewish workers out of the 5000 staff chaplains available for employment .
The rest of the required support comes from such organizations as Aleph to handle .
According to the Jewish religion , every inmate has the chance for redemption , or as they put it , Pidyon Shevuim .
This is the guiding principle for the JPSI , and the reason for volunteers to cater for incarcerated Jews .
Apart from catering to their spiritual needs , the JPSI and the Aleph is also a way for Jews to get help in re-entering society .
Being that inmates are shunned by their society and the problems they experience while inside prison , they need some help bouncing back and coping with society , not excited to see them .
Inmates will get $ 40 and some clothes on their back , while also getting help with their release plans .
As previously stated , family members also get a cold shoulder over individuals in the family getting incarcerated .
This means they also require some support .
The Aleph organization came through for these people through the F.E.E.L.S program , a family program that was started to assist with the inmates ' relative 's psychological and financial situations .
A Beacon of Hope
One odd thing about Jewish inmates is that most of them go to prison , not well versed in their Judaism .
Statistics show that most Jewish inmates were not brought up strictly within their faiths .
However , the experience most Jews get in prison rather than causing them to shun the Judaic religion does the opposite .
Most Jews come to love and embrace their religion , getting spiritually stronger in the face of suffering .
It is a sense of holding on to something that gives you hope as part of your heritage when everything is threatened .
During the dark days of Hitler , Jews still practiced their religion , albeit in secret , as it grounded them to their identity , providing hope and a source of strength .
Inside the prison walls , a Jew who was not conscious or aware of their heritage and identity gets to understand what it means to be a Jew , and experience the worldview of their people in the rawest form .
It has the effect of embracing their heritage and getting the need to understand themselves and religion better , to be able to master the courage and conviction of everyday life American prisons .
Through organizations like JPSI , these Jewish inmates get to be instructed in their Jewish religion .
They are provided with reading materials and information regarding themselves .
What happens is most Jewish people enter the prison system unsure of their identity and come out as stronger individuals , sure in their Judaic ways , and what it means to be a Jew .
Are There no Safe Spaces for Jew Inmates ?
With all the problems that Jews experience , you might wonder whether there is any safe space for Jew inmates .
As long as your prison stint is not as serious as murder , rape , and other kinds of violent crimes , and is less than ten years , you can choose to go to Otisville prison .
This is where most white - collar Jew criminals are incarcerated .
The place adheres to the Jewish religious traditions , and you will get to enjoy kosher meals and participate in all Jewish religious practices .
Expect to find some of the infamous people there , including Sheldon Silver , the previous speaker for the New York assembly , and Trump 's lawyer Michael Cohen .
Why Do People Choose to Volunteer ?
According to a rabbi David , Jewish inmates need to know their religion .
Most people in prison have a lot of time on their hands and a willingness to learn , a factor that motivates the rabbi .
Others have used the fact that judgment belongs to God , meaning they volunteer to teach as they would any other person .
Generally , most volunteers do so out of the need for more Jewish volunteers , and the need to support Jews in prison .
Crime is a bad thing ; however , punishment should befit the crime .
Since most Jews in prison are paying for their crimes , do n't they deserve the same chance at redemption as seen with other religious denominations in prison ?
A man 's body may be the State 's subject to control and punish ; however , the soul belongs to God , and only he can pass judgment on it !
The lack of permission for proper Jewish religious practices sends the message that even the criminal 's soul is condemned .
An unfair and repulsive notion !

Arizona lawmakers on Tuesday approved what foes and supporters agree is the toughest measure in the country against illegal immigrants , directing local police to determine whether people are in the country legally .
FOR THE RECORD :
Arizona immigration bill :
An article in Wednesday ’s Section A on legislation against illegal immigrants in Arizona reported that a federal court had found unconstitutional a New Hampshire law that said illegal immigrants were guilty of trespassing .
The ruling came from a state court .
Additionally , the article said Arizona ’s Republican primary was next month .
The primary is in August . —
The measure , long sought by opponents of illegal immigration , passed 35 to 21 in the state House of Representatives .
The state Senate passed a similar measure earlier this year , and Republican Gov. Jan Brewer is expected to sign the bill .
The bill ’s author , State Sen. Russell Pearce , said it simply “ takes the handcuffs off of law enforcement and lets them do their job . ”
But police were deeply divided on the matter , with police unions backing it but the state police chief ’s association opposing the bill , contending it could erode trust with immigrants who could be potential witnesses .
Immigrant rights groups were horrified , and contended that Arizona would be transformed into a police state .
“ It ’s beyond the pale , ” said Chris Newman , legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network .
“ It appears to mandate racial profiling . ”
The bill , known as SB 1070 , makes it a misdemeanor to lack proper immigration paperwork in Arizona .
It also requires police officers , if they form a “ reasonable suspicion ” that someone is an illegal immigrant , to determine the person ’s immigration status .
Currently , officers can inquire about someone ’s immigration status only if the person is a suspect in another crime .
The bill allows officers to avoid the immigration issue if it would be impractical or hinder another investigation .
Citizens can sue to compel police agencies to comply with the law , and no city or agency can formulate a policy directing its workers to ignore the law -- a provision that advocates say prevents so - called sanctuary orders that police not inquire about people ’s immigration status .
The bill cements the position of Arizona , whose border with Mexico is the most popular point of entry for illegal immigrants into this country , as the state most aggressively using its own laws to fight illegal immigration .
In 2006 the state passed a law that would dissolve companies with a pattern of hiring illegal immigrants .
Last year it made it a crime for a government worker to give improper benefits to an illegal immigrant .
Mark Krikorian at the Center for Immigration Studies , a Washington , D.C. , think tank that advocates tougher immigration enforcement , said the legislation was a logical extension of the state ’s previous enforcement efforts .
“ It makes sense that they would be the first to do it since they ’re ground zero for illegal immigration , ” he said .
Krikorian added that he doubted the law would be used much .
“ Obviously , their prosecutors are n’t going to go out and prosecute every illegal alien , ” he said .
“ It gives police and prosecutors another tool should they need it . ”
Opponents , however , raised the specter of officers untrained in immigration law being required to determine who is in the country legally .
They noted that though the bill says race cannot solely be used to form a suspicion about a person ’s legality , it implicitly allows it to be a factor .
“ A lot of U.S. citizens are going to be swept up in the application of this law for something as simple as having an accent and leaving their wallet at home , ” said Alessandra Soler Meetze , president of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona .
The ACLU and other groups have vowed to sue to block the bill from taking effect should Brewer sign it .
They note that a federal court struck down a New Hampshire law in 2005 that said illegal immigrants were trespassing , declaring that only the federal government has the authority to enforce immigration .
Another provision of the Arizona law , which makes day laborers illegal , violates the 1st Amendment , critics contend .
The issue of local enforcement of immigration laws has been especially heated in Arizona , where Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has taken an aggressive stance , conducting sweeps in immigrant - heavy neighborhoods to round up illegal immigrants .
His actions have drawn a civil rights investigation from the Department of Justice but strong praise from Arizonans .
Other agencies have argued against Arpaio ’s stance , saying that they need illegal immigrants to trust them enough to report crimes .
Brewer , a Republican , has not taken a public stance on the bill .
She replaced Janet Napolitano , a Democrat who became President Obama ’s Homeland Security chief last year .
Napolitano had vetoed similar bills in the past .
Brewer faces a primary challenge next month ; most observers expect her to sign the measure .
Some Republicans have privately complained about the bill , which Pearce has been pushing for several years , but were loath to vote against it in an election year .
The House was scheduled to approve it last week but the vote was delayed until Tuesday to give sponsors a chance to round up enough votes .
It picked up steam after the killing late last month of a rancher on the Arizona side of the Mexican border .
Footprints from the crime scene led back to Mexico .
In an impassioned debate Tuesday , both sides relied on legal and moral arguments .
“ Illegal immigration brings crime , kidnapping , drugs -- drains our government services , ” said Rep. John Kavanagh , a Republican .
“ Nobody can stand on the sidelines and not take part in this battle . ”
Democrats were just as passionate .
“ This bill , whether we intend it or not , terrorizes the people we profit from , ” said Rep. Tom Chabin .

Iron Man was an unexpected success in both popularity and in the Box Office and with the imminent release of Iron Man 2 anticipation is sky high for this superhero sequel .
Thanks to Sky Movies HD , I was able to see it at the gala screening at Vue Westfield in London .
Check out our entire coverage of it here .
Coming into seeing Iron Man 2
I was in buoyant mood and probably the most excited I ’ve been in seeing a film this year and who could blame me with the addition of Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko - Whiplash , the most exciting and well cast villain in recent memory , the genius that is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer and the first look at James Rhodes ‘ War Machine ’ , it has to be brilliant does n’t it ?
Iron Man 2 thankfully just about pulls it off , but only just .
It ’s a strangely paced film and suffers at times from incredibly long exposition and poorly contrived story lines that seem to be added to no doubt develop the Avengers storyline rather than the Iron Man 2 story that I wanted to see .
You ’ll see what I mean after about 4 - 5 scenes throughout littered with Shield / Avengers plot developments that all seemed horribly squeezed in to setup characters for a film that will happen in 2 - 3 years time .
However I ’m happy to say that the rest of Iron Man was a pretty damn good ride , spectacular in places with awesome action set pieces and in general a whole lot of fun but not without some worryingly boring , pointless and highly confusing moments .
Without giving away too many spoilers from the film , the story is of Tony Stark ’s fight against
The US governments attempt to obtain the suit for themselves for the military , Justin Hammer ’s company developing their own suits to rival Iron Man , Ivan Vanko ’s revenge mission on Stark as he claims his father was the one who designed the Arc Reactor Technology and that Tony ’s father Howard Stark stole it from him which is all bundled together with the plot of Tony ’s Arc reactor which is keeping him alive is also poisoning him and he needs to find a solution , which comes in the most ridiculous and confusing way possible .
Needless to say there is a lot going on in its two hour running time with little weight given to each storyline which does hurt the movie but when the film focuses on Ivan Vanko and Tony Stark , Iron Man 2 presses all the right buttons .
Mickey Rourke is truly outstanding as the villain and is the perfect foil to Stark ’s egotistical superhero and their scenes together are the best of the film , particularly their first meeting on the race track where Tony Stark grabs the suitcase that turns into his modified portable Iron Man suit which is just awesome and leads into one of the best scenes of the film that satisfies completely .
It ’s a shame Terrence Howard did n’t make it to the sequel as Don Cheadle had to make the character of James Rhodes his own which is difficult when every other character is set into there original roles but Cheadle does pretty well and when he takes the Iron Man War Machine suit for himself we witness a superb battle between a drunken Stark and Rhodes that helps you get over the actor change pretty quickly and when they team up again for a pretty anti-climatic battle against Whiplash the two have some pretty decent banter gong on .
Sam Rockwell puts in a great subtle comedic turn as Justin Hammer and definitely has a part to play in the planned third film , Scarlett Johansson was pretty average and forgettable in her role of Black Widow , again used to beef up the Avengers movie and Gwyneth Paltrow plays her part nicely as she did in the first movie which is nothing special but this is clearly Rourke and Downey Jr ’s film and together they do make Iron Man 2 worth a watch .
Overall , I do n’t think Iron Man 2 is anywhere near as good as the first film ,
It ’s let down by the amount it ’s trying to squeeze in to the movie with the Avengers story and all the new additional characters but overall it ’s certainly going to please some but will equally bemuse others .
Iron Man 2 is released April 30th in the UK and 7th May in the US .

A major Newsweek hit piece against the Tea Party movement and Alex Jones claims that the move towards a global government and the fact that governments commit acts of false flag terrorism is all an invention of “ conspiracist kooks ” who wear “ tin foil hats ” .
Like we ’ve never heard that one before .
Self - described “ conservative ” Jonathan Kay invokes Obama regulation czar Cass Sunstein in railing against ideas he describes as “ dangerously detached from reality ” by labeling vehemently proven facts as “ conspiracy theories ” and thereby exposing himself as the only person dangerously detached from reality in his article , Black Helicopters Over Nashville .
In the hit piece , Kay smears Alex Jones as a “ modern day prophet ” of the Tea Party movement that he goes on to relentlessly attack as progenitors of “ toxic fantasies ” .
Kay contacted Alex Jones ’ office nearly a year ago seeking an interview about 9/11 truth .
Of course , he spewed the usual baloney about “ wanting to understand our perspective ” while all along preparing to unleash a vitriolic hit piece without one iota of the “ balance ” establishment journalists always claim that they adhere to .
When we explained to him that in order to understand the 9/11 attacks in context , a brief exploration of the documented and manifestly provable examples in history where western governments have staged attacks in order to advance their agenda was necessary , Kay was n’t interested .
We ’re talking about events such as Operation Northwoods , a plan signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon to to “ kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in U.S. cities to create public support for a war ” .
We ’re talking about Operation Ajax , where the CIA instituted a program of false flag terror to crush Iran ’s first democratic government in the 1950 ’s , killing around 300 people .
Far from being a “ conspiracy theory , ” the CIA admits to the program on their own website .
We ’re talking about Operation Gladio , a “ decades - long covert campaign of terrorism and deceit directed by the intelligence services of the West — against their own populations ” run by NATO in collusion with the CIA , a campaign which included the 1980 bombing of the Bologna train station which killed 85 people .
[ efoods ]
Kay was n’t having any of it , he merely wanted to hang around Alex Jones for days on end and try and catch him out by seizing upon ambiguous one - liners that could be spun out of context to make us look like mentally unstable extremists , which is precisely the tactic he uses against several other people in his Newsweek article .
According to Kay , a one world government run by the United Nations that will implement greenhouse gas taxes is another “ toxic fantasy ” of those crazy Tea Party lunatics .
In that case , I guess we must have all just imagined UN Secretary general Ban Ki-moon ’s December 16 2009 Los Angeles Times interview during the Copenhagen summit in which he stated , “ We will establish a global governance structure to monitor and manage the implementation of this . ”
Ban Ki-moon ’s October 2009 New York
Times editorial in which he wrote that efforts to impose restrictions on CO2 emissions “ Must include an equitable global governance structure ” is also a figment of the imagination if you subscribe to Kay ’s world view .
Yes – shocking as it is – top globalists like Herman Van Rompuy , Gordon Brown , Al Gore and others have all publicly and repeatedly called for a new world order and a global government .
This is why even Bloomberg writers like David Reilly and former Democratic advisors like Dick Morris are finally admitting that those tin foil hat wearing kooks
Kay derides in his article were right after all – a secret cabal of bankers and industrialists really does run the world .
Of course , if you still believe Kay ’s fairytale make - believe world in which there is no “ new world order ” and no march towards a “ global government ” which would include a “ global currency , ” then the following You Tube compilation of top power brokers saying those very things since the 1950 ’s does n’t exist either .
Of course , Kay ’s dismissive scorn for so - called conspiracy theorists has n’t stopped him from leeching off their increasing prominence by authoring a book about them to be published by HarperCollins .
We ’ve witnessed a noticeable drop in the amount of hit pieces against us over the last 12 months as everything we said about the global government takeover and the financial meltdown comes to pass and our credibility soars while that of the mainstream plummets yet further .
However , there are still establishment lackeys precariously perched on their peanut gallery howling the same tired old clichés about “ kooks ” wearing “ tin foil hats ” seeing “ black helicopters , ” completely oblivious to the fact that the rest of the world has come to accept the fact that yes – shocking as it is – powerful men do actually get together and conspire about how to increase their power over humanity .
Our message to Kay and his ilk is a simple one – dudes , it ’s over for you !
The mainstream media has lost all credibility .
Acting as apologists and liars for decades in service of the military - industrial complex that has you bought and paid for comes at a cost .
You no longer dictate to the rest of us what construes reality when every single indicator screams from every single direction that you are wrong .
2 plus 2 will never equal 5 , no matter how many times you insist that people who say it equals 4 are “ dangerously detached from reality ” .
The manifestly provable and universally acknowledged fact that the invasion of Iraq came as a result of a conspiracy to manufacture a phony pretext for war remains a fact no matter how many times people like Tony Blair claim it is nothing more than a conspiracy theory .
Governments do commit acts of terror to further their political agendas , and globalists have openly stated that they are centralizing power in order to create a system of global governance .
By continuing to deny and label those who talk about such brazenly obvious facts as conspiracy kooks only makes you look ridiculous , Mr. Kay .
Claiming that the idea of a global government run by the UN which controls greenhouse gas taxes is a creation of “ militant oddballs ” while the United Nations ’ own Secretary General writes editorials and gives interviews saying those very things only confirms that the distance from which you are detached from reality renders your inane hackery completely irrelevant .

Mr. Asbell , a Republican , endorsed Mr. Florio , a Democrat , in the race for governor last year .
Today law - enforcement officials and politicians here questioned how Mr. Asbell could have imagined that his tale of a wild chase and shoot - out through Camden would stand up to the scrutiny of investigators , much less persuade the Governor - elect to reappoint him to a second five - year term .
At his news conference on Tuesday , Mr. Asbell said he had left his office at 5 P.M. on New Year 's Day after spending his first day back from vacation checking his mail .
Almost immediately , he said , two black men in a green Toyota station wagon starting following him and firing shots from a MAC - 10 , a fully automatic . 45 - caliber pistol .
'' My back window blew into the back of my head , '' Mr. Asbell said .
The two cars careered through the streets of Camden until they reached a desolate warehouse section near the waterfront , where , Mr. Asbell said , he stopped his Lincoln Town Car and fired back with a .38 - caliber pistol that he regularly carries and with a sawed - off shotgun he said he kept under his front seat .
Although Mr. Asbell said he could not describe his assailants or recall the car 's license plate number , he was certain he had hit one of the men in the head with a shotgun blast .
' ' I saw his head explode , '' Mr. Asbell said .
'' To me there is nothing better than a sawed - off shotgun .
It 's a crowd pleaser . ''
Curiously , No Witnesses
In explaining the attack , Mr. Asbell compared himself to judges in Colombia who had been assassinated by drug organizations .
He said drug prosecutions had quadrupled in Camden County under his tenure .
But law - enforcement officials were immediately troubled by inconsistencies in the story and grew more suspicious when they were unable to find witnesses to the chase .
They also found no evidence to confirm that anyone had been wounded at the scene , and there were no reports of such a person at local hospitals .
By now , most Thrashers fans have seen both the comments made by Vyacheslav Kozlov about Coach John Anderson and Anderson 's response .
Nearly everybody has made up their mind one way or another , so it almost seems unnecessary to discuss the situation any further .
It is what it is .
However , it is also the off - season for the Thrashers , so there 's not a whole lot of game news ( nor player movement ) to report .
That means we have some time to discuss the Kozlov situation .
Here at Bird Watchers Anonymous , we try to bring a good mix of news , commentary , analysis , and opinion .
This post will be no different : I 'll do my best to present what Kozlov said , how Anderson responded , and offer a bit of fact - checking and opinion to the mix .
We 'll do that after the jump .
On Missing the Playoffs
Kozlov : " To me , this was the best team in 11 years of the organization .
This franchise had the best players .
Right now , they can not blame [ Ilya ] Kovalchuk or [ Slava ] Kozlov .
They have to take responsibility , because I think ownership did everything right , signed good players , they have a good goalie , good defense — but something is missing .
I think we are missing from the coaching staff . "
Anderson : " One thing I understand about professional sports , is that ultimately if the team does n’t do well the coach accepts all the responsibility .
And I do rightfully so , no problem .
When the team wins , the coach gives the players [ the credit ] .
That ’s how it is . … I understand the reality of it .
We did n’t make the playoffs .
I accept responsibility for that .
Whatever happens , happens . "
I 'm not sure that Kozlov is 100 % correct in saying that this team is the best we 've had .
The team that made the playoffs was , on paper and on the ice , a better team .
Not all that much better , but they'd have won a Series of Seven .
Still , we all have to believe that this team did not live up to our expectations .
Is that the fault of the coach or the players ?
Both sides will have to share some responsibility .
Kozlov played in 55 games this season averaging over 15 minutes per game yet had only 8 goals , 3 on the power play .
He 's always been a streaky player , but this season was terrible : his first goal came in Game 17 , and the other seven came in a stretch of 18 games which included a 5 - game drought .
After the 8th goal , he did n't score for 16 games again and was scratched .
In the 5 games through the remainder of the season , he did not score .
" But Tim ! , " you say , " Nik Antropov did n't score any goals for around the same length to begin the season and you wrote a post about how he's the best Thrashers ' forward ! "
Sure .
But Nik was picking up an assist pretty much every game .
Slava had assists in just 5 of the first 16 goalless games and 7 of the back 21 .
That 's nothing to write home about for a guy getting 2nd line minutes .
Still , Coach is right : the fault ends up on his shoulders .
Slava Kozlov is just one player on a team , and it's the performance of the team that matters .
On Preparing For Games and Work Ethic
Kozlov : " Looks like they have fun , but unfortunately in the NHL you have to work .
You have to prepare for every game .
There are lots of good teams in the NHL and you think if you are a good team if you see the roster .
That does n’t work in this league .
You have to do homework and work hard .
I think I can put a big question mark that they were n’t preparing . "
Kozlov : " This system , for two years they tell us it ’s going to work but unfortunately everybody knows what we are going to do .
Our breakouts , we make two , three passes in our zone and we do n’t beat anybody .
I saw that in the New Jersey game .
New Jersey just waited in the neutral zone and we make two or three passes and make one mistake in neutral zone and boom , they counter attack us . "
Anderson : " He talked about what works in the minors .
Well , guess who I coached against ?
[ Mike ] Babcock .
[ Dave ] Tippett . [ Randy ] Carlyle . [ Bruce ] Bodreau .
I can go down the list because where do you think we all start from ?
The minors .
They all said that ’s where we came from .
You are dealing with a different animal up here and that ’s a learning curve that I do have to go through . "
Anderson : " If you know Kozzy , he is very straight laced , very rigid .
I was brought in to try and change the culture here .
I believe you are allowed to smile at practice and you are allowed to have fun .
I want to be a workplace where you say ‘ Man , I ’m glad I ’m here . ’
That ’s what I tried to convey .
If he portrayed that I do n’t work hard , then I think he ’s wrong because we have film [ work ] every day , every power play even .
We are prepared . "
Kozlov 's comments certainly strike a chord , especially when he talks about the problems we 've had against New Jersey [ or substitute another team playing the neutral - zone trap . ]
The Falconer has written about our difficulties against the trap , so it 's not exactly a big secret .
What is more concerning are Kozlov 's comments about the coaching staff having fun but not working .
It 's a pretty hefty charge to say that the coaching staff is not preparing for games .
John Anderson counters that he " was brought in to try and change the culture here . "
This , to me , is the most instructive comment of all .
You may remember talk of " crusty old veterans " last year , and it sounds like it 's not much different this year .
I 've noticed during the few times that I 've been able to attend Thrashers practices that the guys usually look like they are having a great time .
There 's video evidence of this as well : go back and watch the video of Johan Hedberg mic'ed up .
Or this one which has a few of the guys :
;
The guys are having a good time .
Let 's face it : Atlanta is not going to be a place for guys who want to win a Stanley Cup , at least not yet .
It could be a place for guys who love to play hockey , though .
A lighter attitude , the nice weather , and the team made up of good " locker room guys " could bring in players who have struggled elsewhere .
The biggest example I can give is Maxim Afinogenov , a guy we had written off a few months ago as being on the way out .
During a practice at Philips , Falconer and I were struck by how much fun Max was having on the ice .
It was encouraging to see him smiling while flying all over the ice with the puck .
If you read Max 's comments about why he 's staying , you can perhaps see some of the Anderson - effect on him .
( And the contrast between Anderson and Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff is quite apparent . )
I really like it here .
The whole organization was very good to me .
I feel comfortable .
I feel like it ’s home .
I really enjoyed this year here .
One of the biggest challenges Atlanta 's faced is the departure of free agents .
If Anderson succeeds in changing the culture in Atlanta , that 'd be a major first step toward keeping these guys .
Now , not everybody is going to buy into this , and Slava Kozlov does strike me as a guy who would have some issues with all the light - heartedness .
On Ice Time and Playing Four Lines
Kozlov : " We lost lots of games by one goal and I feel when it ’s a tight game , like one - goal or tie game , you have to start playing two or three lines .
Nothing against players like [ Chris Thorburn ] , [ Eric Boulton ] or [ Marty Reasoner ] , but to get the feel of the game you have to use your key players more .
When it ’s 5 - 1 , you can play everybody but when it ’s a tie game you can judge a good coach from the great coach .
The great coach sees how the team is playing , who has to play right now , what do you need to change right now .
Not after the game or before .
I think we missed that part . "
Anderson : " He talked about the minutes played of our third and fourth line .
He averaged 15 and a half minutes a game .
Eric Boulton averaged six .
For him to say I ’m just turning lines over , that ’s not true .
If we needed a goal our top lines played .
Absolutely they played .
If the other team needed to be shut down , our checking lines played .
To say I ’m playing our fourth line too much or too little does n’t make sense . "
Anderson : " He said in Detroit he had great coaches .
They played four lines in Detroit .
That ’s how they won the Stanley Cup .
Maybe Washington will win [ this year ] because they have four good lines and they play them all .
When we needed a goal , he was out there . "
Here 's another case where both guys have very valid points .
Obviously , as Kozlov said , you want your scoring lines on the ice when your team is down , and John Anderson did play the fourth line late in close games .
However , Slava gives the impression that the fourth line was getting equal - or near - equal time as the top line , and that 's simply not true .
Let 's try a relatively simple calculation : I 'm going to take the average even - strength ice time for the top three forwards and average it .
We 'll compare that to the average for the bottom three forwards as a ratio : top/ bottom .
And then let 's compare that to some of the best teams in the NHL this season .
( These numbers are a little rough , as it's not always easy to determine who constitutes the " bottom three " as that changes , especially due to injuries . )
Atlanta : 1.92 ( 15:00 top , 7:50 bottom )
Washington : 1.69 ( 15:45 top , roughly 9:20 bottom )
Chicago : 1.88 ( 15:30 top , 8:15 bottom )
Detroit : 1.43 ( 15:45 top , 11:00 bottom )
Slava may not like it , but as it would turn out , Atlanta 's right in line with ice time distribution with the some of the best in the league .
If anything , Atlanta plays their bottom line less than other teams .
I 've got to give the nod to Anderson on this point .
Of course , that 's just my opinion .
Voice yours by voting in the poll and chiming in with a comment .
Amsterdam police are investigating the disappearance of millions of euros from charty group ChildRight , which works to prevent the exploitation of children , the Telegraaf reports on Tuesday .
The paper says it has evidence that most of the money raised by the charity and its volunteers did not end up helping children in third world countries .
For example , a project to build 10 schools in Sri Lanka following the tsunami resulted in just three sheds being erected .
Now sources have told the paper police suspect much of the missing money was used by former director Raymond C to fund his gambling addiction .
Police have confirmed an investigation is under way .
Robert De Niro to play Vince Lombardi in movie
Legendary coach Vince Lombardi will be portrayed by Robert De Niro .
Academy Award - winning actor Robert De Niro is attached to play legendary coach Vince Lombardi in the theatrical motion picture " Lombardi " being developed by ESPN Films , Andell Entertainment and the NFL .
Additionally , Academy Award - winning screenwriter Eric Roth ( Forrest Gump , The Good Shepherd ) has come on board the project , which will chronicle Lombardi during the years he transformed the Green Bay Packers from the worst team in the National Football League into five - time NFL champions .
" Having an icon portray an icon on film is amazing , " said Ron Semiao , senior vice president of ESPN Films , " and with a writer as talented as Eric working on the script , the results could be magical for NFL fans . "
Current plans call for the film 's release on the weekend between the AFC and NFC Conference Championships and the Super Bowl in 2012 .
" There are few actors who could accurately portray the fire , passion and grit of Lombardi , " said Charles Coplin , NFL 's vice president of programming , " and we 're thrilled to have Robert De Niro on our team . "
The story 's narrative arc spans from 1959 when Lombardi was given his first opportunity to be an NFL head coach , taking over the small - town Packers , then the worst team in the NFL , and runs through his transformation of a group of young , talented but undisciplined losers into five - time NFL champions .
Also , the story highlights the long - standing rivalry that existed between Lombardi and legendary Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry , both of whom were assistants on the New York Giants team that lost the 1958 NFL Championship game .

( CNN ) --
On most mornings , my better half wakes up around 5:30 , throws on some sweats and heads to the gym before work .
About a half hour later , I wake up my 13 - year - old son , go downstairs to the kitchen to make his breakfast and pack his lunch .
Once he's out the door , I brew some coffee and get to work .
Ladies and gentlemen , may I present to you the " gay lifestyle " -- run for your heterosexual lives .
I understand opponents of gay rights must highlight differences in order to maintain the " us against them " tension that 's paramount to their arguments .
But this notion that sexual orientation comes with a different and pre-ordained way of life -- as if we 're all ordering the No. 3 at a drive thru -- only highlights how irrational groups such as Focus on the Family , the Family Research Council , the American Family Association and others like them are in this whole debate .
Pro-marriage organizations try to stop two consenting adults from marrying .
Pro-family groups try to stop stable couples wanting children from adopting unloved orphans .
And somehow , me doing something like going to the grocery store threatens the very fabric of society , as Oklahoma State Rep. Sally Kern spewed .
She says " the homosexual agenda is destroying this nation " and " homosexuality is more of a threat than terrorism . "
I 'm not sure what her idea of a gay lifestyle might be , but with a growing teenager , buying and cooking food dominates my day - to - day .
I do n't worship Barbra Streisand , I do n't watch any TV show with the word " Housewives " in its title and I love fishing , beer and Madonna .
But more important , I 'm just a father trying to keep my son away from drugs , get him into college and have a little money left over for retirement .
I 'm no sociologist but I 'm pretty sure those concerns are not exclusive to gay people .
In one of the most pivotal scenes in the biopic " Milk , " Harvey Milk , played by Sean Penn , gathers a group of community organizers and activists to come up with strategies to combat a 1978 ballot initiative that sought to ban LGBT ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) teachers and their supporters from working in public schools in California .
As the small crowd settles down , Milk quickly glances around the room and says ..
" If we 're going to convince the 90 percent to give a ---- about us 10 percent , we have to let them know who we are ... "
" What " we are -- be it gay , straight , black , white -- is simply window dressing .
" Who " we are is where the substance is , where the person is , where our humanity is .
Too often , discussions about gay people and gay rights focus on sex , as if a person 's entire being is defined by his or her Hollywood crush .
This fixation has been the crux behind attempts to link gay men to pedophilia -- from John Briggs , a state legislator from Orange County who introduced the proposed ban on gay teachers in California , to the Catholic League 's Bill Donohue , whose recent attempts to excuse the church for its global scandal coverup by seemingly blaming homosexuality -- and it's a tactic that is evil incarnate .
" The vast majority of the victims are post - pubescent , " Donohue recently said on " Larry King Live . "
" That 's not pedophilia , buddy .
That 's homosexuality . "
Actually , Bill , sexual predators whose victims are 13 - to 17 - years - old are called hebephiles -- a la Joey Buttafuoco , Madeleine Martin and Heather Kennedy -- not homosexuals .
And that still does n't explain why the church opted to save face as opposed to , in the words of the infamous anti-gay figurehead Anita Bryant , " Save our children . "
Being gay does n't dictate how people live their lives any more than being straight does .
There are gay people who go to church every Sunday and straight people who do not believe in God .
There are single gay men who believe in the sanctity of marriage and married straight men who apparently do not -- such as Gov. Mark Sanford , ex- Sen. John Edwards and Sen. John Ensign , to name a few .
The truth is the only thing all gay people have in common -- you know , besides being gay -- is that we face continuous rhetorical , social and legal attacks for simply existing , thus potentially making something as mundane as bringing a date to a work function a fight - or - flee situation .
And yet , even in the face of that discrimination , LGBT people all handle it differently .
Some of us live in the closet , some of us do drag every Wednesday night , some of us are Republicans hoping to be change agents within a conservative sect and some of us are apathetic Democrats too dumb to carry on a conversation about anything other than Lady Gaga .
In other words , we 're just as diverse , intolerant , upstanding and tragic as our straight counterparts and unless there is an annual meeting I do n't know about , the only item on the much talked - about gay agenda is an abbreviated passage from the Declaration of Independence -- " We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal . "
In 29 states , people can be fired simply for being gay regardless of their education , experience or job performance ; servicemen and women can be dismissed from the military regardless of their qualifications , dedication and courage ; and partners are unable to see their better halves in the hospital regardless of the love , commitment and life they share .
Wanting to be judged by the content of one 's character is n't a special right , it 's a constitutional one guaranteed by the 14th and 15th amendments .
And yet , 145 years since the abolition of slavery , 90 years since women were allowed to vote and 20 years since the Americans with Disabilities Act , we 're still involved in McCarthy - like investigations , holding Briggs - like elections and taking opinion polls based solely upon " what " someone is as opposed to " who " they are .
It 's sad .
We 're such a great nation , still full of great hope and promise and yet we keep being tripped up by ignorance , which leads to fear and then eventually hate .
Being gay is n't a choice , but being a bigot certainly is .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson .
Karen Gillan ’s life is taking some getting used to .
The new Doctor
Who girl has gone from anonymity to infamy overnight , with everyone and his wife dissecting the length of her skirts like they were as important as , you know , the General Election and world peace and stuff .
‘ People kept saying it was going to happen .
But how can you prepare for being famous ?
Other than be aware it ’s going to happen , ’ she says .
The 22 - year - old from Inverness has even experienced her first ‘ papping ’ – while she and boyfriend Patrick Green , a 24 - year - old photographer , were at the garden centre buying bonsai trees , of all things .
‘ That was very strange .
We just looked like the most boring couple in the entire world , ’ she laughs .
‘ Not rock and roll at all . ’
The actress ’s turn as new assistant Amy Pond is going down a storm with viewers , lots of whom are Slightly Fanatical about the cult show .
They ’re also not backwards in coming forwards when it comes to criticising anything they do n’t like , so Karen was ‘ a bit scared ’ about their reaction to her .
Thankfully , fan mail from the Whovian hardcore is flooding in .
‘ I ’ve had loads of stuff , but nothing crazy yet .
Maybe it ’ll happen , but the oddest thing so far is people sending me pictures of myself .
Opening up an envelope and it ’s yourself , it ’s like , “ Thanks for that ” . ’
There ’s been much raving about the on - screen chemistry between Karen and new Doctor Matt Smith – who looks like usurping David Tennant as the most popular Timelord ever .
‘ We worked well together from the start .
We ’ve got on - screen chemistry – we hope – and we ’re working on it every day , trying to make it better . ’
Karen loves playing Amy , who she reckons is a tad strange .
‘ I think she ’s a little bit weird , and I hate to say it , but maybe I fit in to that as well .
Matt called me mad as a box of cats .
There is no evidence to support that whatsoever , ’ she laughs .
In fact , Karen claims Matt is the mad one .
‘ It ’s funny he says that about me when actually he is the mad one .
But he does n’t really know it .
Are you mad if you know ?
You certainly know when he comes in to a room …
Matt is very eccentric and has a lot of energy about him . ’
Karen says she wants to stick around as part of one of British telly ’s biggest institutions for as long as possible .
And who knows where it could lead .
‘ I do n’t know .
Perhaps theatre , that ’s what I ’d quite like to do .
I ’m not sure about Hollywood , ’ she says .
‘ But it ’s too weird to think anywhere beyond this very moment . ’
GETTING AMY POND'S LOOK JUST RIGHT
There ’s been a hoo - ha over the sauciness of some of Karen ’s costumes .
And the actress , who has also done catwalk modelling during dry spells in her acting , was fully involved in creating her character ’s wardrobe .
‘ It was quite a long process .
She ’s quite an outcast and I wanted a vintage -y feel , because I thought it ’d be nice to have something individual that does n’t conform to what girls usually wear at that age , ’ says Karen .
‘ But I think it works going down a slightly more ordinary route as well because she is just an ordinary girl .
So she wears high street clothes mixed with one - off vintage pieces . ’

SEC porn scandal results in zero firings , agency says
By Ed O'Keefe
None of the Securities and Exchange Commission employees caught using government computers to view pornographic images has been fired , according to the agency .
The SEC inspector general investigated 28 employees and five contractors for accessing inappropriate images and Web sites , according to a report released late last week .
Of the employees , eight resigned and six were suspended for periods lasting one to 14 days , the inspector general , H. David Kotz , said in an letter Tuesday to Sen. Charles E. Grassley ( R - Iowa ) .
Five were issued formal reprimands , six were issued informal counseling or warning letters , and three are currently facing disciplinary action .
All five contractors caught were removed from their contracts , Kotz added .
The SEC comes up with different numbers , but they also add up to no firings .
The staffers accessed pornographic Web sites and images by using Google and Yahoo search engines and by successfully disabling Internet filters on their computers , Kotz said .
Grassley on Tuesday asked SEC Chairman Mary L. Schapiro to clarify why the workers faced different levels of discipline .
Schapiro sent a memo Friday stating that any employee who violates the agency 's computer usage rules will be fired .
The Iowa Republican also asked Schapiro for specific salary and disciplinary information for the 33 workers and contractors .
" We look forward to responding to Senator Grassley in detail , " SEC spokesman John Nester said in an e-mail .
Grassley 's office also distributed a whistleblower complaint sent to his office regarding an assistant regional director at SEC's Los Angeles office who made 1,800 attempts to access pornographic Web sites from his agency computer .
The letter , purportedly from an SEC employee in the agency 's Los Angeles regional office , described poor morale and high turnover partly due to the official getting " a free pass " from agency management for his inappropriate computer use .

Iran is helping train Taliban fighters within its borders , according to U.S. military and intelligence officials .
The United States has already said that the Taliban may be receiving limited training from the Iranians in Afghanistan , but the officials told CNN that training in the use of small arms was occurring within Iran .
" We 've known for some time that Iran has been a source for both materiel and trained fighters for Taliban elements in Afghanistan , " Army Lt. Col.
Edward Sholtis said Monday .
But , he said , it is unknown whether that training is occurring with the support of Tehran , or it is " simply something that is happening beyond the government 's control . "
" For some years , Iran has supplied arms and munitions to the Afghan Taliban , " said a U.S. intelligence official .
" It has also helped conduct at least small - scale weapons training for the Taliban .
There 's reason to believe that some of this training has occurred in Iran . "
The officials who spoke with CNN did not say how many Taliban fighters have been trained in Iran , or whether the training was sanctioned at the highest levels of the Iranian government .
Iran , which has always denied supporting the Taliban , said the training allegations were false .
An Iranian official at the United Nations said these are " ... absolutely baseless and wrong allegations , and strongly rejected by the Islamic Republic of Iran . "
Related : Afghan - Iranian mountain trails reveal hidden weapons smuggling route
Gen . David Petraeus , the top U.S. military commander in the region , has said Iran was aiding the Taliban within Afghanistan but that its role was limited in scope .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who visited Afghanistan recently , agreed with Petraeus .
" There is some [ training ] , but it , to this point , I think , has been considered to be pretty low - level , " he said .
A former CIA officer who did a strategic review of Afghanistan for the Obama administration last year said the Iranians have mastered improvised explosive devices - makeshift bombs hidden along roads and in ditches .
" They 've been doing this in Lebanon , Iraq , and other places for decades , " said Bruce Reidel , now a senior fellow at the Saban Institute for Middle East Policy .
" They 're among the best in the world in this kind of knowledge .
And they 're trying to transmit some of that knowledge over to the Afghan Taliban . "
The Sunday Times newspaper in London quoted two unidentified Taliban commanders as saying they had attended three - month courses in Iran .
CNN could not confirm those details .
Predominantly Shiite Iran has been a longtime enemy of the Taliban , which is made up primarily of Sunni Muslims .
But Reidel said that Iran views the Taliban as a way to counter U.S. pressure on Tehran .
" As the U.S. squeezes Iran , Iran is looking for places to squeeze America back , " he said .
" And where better than Obama 's war next door in Afghanistan ? "
Despite the lack of love for Iran 's ayatollahs , the Taliban , said Reidel , are seeking help wherever they can get it , especially with Pakistan 's recent arrests of top Taliban militants and U.S. drone attacks on Taliban havens .
But Iranian assistance to the Taliban has the potential to provoke military confrontation , Reidel said .
If Iran starts supplying sophisticated surface - to - air missiles to the Taliban , then U.S. and NATO command of Afghan airspace could change just as the balance changed when the United States provided Mujahedeen fighters with Stingers in their fight against the Soviets in the late 1980s .
Late last Friday , Rocks
Off learned that
Gumby
and
Davey and Goliath
creator Art Clokey had passed away in his sleep at age 88 .
The pioneering stop- motion animator and his clay work were fixtures in children 's television from 1957 on .
All of Clokey 's characters were moral , fun-loving and devoid of the commercialism that we see in today 's kids programming .
Gumby and Pokey never tried to sell you anything , while Davey and his trusted canine Goliath just wanted you to live your life right .
Clokey 's touch can be felt on modern day stop- motion works like the
Wallace & Gromit
film series , Tim Burton's
Corpse Bride
and
The Nightmare Before Christmas
, Wes Anderson's
The Fantastic Mr. Fox
, and even nightly on Adult Swim's
Robot Chicken
and the
Davey
- biting
Moral Orel
.
Any child of the ' 80s can probably dig up a California Raisins doll at their parent 's house given the chance .
A documentary on the life of Clokey is still making the repertory rounds .
Gumby Dharma
traces Clokey 's evolution from his time as a deserted child in the Depression all the way up to the present day .
He was very much devoted to the simplicity and wonder of childhood , but did partake in the party scene of the '60s ,
.
Davey and Goliath
was in part funded by the Lutheran Church in the early ' 60s , yet did n't ram any sort of religious doctrine down anyone 's throats .
It also depicted racial unity during the civil rights movement , a time when the country was a smoldering haystack of racial aggression .
It 's still an endearing show to gander at on a hung over Saturday afternoon , and you always walk away with a lesson or moral .
Rocks
Off gathered some of the best stop- motion music videos made through the history of the genre to honor Clokey 's groundbreaking work .
Mind you most of these sequences probably took months to create , making stop- motion animation very much a devoted undertaking for the artists at hand .
If Hollywood is n’t afraid of Josh Bernhard and Bracey Smith , they may soon be .
They are the first film / television - makers I ’ve heard of to crowdsource the funding for their latest project , Pioneer One — not just a TV pilot but an entire series , and not to get the attention of a traditional big media distributor but to bypass big media entirely .
And they need your help .
As you can imagine , $ 6,000 USD is peanuts for a 45 minute pilot and a planned story arc set to last 28 episodes or more .
But as of today they ’re only a third of the way there .
Josh and Bracey were previously featured on these pages for their feature film The Lionshare , a drama linking characters together through a ficticious file sharing network , and shrewdly distributed through BitTorrent .
So clearly they ’ve got the talent and the marketing savvy to make this happen .
The series would be distributed via streaming and downloads by VODO.net , where I first saw the inspiring social media documentary Us Now .
And funding for the series is being administered by a service called Kickstarter , which I had n’t heard of before but seems legit .
What about the series itself ?
Pioneer
One is being pitched as “ part political drama , part procedural drama , with a tinge of sci - fi ” .
You can the read the synopsis of the pilot on the project ’s Kickstarter page — here ’s how it ’s all going to play out :
The pilot is a proof - of - concept for a full first season to be distributed as VODO ’s first ‘ Original Series ’ .
From there , we have an on - going arc with at least four more seasons ’ worth of story to be told .
But it all begins with the pilot episode .
We need to show potential backers for the series what we can do and what we have in mind .
Here ’s where you come in :
If everyone who came ’ round Monday to read my iPad post kicked in a mere five bucks , Josh and Bracey would have the pilot covered and would be well on their way to funding the next episode .
To get you all started , I ’ve stepped up to the plate with a $ 5 donation of my own .
If you ’re still on the fence you can track the progress of Pioneer One on its very own Facebook Fan Page , on Twitter or at PioneerOne.tv
But redirecting the cost of your typical coffee - flavoured dairy drink for just one day can give you the power of a big Hollywood mogul — more in fact , if you consider that projects like this could eventually put said moguls out of business .
Sounds like a bargain to me …
Kernel Log : Ceph file system in 2.6.34 , kernel and KVM presentations at the CLT2010
Linus Torvalds has integrated the Ceph distributed network file system and released the second release candidate of 2.6.34 .
Torvalds intends to vary the length of the merge window from now on .
Slides of the presentations at the Chemnitz Linux Days provide background information about kernel and KVM topics .
Ubuntu has been given an AMD graphics driver which cooperates with series 1.7 X Servers .
When he released the first RC of 2.6.34 early , which surprised many subsystem maintainers , Linus Torvalds announced that he might still integrate the Ceph distributed network file system , which did n't make it into 2.6.33 , although the merge window had already closed .
He did this last weekend and , shortly afterwards , released Linux 2.6.24 - rc2 – the usual release email for the new version has not so far appeared on the LKML .
Licensed under the LGPL , Ceph is a " Distributed Network File System " which , according to the developers , can manage data on a petabyte scale " and beyond " , it is robust and offers numerous functions that are missing in other similar open source file systems .
Detailed information about Ceph is available on the project 's homepage , in a short description which was integrated into the kernel sources together with the file system code , and in an older article on LWN .
net which describes an earlier , Fuse - based version of the file system .
The file system was n't the only major addition Torvalds made after closing the latest merge window two days earlier than usual .
Between rc1 and rc2 , multiple changes were also made to the Btrfs file system , the SCSI subsystem and the architecture code for ARM , Blackfin and Microblaze CPUs – more than are usually made at this stage , which generally only accommodates a few stragglers .
Several days earlier , Torvalds had actually refused to integrate the SCSI changes in order to teach the maintainers of the SCSI code and other subsystem maintainers a lesson .
Torvalds hoped to prompt them to stop submitting their changes at the last minute , however , it appears that in the end , he did show mercy .
Torvalds has clarified that he now intends to vary the length of future merge windows – the period of time in the development cycle in which the majority of changes are integrated into a new kernel version .
He said that he wo n't mention in advance how long the respective merge window is going to be – and that he might close it after seven days if he thinks that there is enough work done . ( " [ ...] I'm not even going to mention in the release notes how long the merge window is going to be .
Maybe I 'll say " that 's enough " after just one week , [... ] " ) .
With these measures , Torvalds has further adapted the ( partially unwritten ) rules of the Linux kernel development process .
Presentations
In one of the auditoriums the majority of the presentations during the recent Chemnitz Linux Days discussed the Linux kernel and its KVM hypervisor .
Some of the , mostly German - language , presentation slides and short papers provide ample information for all those who could n't attend the event :
Some of the many volunteers who organised the Chemnitz Linux Days are currently working to add video and audio recordings of the presentations in the five main auditoriums to the event 's homepage .
The organisers of the linux.conf.au ( LCA ) 2010 held in Wellington , New Zealand , have recently completed this task and have released videos of many of the presentations .
The kernel and its environment were also a topic there – for example in the " Kernel Report " by LWN.
net founder and figurehead Jonathan Corbet .
The slides of many LCA 2010 presentations have been available via the conference wiki for some time .
In brief
Kernel
Greg Kroah - Hartman has released the stable kernel versions 2.6.32.10 and 2.6.33.1 which , as usual , offer several dozen corrections and minor improvements ; the release email contains the traditional recommendation that users update to one of these versions .
Linus Torvalds refused to integrate the current form of " writeable limits " , which are intended for a future version of SLES and were submitted by Jiri Slaby for integration into 2.6.34 .
Nigel Cunningham has released version 3.1 of TuxOnIce – an alternative implementation for using software suspend ( suspend / hibernate ) .
At the end of his release email , Cunningham indicates that he intends to focus on improving the kernel 's software suspend code once he has completed some remaining TuxOnIce - related tasks .
Kernel environment ( " plumbing layer " ) and userland drivers
Kernel.org administrator John ' Warthog9 '
Hawley has announced that Kernel.org - hosted services such as Bugzilla , Wiki and Patchwork are now available via SSL .
Greg Kroah - Hartman has released version 0.87 of the usbutils .
Neil Brown has released version 3.1.2 of mdadm , whose default metadata format for software RAIDs created via the kernel 's MD code is now v1.2 .
In a LWN . net article which is now also available to non-subscribers , the Linux Weekly News team have compiled numerous aspects of the interaction between Linux and storage media with 4 - KByte sectors .
This topic has also been repeatedly discussed in the Kernel Log .
Furthermore , it recently sparked prolonged discussions on the LKML ; the page in the Linux ATA wiki used by kernel hackers for the relevant background information has recently been given another major overhaul ; corrections were , for instance , made in some areas that discuss running a Linux distribution in parallel with older Windows versions such as XP .
Graphics
Peter Hutterer has released version 1.7.6 of X.org 's X Server , which only introduces minor corrections .
The latest proprietary Linux graphics drivers on AMD 's driver web page do n't work with the series 1.7 X Servers that have been available since last October .
However , the Ubuntu developers apparently received the pre-release version of a driver that fixes the problem for Ubuntu 10.04 , which includes such an X Server .
As this driver is not publicly available at AMD , this does n't really help the users of other distributions with X.org 7.5 X Servers .
Ubuntu has received such special treatment for all versions since Ubuntu 8.10 , while AMD has , at times , left the users of other distributions out in the cold for months .
The beta version of a proprietary NVIDIA driver for GeForce graphics hardware already supports OpenGL 3.3 .
The developers of the ATI X.org driver package have released versions 6.12.6 and 6.12.192 of their drivers for Radeon graphics cards ; the latter version is the second release candidate of the series 6.13 drivers and is said to considerably improve the performance of KMS EXA DFS ( and , therefore , of GetImage ) .
Michel Dänzer has released version 11.0.1 of the X.org graphics drivers for VMware guests .
On the X.org developer mailing list , Peter Hutterer has provided an overview of what he thinks is required for X to provide decent multi- touch support .
In his blog , Dave Airlie describes some experiments that involve running two X Servers on one graphics card – this is interesting for scenarios such as multi-seat environments .
In a second post , Airlie explained some aspects of a " proof of concept " in which a Radeon graphics card computes images that are subsequently output via Intel chip - set graphics .

What do you do when a laptop breaks down three months after purchase ?
Get it repaired ?
Sell it ?
Or do as this Chinese man did , and destroy it silently at a HP store , with not a single swear - word passing your lips ?

The brutal destruction of the HP laptop happened eight months ago , but it 's only just now come to light thanks to 170 formal complaints against HP products in China .
I 'm amazed at how chilled - out he looks , despite being angry enough to tear his laptop to pieces at a HP store .

Pakistan says the South Waziristan area is a haven for militants
At least 30 militants have been killed in Pakistani air strike near the Afghan border , the military says .
It says a militant " hideout " was hit in the Shawal mountains of South Waziristan , following a tip - off .
The army launched an offensive in South Waziristan last October to root out militants blamed for bombings .
The offensive was closely monitored by Pakistan 's Nato allies in Afghanistan , who say the area is a haven for al - Qaeda and Taliban fighters .
Pakistan 's government said the operation had been completed in December , but fighting in the area has continued .
" The hideout in Shawal was targeted after we were tipped off that terrorists were hiding in the mountains , " said a military spokesman .
The strike came 10 days after Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar , the Taliban 's top Afghan military commander , was captured in Karachi .

LAST year , Blue Monday – the ‘ most depressing day of the year ’ – fell in the same week as Australia Day .
It was a combination of which that caused me to wonder whether it is time to think about heading home .
Blue Monday comes about apparently from the grey weather , high debt , long time until next Christmas , freshness of failed New Year ’s resolutions and low motivation .
Even the sunniest optimist would be muted by the cold , grey London January , and in particular I noticed a fog of discontent permeating the Antipodean population .
A Kiwi friend rumbled her discontent on Facebook unleashing an avalanche of comments from her friends and family back home ; ‘it ’s warm , it ’s sunny , come home , we ’re here , we miss you ’ .
One or two ex-Londoners piped up that they wished they were still here in the UK and current Londoners urged her to think of the travel opportunities but these comments were buried in the torrent of well wishers from back home .
Just two short days after Blue Monday it was Australia Day .
I looked at Facebook over breakfast and it was alive with talk of sun , sea , sand , steak , salads , sheilas , beer , BBQs , blokes , cricket and a day off .
I pulled on my green and gold for Australia Day in London and tried to think warm thoughts as I struggled into my winter coat , pulled on my hat and wound a scarf around my neck .
I shoved a brolly into my handbag and could n’t help but wonder ‘ what am I doing here ?’.
Unexpectedly , London responded as if I had spoken the thought aloud .
I was amazed to see an almost empty tube pull into the station to take me to work .
I was n’t crammed into a hot and malodorous carriage and jolted back and forth , I was seated , and my adjacent commuter even gave me the armrest .
I enjoyed the smooth , efficient ride to work and thought how I really had n’t missed owning a car .
Australia fought back via my iPod , which shuffled to ‘ I Still Call Australia Home ’ .
It ’s a stirring , patriotic song , bringing to mind images of children clad in white standing in dramatic international locations .
However it does n’t exactly call me home , in fact it encourages more travel , hence its use by Qantas to get more “ bums on seats ” of international flights .
Wherever I live , I can still call Australia home , with the added bonus of not calling Australia home for taxation purposes .
Undeterred , my iPod shuffled to The Waifs ’ ‘ London Still ’ .
The mournful Australian accent describing retail therapy at Camden market being totally ineffective against homesickness saddened me , but it was the line ‘ I wonder what I ’m missing , I think of songs I ’ve never heard ’ that really struck a chord with me on that Australia Day last year , as Triple J’s Hottest 100 blasted from radios across Oz .
When people talk for years to come of the 2011 Brisbane floods , my version of the shared experience is based on online news sites , emails , Facebook photos and comments .
I lost nothing and I was n’t there to help with the clean - up .
What I was missing was shared experiences ; at a national level , the swearing in of the first female Prime Minister ; at a state level , the flooding ; and at an individual level , birthday parties , engagements , weddings , not to mention the minutiae of everyday life that is deemed not worthy of mentioning to a friend who is on the other side of the world .
For now I am trading travel opportunities for shared experiences , but maybe I can have a little of both .
A trio of Australian wedding invitations arrived this week , and I ’ve resolved to attend at least one of them , to share the experience in person and to catch up with all the family and friends from back home .
I am elated at this thought until my iPod shuffles to The Ramones ‘ I Wanna Be Sedated ’ , which always reminds me just how long and horrible the kangaroo route flight home is .
‘ Twenty - twenty - twenty - four hours to go , I wanna be sedated ’ .
Hey , least there ’s always a sunny Australia Day to look forward to !
Roseanne Barr has changed her tune .
Instead of practically blaming Marie Osmond for her son ’s suicide , the comic actress - turned - blogger has posted a new comment calling Marie “ a decent and strong woman , ” RadarOnline.com has learned .
Autopsy Inconclusive On Marie Osmond ’s Son
Roseanne stirred up outrage when she suggested that the Mormom Church ’s anti-gay position — and the Osmond family ’s support of the Church — were responsible for 18 - year - old Michael Blosil jumping to his death February 26 in Los Angeles .
Roseanne Blames Mormom Church For Marie Osmond ’s Son’s Suicide
Roseanne has n’t changed her dislike of the Mormom “ gay agenda ” but she is now far more sympathetic about what Marie is experiencing .
Here ’s what she wrote on Roseanne World :
“ thinking about how terrible it would be to lose a child for any reason , accident , illness , murder , mental illness or suicide .
It seems it would either galvanize you or destroy you .
Sometimes , though when your heart is broken , it ’s also at it ’s most open , and something new and better can come in to heal it .
I see Marie Osmond as a decent and strong woman , who can make a huge change in her sphere one day .
The Mormon church reversed its ban on African American members , and it can also reverse it ’s gay agenda .
Marie is the kind of person who can make that her life ’s work , and accomplish it .
Mormon women are some of the world ’s strongest women .
Marie is going back to work in her Las Vegas show the day after her son ’s funeral .
She is that strong in her focus and determination , and I do admire that .
Good Luck on all you do , Marie .
You have so much power to turn the wrong things around !
It ’s time for all bigotry to be gone . ”
Michael ’s funeral is planned for Monday .
Marie and her brother Donny are planning to resume their Las Vegas show the next day .
APRIL 20 -- Usually , when U.S. postal inspectors seek a search warrant to open a suspicious package , they are expecting to find illegal narcotics inside .
But when agent J. David McKinney recently took possession of an Express Mail box , he knew that the contraband inside was not likely of the powdered variety .
Because ' the package was moving , ' according to a court affidavit filed April 15 in U.S. District Court in Roanoke , Virginia .
After determining that the return address on the 10 - pound , 13 - ounce box ( which carried $ 63.55 in postage ) was phony , McKinney obtained permission from a federal magistrate to open the parcel , which sat on his desk and ' moved periodically . '
Inside , as seen in evidence photos , McKinney discovered a live ferret in a homemade wire cage .
The box , destined for someone in Puerto Rico , also contained ferret food , some ' ferret dietary supplement , ' and a box of Children 's Bendaryl , with one tablet missing , according to an inventory sheet .
Presumably , the ferret -- who appeared groggy when the package was opened -- was given the allergy medicine as a makeshift sedative by the unknown shipper .
McKinney told TSG it was the first time in his 20 - year career that he intercepted a live animal destined for the U.S. postal system ( it is illegal to distribute such ' non- mailable animals ' ) .
McKinney added that he was relieved , upon opening the package , to find a ferret , and not a snake , inside .
His affidavit describes a previously unreported incident in which an eight - foot python ( seen here ) was sent via Express Mail to a Kansas address ( ' the snake was discovered loose with the mail in the Postal Truck , ' according to McKinney ) .
The reptile had been mailed from the same Lynchburg post office where the ferret was deposited April 5 .
The ferret is now a ward of Roanoke 's animal control office and , if deemed healthy , will be offered for adoption .

A survey about state of the art C compiler optimization tricks , Felix von Leitner , Linux Kongress 2009 .
The introduction and the conclusion is quite well put :
Optimizing == important .
But often : Readable code == more important
Learn what your compiler does
Then let the compiler do it .
If you do an optimization , test it on real world data .
If itâ€™s not drastically faster but makes the code less readable : undo it .
That 's certainly something that I agree with 110 % .
And really , that 's why a good compilers course is so important , even if the vast majority of students never write a compiler outside of class .
According to a poll which appeared in The Times this morning , the voters have expressed a clear preference for a hung parliament .
This desire apparently arises from popular disgust with Labour ’s intransigence and the slipperiness of the Conservatives .
Presumably , there is also a widely - held opinion that a purposefully inconclusive result will lead either Mr. Brown or Mr. Cameron to invite that nice Mr. Clegg over to Number 10 , and ensure that Vince Cable is installed as Chancellor of the Exchequer .
There is even the potential that a few new voices , say , two or three Green MPs , might get a shout in as well .
This is an intriguing idea and has many merits to it : after all , it is likely that the Liberal Democrats and other parties would demand a change in the voting system as their price for joining any government .
Furthermore , there might be other reforms in the offing , such as a transition to a more green economy and tougher regulation of banks and other financial institutions .
However , there is a problem with this scenario : an inconclusive result does not necessarily imply that this will happen .
We can get a glimpse at what the future may hold by taking a look at what has transpired in Canada , as there are some distinct parallels to our present situation .
Canadian politics rarely appear on the radar screens of the British press ; however , there are some startling commonalities to consider .
In 1993 , the Liberal Party of Canada , which is more or less equivalent to Britain ’s Labour Party , wiped out a demoralised and scandal - ridden Progressive Conservative Party , which was then led by the lacklustre Kim Campbell .
The leader of the Liberals , a charismatic Quebecker named Jean Chretien , became Prime Minister .
He held the post for ten years and won three elections , capitalising on continued disarray among the Conservatives .
His time in office was not untroubled ; for example , he lobbied the Business Development Bank of Canada to give a loan to a crony , a suspicious activity later referred to the “ Grand Mere Scandal ” .
Worse , he was later held responsible for the loose dispersement of hundreds of millions of Canadian dollars to Quebec and Liberal party interests in the so - called “ Sponsorship Scandal ” .
Tainted by these charges of corruption , in 2003 , Chretien yielded his post to his Finance Minister , Paul Martin ; relations between the two of them had been strained for years .
Martin , who had largely been considered a success as Finance Minister , found that the role of Prime Minister to be far more taxing ; he was labelled “ Mr. Dithers ” by the press .
After three years in the role , he and the Liberal Party finally lost power .
Here is where the narrative gets more interesting , and certainly more alarming .
The 2006 election yielded a hung parliament , with the Conservatives , led by Stephen Harper , as the largest party ; this was in spite of the fact that early polls had indicated that the Conservatives would win an outright majority .
Voters had second thoughts , apparently .
After all , Stephen Harper ’s initial presentation of himself and his party to the public was far to the right of Canadian opinion ; his latter moves to more centrist positions were regarded with suspicion .
Harper and the Conservatives have held onto power since 2006 , despite a further election in 2008 which also yielded an inconclusive result .
Despite being a minority , if anything , his hold on the government has become more solid though some of this has relied on barefaced cheek .
That said , part of his continuance is likely due to the unobtrusiveness of Harper himself , who possesses a bland personality and lacks both charm and charisma .
However , he has felt no particular need to form a lasting coalition ; his government has continued on the sufferance not of the Liberals , but the other parties which sit in Canada ’s parliament , the New Democrats ( who are unreconstructed social democrats ) and more interestingly , the nationalist Bloc Quebecois .
It is the behaviour of the latter which may hold the key to the future ; it was their support in February 2006 which allowed the minority Conservative government to be formed in the first place and in the words of the Bloc ’s House Leader Michel Gauthier , continue a “ good while ” .
It is not impossible to imagine a scenario in which the Scottish Nationalists and / or Plaid Cmyru do a deal with minority British Conservative government ; hitherto , both parties have espoused the theme that they are best placed to defend Scotland or Wales from the austerity to come .
Like the Bloc Quebecois , they also have no interest in being part of the central government .
It is entirely possible that one or both of them could offer their support in exchange for defending their nations ’ budgets or for greater devolution of powers from the centre .
Such co-operation is not as far fetched as it may sound ; for example , in May 2009 , David Cameron stressed that he wanted to enhance co-operation with the SNP , in order to make devolved government work better .
There have been meetings between the Tories and SNP to this end .
This is not to say there are no significant differences between Britain and Canada ; unlike Gordon Brown , Paul Martin subjected himself to an election in 2004 and won , albeit he had to continue in a minority government of his own .
Furthermore , Canada has been partially insulated from chaos by having a more federal structure than Britain .
New Democrat and Liberal administrations in the provinces limit Harper ’s room for manoeuvre .
But as the public contemplates the consequences of electing a hung parliament , it may be worth considering that a hung parliament does not necessarily mean the kind of government the people intend to have .
That nice Mr. Layton of the New Democrats has n’t been invited into Ottawa ’s government ; solid , sturdy Mr. Cable may not get to sit in Number 11 Downing Street and balance the nation ’s books .
A change in the voting system has not occurred as a result of Canada ’s hung parliament , and frustratingly , the popular Canadian Green Party still awaits its first elected MP .
Rather than a stable government which capitalises on Parliament ’s best and brightest , the results on May 6th may mean we are in for a very bumpy ride , with David Cameron firmly in the driver ’s seat .
augmented sculpture is an art installation that combines three - dimensional sculpture and 2 - D projections by lichtfront and grosse8 .
the project was recently presented at imm cologne 2010 where viewers could see the piece in action .
the project consists of an abstract geometric form that is spiky and jagged all over .
the sculpture itself is white making it the perfect canvas for colourful light projections .
an array of digital projectors is beamed onto the form in accordance to the specific shape of the sculpture .
the projection can illuminate each facet of the form individually making the sculpture appear to be illuminating from within .

On Christmas Day in 2009 , a small fire broke out on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit .
The crew put it out with an extinguisher and blankets .
The plane landed safely .
Two people were injured : a Nigerian who had caused the fire by trying to detonate 80g of explosive hidden in his underpants , and a Dutch passenger who tackled him .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab failed in his objective of bringing down the aircraft .
But he succeeded in part of his al - Qaida inspired mission : the unnerving of America .
By the next morning , new ritual humiliations awaited those wishing to fly to the US .
TV news channels fuelled the panic with round - the - clock coverage – yet all the important facts are in the paragraph above .
America 's frenzied , alarmist response is hardly becoming for the most powerful nation on earth .
The lack of any sense of proportion simply serves to enhance the status of a terrorist group which is dispersed , quite small and cannot possibly threaten US sovereignty unless Americans connive in their own defeat .
With a panicked , politicised response to an event that killed no one , they are doing precisely that .
The threat from terrorism is serious – not only because of the physical damage it can do but also because it challenges the authority and competence of government .
Governments rightly place high demands on intelligence and security services to guard citizens against that threat .
But the threat must also be kept in perspective .
According to the US National Counterterrorism Centre , during 2008 33 US citizens were killed around the world in terrorist attacks , including 21 in Iraq .
Since 2004 , four have died in the US as a result of terrorism .
Since the 2001 attacks , other extremist plots have been uncovered .
If they had come to fruition , they would have killed Americans .
If the " shoe bomber " , Richard Reid , had been successful in 2001 , 197 people would probably have been killed .
Abdulmutallab could have killed 289 people .
However , none succeeded .
By contrast , in 2006 alone , 18,573 people were victims of homicide in the US .
Traffic - related injuries resulted in 43,664 deaths .
Firearms accounted for 30,896 , while 21,647 died as a result of falls .
No doubt al - Qaida would like to cause deaths on this scale .
The many failed plots show that this kind of success is very difficult for terrorists to achieve .
But success can be achieved in other ways as well : the response is in a sense more important than the attack .
We should never forget that terrorism is as much as anything an act of theatre .
Bringing down the World Trade Centre did not destroy the US economy .
But it did provoke George Bush to declare a " global war on terror " .
The huge expense incurred in pursuing this effort has arguably done more damage to the economy than Osama bin Laden could have hoped for .
Nobody can forget the horror of 9/11 , and it was inevitable that a government faced with such an outrage would respond in extreme fashion .
Hindsight is easy , but if Bush had placed more emphasis on bringing those responsible to justice rather than on declaring an unwinnable " war " against an undefined enemy , things might have turned out very differently .
The most important consideration here should be what will be most effective in combating extremist terrorism in the long term .
It is surely not inspiring for radicalised people with the potential for violent action to see terrorists tried in ordinary criminal courts and sentenced to long prison terms .
This was definitely not the martyrdom they had in mind .
But it surely is inspiring to them to see terrorists treated as a special class of prisoners to be held by the military , imprisoned without trial and tortured .
This is the kind of treatment that makes jihadists believe that they can indeed be the fighters for a cause they aspire to be .
The abandonment of ordinary standards of criminal justice in cases of terrorism can thus be argued to be counterproductive .
On top of this , there is the argument that democratic values of freedom and justice are the western world 's best advertisement .
Departures from such values have damaged America 's international reputation .
The oft - quoted saying of Benjamin Franklin is worth repeating : " They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . "
People in the UK have recently been sporting bags , mugs and clothing bearing the phrase Keep Calm and Carry On , from rediscovered posters produced by the British government in 1939 for use in the event of German invasion .
While this is now almost a caricature of the famed stiff - upper - lip approach , it is a message that holds a lesson in the face of inevitable terrorist attacks .
Some resilience is needed .
In its absence , terrorists achieve their objective .
As obesity becomes a greater social and political issue , campaigners say they have a human right to be fat – and that science backs them up
Ricky Gervais recently said : " If there 's a woman in leggings , eating chips with a fag in her mouth , sterilise her . "
The comment was made in the context of over - population and also included a reference to " stupid fat faces " .
It caused a mild ripple in the media , but it quickly died down , largely because , ironic or not , Gervais 's observation was a reflection of what most of the country thinks .
In Britain , we 're finally enlightened about the importance of respecting race and sexuality : but fat ?
In one sentence , Gervais nailed it : fat equals thick ; fat equals lack of control and overeating ; fat equals poverty and moral bankruptcy , a potent combination of social and body hatred .
Fat equals a life sustained on fizzy drinks , mass - produced food and no boundaries .
The obese , with body mass indices ( BMI ) of more than 30 and with their lumbering walks and rolls of flesh , Type 2 diabetes and heart problems , are a sub -race less deserving of the rights of the rest of us .
As we are told , these adults are to blame for everything from rising healthcare to creating a new generation of fat children ( one in four in the UK ) .
The US spends $ 147bn ( £ 96bn ) a year fighting obesity – more than it spends on cancer and twice as much as it spent in 1998 .
Michele Obama , in her campaign against childhood obesity , has put her 8 - year - old and 11 - year - old daughters on a diet ( their BMI was " getting off balance " her paediatrician told her ) .
Two thirds of Americans are overweight or obese ( defined as a BMI of 25 - 30 or 30 - plus respectively ) .
In the UK , The Foresight Report : Tackling Obesities : Future Choices project ( 2007 ) predicted that in the absence of action , 60 % of men , 50 % of women and 25 % of children would be obese by 2050 , putting the bill for the NHS at £ 45 bn ( costs are estimated to rise to £ 6.3 bn a year by 2015 ) .
We have entered an era in which phrases such as " moral obligation " and " economic imperative " are being used to get fat people thin .
The Food Standards Agency endorses British restaurants ( such as Pret A Manger ) displaying calorific content on menus , just as New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has forced cafes , restaurants and fast - food outlets in the city to do the same .
Billboards around New York are showing glasses of thick , yellow fat , marbled with blood vessels , accompanied by the words " Are You Pouring on the Pounds ? "
Congress is considering proposals for employers to use financial rewards or penalties to promote healthy behaviour by employees – such as losing weight .
In the UK , David Cameron has called for an end to the " moral neutrality " of not passing judgment .
The message could not be clearer : we can no longer let fat people stuff their porky faces with fast food and feed their children burgers in front of the TV , because the rest of us are picking up the bill .
Even hand - wringing liberals ( myself included ) allow ourselves to see overweight people as degenerates , and luckily for us , the catastrophic social and economic predictions lend our views a respectable medical justification .
We cheer Jamie Oliver for patiently trying to tell fat mothers about the vices of over - processed food , and he's now doing the same in the US .
" Overweight " people ( usually the poor ) , we think , just need to be taught the right skills .
They need to learn how to cook properly with fresh ingredients , how to exercise , how to gently guide their children towards fruit and vegetables and how to show restraint in their own eating habits .
Because , we think , in all those millions of fat people out there , there are nice , thin people like us trying to get out .
The focus on fat has created a backlash of " fat pride " .
Just as obesity and the diet industry have their roots in the American culture of excess , so too does the movement set up to challenge our obsession with them .
The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance was founded in 1969 , followed three years later by the Fat Underground , a radical therapy group that began so that its female members could resolve fat oppression and become thin .
( Discovering the futility of diets , the group quickly abandoned any notion of the " thin " ideal . )
After 40 years , then , the " Weight Diversity " movement has come back to the fore .
Made up of activists throughout America – with strong links in the UK – its retaliation against fat - bashing has found its way to Capitol Hill .
It is based on three things .
Science : the strength of evidence of the abysmal long - term failure of dieting ( it makes you fatter in the end ) combined with new research showing weight per se is not indicative of health ; social : the unacceptable persecution of a new " underclass " ; legal : the violation of an individual 's human rights .
With the combination of all three , the Weight Diversity movement is sending out its own message : " Back off ! " , it is saying .
" We are fat , we are happy and we are healthy ! "
Can we dare believe them ?
Before my trip to San Francisco to meet members of the Weight Diversity movement , I had been reading about one of its members , Marilyn Wann , author of Fat !
So ?
Because You Don't Have to Apologize for Your Size !
Wann is one of the fat activists instrumental in getting anti-weight discrimination laws passed in San Francisco ( one of only six cities where they exist ) after she saw a billboard outside a gym showing an alien with the slogan : " When they come , they 'll eat the fat ones first . "
From Fat !
So ?
I know more about her than I do some of my best friends .
I know she is 5ft 4in and weighs 20 stone ; that such a weight is no barrier to a great sex life ( " you can so get on top " ) ; that she has fat parents ; that she has always been fat , has never – unusually for fat people , I will learn – been a yo - yo dieter ; that she was bullied as a child ; that she loves broccoli and cottage cheese but hates cheesecake , milk chocolate and caramel ; that she has no health insurance because of her size but suffers no major health problems ; that she was educated at Stanford ; is funny and smart and likes to wear hot pink ; and has in her wardrobe a custom - made crop - top bikini with hot pink piping and a thong bottom – yes , thong – for all those poolside occasions that leave most of us cowering under a sarong .
If I understand one important thing , it is that I am never to use the words " overweight " , " obese " or " oversize " in her company .
These words are labels given by the medical profession as a " diagnosis " .
She has reclaimed the word " fat " for herself : " Do you want to feel good about yourself ?
Silence your tormenters ?
Look better in miniskirts ?
Use the F - Word , " she writes in Fat !
So ?
She meets me off the plane dressed , as predicted , in hot pink .
It is an odd feeling being with somebody who is proudly fat – it is so against cultural conditioning to ignore it – let alone calling them by the word .
On the first few occasions I stammer it out , my face flushing with embarrassment .
This feeling intensifies when we meet again later in a tiny Thai restaurant .
Marilyn brings along her boyfriend of two years , Orian , who is quite possibly the tallest and fattest man I have ever seen .
They seem very at home in such a miniature setting , and very at home with each other ( First Rule of Fat Club : fat people are not all living in shame . )
I had been worrying about the meal with Marilyn because , naturally , everybody wants to know how much a fat person eats and she knows I 'll be watching .
Orian does keep a beady eye on the dishes but Marilyn seems only casually interested in the food .
At one point she eulogises over a mussel , but that 's as far as it goes .
I ask how much she eats .
She sighs : " People never ask thin folks to justify what they eat " – but is graceful enough to comply .
" I eat twice a day and have a few snacks .
I maybe have takeout a couple of times a month , and if I 'm having a bad day I might have a bag of cheese puffs , but not by any means every day .
I 'm not really into sweets .
I like a bit of cheese but I 'm not going to sit around eating pounds of the stuff .
There are great restaurants here and I love going to them , but … it 's a myth that fat people overeat .
I eat vegetables every day .
For me , food is not the problem in my life .
My fat ass is not the problem in my life . "
" Why do you think you are fat ? " I ask her .
" Do you have to defend why you are thin ? " she snaps back .
But it is a necessary question , I respond , because people – particularly doctors – think you over - consume , and that is the basis of how the medical profession treats weight control : calories in , calories out .
Marilyn sighs again .
" Calories in , calories out is only part of the explanation of why a person weighs what they weigh .
If you look at the data on identical twins , the genetic component is very large – as it is for me .
My mother is fat , my grandmother was fat , we ate totally normally as a family .
There 's also how much disease you 've had in your life , what drugs you 've taken , mental health stuff .
I get people shouting at me on the radio , ' You ca n't beak the laws of physics ! ' and I say to them , ' I bet you know thin people who are completely sedentary and eat vast quantities of food and never exercised .
Well , I say , that person by your equation should be fat ! ' "
Marilyn is not at her strongest on science – her responses do not go beyond the anecdotal .
When I challenge her , for example , on why the medical profession is so worried about the fat problem if fat people can be so healthy , she retaliates in activist speak : " By denying me healthcare , they are effectively saying to me that they want all fat people dead ! "
When I ask why does n't she just tell the doctors what she has just told me – that her diet is not excessive – and she says : " Oh they 'd say I was lying !
To them or to myself . "
Are you , I ask ?
" Why would I ? "
She looks me in the eye , but I detect she is slightly uneasy .
Anyway , Rule Number Two of Fat Club is clear and an accepted fact by all : fat people are not always fat because they eat a lot .
Consider also genetics , depression , isolation , poverty , a messed - up metabolism through a history of yo - yo dieting , combined – to a lesser or greater extent – with a degree of personal choice .
The brother of novelist Lionel Shriver died in December weighing 24 stone .
After a terrible accident , he became immobile and depressed .
He began to overeat , she tells me , as a way of " solace and self - torture " .
He developed diabetes and his spine compressed under the weight so that he lost 4ins in height .
He needed an oxygen tank .
Eventually , he had a sudden respiratory crisis and died of a cardiac arrest in a New York hospital .
" It was utterly heartbreaking , " Shriver tells me .
" One of the most painful things for me was to watch how society treated him .
But this weight diversity movement is flying in the face of medical fact .
I am not concerned about it because the absurdity of it is self - evident .
If people want to say ' I like my size ! ' – fine , each to their own , but morbid obesity leads to unhappiness – it is not what my brother wanted to be and in terms of health costs , it puts a burden on everyone . "
I put that case to Marilyn : " He did n't want to ' love his body ' " I tell her .
" He hated his body . "
" First of all , I 'm sorry to hear about this , " she says .
" There are a lot of things that can go on in a person 's life that are pathological in themselves .
I would not lay the blame here on weight but on the things that were happening to him . "
OK , I say , would you support a fat person coming to you who said they did n't want to be fat ?
" I do n't know why I have to support anybody in anything , " she says .
" I do n't want to present myself as having to tell people how to live in order to guarantee them any kind of health outcome . "
She then says : " Being a fat person means that you are not fully a person .
You are a second - class citizen at best , untouchable , subhuman .
You are less likely to get jobs , dates , cool clothes , respect , to have your own sense of importance and then you get all these doctors saying to you , ' You are going to get sick ! '
I say give up the false hope where weight defines a person and instead adopt a real sense of hope .
" Using the word obese makes it sound like there 's some kind of scientific difference between fat and thin people . "
But people would say there is , I tell her .
She replies : " Historically , science has served an unofficial function of justifying popular prejudice .
I do n't think the majority count of doctors are right .
I am healthy , healthier than some thin people .
I advocate good nutrition and I move my body – I 've been doing circuits five times a week – but these things should only be health enhancing , not to produce weight loss . "
Wann is now 43 , and after her teens and 20s , which she spent being miserable about her size , she insists her life is better fat .
I feel guilty for thinking that perhaps she uses the activism to justify her weight , to lend it a cause , and that if she were truly at peace with herself , a degree of weight would come off anyway .
She is , after all , extremely fat .
But then maybe I 'm stuck in the thin mindset .
Wann sees herself as a libertarian .
" It 's our right to sit on a couch and eat a bucket of bacon all day .
I do n't think I have to prove I am healthy , " she says .
" I would claim human rights – if you agree I am a human being , I have certain rights .
I am not getting in your way by being fat , even if we accept that health and weight are immutable , they [ my thin critics ] are still wrong , they are infringing my rights . "
Do fat people have a right to be fat for whatever reason ?
Should we even be asking the question ?
Marsha Coupe , a fat activist friend of Wann in the UK , told me how she was beaten up on train in Kent for being fat : " A woman , who was drunk , started shouting , ' You fat bitch ' and hitting me .
I could n't defend myself because she was on top of me .
By the time she had finished with me , I looked as if I had been hit by a train .
Obesity is paraded as the cause of all evil , and it 's bear baiting . "
Sondra Solovay is the principal anti-weight discrimination litigator in the US .
She is considerably fatter even than Wann ( " I would n't want to be 50lb heavier than I am , " Wann admits , " only because it would make my life more physically complicated " ) .
Solovay , who looks as if she is wearing special orthopaedic boots , will not talk about her weight history , except to say that she had fat parents and has been a vegetarian since she was eleven .
She has a brilliant mind , degrees from America 's finest law schools and has faced discrimination inside the courtroom and out .
Her manner is gentle and considered .
" Weight is a deep prejudice that goes beyond the green of the dollar , " she says .
" We have a long history of oppressing groups in the US .
We never learn – we just keep applying those labels in different variations to the next group that comes along .
All I want is for us to learn from our history and not to continue to oppress fat people to the point where we need affirmative action to bring them up to where they should be . "
But can fat be treated the same as race ?
As Shriver told me : ' While discrimination against heavy people should be illegal , to equate fat with race , gender and sexual orientation is to cast obesity as an unassailable state over which we have no control .
Quite apart from anything else , is n't it nice to be able to move around quickly ? "
To appreciate the multi-faceted approach of the Weight Diversity movement , I go to Berkeley , California , to watch Phat Girls Fly , a dance group for fat women which specialises in burlesque ( this is San Francisco , after all ) .
The point of my watching is clear .
Third Rule of Fat Club :
Not all fat people are sedentary .
The women possess a million times more body confidence than I do and all of them are a good deal heavier .
Rule Number Four : thin people – particularly women and girls – live under the oppression of a fattist society , too .
Witness the influence of the fashion and diet industries in making teenage girls anorexic and size 10 women still think they are fat .
Would I want to be the same size as the Phat Girls ?
No .
Would I like their body confidence ?
Yes please .
And herein lies a wonderful illustration of how , as a slim woman , I am restrained by weight oppression .
The best chance we have casting aside this way of thinking lies in producing scientific data .
Luckily for the Weight Diversity movement , Dr Linda Bacon , the lead investigator for a clinical research study that evaluates a Health At Every Size programme , has added her much - needed voice to the fight .
Linda Bacon is both thin and a serious player in nutrition science in the US .
She has at her fingertips mountains of epidemiological evidence , which show that , subject to exceptions for the most extreme cases – no doubt Lionel Shriver 's late brother being one – it remains not at all clear that being overweight is an independent health risk of any kind , let alone one that kills .
While a sedentary lifestyle or a lousy diet – both contributing factors to weight gain – do pose health risks , there remained no evidence that being fat , in itself , is bad for you .
In other words , while lifestyle is a good predictor of health , weight is n't .
Bacon also knew of a review of research in 1996 conducted by the National Centre for Health Statistics and Cornell University that showed that in the majority of studies , groups of people labelled " overweight " – note , not the obese – were found to have equal or lower mortality rates than supposedly normal weight people .
The message seemed to be clear .
Fat people might be less healthy if they did n't move from the sofa , but if they were fat and active – with good blood sugar , cholesterol and blood pressure levels – they had absolutely nothing to worry about .
Health At Every Size is a movement that has existed since the late 80s as an alternative to the destructive patterning of dieting ( it has a small branch in the UK , co-founded by NHS nutritionist Lucy Aphramor ) .
It was only in 2002 , however , that Bacon tested the theory scientifically : " I am a scientist , " she tells me .
" I have three graduate degrees all related to the field of weight science and it's amazing to me that in none of the fields are our stereotypes about weight at all based in science .
There are people who are at unhealthy weights but addressing it as a weight issue does n't make the problem go away . "
Bacon embraced this herself in her 20s after years of borderline bulimia .
Once she let go of the idea of weight loss and become interested only in her health – exercise and good food sourced at local farmers markets – she lost 30 lb .
By that stage , ironically , she did not care .
Helped by two researchers from the US Department of Agriculture , and by Judith S Stern , a respected diet researcher , and funded by the National Institutes of Health , she conducted a clinical research study on 78 women with BMIs above 30 but no more than 45 .
Half went on a conventional diet programme , with calorie control and weigh - ins , and half went on the HAES program that encouraged group exercise and acceptance .
At the end of the six months , there was another six - month period where both groups met monthly .
At the end of the year , the dieters had regained all their weight with no health benefits .
The HAES women , however , had significantly lower cholesterol and blood pressure , had quadrupled the amount of energy they spent being active and had been freed from the tyranny of diets .
But the HAES women did not lose weight either : " Our bodies are invested in maintaining fat for ' lean ' times , " says Bacon .
" Of course , they might lose weight over the long term as the work they did in HAES becomes more ingrained in their lives .
We just do n't know .
What 's most important is that these women got healthier and felt better about themselves . "
Lucy Aphramor agrees : " There is a vast amount of research to show that weight - controlled behaviour does n't work , and also evidence to suggest it leads to a negative effect on health and more weight gain .
If we are to reduce population weight gain , we have to prevent people from going on diets .
We have to change social attitudes to ' fatness ' and ' thinness ' .
It should be about health . "
In other words , it could be that our war on fat is actually helping cause the very disease it is supposed to cure .
On a bright , cheery Sunday morning , Marilyn Wann is out on the streets of San Francisco with her Yey !
scales , specially modified weighing scales that substitute numbers with readings of " You 're sexy " , " Fabulous " , " Beautiful " .
" Come on the Yey !
Scales , " she shouts from a cloud of hot pink .
" Come get a free compliment ! "
Passers - by eye the scales as if they were a nest of vipers , but gradually , nervously , men and women approach and climb on board .
From this random , non-scientific sample , I learn this : they all dread getting on scales ; one girl told me her mother said she was too fat ; one guy had lost two - and - a - half stone through the cabbage diet – and put most of it back on .
Another woman had finally abandoned diets for exercise and had never felt better – or looked slimmer .
There was nobody for whom weight was not an issue .
( Admittedly , those people might have kept on walking . )
Two hours later , waiting in the queue at the airport , I get chatting to a retired doctor from Glasgow .
He shakes his head at the concept of the Weight Diversity movement : " Calories in , calories out , " he says .
I start to explain the theories I have just learned , but he says : " Nobody came out of Belsen fat ! " I 'm silenced .
A week later , a man I am sat next to at dinner almost explodes with fat rage .
Other people join in .
I hear the same thing again : " Look !
There were no fat people in concentration camps ! "
So is this what it 's really come to , I think .
In the debate to get fat people thin , we recall the starvation methods of Hitler 's concentration camps ?
While nobody is suggesting rounding fat people up , if people start discussing the issue through an extreme of no choice , might we not be better off in a world that advocates free choice , however extreme ?
And with views so polarised , do we ever stand a chance of becoming a nation in good health , eating good food ?

Fr Lawrence Murphy died in 1998 with no official blemish on his record A man who says he was the victim of an American paedophile priest is bringing a lawsuit against the Pope and the Vatican in a US federal court .
His lawyers want the Church to release any files it has on abuse cases involving priests .
The alleged victim , whose identity has not been disclosed , says he was abused by the late Father Lawrence Murphy .
Fr Murphy is accused of attacking up to 200 children during his 20 years at a school for deaf children in Milwaukee .
He was finally moved from the St John school to another diocese in 1974 , but was never prosecuted or defrocked .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
A Church trial was opened after the Vatican received a letter from Fr Murphy 's bishop in 1996 , but it was not concluded by the time Fr Murphy died in 1998 .
The alleged victim 's lawyer , Jeff Anderson , says the Vatican has been negligent .
" What we want the Vatican to do is step up to disgorge the secrets that they have in their files , " he told the BBC .
' Horror '
The victim wrote to the then - Vatican Secretary of State Angelo Sodano in 1995 asking the Pope to excommunicate Fr Murphy .
The BBC has seen copies of the documents submitted to the court .
They include a seven - page letter to Fr Murphy graphically describing the alleged abuse and the effect it had on him .
" Do you know that you really ruined my life ? " he writes .
The writer also says one boy abused by Fr Murphy later committed suicide .
" God must punish you and send you to hell to stay forever , " he adds .
There is a grave and serious problem , and all trails and responsibility for that leads to one place , to the Vatican
Jeff Anderson
Plaintiff 's lawyer
The plaintiff says the Vatican did not reply to his letter , or to another one sent several months later .
The fact that the alleged abuse was linked to the confessional meant the case should have been referred to the Church 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ( CDF ) .
At the time this body was run by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , now Pope Benedict XVI .
The CDF says the first it knew about the Murphy case was in 1996 .
The lawsuit names the Pope and two cardinals .
Mr Anderson says his client is not seeking money but wants the Church " to fundamentally come clean , to come forth with all documents that have evidence of crimes against children for decades " .
He adds : " Until and unless all of those things are done , there is a grave and serious problem , and all trails and responsibility for that leads to one place , to the Vatican , to the pontiff . "
The Vatican has not responded to the lawsuit so far .
In an earlier interview the Pope 's spokesman , Fr Federico Lombardi , told the BBC that Benedict XVI had taken a clear line of transparency .
Last month a Vatican newspaper editorial said media claims that the future Pope had failed to act against Fr Murphy were " ignoble " , and that there had been no cover - up .
There has been a wave of allegations that Church authorities in Europe and North and South America failed to deal properly with priests accused of paedophilia , sometimes just moving them to new parishes where more children were put at risk .

Zombies are open source , humans are proprietary .
Sounds like the latest self - help relationship book for geeks , but it 's actually an interesting analogy .
A college student at Champlain University in Burlington , Vt. , posted two videos this week of one of his professors explaining open source this way .
I found it quite interesting after my post the other day about the problems in teaching the tenets of open source .
( Part I , Part II ) ( Also fun : there actually is at least one open - source zombie video game .) old shampoo commercial , they each bite two friends and so on and so on and so on .
But humans have to have sex and give birth and grow from infant to adulthood .
And they generally can only kill one zombie at a time .
It takes time and effort and resources to build up to a plan and an opportunity to get rid of a whole bunch at a time .
Basically , his initial concept was this : Zombie population grows exponentially .
One infected undead bites someone , creating a new zombie .
Much like that
Open source software can propogate , update and debug much faster than proprietary software , because there are a whole bunch of coders out there who can dive into the program and fix things .
While there may be some overarching structure , such as the Mozilla Foundation , the reaction time is much faster ( let 's not get into the old , shuffling Romero - era zombies vs the super - fast mutants of 28 Days Later and its ilk ) than for proprietary software .
After last month 's Pwn2 Own Contest , Mozilla once again was the first to issue patches for the bug found in the hacking competition , beating Microsoft and Apple to the punch for the second year in a row .
Matt Asay 's CNET column earlier and was struck by a point he made : Mozilla has achieved something amazing by snagging perhaps a third of the worldwide browser market with its open - source Firefox .
But without the " corporate greed " structure behind it , can it have a second act ?
Can it become something more than the sum of its parts and become bigger than - gasp !
- Facebook , even ?
But the same corporate structure that can make the closed - source companies take longer to react to problems can also help create a more sustainable structure for the long haul .
I was reading
While the zombies may be able to propogate and multiply faster than humans , the humans probably will win in the end , because they have everything to lose .
I looked on Google.com Advanced Search for " problem " " anal bead " but found so many articles that I could n't go through them all .
Perhaps you 'll have better luck .
Several different designs of these bead strings were pictured , and some of them looked dangerous if they should break .
You could eat a lot of soft foods like apple sauce and other foods that you know can produce soft bowel movements , and wait for results .
A bulk - producing laxative might also work .
In my opinion , a Fleet 's enema might be too drastic .
If there 's any possibility that part of the broken bead string might be poking or scratching the delicate rectal tissues , you really should give up and go to the doctor .
Tell the receptionist that it's a very personal issue , and when you see the doctor , ask him not to keep any detailed information in your records .
He could call it " irritation " or " constipation " or some such thing .
If you explain your special privacy concerns , I 'm sure he 'll understand .
Seven robbers tied up two employees and stole money out of the cash register early Wednesday at an upscale restaurant along San Francisco 's waterfront , police said .
The holdup happened at Chaya Brasserie at 132 The Embarcadero at 12:15 a.m. , after the restaurant had closed , police said .
The robbers burst in through a side door , assaulted a restaurant manager and custodian and tied them up , said police Sgt. Wilfred Williams .
No customers were inside , police said .
One of the assailants was armed with a knife , police said .
The men took an undisclosed amount of money from the cash register before fleeing .
No arrests have been made .
The robbers were wearing hooded sweatshirts and had their faces covered , so police do not have a good description of them .
Jacques Lemaire plies his trade against the St. Louis Blues during a rather unusual line change .
The state of Lemaire 's receding hairline , the lack of the helmet which he donned in mid-career , and especially the fact the Blues goalie is almost certainly Ernie Wakely , places this photograph around 1970 - 72 .
Jacques Lemaire announced his retirement this week , 26 years and 16 coaching seasons removed from his coaching debut .
It occurs to me that most in the reading audience will know Lemaire as a coach , but relatively few will remember him as a player .
Fewer still are of the advanced vintage that can remember him breaking in !
The year was 1967 .
Canada was celebrating its Centennial , and hockey was changing .
The NHL was expanding from 6 teams to 12 .
The Toronto Maple Leafs had won the Stanley Cup that spring in a mild upset over the Montreal Canadiens , but were a spent force , never to win again .
The Habs , meanwhile , were reloading .
They had lost some 20 bodies from their organization to expansion , but had plenty of young talent to fill the holes .
They also still had their canny old coach , Toe Blake , in his 13th and last season behind the Habs ’ bench .
Among the youngsters was Jacques Lemaire , a dynamic young centre .
Lemaire had starred with the Montreal Junior Canadiens for three years , then spent his first professional season with Houston Apollos in the old CPHL before returning to Montreal where he would spend the entirety of his 12 - year NHL ( playing ) career .
I was a Habs hater in those days , and easily took a dislike of Lemaire and his obvious talent .
Reason had nothing to do with it , although he did provide plenty of " reasons " , most of which had to do with him popping big goals or making key plays to thwart my club du jour , defined as whoever was playing the Habs that night .
Lemaire ’s calling card at first was his powerful slapshot .
Let ’s let his legendary captain , Jean Beliveau , take up the story :
" In the 1968 season , the team was playing in Boston .
Since I had suffered a minor knee problem in New York the night before , I was sitting this game out in the press box .
At intermission , however , one of the trainers waved at me from the bench .
I went downstairs , and Larry Aubut said , " Toe just got kicked out of the game .
You ’re coaching . "
[ Note : No assistants in those days ! ]
" We were down 1 - 0 at that point , and the Bruins added another early in the second , before they took a penalty .
I ’d always wondered why Toe never put Jacques Lemaire on the point .
The rookie had the best slapshot on the team – hard , heavy , and accurate .
" Here ’s my chance to try out my theory , " I thought .
I sent him out on the point – and he promptly scored .
For the rest of the game Jacques was on the point for every power play .
We finally won 5 - 2 or 5 - 3 . "
-- Jean Beliveau , My Life in Hockey
The essential Hockey Summary Project verifies most of the major details of this story , although Le Gros Bill modestly understated the final score , which was 6 - 2 Habs .
It would be Beliveau ’s only game behind the bench ; at his retirement announcement three years later he stated " There are two jobs I do n’t want in hockey : coach and general manager . "
But in his one game he beat Bobby Orr ’s team , making a key strategic move while providing an odd link between two of the very few men who made the Hall of Fame as players but later became even more famous as coaches .
( My guess is that the crafty old coach , Blake , had likely thought of using Lemaire on the point but did n’t want to expose a rookie in a position where he might fail . )
Blake gradually worked the rookie into the line - up , and he finished his first season 8th in club scoring with 22 - 20 - 42 while crafting an impressive +15 .
Lemaire emerged as a major force in the playoffs , playing a key role as Montreal stormed to the Cup , losing just one game over three series .
Jacques scored a pair of goals in his second playoff game , a win over Boston .
In the Eastern Conference Final - whose winner was all but assured of taking the Cup - he scored the series - winning goal in overtime to eliminate the Blackhawks .
He followed up by scoring another overtime winner in the very next game , which of course was his first career Stanley Cup Finals game , in St. Louis against Scotty Bowman ’s Blues .
Lemaire wound up second on the Habs with 13 playoff points , just one behind linemate Yvan Cournoyer ; and tied the great Beliveau for the team lead with 7 goals .
The rookie was a leading Conn Smythe candidate , although ultimately the PHWA went another way and gave the award to losing finalist and respected veteran Glenn Hall .
Jacques Lemaire drinks from the Stanley Cup in 1968 .
After winning the first Cup of the expansion era , Blake retired .
Lemaire would win a second Cup under Claude Ruel and a third under Al MacNeil before Scotty Bowman took over the squad in 1971 .
The pair would enjoy 8 productive seasons together , and it would seem Jacques learned a thing or two hundred along the way .
Lemaire did n’t come with a built - in reputation as a great defensive stalwart , but it quickly became clear he was a very cerebral player with an uncanny knack of being in a good spot to thwart an attack .
Paired mostly with Cournoyer on his right wing , the duo had an assortment of portsiders over the years including the great veterans Dick Duff and Frank Mahovlich , the young Marc Tardif and the younger Murray Wilson .
The frequent combination of Lemaire between F.Mahovlich and Cournoyer was Montreal ’s first line in the early 70s , with each of the three playing a huge role in the Cup wins of 1971 and ’ 73 .
In ’71 Lemaire scored a memorable goal that turned around Game 7 of the SCF in Chicago Stadium , beating Tony Esposito with a booming slapshot from outside the blueline to cut a 2 - 0
Hawks lead in half and instantly put the fear of the devil in a Chicago Stadium crowd that had been loud and boisterous until that moment .
Minutes later Lemaire set up Henri Richard for the tying goal , and the Habs went on to steal the game and the Cup , 3 - 2 .
Lemaire posted a solid 19 points in the postseason , but this time the media saw fit to vote for a rookie , in fact a pre-rookie , Habs teammate Ken Dryden .
In 1972 - 73 Bowman ’s Habs hit their first peak , setting an NHL record with just 10 losses in a 78 - game schedule .
Lemaire led that squad in scoring with 44 goals and 95 points ( 4th and 5th in the league respectively ) , and led all NHL forwards with a +59 rating , yet was left off the end - of - season All - Star Team as voters preferred his more fearsome contemporaries Phil Esposito and Bobby Clarke at pivot .
Lemaire posted another 20 points in the playoffs , but lost out in Smythe voting to his linemate Cournoyer .
So it always seemed to go for # 25 .
Win the Cup , escape the limelight .
Gradually Montreal ’s veteran leadership core – Jean Beliveau , Henri Richard , Jacques Laperriere , J.C. Tremblay , Frank Mahovlich – retired or moved on to the WHA , passing the torch to the able hands of Lemaire , Cournoyer , Serge Savard , Guy Lapointe , and Pete Mahovlich .
Meanwhile a new generation of prodigious talent was bubbling underneath : Guy Lafleur , Steve Shutt , Larry Robinson , Bob Gainey , Mario Tremblay , Doug Risebrough , Doug Jarvis , and on and on .
By 1975 an awesome powerhouse was emerging .
I still hated the Habs , but the New Year ’s Eve game against Central Red Army would show them in a different light .
For one night they were perforce the good guys ; I saw a whole lot of the bleu , blanc et rouge Real good that night , Jacques Lemaire foremost among them .
From then on I found myself admiring and respecting Lemaire as a tremendous competitor and a master of the two - way art .
( Alas , I never did get to see him play a live game as his early retirement took him out of the NHL just as my Oilers were getting in . )
As he proved that New Year 's Eve , Lemaire 's game would have been ideal on the international stage .
Even as he was a private man who largely shunned the limelight , he was a proud competitor who was hurt by being overlooked for the great Team Canada squads of 1972 and 1976 .
Canada was always knee - deep in fine centres , but Lemaire 's omission from the Summit Series and the first Canada Cup was a puzzle .
Lemaire was a " glue " player , ready able and willing to play whatever role was needed to help the team win .
He described his own game this way in a 1981 interview with Michael Farber ( hat tip Jonathan Willis at Hockey or Die ) :
" I was appreciated … by people who liked my style .
And I was hated by other people .
A group of persons go to the games to see Lafleur and Gretzky .
There ’s another group that go to see Nilan fight .
And there are other people who go to study the game , to see who ’s doing his job and who is n’t .
I like to think those people appreciated me …
" I liked being second or third violin .
As long as the team was doing great , that was my main purpose .
I was happy .
Satisfied . "
That team did better than great .
They posted regular season records of 59 - 10 - 11 ; 60 - 8 - 12 , and 58 - 11 - 11 over the next three seasons , scoring more than 2 goals for every 1 they allowed over that span .
In the playoffs they lost just 1 , 2 , and 3 games en route to the Cup .
Lafleur emerged as a dominant scorer , with Shutt a constant on his port side .
P. Mahovlich and Lemaire took turns as their centre as Bowman constantly tinkered with match - ups .
Mahovlich was ultimately traded in the fall of 1977 and Lemaire moved up to the top line on a full - time basis .
Lemaire ’s two - way game fit in nicely on any line and invariably complemented his linemates .
With Lafleur and Shutt he was effectively the middleman in a 2 - 1 - 2 , keying the transition game in the manner of cerebral Russian centres like Vladimir Petrov or later , Igor Larionov .
Through it all he continued to deliver offence in the crunch .
He scored key goals in the first two games of the sweep of the Flyers in the ' 76 SCF , including the late tying goal in Game 1 , then an unassisted shortie which broke a scoreless tie deep into Game 2 , both one - goal Montreal victories .
In the 1977 Finals he notched the game winner in three of the four games against the Bruins , scoring both goals including the overtime winner in Montreal 's 2 - 1 victory in Boston that clinched the Cup .
He finished the playoffs with 19 points in 14 games but linemate Lafleur won the Conn Smythe that time .
In 1977 - 78 Lemaire achieved a career high with 97 points , finishing fourth in league scoring .
Alas , besides Lafleur , the other two players who finished ahead of him were centres Bryan Trottier and Darryl Sittler , and yet again Lemaire was left on the sidelines when the post - season All - Star Team was announced .
He had to console himself with another new Stanley Cup ring .
By the 1978 - 79 season the Montreal dynasty started to show its first signs of wear .
The squad fell to a record of " just " 52 - 17 - 11 , and lost first overall by one point to the rising power that was the New York Islanders .
Lemaire missed 30 games to injury , but still mustered over 50 points , and over 200 shots on goal , for the 11th consecutive season .
He had plenty left for the post - season , which was arguably the best of his great career .
Lemaire scored 2 or more points in 6 of Montreal 's last 7 victories in those playoffs .
Among those was a key assist on the biggest goal of the playoffs , teeing up Lafleur 's powerplay marker that tied Game 7 of the semi-finals against Boston after the famous too - many - men penalty that essentially ended Don Cherry 's reign in Beantown .
Lemaire wrapped up the playoffs by scoring the Stanley Cup - winning goal against the Rangers , then scored the season 's final goal to clinch a 4 - 1 Habs triumph .
It was his 11th goal and 23rd point of the playoffs , enough to lead the NHL in both categories .
Yet checker Bob Gainey was the voters ' choice for the Conn Smythe Trophy .
Lemaire was now 33 years old , and seemed to have lots in the tank .
He had played 12 NHL seasons and finished an amazing 8 of them as a Stanley Cup champion .
He had scored at least 20 goals every season , averaging ~70 GP , 30 goals , 70 points , and +30 over those dozen regular seasons , with much more in the playoffs .
Astonishingly he had never received a major individual award from the NHL - no appearances on the All - Star Team , no Conn Smythe Trophy , not even a Lady Byng despite never taking as many as 30 PiM in a season .
And like that , poof , he was gone .
Lemaire accepted a job in the Swiss B League as a player - coach , and set his single - minded focus on coaching .
Ever the second violin , even his departure was overshadowed by those of Ken Dryden and Scotty Bowman .
Deprived of three key contributors still in their prime , Les Glorieux remained a fine hockey team , but the dynasty was over .
Lemaire took an unconventional route back to the NHL - Europe , US College , then major junior - but within five years was Montreal 's head coach , leading them to a surprise Conference Final .
After stepping down a year later , he was part of the management team as the Habs won the Cup in 1986 and 1993 , but left the organization for good that summer ( and they have n't won since ) .
Lemaire went on to coaching success in New Jersey , winning the Stanley Cup in 1995 , his eleventh such triumph in various capacities .
He was ( in ) famous for his defensive tactics , particularly the widely - reviled Neutral Zone Trap , but managed to mould such players as Sergei Brylin , Brian Rolston , and even Bobby Carpenter into low - PiM checkers , opportunistic counterattackers , and ultimately into champions .
While playoff success would largely elude him after 1995 , his teams in Jersey and Minnesota won four Jennings Trophies over the years for fewest goals against , just as his Habs teams had won six Vezina Trophies ( also for fewest goals against back in the day ) during his playing days .
Jacques Lemaire had a great offensive mind for the game , but his calling card was defence .
For the lion 's share of the last 43 years , he always seemed to combine the two in an effective package that resulted in outscoring , and winning .
In 1984 , just as he was beginning his second NHL career as a coach , a new group of voters made amends for a dozen years of omission when Jacques Lemaire was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame .
It was an honour he rightfully earned by virtue of being one of the finest hockey players of his generation .
In years after , the PHWA finally nodded his way , twice voting him the Jack Adams Trophy for his coaching acumen .
Thus Lemaire retires a venerated , no - longer - underrated elder of the sport .
He also retires a winner on the international stage , having at long last been given his opportunity to represent Team Canada , as an associate coach in Vancouver 2010 ; with typically little fanfare he also - typically did his part to help his team win the big one .
I for one wish Jacques a happy retirement because he 's earned it after a lifetime of dedication to the game .
Jacques Lemaire holds no NHL records , save one : he is one of six players to score two Stanley Cup - winning goals .
The others ?
Mike Bossy , Bobby Orr , Henri Richard , Jean Beliveau , and one Hector " Toe " Blake .

In last five days , social gaming users have contributed $ 1.5 million to Haitian earthquake relief
Facebook users playing Zynga games have donated more than $ 1.5 million over just the past five days to aid the Haitian relief effort .
About 300,00 users from 47 countries have purchased enough limited edition virtual goods via Zynga 's top four games on Facebook -- FarmVille , FishVille , Mafia Wars and Zynga Poker -- to make this massive contribution to the U.N. World Food Programme ( WFP ) .
FarmVille users alone donated $ 1 million .
" Through their donations , Zynga players are helping us to bring urgently needed food assistance to people who have been plunged into hunger by this devastating earthquake , " said Nancy Roman , WFP director of communications .
" We started distributing food within 24 hours of the earthquake , and in the coming weeks , we aim to deliver weekly rations to 2 million people . "
Zynga had run a similar effort in 2009 called Sweet Seeds for Haiti , in which users raised $ 1.2 million to bring school lunches to Haitian children .
In that program , just 50 % of profits from limited edition virtual good sales went towards the effort .
Reports say that the social gaming company , whose games see 227 million monthly active users , had reached upwards of $ 200 million in 2009 revenue .
If revenues on the limited edition virtual goods were to be annualized , Zynga would be making at least $ 109 million annually , according to Business Insider .
The donations program is still on - going , but already Zynga has once again demonstrated the power social networking has in bringing people together for causes .

Eating out in Huntsville , Alabama exposes the CrossFitter to a harsh world with no regard for balanced carbohydrate / protein portions or quality foods .
However , you can successfully zone at almost any restaurant if you understand the Zone diet and are willing to make a couple special requests .
You wo n’t have a perfect weighed and measured 4 block zone dinner like you could prepare at home , and your food quality absolutely will not be up to Paleo standards , but you ’ll be close enough that an occasional lunch with friends wo n’t derail your body composition and fitness goals .
While the following meals are the exception to the rule , and would n’t provide great results if eaten multiple times per day , they will serve you well in moderation .
I repeat , most of these choices are not perfect , but they are pretty damn good , which is good enough for me .
1. Lamb Salad at Tazikis Greek Fare
This favorite of mine combines zone friendly portions with mostly Paleo ingredients .
Grilled lamb is served in approximately 1 oz slices for easy zoning .
It also features high - quality carbs such as spinach and lettuce in the salad , tomatoes , peppers , and onions .
It also includes some Feta cheese for extra taste and protein .
For a tasty and quality fat source you can either go with the standard dressing served with the salad , or ask for Skordalia , a hummus - like sauce .
Only eat the small pieces of toasted pita bread if you ca n’t fully get your carb blocks from the vegetables .

2. Grilled Chicken on the Barbie at Outback
This is normally served with rice and grilled veggies .
Ask for no rice and extra grilled veggies .
Whether you choose chicken or steak , both will arrive in bite sized portions that are easy to eyeball into zone blocks .
I always ask for the chicken plain with just house seasoning as it comes glazed with bbq sauce .
The grilled veggies taste great– a little too great– so I ’m almost sure some type of light sugary glaze is applied to them during cooking , however you can also ask for fresh steamed brocolli ( minus the butter ) or asparagus .
The double portion of grilled veggies should be enough for up to a 4 block meal .
I do n’t generally add fat because I ’m sure enough butter was used during cooking to comprise my fat blocks , unless you opted to skip the butter , and you can always ask for butter on the side so you are in control .
Skip the bread completely .
Better yet , tell your server you do n’t want any , so he wo n’t even bring it to the table .

3. Curry Dishes at [ Insert Favorite Thai Restaurant Here ]
The difficulty with Thai food is that it ’s almost always served with rice .
I zone Thai food by ordering curry dishes that are essentially just stir - fry meat over vegetables .
I find that Masaman Beef and Cashew Chicken work well .
Then I eat very , very small portions of rice .
I actually dip the meat into the rice and just eat whatever rice sticks to it .
Rice is an insanely dense carb , so tread lightly .
Peanuts and cashews are an excellent part of many
Thai dishes that provide a quality fat source .
If you need some extra fat and protein content then order some chicken coconut soup .
4. Fajitas at Cantina Laredo
This fajita dish is great to eat as a cheat , complete with flour tortillas galore , but it ’s also completely zoneable and enough to share between two people .
Using quality carbs in this meal will be difficult unless you special order some vegetables .
The salsa and diced tomatoes are the closest you ’ll find to quality carbs .
However , you can request corn tortillas instead of flour to make zoning easier .
Corn tortillas are 1/2 block per tortilla compared to 1 block per tortilla for flour .
This meal also has a large variety of quality protein to pick from : chicken or beef , or depending on your daily block requirements you can do go for the combination .
You can also get quality fat from the guacamole .

5. Ginger Chicken with Brocolli at P.F. Chang’s
P.F. Chang ’s has a surprisingly affordable lunch menu , and they even have a gluten free menu now .
The Ginger Chicken and Brocolli is my favorite .
Most dishes are served with rice , you can always sub for veggies or you can now substitute with quinoa !
I ’ve found they generally include about 2 blocks of brocolli .
The chicken has a light ginger glaze that will add some carb blocks if you decide to leave it on .
I usually scrape it off and go with “ fat replacement ” where I substitute extra fat blocks for missing carbs .
I get my fat blocks ( and probably more than necessary ) from the egg drop soup that is also on their gluten free menu as well .

6. Grande Latte at Starbucks
OK , it ’s not a meal , but it ’s commonly available , quite tasty , and it ’s really not that bad .
A grande latte is actually a pretty zone - balanced 2 - block snack with 18g of carbs , 12g of protein , and 7g of fat .
Yeah , it ’s just a shade protein light and fat heavy , but as long as you are n’t drinking seven per day then you ’ll probably be OK .
A tall size is approximately a 1.5 - block snack .
I like to order the half - caffeinated version to lessen any dependence on caffeine for energy .
If you decide to start adding sugary syrups for mochas and other variations , understand that you ’re overshooting on carbs .
This wo n’t hurt you too badly if the rest of your diet is in check , but be aware of it .

7. Cobb Salad at Steak Out
This has a bunch of quality ingredients : lean meat ( chicken or beef ) , hardboiled egg , shredded cheese , lettuce , and tomatoes .
The portions are a little carb - light , but you can make up the missing carbs in additional fat content from some light ranch or bleu cheese dressing .
The cubed ham and bacon bits are a little fatty , pushing this meal way over the recommended fat content .
If you want to be strict you could delete the cubed ham and ask for a double order of chicken or steak ( which is n’t very expensive ) , but the numbers actually come out pretty close if you use the extra fat content as carb replacement .
Either way , this is a good choice that ’s drastically superior to anything served with a baked potato .
It ’s about a 4 - 5 block meal .

8 . Any burger customized at SmashBurger
At SmashBurger you can build your own of pretty much any menu item .
Instead of a traditional bun you can sub for a lettuce bun or gluten free bun .
You also have your choice of a traditional beef patty , grilled chicken or even a black - bean patty .
Instead of traditional lettuce you can have spinach for a high quality carb .
You can also add quality fat by adding avocado or guacamole .
They even have the option to add a fried egg to any burger which will give you your protein blocks .

9. Tacos Al Carbon at Rosie ’s Cantina
This soft taco dish puts fajita style beef into three soft tortillas along with a few sauteed onions and vegetables .
It ’s similar to fajitas , only the fajitas are already made for you .
You can ask for corn tortillas to lower your carb blocks , but the fact is that you ’re not really getting any quality carbs from a Mexican restaurant , so just focus on quantity and make the best of the situation .
Guacamole is provided as a decent fat source .
I estimate this is about a 4 - 5 block meal that is just a shade protein light and plenty fat heavy .
No online menu or nutritional information available , and they ’re closed on Sundays .
Boo !
10 . Pulled Pork Barbecue at [ Insert Favorite BBQ Restaurant Here ]
These last few options are certainly not ideal , as they provide almost zero quality carbs .
However , if you ’re just trying to stay in the zone between “ clean ” meals then pulled pork barbecue can work .
This is easy : order a pulled pork plate , eyeball your protein blocks from the meat , apply 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce per block for your carbs , and ignore everything else on the plate .
Yes , throw away the roll .
Just throw it away .
If you like you can cut a little barbecue sauce and have some baked beans .
Still not a great option , but slightly better than getting all your carbs from sugar and tomato juice in the barbecue sauce .
If you were to eat the above meals 5 times a day as your regular routine , then you would undoubtedly get very slow , if not downright poor results .
However , this is somewhat of a “ best of the worst ” list , kind of like a Garth Brooks greatest hits album .
Eating out is never going to be extremely zone friendly .
Restaurants partially compete on taste , and most of the world is willing to ignore everything else such that restaurants will do anything to make a dish taste better .
However , you can survive an occasional lunchtime jaunt with a little bit of thought and planning .

A wealth of classic literature lives on the internet — in Google Books — and it 's free to anyone who can find it .
The Google database contains a massive library of scanned books from the collections of public and academic libraries .
Google Book Search is a useful tool for finding these books according to a keyword or phrase search .
Google searches the content of the books as well as titles and other metadata , so you can search for snippets , passages , and quotes .
Sometimes , you can find whole books that you can add to your own library and read on your phone or tablet .
Only books with specific permissions can be downloaded for free , which usually means the books are old enough that they belong in the public domain .
Some modern books are offered as an introduction to a series , too .
Books with intact copyrights are available only for preview or , in some cases , for purchase in the Google Play Store .
The amount of a book you can preview varies from just a citation to the entire book , depending on the agreement Google has with the publisher .
You can go directly to Google Books and find books to download for free .
You 'll need an author , genre , title , or some other descriptive term to enter into the search engine .
The process is intuitive :
Go to Google Books ( not Google Play ) .
Search for a descriptive term , such as " Chaucer " or " Wuthering Heights . "
After Google returns the search results , click on Tools in the menu above the search results .
You should see the ​ Tools menu appear at the top of the search results .
Click on the option that says Any Books .
Change it to Free Google eBooks in the drop - down menu to narrow the search results .

If you prefer to download the book as a PDF , go to the Settings cog icon and select Download PDF .
Some of the books in the search results are n't going to be classic or even public domain books ; some are just books someone wrote and wants to distribute for free on Google Books , whether forever or for only a few hours .
Read the description that appears with each of the books in the search results list for more details .
You can adjust the Any time option in the ​ Tools menu to find only older works to exclude modern commentaries .
If you 're not interested in reading a full book and just want to find out some information , you can use the Tools menu to restrict your search to books with an available preview by selecting Preview available in the Any time drop - down menu .
That filter also shows free ebooks because they always include full previews .

Many people were relieved when they saw how mild the 2001 recession was — in fact it did n't even technically count as a recession since there were not two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP — although 3 out of 5 quarters after the second quarter of 2000 saw a falling GDP .
Of course , given how lousy the labor market has been since then most people still feel that the economic downturn was a lot sharper than those numbers would indicate , and that the following expansion was a lot slower than the ofiicial numbers would indicate .
Still , given the bursting of the great stock market bubble of the late 1990s , the 2001 recession was indeed surprisingly mild even if the official numbers underestimate its severity somewhat .
Compared to Japan in the 1990s and even more so America in the 1930s , America today has seemingly absorbed the bursting of a stock market bubble seemingly well .
Or have the problems simply been mostly postponed ?
There are some bright spots in the American economy .
The corporate sector is looking much stronger than it looked in the late 1990s .
For one thing , after - tax corporate profits adjusted for capital depreciation are at a record level , 6.2 % of GDP .
Corpoarate financial savings are back at the levels they were before the bubble economy of the late 1990s , at roughly - 2 % of GDP .
Corporate debt is still at historically high levels at 65 % of GDP , but the debt burden has fallen somewhat since its 2001 peak and is actually no higher than the peak of the former cyclical peak in 1990 .
All in all , the corporate sector looks pretty healthy , which means that business investment will likely rise from its currently relatively low levels especially since the cost of capital is fairly low , reflecting low interest rate and stock market valuations that are still well above the historic average .
( They are however far lower during the late 1990s and early 2000 . )
The recovery in business investment is , however , likely to be limited somewhat by the low level of capacity utilization .
The government sector has , under the presidency of George W. Bush , seen its financial balance weaken to its worst levels since his father was president .
Including state and local governments , the total government deficit are at roughly 4.5 % of GDP compared to the surplus of 1.3 % of GDP in 2000 .
Many Bush apologists argue that this deficit has helped households and companies improve their balance sheets and thus enabled them to avoid drastic spending cuts which would have created a recession .
This is to some extent true .
While this has also created the unprecedented situation that the current account deficit has increased during a recessionary period from 4.4 % of GDP in 2000 to 5.7 % of GDP in the second quarter of this year , the private sector financial deficit has been reduced from 5.7 % of GDP in 2000 to 1.2 % now .
That is , however , still weaker than anytime before the bubble economy in the late 1990s .
Typically the private sector has a large financial surplus during recessions ( reflecting budget deficits and a balanced current account ) and roughly balanced financial savings during booms .
But now the private sector has a weaker financial savings than it ever had before during booms which will strongly limit its ability to increase spending .
As we shall see , this reflects not corporate overinvestment but the disappearance of household savings because of the housing bubble .
Moreover , the budget deficit only means that the government is borrowing for the private sector , masking the real overspending .
In time there will have to be spending cuts and / or tax increases to curb the deficit .
This means that the government sector is likely to be a continued drag on the economy , inhibiting improvement of corporate and household balance sheets from current levels .
But the sector that poses the biggest threat to the economy is the household sector which is spending and borrowing at an unsustainable level .
The household savings rate which in the early 1980s was more than 10 % of disposable income is now only 1 % which is a record low and actually somewhat lower than when the stock market bubble reached its peak .
At the same time household debt has risen steadily , from roughly 65 % of disposable income in the early 1980s to 80 % in the early 1990s to 95 % in 2000 to 114 % in the second quarter of this year .
In particular , mortgage debt has risen very fast .
Mortgage debt has doubled relative to disposable income since the early 1980s from just over 40 % to 85 % today .
Record low savings and record high debt levels means that there is a substantial risk of a downturn in the household sector .
In a recent speech , Alan Greenspan tries to downplay the risk of a collapse in the household sector by saying that not only was household debt at a record high , but household assets were also at historically high levels .
The partially deflated stock market bubble has lowered the total household assets to income value somewhat from the historic highs reached in early 2000 , but it is still far higher than in the early 1980s .
Household assets have risen from roughly 500 % of disposable income in the early 1980s , to 570 % in the early 1990s to 730 % at the height of the stock market bubble .
Now it stands at 660 % .
While the rise in asset values until 2000 was mostly a result of the recovery of stock prices from the depressed levels in the early 1980s to the extremely overvalued levels in 2000 , in recent years the stock market bubble has deflated to a high extent , while a new bubble , this time in housing prices has appeared .
There are , however , several problems with Greenspan 's view that household indebtness really does n't matter because asset values have risen too .
First of all , it is in most cases different households which have huge assets and which have high indebtedness so for many households leverage is very high despite the seemingly low total debt to asset ratios .
Second , given the fact that leverage is at record high levels and given nonexistent net savings from income , households will be much more vulnerable to asset price changes than ever before .
And third , there is always a great risk that asset values will decline , even while debt levels are fixed .
Particularly worrisome is the high leverage in the housing market .
Housing prices have risen sharply in recent years with household real estate asset values rising from the 135 % to 150 % ( With a temporary peak of 155 % in 1989 ) range of disposable income that it used to fluctuate within until 2000 , to a record 184 % of disposable income .
But even as housing values have risen sharply , housing debt has risen even faster .
In the early 1980s , home mortgage debt was less than a third of the total housing value .
By the mid-1990s this had risen to more than 40 % and now it stands at 45 % .
Again , since housing values have risen this means housing debt to income has more than doubled from slightly above 40 % in the early 1990s to 85 % today .
Alan Greenspan tried to put a positive spin on this by saying this meant that three fourths of all households have less than 80 % leveraged .
Yet this means that if housing prices fall back to their historical mean at slightly above 140 % of disposable income , meaning a decline of house prices of more than 20 % , then one fourth of all home owners would have their home equity wiped out and in many cases go bankrupt .
And since this has been a credit driven price boom there is no evidence that the relative housing price increases really reflect an increase in the subjective value of housing from the general population .
This means that there is a very strong likelihood of an eventual price correction back to the price range that existed for decades until just a few years ago .
And with a savings rate near zero and a quarter of home owners leveraged to a level which would wipe out their entire housing equity this would mean a financial crisis deeper than the one associated with the stock market bubble .
And this time , unlike after the stock market bubble , the Federal Reserve has very little room to reduce interest rates further as interest rates are negative in real terms and historically very low in nominal terms , and the Federal government has very little room for further fiscal stimulus with a historically very high budget deficit .
Nor is the help likely to come from abroad .
To be sure , the dollar is almost certain to fall in value which would help export industries and domestic companies which compete with imports , but that will weaken the Asian and European economies as will the likely recession in the United States .
This will substantially weaken the world economy making strong U.S. export growth unlikely despite the falling dollar .
One mystery surrounding the current situation is the near record low long - term interest rates with the 10 - year government bond hovering at around 4 % .
With a huge budget deficit , record low household savings rate , a housing bubble and an investment recovery , one would expect high interest rates .
Are the low interest rates because of low inflation ?
No , while inflation is far below the levels of the 1970s it is not really that low .
If you look at real interest rates you 'll find that they are at historically very low levels .
Is it because massive money supply increases have pushed real interest rates below their natural level ?
No , the money supply is increasing at a far slower rate than it has been for many years .
So what is the cause of the low interest rates responsible for the current unsustainable situation ?
The answer is the massive purchases of U.S. government bonds by Asian central banks , particularly the Bank of China and the Bank of Japan .
During the first half of this year foreign central banks bought more than $ 201 billion of U.S. assets , $ 180 billion of which was U.S. government bonds .
This means that foreign central banks financed more than 60 % of the U.S. current account deficit and nearly the entire increase in government debt .
It might seem strange that they are so interested in buying such low - yielding securities as U.S. government bonds .
But the reason why they do it is because they want to avoid a sharp increase in the value of their currencies against the dollar , which would deal a heavy blow against their export industries .
But this is in itself an unsustainable situation .
Their increasing purchases of U.S. assets make them increasingly vulnerable to heavy losses if the dollar falls , but the increasing U.S. current account deficit forces them to increase their purchases to prevent their currencies from rising .
The longer this unsustainable process is allowed to continue the heavier losses that will be inflicted on both sides .
Only if either Asian countries accept a sharp appreciation of their currencies or if the U.S. adopts a much tighter monetary and / or fiscal policies can the situation be prevented from getting worse .
But as both solutions would create temporary downturns in the world economy , it is doubtful that the politicians in either Asia or the United States will be willing to face up to them .
The conclusion is that Alan Greenspan and George W. Bush did not prevent the stock market bubble of the late 1990s from turning into a crisis .
They only postponed it .

U.S. federal government orders 5,600 hybrids , first 100 Chevy Volts [ Update ]
President Obama announced today that the federal government has placed fleet orders for 5,600 hybrid vehicles - more than doubling the number of hybrids currently in the federal fleet .
Obama also said that the government will purchase the first 100 Volts possible when they go on sale early next year .
The news of the government 's large hybrid order comes just days before the National Highway Traffic Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency pass a joint final ruling establishing new , stricter emissions and fuel economy standards on automakers .
According to the Detroit News , the federal government has placed an order for 5,600 new hybrid vehicles to replace traditional gas - powered vehicles in its aging fleet .
According to Obama , the government 's order will be effectively " doubling the number of hybrid vehicles in the federal fleet , even as we seek to reduce the number of cars and trucks used by our government overall .
We 're going to lead by example and practice what we preach : cutting waste , saving energy and reducing our reliance on foreign oil . "
In addition to ordering 5,600 hybrid vehicles , the Obama administration also announced that the government will be purchasing approximately 100 Chevy Volts next year .
Aside from identifying the 100 Volts , the administration has not identified the make or model for the remaining hybrids to be purchased .
Obama 's announcement comes one day before NHTSA and the EPA are set to finalize an increase in standards that will directly affect automakers .
The new regulations will increase standards for greenhouse gas emissions , as well as increase corporate average fuel economy standards for light - duty vehicles for model years 2012 - 2016 .
The new regulations are expected to cost automakers $ 60 billion just over the next five years , but will boost fleet - wide fuel economy to 34.1 mpg in the same time period .
The changes in fuel - economy standards are expected to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 950 million metric tons and reduce oil consumption by 1.8 billion barrels over the complete lifetime of the vehicles , according to NHTSA .

Boobquake , a day of action that calls on women worldwide to dress scandalously and prove wrong an Iranian cleric who blames natural disasters on immodest cleavage , has started disastrously , news.com .au reported Monday .
At 11 am ( local time ) , a 6.9 magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan , no doubt causing thousands of Boobquake fans to hastily button up .
MORE ABOUT BOOBQUAKE DAY
Although Boobquake founder Jennifer McCreight , of Indiana . , has claimed that the quake does not count because it happened outside her Boobquake time zone , she admitted on her blog that the wobble was significant , but not unusual .
“ On avg , 134 magnitude 6 - 6.9 earthquakes occur annually , ” she wrote on her Twitter feed , before following it up on her blog with : “ If we get many of a similar magnitude in the next 24 hours , we might start worshipping the power of immodesty . ”
Blogger McCreight called on women to show as much cleavage as possible on Monday in order to prove Iranian cleric Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi wrong for claiming that promiscuous women were responsible for causing earthquakes .
“ Many women who do not dress modestly … lead young men astray , corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society , which ( consequently ) increases earthquakes , ” Sedighi said last week .
Meanwhile “ saddened ” by the frivolousness of Boobquake , a new Facebook group is calling for “ Brainquake , ” a day for women to “ show off their resumes , CVs , honors , prizes , and accomplishments . ”
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide whether the First Amendment requires that the names of people who sign ballot - initiative petitions be kept secret .
As in the court ’s decision on Wednesday to block the broadcasting of the trial of a challenge to a ban on same - sex marriage in California , the appeal was brought by opponents of such unions who said they feared harassment should their views be made widely known .
The new case arose from an effort to overturn a Washington State domestic partnership law known as the “ everything but marriage ” act .
Opponents of the law gathered more than 130,000 signatures , enough to place a referendum on the November ballot .
Several groups asked the state to turn over the names , under its public records law , and two groups said they intended to post the names on the Internet .
Their goal , according to a news release , was to encourage conversations among friends , relatives and neighbors that “ can be uncomfortable for both parties . ”

Sure , you knew teenagers sent a lot of text messages .
But did you know that among American teen texters , half send more than 50 text messages a day , and a full third send approximately 100 text messages a day ?
That 's the news today from the Pew Research Center , which has published a long study on the texting habits – we 're tongue - tied , too – of America 's most text - happy teenagers .
Just so we 're all on the same page : Researchers are not saying that a third of all American teens send 100 text messages a day .
In fact , a substantial portion of US teenagers do n't send any text messages at all .
Zip. Zilch .
Nada .
The Pew statistic comes from a somewhat smaller pool : the 88 percent of American teens who text regularly .
So what does the study say about the nation 's top teen texters ?
Well , for one , we now have proof that the fingers of many teenage girls are bonded to their keypads .
According to the Pew Research Center , 14 - to 17 - year - old girls are the most active texters , often sending 3,000 text messages a month .
Let 's do some quick math .
Say it takes about 30 seconds to send a text message .
At 3,000 text messages , these girls are spending 25 hours a month texting .
We 're getting tired just thinking about it .
Then , of course , there 's the 2009 LG US National Texting Champion , Kate Moore , who admits to sending 14,000 texts a month .
In other news , it turns out your mom really is more than happy to click through your sent message list .

A Brief Report On The Finances of The World - Controlling Atheist Cabal
I recently had the pleasure of dealing with a very polite young woman who wanted to give me a flyer about a presentation by Eric Hovind , son of the more ( in ) famous Kent Hovind .
A snippet of our conversation went something like this :
Me : Has this been experimentally demonstrated ?
Her : Oh , yes .
Me : Can you give me the publication history where I can find this information ?
Her : Actually , the atheist organizations do n’t want us to publish it .
As may be divined through careful astrology , the conversation went downhill from there .
It did give me some ideas , though , that struck me as interesting enough to research further .
Presuming she meant that the atheist organizations were preventing them from publishing their information in an academic journal , a resource disparity between creation scientists and atheist organizations should be pretty apparent and easy to identify , and it should favor the atheist organizations .
Specifically in the case of non-profit agencies , GuideStar.org should be able to easily find the 990 forms and give us the revenues of the more significant players ( revenue in this case being used as a measure of public support and / or interest ) .
In many ways the Discovery Institute ’s often - found publicity of intelligent design has secured it as the foremost organization interested in doing so .
Their GuideStar page can be found here , though a free registration is required to view the 990 form .
For expediency ’s sake , the 2007 990 form ( line 12 ) says that the Discovery Institute took in a total of $ 4,256,588 .
( We ’re using 2007 because GuideStar as of yet does not have their 2008 form . )
According to GuideStar , the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science took in $ 308,546 for the 2007 fiscal year .
A clear difference is at work here , but it is precisely the opposite of the lady ’s claims .
On a purely financial level , intelligent design has Dawkins outfinanced by an astounding $ 3,948,042 .
However this comparison is n’t quite fair – one would hypothetically donate to the Discovery Institute if they liked intelligent design as a concept , while the RDFRS would receive funds from those who specifically support Richard Dawkins ’s drive to promote , well , reason and science through this foundation .
Is there some other , more general , evolutionary foundation that might be better able to match the Discovery Institute ’s general mandate ?
In fact there is .
The Evolution Society , chaired by Charles Fenster , a biologist at the University of Maryland , seems to have a general enough mandate — the “ STUDY AND PROMOTION OF EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES . ”
According to GuideStar , in 2007 it took in $ 416,980 .
The Discovery Institute thus has them out - financed by $ 3,839,608 .
The financial situation really ca n’t get much clearer .
Atheists are being outspent quite well , or at least those groups are .
It ’s also worth noting that the Discovery Institute spent over $ 3 million on “ program services ” in 2007 , more than either of the two atheist organizations made during that same period .
It strikes me , though , that this comment about atheist organizations blocking intelligent design publishing attempts is actually sort of a reverse compliment .
If the Pew Foundation ’s breakdown of American religious affiliations is correct , 1.6 % of Americans self - identify as atheists while 78.4 % identify as Christian .
The Census Bureau estimates that the 2009 US population was 307,006,550 people .
Presuming the Pew Foundation ’s percentages hold true for 2009 , there were roughly 240,693,135.2 people who would identify themselves as Christian in 2009 in the United States , and 4,912,104.8 people identifying themselves as atheist .
Presuming this woman ’s logic to be correct , one atheist is therefore capable of stopping 49 Christians from publishing things about intelligent design .
At last , a believable sighting of that peace president many of us thought we had elected .
Give Barack Obama credit , big time , for the startling progress he has made in tempering the threat of nuclear annihilation .
The Obama administration ’s Nuclear Posture Review Report for the first time prohibits “ first use ” of nuclear weapons against nations complying with the nonproliferation treaty .
It also pledges a halt to U.S. efforts to modernize such weapons , as had been proposed by then - President George W. Bush in his call for new nuclear “ bunker busters . ”
Whereas his predecessor succeeded only in eliminating the nonexistent Iraqi nukes , this president has forged a treaty with the Russians that will reduce the world ’s supply of the devil ’s weapons by one - third .
But it was essential to follow that up with a clear departure from the always - insane policy that the U.S. has a right to develop and use such weapons as conventional tools of war .
That is the right that Harry Truman acted on in perpetrating the most atrocious act of terrorism in world history when he annihilated the civilian populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
That is what spawned the nuclear arms race that so troubles us today , especially regarding North Korea and Iran .
Yet until Tuesday no American president had renounced the immoral claim that our nation had some God - granted right to use those weapons again .
While we consistently insisted it was morally repugnant for any other state to follow in our footsteps , we continued to build ever deadlier versions of these intrinsically heinous weapons .
But that madness ended when Obama on Tuesday affirmed an all - important distinction that Bush , more than any other president , had insisted on blurring — the distinction between nuclear and all other weapons , including the chemical and biological varieties .
Lumping them together as weapons of mass destruction denies the global life - ending threat that nukes alone present .
Ironically , the most important section of Obama ’s strategy statement , instantly attacked by his knee - jerk critics , could help fulfill the penultimate goal of Ronald Reagan .
Because of Obama ’s declaration that the “ United States will not develop new nuclear warheads … or provide for new [ nuclear ] military capabilities ” there is now a plausible case to be made for anti-missile defense .
Reagan always insisted that his Strategic Defense Initiative program was a means toward nuclear arms cuts and ultimately the abolition of these horrific implements of mass death .
But SDI could be properly criticized as a cover for aggression unless we cut the arsenals as opposed to refining and expanding them .
In his historic meeting with then - Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev , Reagan embraced the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons — just as Obama did in his April 2009 speech in Prague .
It is a position that commends itself to all who honestly confront the threat these weapons pose to human existence .
We have indulged the luxury of not confronting that ultimate horror because of the time that has passed since the explosion of those now relatively small nuclear bombs over Japan .
As Henry Kissinger puts it in the documentary “ Nuclear Tipping Point , ” which was screened at the White House on Tuesday night : “ Once nuclear weapons are used , we will be driven to take global measures to prevent it .
Why do n’t we do it now ? ”
The answer is that we have become inured to the danger and lulled into accepting these weapons as usable implements of war , an attitude reflected in Tuesday ’s reaction by Arizona Republican Sens .
Jon Kyle and John McCain , who in a joint statement denounced Obama ’s policy as limiting the nuclear “ option . ”
They repeated the old canard that nuclear weapons are a legitimate choice in response to a non-nuclear threat .
That will be the line of those who oppose the Senate ’s ratification of the new START agreement with Russia and the long - overdue passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty .
If they win in that debate there is no serious possibility of progress in preventing the further proliferation of nuclear weapons and breaking the death wish of those who still toy with the idea that such weapons are legitimate .
Those in the peace movement who think Obama should have gone further in his efforts to put the nuke genie back in the bottle should tread carefully here .
Instead of demanding perfection , they should be gratified that we finally have a president who has at least laid down some important markers of progress .
After decades of both Republican and Democratic administrations indulging the absurdity that “ nuclear war fighting ” could have a humane outcome , Obama has reversed course .
It took 150 meetings , including 30 at the White House , and the president ’s frequent direct intervention .
The outcome is a bold statement of nuclear sanity , and for that President Obama should be applauded .
On Thursday , April 8 , Robert Scheer joined readers for a live chat to discuss this column .

Foreign ministers and aid groups leading the effort to help Haiti recover from the devastating earthquake met today for their first conference on how to channel aid into a country that has lost much of its already poor infrastructure .
Haiti's magnitude 7.0 earthquake on 12 January killed an estimated 200,000 people and left the poorest country in the western hemisphere virtually without a functioning government .
It wrecked the presidential palace , parliament , government ministries and the UN headquarters , among thousands of other structures .
The Haitian prime minister , Jean - Max Bellerive , told the Montreal conference that his government needed to rely strongly on its partners but said Haiti was able to lead the rebuilding effort .
" Haitians continue to work in precarious conditions but it is in the position to assume the leadership expected of it by its people in order to relaunch the country on the path to reconstruction , " he said .
However , Bellerive admitted the government was facing serious legitimacy issues as people question whether it exists at all .
The destruction of key government buildings has hampered the work of what was already a weak and inefficient state .
Bellerive said while Haiti needed help from abroad , it had to do more with less and work in a different fashion .
He said in the short term , it needed to help people with water , food and housing .
" The people of Haiti , the Haitian community , will need more and more and more in order to complete the task of reconstruction , " he said .
He said Haiti 's government had set up six groups to deal with issues such as humanitarian aid , housing and security .
He said each group was being led by a minister as well as an international party .
But the Italian government official who led the country 's response to the L'Aquila earthquake condemned the relief efforts in Haiti as a disorganised " vanity parade " .
Guido Bertolaso , the head of Italy 's civil protection service , said there had been a fundamental lack of leadership thus far in foreign aid missions to Haiti , warning also that the large US military mission in the country was not entirely helpful .
" The Americans are extraordinary , but when you are facing a situation in chaos they tend to confuse military intervention with emergency aid , which cannot be entrusted to the armed forces , " Reuters reported him as saying .
Italy 's foreign minister , Franco Frattini , swiftly distanced the government from Bertolaso 's comments .
He had " attacked American and international organisations head on .
The Italian government does not share these statements , " Frattini said .
The Canadian prime minister , Stephen Harper , and ministers from more than a dozen countries , eight international bodies and six major non-governmental organisations attended the conference .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , told reporters that international donors and organisations had been mapping out a plan for Haiti development for months before the quake .
She indicated it could be the basis for a revised plan .
" I do n't want to start from scratch , but we have to recognise the changed challenges that we are now confronting , " she said .
Governments have pledged nearly $ 1bn ( £ 616 m ) in aid to Haiti , according to an Associated Press estimate .
Today 's meeting came as a global army of aid workers was delivering more food into people 's hands in Haiti , but the efforts were still falling short .
Paul Conneally , spokesman for the International Red Cross , said there was a growing need to bring in heavy equipment to take down damaged buildings , some of which could collapse at the slightest aftershock .
LIMA ( Reuters ) - A huge glacier broke off and plunged into a lake in Peru , causing a 75 - foot ( 23 - meter ) tsunami wave that swept away at least three people and destroyed a water processing plant serving 60,000 local residents , government officials said on Monday .
The ice block tumbled into a lake in the Andes on Sunday near the town of Carhuaz , some 200 miles north of the capital , Lima .
Three people were feared buried in debris .
Investigators said the chunk of ice from the Hualcan glacier measured 1,640 feet by 656 feet .
“ This slide into the lake generated a tsunami wave , which breached the lake ’s levees , which are 23 meters high -- meaning the wave was 23 meters high , ” said Patricio Vaderrama , an expert on glaciers at Peru ’s Institute of Mine Engineers .
Authorities evacuated mountain valleys , fearing more breakages .
It was one of the most concrete signs yet that glaciers are disappearing in Peru , home to 70 percent of the world ’s tropical icefields .
Scientists say warmer temperatures will cause them to melt away altogether within 20 years .
In 1970 , not far from Carhuaz , an earthquake triggered an avalanche of ice , rock and mud on the mountain of Huascaran that buried the town of Yungay , killing more than 20,000 people who lived below Peru ’s tallest peak , which sits 22,204 feet above sea level .
When security vendors used to pitch articles on smart phone malware , my blood ran cold .
The first such story I wrote , in 2004 , was about a proof - of - concept virus that could infect smart phones used by a super minority of people .
Each year on , I did the occasional interview about smart phone threats and the message was usually the same :
Attacks targeting phones was still a way off , but security pros need to start thinking about countermeasures .
( See Mikko Hypponen 's predictions from late 2008 as another example . )
Funny thing about threats that are a couple years away : Nobody really wants to think about what they'd do about it because they have plenty of clear and present dangers to deal with on desktops , laptops and all the other elements that encompass a traditional enterprise network .
The thought of new defenses comes only after the once - theoretical attack has hit the proverbial fan and landed right on top of some poor IT shop that 's caught unprepared .
Even when the iPhone came out a couple years ago , the conventional wisdom was that attacks remained in the distant future , because there were still too few users for the bad guys to waste their time .
That was then .
Today 's a different story .
Just about everyone has a smart phone now .
Most have a BlackBerry or an iPhone .
More have purchased the Android and a few other types .
Users now visit all the same dangerous Internet destinations they visit on their home computers and laptops .
They trade files and open e-mail attachments that may be infected .
They can be scammed out of their sensitive information , like credit - card and Social Security numbers .
With all this happening , the bad guys now have reason to shift their attention and create new flavors of mobile malware .
With so many of these devices hooked to company networks for access to e-mail and other programs , attacks on the phones can now be used to penetrate larger company systems .
In other words , it 's time for IT security practitioners to start paying attention and making plans .
There 's already plenty of evidence that trouble is afoot .
At the ShmooCon security conference in Washington D.C. a couple months ago , Trevor Hawthorn , founder and managing principal at Stratum Security , ran attendees through a series of specific weaknesses that could be used against iPhone users .
He discussed security holes ( since fixed ) found in AT&T 's network , which Apple 's iPhone uses , and how an epidemic of " jailbreaking " is disabling critical security controls on the device .
Jailbreaking is a process iPhone and iPod Touch users can exploit to run whatever code they want on the device , whether it 's authorized by Apple or not .
Jailbreaking the phone allows you to download a variety of apps you could n't get in the Apple App Store .
For those who hate Apple 's heavy hand and welcome any method to thumb a nose at the company 's decrees , jailbreaking is very attractive .
But there 's a problem , Hawthorn said .
A big one .
" Jailbreaking wipes away 80 percent of the iPhone 's security controls , " he said .
" Since nearly 7 percent of all iPhones are jailbroken , " the bad guys have plenty of targets to choose from . "
And target they have .
Exhibit A is the iKee worm .
According to an earlier analysis from security vendor Sophos , Apple iPhone owners in Australia were infected by a worm that changed their wallpaper to an image of 1980s pop crooner Rick Astley .
" The worm , which could have spread to other countries although we have no confirmed reports outside Australia , is capable of breaking into jailbroken iPhones if their owners have not changed the default password after installing SSH , " Sophos Senior security Consultant Graham Cluley wrote .
" Once in place , the worm appears to attempt to find other iPhones on the mobile phone network that are similarly vulnerable , and installs itself again
On each installation , the worm - written by a hacker calling themselves " ikex " - changes the lock background wallpaper to an image of Rick Astley with the message : ' iKee is never going to give you up . ' "
Also worrisome is that the bad guys can use the advanced map and GPS software on these devices to see exactly where a person is and where they are going .
From there , the cyber threat becomes a physical one .
One way the bad guys can target the phone user is through a game called " Underworld : SweetDeal , " a free location - based iPhone multi- player online game about trading controlled substances in the real world .
Hawthorn noted how players can use Google Maps to locate where other players are physically .
He found players in some interesting places through the course of his research .
He was able to track one player to a parking lot outside the headquarters of NSA .
Another player was tracked to a parking lot outside CIA headquarters .
" You can check a person 's movements because the game checks in on your device 's location regularly , " he said .
Google 's head of Android security also acknowledged in an interview with colleague Robert McMillan that phone attacks are upon us .
" The smartphone OS will become a major security target , " Android Security Leader Rich Cannings said .
Attackers can already hit millions of victims with a smartphone attack , and soon that number will be even larger .
" Personally I think this will become an epiphany to malware authors , " he said .
Then there 's the article my colleague Joan Goodchild recently wrote on all the apps people download onto their phones ( There 's an Insecure App for That ) .
In that article , security experts noted that mobile phones now have an application for almost everything , and that those apps leave the same basic security holes wide open .
There 's plenty of common - sense guidance for users on how to keep their phones secure .
Joan 's story lists five such tips
Tip 1 : Do n't forget basic security practices when it comes to mobile applications
Tip 2 : Consider the unique risks of mobile devices
Tip 3 : Do n't allow sharing of authentication information between sites
Tip 4 : Do n't expose line of business applications to your mobile workforce without the proper security in place .
Tip 5 : Take advantage of the security features that are available in each device when writing native apps
Good advice .
In the final analysis , the path to smart phone security is about the same as the security we 've gotten used to on the larger computing systems .
We simply must realize it 's something we can no longer ignore .
No group in America has been hit harder during the current recession than young adults .
Millions of Americans are graduating from college with virtually no money , lots of debt and with very dim employment prospects .
Those who do n’t go to college are even worse off .
All their lives these young Americans were taught if they studied hard , got an education and worked within the system that good jobs and the American Dream would be waiting for them .
But now millions of them are realizing that all of their studying and hard work is not providing them with the rewards that they always thought they would get .
This is causing large numbers of young American adults to become depressed and disillusioned .
In fact , record numbers of them are moving back in with their parents .
But without decent jobs , what are they supposed to do ?
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , in March the national rate of unemployment in the United States was 9.7 % , but for Americans younger than 25 it was 18.8 % .
In fact , according to a Pew Research Center study , approximately 37 % of all Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 have either been unemployed or underemployed at some point during the recession .
Things are even worse for those under the age of 20 .
According to a new report based on U.S. Census Bureau data , only 26 percent of American teens between the ages of 16 and 19 had jobs in late 2009 which represents a record low since statistics began to be kept back in 1948 .
But the inability to get good jobs is only part of the story … .
* The Pew Research Center study also found that only 61 % of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 are covered by some form of a health plan .
* According to a National Foundation for Credit Counseling survey , only 58 % of those in “ Generation Y ” pay their monthly bills on time .
* Not only that , but according to a November MetLife poll , nearly 70 % of those in “ Generation Y ” are not building up a cash cushion , and 43 % are accumulating too much credit card debt .
* According to Fidelity Investments , those in Generation Y have more than three credit cards on average , and 20 percent of them carry a balance of at least $ 10,000 .
So what does all this mean ?
It means we are raising a generation of young Americans that are a financial mess .
But is n’t that our own fault ?
After all , most young Americans have never received any formal training on how to manage their money , and the role models of financial responsibility they do have ( the rest of us ) are hardly worth emulating .
But if each generation of Americans is becoming increasingly financially irresponsible , what does that mean for the future of this nation ?
Berlin , Germany ( CNN ) --
Authorities have raided a monastery in southern Germany as part of a probe into allegations that priests sexually abused children there , prosecutors said .
Eight former students at the Ettal Abbey boarding school have reported that they were abused in 1954 and in the 1970s and ' 80s , the abbey has said in a statement .
The head of the monastery and the school headmaster stepped down last week .
Investigators with the Munich State Prosecutors Office visited the Benedictine Abbey of Ettal on Tuesday afternoon as part of their ongoing investigation into allegations of sexual abuse of underage children by priests there .
Authorities are now assessing evidence collected at the abbey , the prosecutors said .
No arrests have been made in the investigation involving Ettal .
The investigation unfolds amid a growing scandal involving allegations of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church in Germany .
Nearly every day since the end of January , people have come forward to report cases of sexual abuse by Catholic priests in Germany .
News reports put the number of cases at about 150 .
Germany 's highest - ranking Catholic , Freiburg Archbishop Robert Zoellitsch , has addressed the problem .
" I apologize in the name of the church in Germany to all those who became the victims of such crimes , " he said recently .
" Sexual abuse weighs extremely heavily in the context of the church because children and youth put so much trust in priests , " he said .
" There must be no sexual abuse -- especially in the church . "
He also said he would raise the subject with Pope Benedict XVI when he visits him in March .
My debate with George Monbiot is still going on in this thread .
I ’m raising this comment to be a separate blog post ( with extra linky goodness ) , because I think it ’s important , independently of any discussion of the CRU emails ( and to point out that the other thread is still growing – go see ! )
Like many other commentators , George Monbiot suggests that “ to retain the moral high ground we have to be sure that we ’ve got our own house in order .
That means demanding the highest standards of scientific openness , transparency and integrity ” .
It ’s hard to argue with these abstract ideals .
But I ’ll try , because I think this assertion is not only unhelpful , but also helps to perpetuate several myths about science .
The argument that scientists should somehow be more virtuous ( than regular folks ) is a huge fallacy .
Openness and transparency are great as virtues to strive for .
But they cannot ever become a standard by which we judge individual scientists .
For a start , no scientific field has ever achieved the levels of openness that are being demanded here .
The data is messy , the meta - data standards are not in place , the resources to curate this data are not in place .
Which means the “ get our own house in order ” argument is straight denialist logic – they would have it that we ca n’t act on the science until every last bit of data is out in the public domain .
In truth , climate science has developed a better culture of data sharing , replication , and results checking than almost any other scientific field .
Here ’s one datapoint to back this up : in no other field of computational science are there 25 + teams around the world building the same simulation models independently , and systematically comparing their results on thousands of different scenarios in order to understand the quality of those simulations .
We should demand from scientists that they do excellent science .
But we should not expect them to also somehow be superhuman .
The argument that scientists should never exhibit human weaknesses is not just fallacious , it ’s dangerous .
It promotes the idea that science depends on perfect people to carry it out , when in fact the opposite is the case .
Science is a process that compensates for the human failings of the people who engage in it , by continually questioning evidence , re-testing ideas , replicating results , collecting more data , and so on .
Mistakes are made all the time .
Individual scientists screw up .
If they do n’t make mistakes , they ’re not doing worthwhile science .
It ’s vitally important that we get across to the public that this is how science works , and that errors are an important part of the process .
Its the process that matters , not any individual scientist ’s work .
The results of this process are more trustworthy than any other way of producing knowledge , precisely because the process is robust in the face of error .
In the particular case [ of the CRU emails ] , calling for scientists to take the moral high ground , and to be more virtuous , is roughly the equivalent of suggesting that victims of sexual assault should act more virtuous .
And if you think this analogy is over the top , you have n’t understood the nature of the attacks on scientists like Mann , Santer , Briffa , and Jones .
Look at Jones now : he ’s contemplated suicide , he ’s on drugs just to help him get through the day , and more drugs to allow him to sleep at night .
These bastards have destroyed a brilliant scientist .
And somehow the correct response is that scientists should strive to be more virtuous ?!
Oh yes , blame the victim .

Coastal Florida -- but Mica , Stearns & Miller put their dangerous ideology ahead of the interests of their own endangered constituents
Harmful algal blooms are a rapid overproduction of algal cells that produce toxins and occur in both salt and freshwater .
People and animals are exposed to the toxins when they drink or swim in the contaminated water or consume seafood that has ingested these toxins .
The toxins cannot be removed or neutralized through the traditional water treatment methods , like filtering , boiling , or chemical treatments .
In addition to releasing toxins , the blooms can block sunlight in water and use up the available oxygen in the water , causing a severe oxygen depletion .
The oxygen depletion , called hypoxia , stresses or suffocates marine animals and plants .
Environmental changes in water quality , temperature , and sunlight or an increase in nutrients in the water can cause blooms to increase dramatically .
Harmful algal blooms also have a negative financial impact on a region , if beaches are closed and fishing is suspended .
Harmful algal blooms and hypoxia cost the U.S. seafood and tourism industries approximately $ 82 million annually , according to a conservative estimate from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
The bill will give local communities the tools and best practices to understand and respond to harmful algal blooms and hypoxia .
It will assist in regional , state , tribal , and local efforts to develop and implement appropriate marine and freshwater harmful algal bloom and hypoxia response plans , strategies , and tools .
It will also provide resources for and assist in the training of local water and coastal resource managers in the methods and technologies for monitoring , controlling , mitigating , and responding to the effects of marine and freshwater harmful algal blooms and hypoxia events .
The state and regional participation is completely voluntary .
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) determined that the bill does not impose any cost on state , local , or tribal governments .
The bill has been endorsed by Environmental Defense Fund , Surfrider Foundation , Ocean Champions , and PURRE ( People United to Restore our Rivers and Estuaries ) .
Well , hard - core GOP obstructionists who oppose government action to make society a better place pretty much oppose everything , and 98 of them voted against the bill yesterday .
Most of them represent landlocked districts , and most of them are just against any positive action -- you know , Michele Bachmann , Virginia Foxx , Patrick McHenry , Eric Cantor , David Dreier , Pete Sessions , Mean Jean Schmidt , all the creeps and imbeciles from Texas and Georgia , of course , Scott Garrett , Steve King and ( shockingly , considering his Long Island district ) Peter King .
It made me think of a speech then - candidate Bill Clinton gave at Georgetown University on October 23 , 1991 , the And the five Democrats who voted " no " ?
See if you can detect a pattern .
Jason Altmire , Dan Boren , Bobby Bright , Ann Kirkpatrick , Bill Owens -- five of the most spineless and habitually conservative Democrats , all from inland districts , all eager to go run to the Chamber of Commerce types and say , " See I 'm really one of you . "
And they are .
It made me think of a speech then - candidate Bill Clinton gave at Georgetown University on October 23 , 1991 , the New Covenant speech .
It was one that turned the tide in his favor and help make him president .
Let me quote just a llittle so you can compare it with how the members of Congress who voted " no " yesterday define their role in politics :
The very fiber of our nation is breaking down : Families are coming apart , kids are dropping out of school , drugs and crime dominate our streets .
And our leaders here in Washington are n't doing much about it .
The political system we have now rotates between being the butt of jokes and the object of absolute scorn .
Frustration produces calls for term limits from voters who do n't even think they have the power to vote incumbents out , and resentment produces votes for David Duke , not just from racists , but from voters so desperate for change they will support the most anti-establishment message , even if it 's delivered by an ex-Klansman who admits it was inspired by Adolf Hitler .
We 've got to rebuild our political life before the demagogues and the racists , and those who pander to the worst in us , bring this country down .
People once looked at the president and the Congress to bring us together , to solve problems , to make progress .
Now , in the face of massive challenges , our government stands discredited , our people are disillusioned .
There 's a hole in our politics where our sense of common purpose used to be .
The Reagan - Bush years have exalted private gain over public obligation , special interest over the common good , wealth and fame over work and family .
The 1980s ushered in a gilded age of greed and selfishness , of irresponsibility and excess , and of neglect .
S&L crooks stole billions of dollars in other people 's money .
Pentagon consultants and HUD contractors stole from the taxpayers .
Many big corporate executives raised their own salaries even when their companies were losing money and their workers were being put into the unemployment lines .
Middle - class families worked longer hours for less money and spent more on health care and housing , and education and taxes .
Poverty rose .
Many inner-city streets were taken over by crime and drugs , welfare and despair .
Family responsibility became an oxymoron for many deadbeat fathers who were more likely to make their car payments than to pay their child support .
And government , which should have been setting an example , was even worse .
Congress raised its pay and guarded its perks while most Americans were working harder for less money .
Two Republican presidents elected on a promise of fiscal responsibility advanced budget proposals that more than tripled our national debt .
Congress went along with that , too .
Taxes were lowered on the wealthiest people whose incomes were rising , and raised on middle class families as their incomes fell .
... To turn America around , we 've got to have a new approach , founded on our most sacred principles as a nation , with a vision for the future .
We need a new covenant , a solemn agreement between the people and their government to provide opportunity for everybody , inspire responsibility throughout our society and restore a sense of community to our great nation .
A new covenant to take government back from the powerful interests and the bureaucracy and give it back to the ordinary people of our country .
Brian Baird ( D - WA ) is retiring from Congress and will hopefully be replaced by a more progressive Democrat , state Sen. Craig Pridemore .
I 've had my disagreements with Baird -- plenty of them -- but he's one of the only members of Congress willing to be even remotely evenhanded towards the Palestinians , so I always have a grudging admiration for him when he acts badly on other matters .
Yesterday an important but obscure bill of his passed , 251-103 -- H.R. 3650 , the Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act .
There were 39 co-sponsors , spread out on both sides of the aisle .
Baird , a member of the Congressional Boating Caucus as well as the Coastal Caucus , is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the Science and Technology Committee , and he also serves on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee and the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment .
It all seemed to come together yesterday when he managed to pass H.R. 3650 , which is meant to establish a National Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Program , to develop and coordinate a comprehensive and integrated strategy to address harmful algal blooms and hypoxia , and to provide for the development and implementation of comprehensive regional action plans to reduce harmful algal blooms and hypoxia .
" This bill , " said Baird , " will reauthorize a program that has funded research to advance our understanding and our ability to detect , assess , predict and control these harmful algal bloom and hypoxia events .
Since the last reauthorization there has been an increase in the number , frequency and type of algal blooms and hypoxic events , affecting more of our coastlines and inland waters .
" According to WaterWorld Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) is carrying the same bill in the Senate , and it 's already passed the Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee .
So who 's against it -- and why ?
Red Tide lovers ?
Labels : Bill Clinton , Brian Baird , Red Tide , the nature of conservatism
The Melbourne Storm have been stripped of two premierships , three minor premierships and fined a total of $ 1.6 million for massive breaches of the NRL 's salary cap rules .
They have also been stripped of all competition points accumulated this season and will not be playing for points for the remainder of the campaign .
NRL chief executive David Gallop addressed a media conference in Sydney , outlining that an audit had found the Storm had been operating two sets of books to hide breaches from salary cap auditor Ian Schubert .
Additional payments amounted to $ 1.7 million over five years and $ 700,000 in 2010 .
" They had a long - term system of effectively two sets of books and the elaborate lengths they have gone through to cover this up has been extraordinary , " Gallop said .
" The club has furthermore been fined $ 500,000 and will be forced to return $ 1.1 million in prize money , with it being distributed evenly among the other 15 clubs . "
While the Storm will lose their titles from 2007 and 2009 , Gallop said neither losing grand finalists Manly or Parramatta will assume those titles .
He said the Storm would have noted what happened in 2002 , when the Bulldogs were stripped of 37 competition points and fined $ 500,000 for breaching the cap .
" The rules are the rules , everyone in this competition knows them .
Particularly after the Bulldogs , they knew the risk they were taking , " Gallop said .
" There 's no alternative for the NRL in terms of penalties . "
When asked whether there would be legal implications for those involved , Gallop replied : " Most certainly . "
Storm coach Craig Bellamy said in a statement that he was unaware of the breaches .
" This is an absolute shock to myself , to our football staff , to our players , " he said .
" Personally I am heartbroken .
But this football club has great character and values .
We will not walk away from this challenge .
" We will stick tight together as a group and fight our way back from this . "
John Hartigan , chairman and chief executive of club owner News Limited , said the deception had been concealed from his organisation .
News has appointed accounting firm Deloitte to conduct a forensic audit of the club 's accounts , stood down two senior staff believed to be involved and hired respected administrator Frank Stanton to move in as caretaker chief executive .
" Today is a regrettable day in the history of the game , " Hartigan said .
" I do n't think there will be a league fan anywhere who is not outraged by what appears to be a highly orchestrated , deeply deceptive fraud in which there was systematic and deliberate concealment of unlawful payments to certain players over an extended period . "
The investigations revealed the Storm maintained a dual - contract system , with the club confirming that side letters promising extra payments were stored in a secret file .
" The breakthrough in the investigation was the discovery by the salary cap auditor ( Ian Schubert ) of a file in a separate room at the Storm to the room which contained the file with the player 's contracts , outlining the payments to the players not disclosed to us , " he said .
" It was through this system that they were able to attract and retain some of the biggest names in rugby league .
" The results of their practices on the field speak for themselves . "
Gallop said the Storm need to quickly find a way to rectify the situation to have any chance of regaining their status in the league .
" Certainly by the 2011 season they need to be operating within the salary cap and how they do that I 'm not sure at this stage , " he said .
Sportingbet Australia reacted immediately to the news by slashing the Storm 's wooden spoon odds from $ 250 into $ 1.01 .

The decision by a federal agency to reinterpret a law meant to prevent deaths due to pool - drain accidents has outraged pool safety advocates and the parents of children killed by pool - drain suction .
" I was blown away , " said Nancy Baker , mother of a seven - year - old who died in 2002 .
" It 's sad that it will take more deaths to make them see the intent of the law . "
Baker and Karen Cohn , mother of a six - year - old who died in 2007 , sent an angry letter to the Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) after that agency recently voted to interpret the 2007 Pool Safety
Act to no longer require back - up anti-entrapment systems in as many as 150,000 public and hotel pools and hot tubs .
" We urge you to reconsider and fulfill the intent of this important new law by installing the layers of protection that are required to mitigate - if not eliminate - incidences of drowning across this country , " wrote Baker and Cohn .
" There 's too much at stake . "
CLICK HERE TO WATCH A GOOD MORNING AMERICA INVESTIGATION OF POOL DRAINS
The vacuum effect in pool drains is powerful enough to hold swimmers , especially children , to the bottom of a pool .
Contact between human skin and a flat pool drain can create suction equal to hundreds of pounds of pressure .
In one horrific instance , four adult men were unable to pull a young girl from the grasp of a deadly drain .
Swimmers can die from drowning or evisceration .
From 1999 to 2008 , according to CPSC data , there were 83 reports of suction entrapment , including 11 deaths and 69 injuries .
Experts say the number of deaths and injuries may be much higher , however , because police and medical records do n't always list specific causes for drowning .
Nancy Baker 's daughter Virginia Graeme Baker died in a tragic spa accident in 2002 .
The 7 - year - old granddaughter of former Secretary of State James Baker died in her mother 's arms after she sat on the underwater floor drain of a hot tub .
" I kept pulling at her , never understanding what was holding her down and I could n't pull her off , " said Nancy Baker .
" I opened my eyes underwater and there are n't words to describe what this is like , " she said .
The suction pressure holding her daughter down was later estimated at 700 pounds .
" I really wish it was n't my daughter , " said Baker .
" But when she died [ the issue ] moved from the back pages of the newspaper to the front pages of the newspaper . "

In December 2007 , in a rare bipartisan vote , Congress passed the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool And Spa Safety
Act to provide basic drain safety standards and layers of backup protection from dangerous drain suction for the nation 's public and hotel pools and hot tubs .
The law mandates that drains in about 300,000 of the nation 's public and hotel pools and hot tubs be covered with larger , rounded covers that do not create suction , and that there be a back - up mechanical system installed in drains to prevent suction in those pools that have a single main drain .
As many as half of the pools and hot tubs covered by the Pool Safety Act have single main drains .
But new CPSC chairwoman Inez Tenenbaum asked for a review of the Pool Safety Act shortly after taking the helm of the commission last year , and called on representatives of the pool industry and pool safety advocates to make presentations to the commission .
On behalf of the pool industry , pool equipment manufacturer Leif Zars argued that redesigned drain covers were enough to prevent pool suction accidents .
Zars owns a company that manufactures large rounded drain covers that prevent suction .
A majority of the CPSC commissioners agreed with the pool industry 's position .
In March the CPSC voted 3 to 2 to reinterpret the law and drop the requirement that pool drains include a secondary anti-entrapment system .
Now public and hotel pools will not have to install a secondary anti-entrapment system in order to be in compliance with the Pool Safety Act 's wording of " unblockable drain . "
Pool safety advocates argue that larger , rounded drain covers are not enough .
In the summer of 2007 , 6 - year - old Zachary Cohn got trapped by the suction of the drain in his family 's pool in Greenwich , Conn .
His parents were unable to free him before he drowned .

" The size of the drain cover did n't matter in Zac 's case , " said John Procter , spokesperson for the Pool Safety Council , a non-profit safety advocacy group .
" What killed him was the fact that [ the drain cover ] came off and exposed him to the suction of the drain itself .
That 's why layers of protection are so important - and part of the law . "
The Cohn case is highlighted by safety advocates because the Cohn pool was new and had updated drain covers , but the builder did not install " backup layers of protection " like safety shut off valves or suction - limiting systems - the issue at the heart of the conflict surrounding the recent CPSC reinterpretation vote of the Pool Safety Act .
" The Commission not only defied the intent of the legislation by turning a blind eye to one of the specific risks that the Act is intended to eliminate , but also breached its custodial responsibility to protect the public from unreasonable risks of serious injury or death , " wrote Nancy Baker and Karen Cohn in their letter to the CPSC after its vote .
" As parents of children who have fallen victim to entrapment , we cannot stand by and allow others to experience the loss we have suffered . "
" I was disappointed that the CPSC ruled against requiring layers of protection , " said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , D. - Fla. , who introduced and pushed for the passage of the Pool Safety Act .
" This ruling leaves children 's lives only as safe as the first layer of protection , which leaves them vulnerable to human error and mechanical failure , with no further layer of protection . "
Pool safety watchdog groups were also very concerned .
" The Virginia Graeme Baker law is all about layers of protection , " said Paul Pennington , the founder of the Pool Safety Council .
" It 's shocking that [ the CPSC ] would change the interpretation so blatantly . "
The CPSC 's decision even went against the position of Chairman Tenenbaum .
" In my role as Chairman , " Tenenbaum said , " I am not willing to gamble the safety of our children in the hope that drain covers throughout the nation that are commonly removed for maintenance always will be reinstalled correctly or that a missing or broken drain cover will be immediately noticed by an observant pool operator who will then shut down the pool before any children are at risk . "
In a statement , CPSC Commissioner Anne Northup , who sided with the majority , said that the Pool Safety Act " primarily addresses the miniscule portion of drownings attributable to entrapments " and that " unblockable drain covers are at least equally as effective in preventing or eliminating injury or death from drain entrapments as the other systems described in this statute . "
Kirstin Pires , spokesperson for the Association of Pool and Spa Professionals , a trade group representing pool and spa manufacturers , said her group was " pleased " with the CPSC 's decision .
" We like what happened , " said Pires .
" Now we can go about the important business of making sure every pool is in compliance . "
" The CPSC did the right thing , " said Leif Zars .
" I agree totally with their interpretation . "

Rewarding Iowa
So same - sex marriage is legal in Iowa and has been for a more than year now .
Efforts to ban same - sex marriage in Iowa have stalled and many Democratic politicians and candidates are sticking their necks out for us .
Seems to me that teh gays should reward Iowa by — I hope you 're sitting down — visiting the state and spending some of our big gay tourist dollars there .
Yes , yes — I know .
Iowa .
No beaches , no big cities .
But the Midwest in the summer has its charms .
There are lots of pretty little towns along the Mississippi .
( Check out Clinton , Iowa , sometime . )
And if someone wanted to organize something big — well , big for Iowa — this story in today 's New York Times suggests one possibility :
Perry ’s fortunes dived in the late 1970s , when the Milwaukee Road , the last of the rail lines that sustained the town from its founding in 1869 , was shut .
But rather than trying to land one big project or employer , in the 1990s Perry embraced a development strategy based on adding recreation , lodging , education and clean energy to its traditional strength in livestock agriculture ....
From the corner of Second and Otley , Perry ’s multipronged efforts are apparent .
The Raccoon River Valley Trail , a 89 - mile bike path that ties downtown Des Moines to Perry and , farther on , to Jefferson , runs down Otley Avenue .
The last half - mile section in Perry will be paved this month at a cost of $ 100,000 , financed by the state .
Across the square is the Hotel Pattee , an elegant 40 - room , full - service hotel where rooms are modestly priced by big city standards , typically around $ 140 .
The hotel closed for two years in 2006 after a renovation in the late 1990s financed by Roberta Green Ahmanson , a wealthy native daughter , that city leaders said cost an estimated $ 20 million .
In 2008 the hotel was reopened by Steven C. Olson , the chief executive and president of Leisure Hotels ...
Mr. Olson said in an interview that the hotel had indeed lost $ 400,000 over the last two years , but that he expected to break even by the start of next year .
Part of the reason is that the completion of the Raccoon bike trail should encourage more of Des Moines ’s athletic young professionals and couples to spend summer weekend evenings in his hotel .
“ We see the trail as a marketing opportunity , ” Mr. Olson said .
Des Moines — where I was once briefly incarcerated — is an interesting city with corn-fed gay boys ( and a couple of actual gay bars ) and tons of straight people who are thrilled when people drop by in between the Iowa caucuses .
If teh gays got together and booked a block of rooms in a hotel in Des Moines on a Thursday night and bought out the Hotel Pattee for the rest of the weekend , I 'd fly in — instead of over — for that .
Ride the Raccoon River Valley Trail from Des Moines to Perry on Friday , spend the night ( and some money ) in Perry that night , ride to Jefferson on Saturday morning , have lunch , ride back to Perry , spend the night ( and more money ) , ride back to Des Moines on Sunday morning , fly home .
The Midwest — the warm , green , flat Midwest — is a lot more scenic than folks who 've never been assume .
And Iowa deserves our support .
Anyone else interested ?
( By which I mean : anyone interested in doing all the work so that I can blow into town and enjoy a nice bike ride through the cornfields ?
And spend my gay tourist dollars , of course . )
UPDATE : There 's a website , and a video ...
Looks pretty — not a single pig-manure lagoon in sight .

THE GUY WHO HAS A PUPPY THAT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE MINE ★★★★★ Hello , and welcome to my week - by - week review of everything in the world .
Today I am reviewing the guy who has a puppy that looks exactly like mine .
( scroll down for the latest photo / info / video )
We ’re back on Arroyo Beach in far south West Seattle right now , along with TV crews , watchful neighbors , and whale experts ( plus one news chopper overhead ) .
Jeff Hogan tells us that the gray that beached and died here yesterday afternoon is a female , about 30 feet long , “ sub - adult , ” and emaciated .
NOAA has reps here too and will try at high tide to tow it away so it can be necropsied elsewhere , but if that ’s not possible , they may have to do a “ limited necropsy ” here .
NOAA tells us the number of gray whale deaths has n’t risen to an alarming level yet ; this one may be the first found dead in West Seattle waters since 1999 ( here ’s an article we found about what was happening that year ) .
Here ’s a wider view of what ’s happening here , looking toward Vashon from our spot beneath a residential bulkhead :
The tide is still receding , with low tide at noon , so nothing ’s going to change here for some hours .
The whale is cordoned off with a yellow - tape perimeter .
We did a video walkaround before that tape went all the way up and will add that shortly .
We asked Hogan if there is any way to tell if this ( or any of the others that died recently ) is the one that West Seattleites watched a few weeks ago – he said photographs would have to be used to make the comparison .
11:32 AM : An impromptu field trip from Westside School just dropped by and drew immediate TV attention :
The rain is falling more steadily now .
Again , nothing major is expected to happen here until the tide ’s in later – high tide is n’t until 7:15 this evening .
ADDED 1:44 PM : Finally able to upload the video walkaround we mentioned earlier :
Here are our previous stories :
– First report from the beach , shortly after the whale died
– Nighttime look after the tide went out
Perhaps the most amazing sight is the whale ’s baleen ( what ’s in their jaws to filter food out of muddy shallows ) – a photo shared with us by “ D ” has a clearer look – click ahead ( ALSO AHEAD , LATEST UPDATES ) :
3:13 PM : Nearby resident Scott , whose wife rolled video on what turned out to be the whale ’s final moments of life yesterday afternoon , says NOAA is indeed planning to be back out in a few hours to try to float the whale off the beach at high tide ( 7 pm ) .
7:10 PM : Here ’s all you could see at the scene a short time ago as high tide approached :
We ’ve posted a new report with an update .
AN Indonesian teenager chopped off his penis and tossed it down a well after learning his girlfriend intended to marry another man .
The 19 - year - old from a village in Central Java was lucky to survive the self surgery , health authorities said .
" He arrived at the hospital last Thursday in critical condition from blood loss , " Cilacap General Hospital Director Sugeng Budi Susanto told local media .
" Cutting off a penis can be fatal . "
Doctors were unable to re-attach the dismembered member because villagers could not find it .
The teen spent several days in intensive care but is now in recovery , Mr Sugeng said .
He had not spoken to anyone about the incident , Mr Sugeng said .
" He 's still too shocked and embarrassed to talk to or see anyone . "
A mother has warned of the risk of children spending hundreds of pounds on " free " online games available through Facebook after her 12 - year - old son ran up bills of more than £ 900 without her knowledge .
The woman , who prefers to remain anonymous , discovered last month that her son had spent more than £ 900 on FarmVille .
He had emptied his own savings account of £ 288 and had used her credit card to the tune of £ 625 to pay the bills .
FarmVille , one of the most popular games on Facebook , allows members to manage a virtual farm by planting , growing and harvesting crops , trees and livestock .
New users are given virtual coins to set up their farm , and the revenue from matured crops can be used to maintain it .
But those who are desperate to progress more quickly can buy extra virtual coins using real cash .
The mother said : " The first use of my card was on 14 March .
I discovered it on the 29th and the card was stopped at that point .
Any transactions after that date were already in the system , so what I thought was a £ 427 spend turned into £ 625 over the next few days .
" The total spend is about £ 905 , but the credits are still rolling in .
Facebook and [ game creator ]
Zynga will not refund anything as [ the son ] lives in my house .
Facebook has disabled his account and Zynga has unhelpfully suggested I use password protection on computers in the future . "
She contacted her credit card company , HSBC , but was told she would only qualify for a refund if she reported her son to the police and obtained a crime number .
" He would be cautioned and I have been told that this caution would stay with him .
Obviously the idea of a stupid farm simulation jeopardising his future earnings is not something that I want to consider , " she said .
She added that her son was " very shocked " when confronted with the amount he had spent , but it was clear he knew what he was doing .
" When I asked him why he did it he said that they had brought out ' good stuff that I wanted ' . "
She does not blame Facebook , Zynga or HSBC , saying that her son was the one using the card and is entirely at fault .
But she added : " I do think they need to shoulder some responsibility in this business and put systems in place to stop this happening again .
The fact that he was using a card in a different name should bring up some sort of security and the online secure payment filter seems to be bypassed for Facebook payments . "
A spokeswoman for HSBC said that had the credit card been used on a gambling site it would have started alarm bells ringing for " unusual usage " .
But because the card had been used to buy Facebook credits HSBC did not consider the transactions to be suspicious , even though £ 625 was spent in just two weeks .
Michael Arrington , founder of the Techcrunch blog , criticised Zynga last year for " monetising " the game , and warned that people who did n't have access to a credit card to buy extra virtual money could use " pay by mobile " companies instead .
The indebted 12 - year - old has not used his mobile to pay for virtual money , his mother said , but only because his older brother lost all his credit buying a ringtone a couple of years ago .
" We sound terribly technologically unaware do n't we ?
I would n't mind but I am always explaining that all of these online offers , ringtones and games are a scam designed to take money off stupid people .
Kids know best though . "
Leading into a massive assault on the Kandahar province of Afghanistan , the Obama Administration is ‘ winning hearts and minds ’ in Afghanistan and Pakistan with increased drone strikes and night raids .
27 Apr 2010 | InfoShop News
Leading into a massive assault on the Kandahar province of Afghanistan , the Obama Administration is ‘ winning hearts and minds ’ in Afghanistan and Pakistan with increased drone strikes and night raids .
The escalation of the Bush Administration ’s increasingly violent occupation of Afghanistan has been greatly expanded into Pakistan by the Obama Adminstration , in collaboration with the Paki military .
In Afghanistan , the escalation of night raids have consistently terrorized the local population , sparking unrest .
Death From Above
After killing a record 700 civilians last year in at least 44 distinct drone strikes against Pakistan in 2009 , the Obama Administration is escalating the rate in 2010 .
Jason Ditz writes at Antiwar News : “ Less than four months into the new year , the U.S. has already launched 40 attacks and killed at least 268 people .
The most recent strike yesterday in North Waziristan killed at least nine people . ”
Throughout every night , one can see “ an endless caravan of old cars and pickup trucks rolls through ” towns of North Waziristan “ filled with jihadist recruits going to join the fight against U.S. forces ” in Afghanistan ” for what , Ron Moreau and Sami Yousafzai report at Newsweek , “ appears to be a conscious militant ‘ surge ’ that ’s bigger than any similar seasonal movement in the past . ”
The Paki government has “ declared a victory ” in the South Waziristan region .
“ In all cases the offensive drove the militants out , but few of the leaders were ever accounted for , and as soon as the military lures the civilians back , the militants return as well , ” Mr. Ditz wrote today , adding that “ tribesmen are holding out for security guarantees ” :
For the dominant Mehsud tribe , the region does n’t appear remotely safe to return to .
One elder asked : “ how can we go back unless the area is cleared ?
This is not our land any more .
It ’s a battleground . ” …
For the Mehsud tribe in particular , trust in the government is difficult to come by .
Officials were ordering mass arrests of Mehsud tribesmen across the nation in October , claiming that they were “ suspected militants . ”
When the militants return to South Waziristan , as they inevitably will , the tribe is setting itself up to be blamed once again for not stopping the militants themselves .
To make matters worse , the first rule of the Obama Administration ’s raindrops of death is that it does n’t exist while the relatives of the dead scream past silence “ The United States has long tried to maintain plausible deniability that it is behind drone warfare in Pakistan , ” Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann of the New America Foundation write at The New York Times ( NYT ) today , adding : “ For reasons of its own , the Pakistani government has also sought to hide the fact that it secretly agreed to allow the United States to fly some drones out of a base in Pakistan and attack militants on its territory . ”
All of this said , the Pakis have somehow figured out that they ’re being systematically slaughtered .
“ In a poll last summer , only 9 percent of Pakistanis approved of the drone strikes , ” Mr. Bergen and Ms. Tiedemann continue .
“ A key reason for this unpopularity is the widespread perception that the strikes overwhelmingly kill civilians . ”
The death from above is not the only fear in Pakistan , but fearing invasions by the Paki military , which is viewed as foreign by the tribesmen .
The fear of spontaneous foreign invasion into civilian homes is n’t isolated to Pakistan , but also by Afghans .
Night Raids
General Stanley McChrystal , commander of the U.S. - led International Security Assistance Force offensive in Af - Pak , “ has not only refused to curb those raids but has increased them dramatically , ” Gareth Porter reported at Inter Press Services last month , adding that :
even after they triggered a new round of angry protests from villagers , students and Afghan President Hamid Karzai himself , he has given no signal of reducing his support for them .
Two moves by McChrystal last year reveal his strong commitment to night raids as a tactic .
After becoming commander of NATO and U.S. forces last May , he approved a more than fourfold increase in those operations , from 20 in May to 90 in November , according to a report in the Los Angeles Times Dec. 16 .
One of McChrystal ’s spokesmen , Lt. Col .
Tadd Sholtis , acknowledged to IPS that the level of night raids during that period has reflected McChrystal ’s guidance .
Jerome Starkey reported at the London Times , 13 Mar 2010 , that a February raid , which led to the deaths of two pregnant women — one , a mother of ten and the other of six — and a teenage girl , were “ carried out by U.S. and Afghan gunmen ” .
He noted the raid came two weeks after “ after the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan [ General Stanley McChrystal ] issued new guidelines designed to limit the use of night raids ” after having “ been criticized for night raids based on dubious or false intelligence leading to civilian casualties ” .
Mr. Starkey recently reported that Afghan investigators found that the forces staged the scene as an ‘ honor killing ‘.
“ U.S. special forces [ S.O.F. ] soldiers dug bullets out of their victims ’ bodies in the bloody aftermath of a botched night raid , then washed the wounds with alcohol before lying to their superiors about what happened ” .
Mr. Ditz wrote yesterday : “ Another of the night raids that Gen. Stanley McChrystal has repeatedly promised to curb has gone awry , and sparked violent protests across the Logar Province of Afghanistan today , after it was revealed that the raid killed three innocent civilians . ”
NATO claims the three were “ insurgents ” , but Mr. Ditz adds that local accounts are contrary to this , sparking violent protests :
As the protests grew over the morning relatives insisted that all those killed were actually civilians .
But local tribesmen wasted no time taking to the streets in protest , blocking roads and eventually turning on a NATO supply convoy that attempted to pass … .
Though NATO killing civilians and labeling them insurgents is nothing new , and that was n’t even the first time it had happened this week , locals seem to be increasingly discontented with the business - as - usual of NATO killing their neighbors and chalking it up to “ insurgency , ” and the violent protests will likely only continue to grow as such incidents continue to occur .
Winning Hearts and Minds in Kandahar
The U.S. - led ISAF coalition has telegraphed a June offensive in the province of Kandahar — governed by the excessively violent and corrupted Ahmed Wali Karzai , provincial council chief and brother of the Afghan president — with an escalated presence of S.O.F. soldiers within and massive repositioning of forces on the periphery , the NYT reports :
American and NATO officials are not eager to speak publicly about one of their biggest challenges : the effect of the continued presence of Ahmed Wali Karzai , the Afghan president ’s brother and head of the Kandahar provincial council , whose suspected links with drug dealers and insurgents have prompted some Western officials to say that corruption and governance problems have led locals to be more accepting of the Taliban … .
To shape the arrangement of allied forces ahead of the fight , conventional troops have begun operations outside of Kandahar , in a series of provincial districts that ring the city .
American and allied officers predict heavy pockets of fighting in those belts … .
The plan has echoes of the troop “ surge ” in Iraq , when additional American forces were sent to attack the insurgents who were operating in the belts outside the Iraqi capital , planning attacks , constructing roadside bombs and launching assaults .
Other similarities to Iraq include the plans to woo local tribal leaders in and around Kandahar , similar to the way soldiers and Marines in Anbar Province courted the tribal Sunni sheiks in Iraq to fight insurgents .
The United States and its allies in the Afghan government will try to unite local tribal leaders in and around Kandahar to turn in Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters .
As in Iraq , officials said , the strategy will include monetary incentives in the form of economic development money for local leaders and tribal officials who support the government ’s security efforts . …
While the overt parts of the Kandahar offensive will begin in coming weeks — several dozen platoon and company - size outposts for American and allied forces have already been constructed in recent weeks along the approaches to Kandahar — military officials warn that securing the city could take months .
Military commanders say their goal is to show concrete results by late summer or early fall , in advance of Ramadan and national parliamentary elections .
While the officials stressed that they will limit civilian casualties , an increase in operations will put more residents in the cross - fire .
The fighting already under way in the province is putting at risk the sharp drop in civilian casualties that followed General McChrystal ’s orders to strenuously avoid them .
Recent episodes of civilian casualties , including an attack on a bus , have undermined trust for NATO operations .
Afghan officials are attempting to block the offensive , “ warning that the alliance would have to guarantee that civilians would be protected in the offensive ” , Mr. Ditz wrote yesterday .
He adds the large February Marja invasion , “ which “ sold as the ‘ test ’ for the Kandahar strategy ” , has thus far “ yielded less than promising results “ :
The goal of occupying the city and propping up some semblance of a government is still unfinished , even with the comparative advantage of Marja not being nearly as big a city as it was presented as .
Kandahar , by contrast , is an enormous city , and one with a population that has already had its fill of violence and occupation .
The idea that a new violent occupation is going to solve the problems in the city seems farcical , but seems to be the only idea NATO has come up with .
The U.S. - led coalition ’s response : have the C.I.A. drop 35 - pound missiles instead of 100 - pounders and propagandize a “ handover ” of Afghan provinces to the Afghan government that is “ not calendar - driven ” and has no plan of troop withdrawal .
People Want a Refund on the Terror Narrative
German troops have recently experienced intense blowback for civilian deaths , increasing the large two - thirds majority within Germany to withdraw from the occupied nation - state .
“ Faced with solid pubic opposition against the war in Afghanistan , Chancellor Angela Merkel told legislators Thursday that German troops were not yet going to withdraw from the country , but would remain there to prevent the spread of international terrorism , ” Judy Dempsey reported at the NYT last week :
With two out of three Germans opposed to the war , according to a recent poll in Stern magazine , and with casualties increasing — seven soldiers were killed in the past three weeks —
Mrs. Merkel had been criticized not only by her own conservative Christian Democrats , but also by the highly influential mass circulation Bild newspaper for failing to explain to the public why German troops are based in Afghanistan … .
Her speech won some support from the opposition Social Democrats , who are in a quandary because when they were in government from 1999 to 2005 , they supported sending troops to Afghanistan .
Sigmar Gabriel , the leader of the Social Democrats whose grass roots are traditionally pacifist , is staunchly against Germany remaining in Afghanistan .
He called for a an independent assessment that would determine whether the new U.S. counter - insurgency strategy would succeed .
Mrs. Merkel ’s speech was roundly criticized by the Left Party , which has consistently called on the government to end its mission in Afghanistan .
After a large percentage of U.K. troops lost were killed during in the Helmand Surge led by the Obama Administration , resistance is growing for the mobilization to Kandahar .
“ A switch to Kandahar would risk undermining public support but a refusal to do so would risk alienating the Americans , ” The Daily Telegraph in London reported last week .
The decision is “ likely to be one of the first and most difficult decisions to be taken by the next prime minister following the May 6 election ” , later adding :
British forces would face a tough urban fight in Kandahar and many fear casualty rates could exceed those in Helmand .
An Army planner warned : “ It is a far more complex area .
If we think the problems in Helmand are difficult then they are horribly magnified in Kandahar . ” …
Senior Foreign
Office figures fear that moving to Kandahar would mean British troops remained in Afghanistan indefinitely whereas Helmand would leave open the possibility of an “ exit strategy ” being developed at relatively short notice should the situation in the country deteriorate .
The “ centerpiece ” of ISAF ’s “ political effort ” to infiltrate the tribal organizations of mutual consultation — “ shuras “ — and bribe them with “ government services and resources to districts “ .
To actually believe the juvenile fairy tale of ‘ fighting terrorism ’ , a sheep has to believe that further corrupting the Afghan government is , at best , the stubborn display that American exceptionalists in the White House are slower at learning why 9/11 happened than Glenn Beck .
Mr. Beck recently expressed that though “ we ” did n’t “ deserve 9/11 ” , “ we ” were n’t “ minding our own business ” , but were “ in bed with dictators and abandoning our principles ” , conceding that “ that causes problems ” .
When the batshit - crazy one is making more sense than the man in charge , double - check your last will and grab your wallet .
Chan .
Merkel ’s claim the offensive is to “ prevent the spread of international terrorism ” is about as much of as lie as one can come up with , as there are n’t any significant international terrorism networks in Kandahar — or anywhere else in Afghanistan .
The offensive into Kandahar is being highly publicized and therefore , the Taliban has been mobilizing militants , “ planting bombs and plotting attacks as NATO and Afghan forces prepare for a summer showdown with insurgents , according to a Taliban commander with close ties to senior insurgent leaders “ .
The Taliban has neither the interest nor the means to participate in international terrorism to any significant degree .
Last year , on the eighth anniversary of the U.S. invasion , a statement was intercepted in which “ the Taliban said their goal was ‘ independence and establishment of an Islamic system ’ ” , Todd Pittman reported at the Associated Press , adding :
“ We did not have any agenda to harm other countries including Europe , nor we have such agenda today , ” the group said .
“ Still , if you want to turn the country of the proud and pious Afghans into a colony , then know that we have an unwavering determination and have braced for a prolonged war . ” …
“ We call on the American rulers and their allies of the coalition once again to put an end to the game of occupying Afghanistan and killing the Afghans under unsubstantiated pretexts , ” the statement said .
“ At the beginning , they were promising they will withdraw within three months , in their words , after eliminating the so - called terrorism , ” the statement said , referring to U.S. forces .
“ Contrarily , today , eight years ( later ) … they have built up hundreds of military bases in Afghanistan and Iraq . ”
“ We believed from day one that this is not a war between democracy and the so - called terrorism , but rather a war between the Western colonialism and the freedom - loving nationalist and Islamist forces , ” the statement said .
The absurd notion of the Taliban being “ freedom - loving ” aside , their “ nationalist ” sentiments are very telling to the fact their agenda is not international .
Their actions have been consistent with nationalism , not the false - flag illusion of ‘ global jihad ’ .
Remaining in Afghanistan literally fuels this fire of American aggression , hypocrisy and lies that creates terrorism .
“ Signing up new recruits for the Afghan jihad is n’t hard , ” Newsweek reports from a “ senior Taliban operative ” :
Uneducated , unemployed tribal youths , angry at the American presence in the region and at the increase in U.S. drone - missile attacks on suspected terrorists , are easy marks for Taliban propaganda .
“ You can find many youths who will be ready to go in 20 minutes , ” says the operative .
A Helmand district commander named Abdul Malik says the new recruits have bolstered the morale of local fighters : “ Their presence gives us a big psychological boost . ”
Remember the Brown People not in the White House Getting Slaughtered by the One Who Is ?
Malalai Joya , a suspended member of the Afghan Parliament , wrote shortly before the Obama Adminsitration began the Afghan Surge injects steroids into the problems faced by the Afghan people , “ squashed between two enemies : the U.S. - NATO occupation forces on one hand and warlords and the Taliban on the other ” :
While we want the withdrawal of one enemy , we do n’t believe it is a matter of choosing between two evils … .
Transparency International reports that this regime is the second most corrupt in the world .
The U.N. Development Programme reports Afghanistan is second last — 181st out of 182 countries — in terms of human development .
That is why we no longer want this kind of “ help ” from the west .
Like many around the world , I am wondering what kind of “ peace ” prize can be awarded to a leader who continues the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan , and starts a new war in Pakistan , all while supporting Israel ?
The purpose of the Obama Administration ’s sociopathic escalation of war and occupation , death and destruction in Afghanistan and Pakistan is clearly not in the interests of the Afghan people .
It is clearly not in the interest of “ preventing the spread of international terrorism ” , as the aggressive occupation is not a fight against , but exponentially greater , propaganda for recruiting terrorists who actually have the means to commit international terrorism .
International terrorism is clearly defined in U.S. legal code as :
Activities that involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the U.S. or of any State , or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the U.S. or of any State ; appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population ; to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion ; or to affect the conduct of a government by assassination or kidnapping ; and occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. , or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished , the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce , or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum .
Shorty after 9/11 , Professor Noam Chomsky gave a talk , in which he articulated : “ We certainly want to reduce the level of terror , certainly not escalate it .
There is one easy way to do that and therefore it is never discussed .
Namely stop participating in it . ”
But that would , of course , only make sense if it were actually in the occupying powers ’ interests .

Prison guard Albert James Turner Jr. , accused of killing his wife and mother - in - law in Rosenberg , was captured Friday in Concord , N.C. , after more than two months on the run , the U.S. Marshals Service said .
Turner , 45 , was arrested without incident as he sat on a bench in a shopping mall around 12:45 p.m.
Houston time , Rosenberg police said .
Turner is accused of fatally stabbing his wife , Keitha Frank Turner , 39 , and his mother - in - law , Betty Jo Frank , 66 , after an argument on Dec. 27 .
Both women died of stab wounds to their faces and necks — injuries inflicted in front of several of Turner 's children , the U.S. Marshal 's Service said .
One of the children called 911 after the slayings occurred at the home of Turner 's in - laws in the 2400 block of Chestnut .
The sounds of children screaming could be heard in the background of the 911 call .
Turner 's father - in - law , pastor Gene Frank , who founded the Church of Living Waters and Living Water Christian School , was inside the home at the time of the killings and suffered minor injuries .
Turner , who worked at a Texas Department of Criminal Justice prison in Sugar Land , immediately fled the home .
A few days later , his Honda Accord was found in the Chattahoochee River in Georgia .
The search had been focused around Atlanta as well as the Orlando , Fla. , area , where Turner is known to have family .
Turner was added to the U.S. Marshal 's 15 Most Wanted last week and his case was scheduled to be profiled nationally on America 's Most Wanted Saturday night .
A tip led to Turner 's arrest after an America 's Most Wanted preview featuring Turner aired Friday morning on the Live with Regis and Kelly TV show as America 's Most Wanted host John Walsh appeared to celebrate his program 's 1,000th episode , the U.S. Marshal 's Service said .
“ Thanks to America 's Most Wanted and a viewer tip , Turner will now get a different perspective of what it is like to be in a prison , ” said John F. Clark , director of the U.S. Marshal 's Service .
“ The fact that he committed horrible crimes in front of his children makes his capture even more satisfying . ”
Turner will be extradited to Fort Bend County , where he will stand trial for the double slaying .
Rosenberg Police Chief Robert Gracia said the Frank family was notified of the arrest .
“ It 's a good day in Rosenberg , ” Gracia said .
“ We were notified by the Concord Police Department that they had arrested Turner , and we 're in the process of working with the federal authorities at the U.S. Marshal 's office to bring him back here to stand trial . ”

Ikävät puheenaiheet eivät katoa ennen kuin niitä koskevat ongelmat on ratkaistu .
Liigan viime kautta varjostaneet päähän kohdistuvat taklaukset ovat sellainen aihe .
Ilmiöön on syytä pureutua käytännön kautta , kyse on monimutkaisemmasta asiasta kuin usein annetaan ymmärtää .
The Supreme Court justices , hearing a 2nd Amendment challenge to Chicago ’s ban on handguns , signaled Tuesday that they were ready to extend gun rights nationwide , clearing the way for legal attacks on state and local gun restrictions .
The court ’s majority appears almost certain to strike down a Chicago ordinance and rule that residents have a right to a handgun at home .
Of U.S. cities , only Chicago and its Oak Park suburb have total bans on handguns .
But many cities and states have laws regulating who can have a gun and where they can take it .
Gun rights advocates have said they ’ve been waiting for the court ’s ruling in this case to begin challenging gun regulations nationwide .
At one point in Tuesday ’s argument , Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. noted the city ’s lawyers doubted that people had a right to carry concealed weapons in public .
“ Well , maybe that ’s right , ” Roberts said .
But he quickly added that the question could be left for a future case , indicating that the court was not likely to sweep away additional gun regulations in this ruling .
But the clear message from the argument is that a five - member majority on the court thinks the right “ to bear arms ” is a fundamental right , like the freedom of speech , that cannot be unduly restricted by federal regulations , state laws or city ordinances .
Two years ago , the justices in a 5 - 4 decision struck down a similar handgun ban in the District of Columbia -- a federal enclave -- saying for the first time that the federal government is restrained by the 2nd Amendment from preventing an individual from having a gun for self - defense .
In the Chicago case , the court is weighing whether to extend that protection to state and local jurisdictions .
In the ruling two years ago , the court also said reasonable regulations of guns were permitted in the District of Columbia .
The tenor of Tuesday ’s argument suggested it may take years of lawsuits to draw a line between an individual ’s right to have a gun for self - defense and the government ’s authority to set reasonable regulations .
Since 1982 , Chicago has enforced a strict ban on handguns , even for law - abiding residents who want to keep one at home .
The city ’s lawyer argued Tuesday that throughout American history , cities and states have enforced restrictions on weapons without much interference from federal judges .
“ Firearms are designed to injure and kill , ” and cities need to regulate them to protect the public ’s safety , James A. Feldman said .
But he ran into skeptical questions from the court ’s leading conservatives , who referred to their decision in the Washington , D.C. , case .
Shortly after that decision , gun rights advocates sued to challenge Chicago ’s ban on behalf of Otis McDonald and several other city residents .
The case forced the high court to confront a simple question it had never answered :
Does the 2nd Amendment limit only the federal government ’s authority over guns and state militias , or does it also give citizens nationwide a right to challenge their local and state gun laws ?
Since the District of Columbia is a not a state , the court ’s ruling in D.C. vs.
Heller left that issue unresolved .
But during Tuesday ’s arguments , the justices who formed the majority in the D.C. case said they had already decided that gun rights deserved national protection .
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the individual right to bear arms is a “ fundamental ” right , like the other protections in the Bill of Rights .
“ If it ’s not fundamental , then Heller is wrong , ” he said , referring to the D.C. ruling , which he joined .
Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito Jr. echoed the same theme .
At one point , Justice John Paul Stevens proposed a narrow ruling in favor of gun rights .
Two years ago , he dissented and said the 2nd Amendment was designed to protect a state ’s power to have a “ well regulated militia . ”
Now , however , Stevens said the court could rule that residents had a right to a gun at home , but not a right “ to parade around the street with a gun . ”
A lawyer representing the National Rifle Assn. scoffed at the idea and opposed a “ watered - down version ” of the 2nd Amendment .
Scalia also questioned the idea .
In his opinion two years ago , he described the right to bear arms as a right to “ carry ” a weapon in cases of “ confrontation . ”
Such a right would not be easily limited to having a gun at home .
The justices will meet behind closed doors to vote this week on the case of McDonald vs. Chicago .
It may be late June before they issue a written ruling .

In today 's edition of far - out science , researchers have found evidence that the wafting aroma of food has an effect on an organism 's lifespan -- and they 've demonstrated that interfering with a fruit fly 's sense of smell causes it to live a longer , healthier life .
While there 's no guarantee that the trick would work for humans , optimistic researchers
suggest that certain odors — or drugs that block us from sensing them — might one day help prevent disease and extend lives [ ScienceNOW ] .
In the past decade , scientists have established a clear connection between extremely low - calorie diets and extended lifespans ; studies have demonstrated that yeast , fruit flies , mice , and monkeys on these diets live longer than their peers .
While the exact mechanism at work is n't yet clear , researchers suspect that a near - starvation diet causes an organism 's metabolism to slow down , and triggers other changes that evolved to help organisms survive in times when food was scarce .
Now scientists say it may not be just what a creature eats , but also what it smells that has an effect on how long it lives .
In one 2007 study , molecular biologist Scott Pletcher and his colleagues found that completely eliminating fruit flies ' sense of smell caused them to live nearly 20 percent longer than normal flies .
They also found that wafting the smell of yeast , a tasty treat for fruit flies , towards flies that were on a low - cal , live - extending diet hastened the death of those flies .
This led the scientist to hypothesize that specific odors might be influencing the flies ’ lifespans .
Luckily , other scientists had identified a receptor in a group of neurons that enable fruit flies to smell carbon dioxide , which signals the presence of a good meal of tasty yeast
[ ScienceNOW ]
.
So , Pletcher and his team set out to find if the CO2 had anything to do with the duration of the flies ' lives .
For the new study published in PloS Biology , Pletcher eliminated the fruit flies ’ ability to smell carbon dioxide , while keeping the rest of the olfactory system intact .
Even on a standard , full - calorie diet , the flies that could n't detect CO2 lived up to 30 percent longer than other flies .
The researchers suggest that the absense of CO2 may have indicated to the altered flies that food was scarce in the environment , prompting them to snap into survival mode .
Oddly , however , the life - extending effect was only seen in female flies -- male flies gained no such benefit .
The smell - deprived female flies also seemed healthier and stronger by several measures :
They stored extra fat , produced more offspring , and proved to be more resistant to oxidative stress than normal flies .
Pletcher is n’t sure how the inability to smell CO2 extended the females ’ lifespans , but he says the findings open up fascinating new areas for studies of human aging .
He suggests that there might be certain smells or drugs that would block certain odors , and which could give humans a bit more time before we shuffle off our mortal coils .
Matt Karberlein , an aging expert who was n't involved in Pletcher 's research , was cautiously optimistic about that possibility , saying :
“ We definitely undergo physiological changes in response to smelling food – I ’m getting hungry just thinking about it – so I think it ’s possible ” [ New Scientist ] .

Buzz is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly noisy social media world .
Why do I think it ’s superior to Twitter , Facebook , and Friendfeed ?
Let ’s take the easiest comparison first :
Buzz vs. Friendfeed
Right now , Buzz basically is Friendfeed but with immediately greater penetration .
Real conversations with more people .
[ BTW I know I have Buzz on the brain because I just tried to create italics in this blog post _this way _ ]
( Crazed Hulk Scobleizer ) by Thomas Hawk
One interesting difference though , is that people seemed to like the 3.0 aggregator aspect of Friendfeed but :
Advertisement Continue Reading Below
Buzz users hate noise , and They unfollow people who add Twitter and Friendfeed streams to their Buzz streams .
Buzz beats Friendfeed because Buzz is bigger .
Buzz vs. Twitter
As much as I loved Twitter in 2008 , I loved it less in 2009 when celebrities took over , and I can take it or leave it now that it ’s all botted - out .
( Twitter peeps ) by Thomas Hawk
I still tweet people and @reply them .
What I find so dissatisfying is how short and superficial the conversations are .
It ’s a great place for a quick joke or comment , but 140 characters is limiting , and a lot of conversations end more quickly than Buzz conversations .
Advertisement Continue Reading Below
This blog post ’s many cool quotes ( below ) are substantial because they came from a Buzz conversation .
If they were tweets , they would n’t stick to your ribs so much .
Another advantage Buzz has is that you can see how many people are likely to hear you if you comment , and the gmail integration ensures people will return to reply .
Buzz beats Twitter because Buzz has :
Longer , more substantial conversations , with More replies and More attention from participants .
Buzz vs Facebook
As I ’ve said , people seem less tolerant of noise on Buzz .
No pokes , Zombie kisses , or farming games on Buzz .
There ’s less downside for ADD folks ( and some research suggests that computer multitasking makes our brains temporarily ADD even if we ’re not genetically that way ) .
Less distraction means more focused interaction , and more likelihood of substantial conversation .
Portrait of Buzz by Thomas Hawk
As my fellow Buzzer Thomas Lucas says :
Facebook is very social and “ everyone is on it ” but it is becoming MySpace really fast .
I think the future of real social interactivity and news will be buzz .
You can have conversations that are real - time and in order - you do n’t have to keep scrolling / clicking to find out what tweet people are answering .
And the “ no frills ” of Google will HOPEFULLY keep the farms , mafias and daily horoscopes out of buzz .
Tweet your “ thoughts ” , plant some crops and talk to that “ hot girl ” from high school on Facebook and keep buzz for news and conversations .

More comparisons from Myrna Weinreich :
Love Buzz , not sure exactly why but ‘ deeper ’ , richer than FF and definitely more than FB which is usually ( not always ) a superficial ‘ hey there , whatcha doin ’ .
And down the road , if ads come to Buzz they ’ll likely be AdWords text ads , which are much less distracting that the image / banner ads we see on other social platforms .
AdWords text ads are semantically relevant , and tend to be more of a service to the user than other ad types .
Relevant ads wo n’t diminish conversation as much as other ad types on other social sites do .
Buzz beats Facebook because Buzz protects conversations from noise and spam .
Change , Social Platform Identity , and Survival
It does seem that MySpace - ification is a danger for all social networks .
As soon as you try to make the social platform a place where people can live their entire lives , you junk it up , and the noise obstructs real interaction .
No Dumping by Observe The Banana

Twitter has stayed focused , but their API lets in a lot of noise .
Hopefully Buzz will remain focused and add the connected sources filter Buzzers are asking for ( so they can follow you but filter out your tweets , if they like ) .
Here are a few a the things Robert Scoble wants from Buzz , many of them related to noise :
# 1 . I need noise filters .
# 2 . I need noise filters .
# 3 . I need noise filters .
# 4 . I need noise filters .
# 5 . I need noise filters .
Oh , sorry , my Twitter import just barfed .
Let ’s start again . # 1 . I need a way to remove Tweets .
All Tweets .
I have n’t seen a single Tweet that is not noise here .
# 2 . I need a way to remove whenever Jesse Stay talks about FriendFeed .
That ’s noise .
# 3 . I need a way to remove all the reposts of Mashable or Techcrunch items .
That ’s noise .
# 4 . I need a way to only display items that get engagement .
That would remove noise .

Here ’s another post about noise and Smart Filtering .
Louis Gray mentioned a ProBlogger ( Darren Rowse ) post about defriending most of his Facebook friends , because he ’s shifting FB use from blog promotion back to its original friend / personal usage .
Andy Beard is experimenting with leaving Twitter ( he ’s not the first and wo n’t be the last ) .
Do these two movements mean anything larger ?
Most assuredly they underscore that everything changes .
In the midst of this change , the social platform that enables conversation and protects us from noise and spam will enjoy the greatest success .
Different Strokes for Different Folks
Ultimately , as cool as the versus metaphor is , it ’s not about one platform winning , but each one having strengths , and each attracting an audience that prefers that communication style :
Something I think alot of people forget is that the very nature of each of these apps / sites is different , and attracts a different audience .
Of course , there is always some crossover , but my own audience is quite different in each of the properties ..
Just because of the variability of the features / formats , etc .
A lot of people make the mistake of just dumping anything and everything to every social media outlet ( Scoble , Pirillo , etc ) .
The real key for businesses is to have content keyed / tweaked to each of the sites .
Engaging in conversation appropriate to each of the mediums as it were .

Slash pulled off the ultimate act of defiance on " The Tonight Show with Jay Leno " last night -- dude rocked a Team Coco pin on the air during his performance at the end of the show !
There was pushing , profanity and even punches thrown ; at one point on Friday , the police had to be called in to help regulate the crowd .
Just blame it on the potent combination of unseasonably warm weather , a holiday weekend and thousands of Torontonians trying to get to Toronto Island .
That , and the fact that just one puny , puttering ferry was available to haul everyone across .
" It was very busy , much busier than normal , " said Corbin , the first mate of Ongiara , the 220 - passenger ferry .
" We were not really prepared for the crowd , basically . "
Lineups at the ferry docks stretched past the ticket gates as people waited for up to three hours before leaving dry land .
People became so frustrated they were rushing onto the boat or jumping queues .
At least one fist fight broke out Friday , Corbin said .
" ( People were ) very impatient , " he said .
" Rude to me , rude to the captain .
They were swearing at the deckhand , calling him a lazy bum and using the f- word . "
But many were angry at having to wait hours for a boat when several larger ones were sitting nearby .
" I wonder how long it takes to get a boat ready for water ? " said Emma Ditchburn of Hamilton .
" The city knew the weather was going to be brilliant and that meant more people going across ( to the island ) .
Why not get the other boats ready ? "
Yona Joo , a Korean student learning English in Toronto , and her friends waited two hours Saturday afternoon before reaching the front of the line .
Even then , they were n't able to make the next ferry .
" Why is there only one ( boat ) in use ... why not these ? " she asked , pointing to three others docked metres away .
" It 's so unfair , " she said .
" I wo n't be able to go ( back to the island ) again and I 'm leaving for Korea soon . "
Ongiara is still running on its winter schedule , which means one trip every hour , but because of the crowds , crew members were running the boats every half - hour .
It takes roughly 15 minutes to get to the islands , with a round trip taking 30 minutes .
For crew members , this meant working straight through their eight - hour shifts .
Captain Tom Millard said he empathized with the passengers but there was little he or his crew members could do .
" It 's understandable they 're annoyed .
However , we can't make the boat bigger , " he said .
" As front - line service providers , we are not responsible for the decisions made by management . "
Some employees working the docks said it was possible to have one of the bigger boats running this weekend but management never made the call .
But according to James Dann , manager of waterfront parks for the city , there is little flexibility to change operations on short notice .
Ferry schedules are drawn up six months in advance and , at that point , " you are not expecting the first week of April to be so beautiful and sunny . "

" Our boats are yet to be certified by Transport Canada and the bulk of our staff recall will be in the next two weeks , " Dann said .
" We have some full - time staff but most of our staff is seasonal . "
Referring to Friday night 's incident on the Ward 's Island dock when police were called , he said passengers usually do n't get unruly .
" I guess when the weather turned ( cooler ) , there was a crush of people wanting to go back home , " he said .
" There were some people who jumped ahead in line and there was chaos . "
What are the haps my friends
According to this view , The Crazy Line separates their rhetoric from violent behavior .
Their rhetoric is n’t crazy .
Crazy is something that needs to be added to make the leap from their sane and rational rhetoric to violent behavior .
But this view does n’t hold up to analysis .
If one looks at the rhetoric of these right - wing politicians and pundits , one sees that the crazy is already there , and the leap from the rhetoric to violence requires no additional crazy , but can be made using logic and rational thinking .
The politicians and pundits have already done the heavy lifting ; they ’ve already crossed The Crazy Line .
Walking the additional distance from the rhetoric to violent action is easy .
Going that extra distance may even be required by logic .
What is a rational , reasonable response if you are a patriotic citizen who believes that America is under attack from within , and that Maoist forces are on the verge of destroying your way of life and replacing it with some socialist nightmare ?
What do you do if you are told your country is on the verge of totalitarianism , that the freedoms you have enjoyed as a birthright are about to be taken away from you , the US Constitution nullified , and your rights abrogated ?
What is a rational , reasonable response if the institutions of democracy have been compromised ?
What can you do when the government is filled with treasonous conspirators who disdain established traditions and rules and cram oppressive legislation down your throat ?
What can you do when your president ’s loyalty to the country is questionable and he is clearly sympathetic to foreign enemies who want to destroy America ?
What can you do when the courts are packed with ideological schemers bent on pushing a radical agenda ?
What can you do when the government no longer listens to the people ?
What choices do you have ?
Do you do nothing while you and your children are reduced to slavery ?
Surely you must act .
Surely you must stand up and demand things be made right .
But what use is that when government no longer listens to the will of the people ?
What can you do when America ’s sacred political institutions have been hijacked by America ’s enemies ?
You must do something .
You have a responsibility to do something .
Have past generations not risen up in arms to defend their freedom ?
Have they not been willing to kill and die to preserve our way of life ?
If our nation is facing an existential threat from within , then does n’t every freedom - loving , patriotic American citizen have a responsibility to fight back ?
If you accept all these premises , then violent insurrection is the logical , natural , patriotic , and right thing to do .
It ’s time to get your gun and take a stand .
It ’s time to do something about the enemies of America , before they destroy everything we hold dear .
There ’s nothing crazy about drawing that conclusion .
It ’s the premises that are crazy in the first place .
All of these wild , baseless , idiotic claims about the Democrats being hell - bent on destroying our country and our way of life – claims made not because the claimant believes them , but because he is a cynical prick who derives some political or financial benefit from other , stupider people believing them – are the source of the crazy .
No additional crazy is required .
No , Mr. Pundit and Ms. Politician , you ’ve already crossed The Crazy Line .
Anybody who has followed you across that line can now logically and rationally conclude that they must act bravely and decisively for the sake of the country .
The leap from your rhetoric to violent action is a rational leap , perhaps a required leap for any true American .
You brought the crazy with you on your long , lucrative trip to the frontier of reality ; it is n’t a missing ingredient necessary to transform your rational words into bloody violence .
All that ’s required for the transition to violent behavior is to listen carefully to what you ’re saying , believe that it is true , and muster a little courage .
So do n’t be too sure that if something horrible happens , you will not be held accountable in a court of law .
You brought the crazy , you own it .
Debate with Steve Easterbrook
We explore the mutual incomprehension across the climate emails divide
By Steve Easterbrook and George Monbiot , republished on Monbiot.com , 8th April 2010
The computer scientist Steve Easterbrook wrote an interesting critique of my approach to the hacked climate emails .
This prompted me to write a column about the two cultures , and our inability to understand each other .
Steve has now taken up the baton again , and I ’ve responded to him .
These comments were first published on Steve ’s blog , where you can also read what other people have to say about the controversy and follow the links in Steve ’s piece .
Steve writes :
My exposé of why academics ’ private emails sometimes seem cranky has gotten a lot of attention .
Joe Romm posted it at ClimateProgress , where it generated many comments , many expressing thanks for saying what needed to be said .
George Monbiot posted a comment , pointing out that for a journalist , FoI laws are sacred : a hard won concession that allows them to fight the secrecy that normally surrounds the political establishment .
So there ’s clearly some mutual incomprehension between the two cultures , academic and journalistic .
For journalists , FoI is a vital weapon to root out corruption in a world where few people can be trusted .
For scientists , FoI is a blunt instrument , unneeded in a world where honesty and trust are the community norms , and data is freely shared as much as is practically possible .
George expands this theme on his blog , and I appear to have shifted his perspective on the CRU emails , although perhaps not as far as I might have hoped .
His thesis is that scientists and journalists have each formed a closed culture , leading each to be suspicious ( and worse ) of the other .
Well , I think this is not strictly accurate .
I do n’t think either culture is walled in .
In fact , I ’m beginning to think I overstated the case in my original post : scientists are certainly not “ walled in like an anchorite ” .
Pretty much every scientist I know will happily talk at length to anyone who shows an interest in their work , and will nearly always share data and code with anyone who is engaged in honest scientific work .
For our own research into software quality , we have obtained source code , datasets , software bug histories , and extensive access for interviews in every climate modeling centre we have approached .
Unfortunately , scientists tend to be way too focussed ( obsessed ? ) for most people ’s taste , so lay people do n’t generally want to talk to them in the first place .
But scientists will accept into the community anyone who ’s willing to work at it ( after all most of us spend a lot of time training students ) , as long as they show the necessary commitment to the scientific process and the pursuit of truth .
Traditional investigative journalism used to share these values too , but this tradition now seems to be another endangered species .
The experience when scientists talk to journalists is usually more about the journalist seeking a sensationalist angle to sell a story , rather than a quest for understanding .
And a reliance on false balance rather than weighing up the evidence .
So there is a bit of a gulf between the two cultures , but its not insurmountable , and there are plenty of examples of good science reporting to show that people regularly do bridge this gulf .
No , the real story is not the relationship between science and the media at all .
It ’s the story of how the media has been completely taken in by a third group , a third culture , consisting of ideologically - driven , pathological liars , who will say almost anything in order to score political points , and will smear anyone they regard as an opponent .
Stern calls climate change the greatest ever failure of the free markets .
I think that looking back , we may come to regard the last six months as the greatest ever failure of mass media .
Or alternatively , the most successful disinformation campaign ever waged .
At the centre of this story are people like Marc Morano and Jim Inhofe .
They have n’t a clue what science is ; to them it ’s just one more political viewpoint to attack .
They live in a world of paranoid fantasies , where some secret cabal is supposedly trying to set up a world government to take away their freedoms .
Never mind that every credible scientific body on the planet is warning about the wealth of evidence we now have about the risk of dangerous climate change .
Never mind that the IPCC puts together one of the most thorough ( and balanced ! ) state - of - the - art surveys ever undertaken in any scientific field .
Never mind that the newest research suggests that these assessments are , if anything , underestimating the risk .
No , these people do n’t like the message , and so set out to attack the messengers with a smear campaign based on hounding individual scientists for years and years until they snap , and then spreading stories in the media about what happens when the scientists tell them to piss off .
Throughout all this , in underfunded labs , and under a barrage of attacks , scientists have done their job admirably .
They chase down the uncertainties , and report honestly and accurately what they know .
They doggedly compile assessment reports year after year to present the mass of evidence to anyone who cares to listen .
It simply beggars belief that journalists could , in 2010 , still be writing opinion pieces arguing that the scientists need to do a better job , that they are poor communicators , that we need more openness and more data sharing .
That these themes dominate the reporting is a testament to how effective the disinformation campaign has been .
The problem is not in the science , or with scientists at all , nor with a culture gap between science and the media .
The problem is with this third group , the disinformers , who have completely dominated the framing of the story , and how honest journalists have been completely taken in by this framing .
How did they do it ?
Well , one crucial element of their success is their use of FoI laws .
By taking the journalists ’ most prized weapon , and wielding it against climate scientists , they achieved a whole bunch of successes all at once .
They got journalists on their side , because journalists have difficulty believing that FoI laws could be used for anything other than good old - fashioned citizen democracy .
They got the public on their side by appearing to be the citizens fighting the establishment .
They set up the false impression that scientists have stuff to hide , by ignoring the vast quantities of open data in climate science , and focussing on the few that were tied up with commercial licence agreements .
And they effected a denial of service attack by flooding a few target scientists with huge numbers of FoI requests .
Add to this the regular hate mail and death threats that climate scientists receive , and you have a recipe for personal meltdowns .
And the media lapped up the story about personal meltdowns , picked it up and ran with it , and never once asked whose framing they were buying into .
And the result is that , faced with one of the greatest challenges humanity has ever faced , the media got the story completely backwards .
Few journalists and few scientists seem to have any conception of how this misinformation campaign works , how nasty these people are , and how dirty they play .
They have completely owned the story for the last few months , with their framing of “ scientists making mistakes ” and “ scientists distorting their data ” .
They ’ve successfully portrayed the scientists as being at fault , when it is the scientists who are the victims of one of the nastiest public bullying campaigns ever conducted .
History will have to judge how it compares to other such episodes ( McCarthyism would make a fascinating comparator ) .
And the stakes are high : at risk is our ability to make sensible policy choices and international agreements based on good scientific evidence , to ensure that our children and grandchildren can flourish as we do .
We ’re fucking this up bigtime , and it ’s not the scientists who are at fault .
George writes :
Hi Steve ,
Thanks for this .
Another interesting post , though this time I think that you ’re the one who has got the story backwards .
Apart from anything else you ’ve got the sequence of events wrong .
The FoI applications started to come in only after several years in which Phil Jones and CRU had frustrated requests for information .
We did n’t have an FoI Act in this country until 2005 ( and we still use chipped flints to cut up our dinner ) .
In fact Jones made it clear that he was afraid of FoI because he would n’t be able to block such requests any more .
Here are three examples :
1 . “ The two MMs have been after the CRU station data for years .
If they ever hear there is a Freedom of Information Act now in the UK , I think I ’ll delete the file rather than send to anyone …
We also have a data protection act , which I will hide behind .
Tom Wigley has sent me a worried email when he heard about it – thought people could ask him for his model code .
He has retired officially from UEA so he can hide behind that .
IPR should be relevant here , but I can see me getting into an argument with someone at UEA who ’ll say we must adhere to it ! ”
http://www.eastangliaemails.com/emails.php?eid=490
2 . “ If FOIA does ever get used by anyone , there is also IPR to consider as well .
Data is covered by all the agreements we sign with people , so I will be hiding behind them . ”
http://www.eastangliaemails.com/emails.php?eid=485&filename=1106338806.txt
3 . “ I ’m getting hassled by a couple of people to release the CRU station temperature data .
Do n’t any of you three tell anybody that the UK has a Freedom of Information Act ! ”
http://www.eastangliaemails.com/emails.php?eid=498&filename=1109021312.txt
To begin with , the FoI requests , like the previous applications for data , were few in number .
It was only after they were blocked using bureaucratic obfuscation of the kind that could scarcely be better designed to make people furious that – in July 2009 – Steve McIntyre organised a mass application campaign .
CRU Refuses Data Once Again
He managed to generate 58 requests .
But even that brought the total number of requests to just 105 , across five years , many of which were received AFTER the hacked emails story broke .
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/25032/response/66822/attach/2/Response%20letter%20199%20100121.pdf
As the former Information Commissioner Richard Thomas pointed out to parliament , this is n’t a great deal and did not in his view amount to a campaign of harassment .
Though I think it ’s fair to say that the McIntyre requests could be classified as vexatious .
In either case , CRU was able to refuse the 58 requests McIntyre organised without breaking much sweat .
Jones , as far as I can tell , did n’t have to deal with these requests himself : they appear to have been handled by CRU / UEA administrators , who just threw them all back in the water .
I do n’t see evidence here of “ a denial of service attack by flooding a few target scientists with huge numbers of FoI requests . ”
Remember , if CRU had n’t blocked the early requests for data , none of this would have happened .
With best wishes , George
Steve writes :
George : Good points – I ’ve conflated a number of things , and you ’re right “ flooding with FoI requests ” is not strictly accurate .
What I meant to say was that the FoI requests were just the most visible part of a much longer campaign , going back at least a decade .
When Phil Jones writes “ The two MMs have been after the CRU station data for years ” it ’s clear that we ’re coming late into an ongoing battle , and Jones is already pretty pissed off with the whole thing .
Taken out of context , the email reads like an attempt to cover up misdeeds .
But in the context of many years harassment by people who have no interest in constructive criticism , a long track record in misrepresenting the science , and no obvious sign of ever backing off , well , it looks much more like letting off steam in private with trusted colleagues ( particularly as there ’s no evidence that he ever did destroy any data ) .
It ’s clear from reading the accounts from Mann and Santer that they were under constant bombardment , and that they ’d already come to understand that rebutting each criticism is pointless .
Mann and Santer have been much more effective in getting their side of the story on record ; Jones has n’t communicated this so well , and I think he has been slow to understand the game that was being played , and a little foolish in what he said about it in the emails .
But it ’s wrong to say that if the CRU had n’t blocked the early requests for data none of this would have happened .
The original station data was tied up with restrictive licenses , because it ’s commercially useful in the forecasting community .
It ’s not clear that Jones could ever have handed this over to M&M , and in the early days , it appears Jones offered constructive suggestions for how to get hold of the data directly from source ( as the CRU never owned this data in the first place ) .
But M&M saw this as a smokescreen , and went on the attack , and things just went downhill from there .
The real story that needs to be told is why M&M went after Jones in the first place .
John Mashey has been investigating who they work with and why ; his dossier is here :
http://www.desmogblog.com/sites/beta.desmogblog.com/files/plagiarism%20conspiracies%20felonies%20v1%200%201.pdf
and DeepClimate has been exploring how M&M systematically distort the evidence – see for example :
McClimategate continues :
Yet another false accusation from McIntyre and McKitrick
I remain convinced that the more important story is an examination of the motivation and sponsorship for M&M ’s attacks , the impacts they have had on the scientists who have been the victims , and an account of how the science has stood up robustly to everything they ’ve thrown at it .
I do n’t think endless examinations of the contents of Phil Jones ’ emails serves any useful purpose .
And given that none of this changes the science in anyway whatsoever , I can only conclude that as a way of distracting everyone ’s attention , it has been a remarkably successful propaganda exercise .
George writes :
Hi Steve ,
I have n’t yet read the Mashey report , which I will do now .
But do n’t the emails suggest that M&M might actually have been right to believe that the restrictive licences were , at least in part , a smokescreen ? :
“ If FOIA does ever get used by anyone , there is also IPR to consider as well .
Data is covered by all the agreements we sign with people , so I will be hiding behind them . ”
Here ’s what Jones told another requester :
“ Even if WMO agrees , I will still not pass on the data .
We have 25 or so years invested in the work .
Why should I make the data available to you , when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it . ”
http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/memo/climatedata/uc3502.htm
And should n’t we be concerned that commercial considerations are getting in the way of the free flow of information ?
Is that not antithetical to the open society and the spirit of scientific inquiry ?
It ’s something I ’ve campaigned against in other areas : particularly the patenting of genetic material .
I react against it for two reasons : first that it ’s an enclosure of a common ( and in this case publicly - funded ) resource , secondly that it ’s the kind of convenient excuse everyone in authority hides behind these days , when there ’s something they do n’t want to tell us .
( Sorry , I ca n’t tell you that – security you know , er , health and safety , er commercial confidentiality ) .
Here in the UK the terms of the stealthy privatisation of almost the entire public sector ( the Private Finance Initiative ) were kept secret from the public on the grounds of commercial confidentiality .
I campaigned against that excuse for years .
Only by using the FOIA , and by harassing the bastards mercilessly , did we finally open up that can of worms , by which time it was all too late .
I hope this gives you more of an idea of why my gut response is different from yours .
Steve writes :
George ,
Yes , the emails make it quite clear Jones does n’t want to hand over his data , and is prepared to use any excuse not to .
At face value , it certainly looks like he ’s got something to hide .
But what ?
His work on the temperature reconstructions is sound , as has been shown by other reconstructions .
The allegations made by M&M about temperature biases in surface station selection were clearly shown to be wrong by several independent analyses , including work by Tamino :
http://tamino.wordpress.com/2010/02/25/false-claims-proven-false/
by Wood and Steig :
http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/12/are-the-cru-data-suspect-an-objective-assessment/
and many others .
There ’s nothing wrong with any of the data , nor any of the science from Jones ’ team at the CRU .
So why does Jones act in the emails like someone who wants to hide evidence ?
The only reasonable explanation is that he wants to withhold the data because he ’s quite simply fed up with the constant baseless attacks .
Ben Santer had already warned him how much time and effort it takes having to correct misrepresentations of their work .
Refusing to cooperate with time - wasters is completely rational .
We can argue whether in the long run this was a good idea ; we can argue over what strategy scientists might best adopt in this situation .
But the fact is that Jones chose the path of withholding his data , motivated partly by anger and partly by the desire to protect his time .
Bear in mind of course , that releasing datasets requires a non-trivial amount of work ( to define the meta - data , and document the processing that has occurred ) , and often will still be useless to anyone else anyway .
Bob Grumbine explains why :
http://moregrumbinescience.blogspot.com/2009/11/data-set-reproducibility.html
http://moregrumbinescience.blogspot.com/2010/03/what-should-be-reproducible.html
The normal practice is for other labs to get hold of the raw data independently and do their own reconstructions .
So when someone comes along demanding the data , because they want to find flaws in work that ’s already been thoroughly replicated elsewhere , and is known to be sound , well , they ’re just timewasters .
And yes , there is a bigger context here – this science is fundamentally important for public policymaking , and must withstand a much higher degree of scrutiny than normal .
Phil Jones might be guilty of not grasping this bigger issue , but then I do n’t think many people have put much thought into how we do this .
The climate modelers I ’ve spoken to cannot defend their software practices , nor can they adequately demonstrate they are using best practices ( comparable , say with the best in the commercial software world ) .
However , when you look at what they do , it turns out to be phenomenally good .
The problem is n’t that the code is n’t subjected to scrutiny ; the problem is that it ’s subjected to so much scrutiny in so many ways by so many people that nobody can give a coherent account of all of these , nor how they add up ( I ’ve made it my research goal to produce such an account for software development practices of climate scientists – I hope others can do the same for the data handling practices ) .
Bottom line :
There are two hypotheses for why Jones talks this way in the emails : ( 1 ) because he has something nefarious to hide or ( 2 ) because he ’s fed up with people wasting time and making unfounded allegations , and wants nothing to do with them .
Hypothesis 1 depends on there being something wrong with his work , but the reconstructions show it ’s sound .
So we have to go with hypothesis 2 .
BTW I agree completely with your comments about commercial considerations getting in the way of the free flow of information in the science community .
Unfortunately , this is a result of lack of funding , particularly of meteorological research .
Many weather services around the globe ( the Met Office included ) gain part of their funding from selling commercial forecasting services , and there is tough competition for some of the bigger customers .
The dataset that M&M are after is drawn from meteorological services in many different countries , and many of them place different restrictions on it to protect their interests ( several countries , including Canada , have refused to release their portions ) .
Most of this , Jones and the CRU have no control over ; when they obtained the data from these many different sources they had to sign agreements to respect confidentiality .
Part of Jones frustration is the amount of effort it took to do this ( hence his response that M& M go collect the data from these various sources themselves ) .
We ’d all much prefer meteorological data data to be free and open – it would make our lives much easier .
But we ’re faced with constant pressure on universities and government research labs to prove their value by commercializing the outcomes of their research , and by selling services .
A growing proportion of the research is no longer publically funded – it ’s funded by industrial research grants and by income earned on “ intellectual property ” .
We ’re going to have to untangle the mess that free market ideology has made of our public research institutions to fix this problem .
The real irony is that the those on the rightwing who have been most active in pushing this commercialization of research labs are now the ones screaming most loudly about freeing the data .
George writes :
Thanks for this Steve .
I think you make a good case for what Jones ’s motivation might have been ( and I wish to God that he or the university had come forward at an early stage to explain it : the mishandling of this crisis is a whole other saga ) .
If true , it sounds like a tragedy straight out of a Hardy novel – Jude the Obscure or Tess of the Durbervilles perhaps – misplaced action , misunderstood intentions , letters under the doormat .
I ’m prepared to believe that Jones is a good man who , partly because of the constraints he was under , made a series of disastrous tactical errors .
On this account he emerges as a tragic figure , in the classical sense .
But , as Hardy shows , ultimately it ’s the actions , not the intentions that count .
This is what we end up being judged by , and why it is so important both to act strategically and to act as if the world is watching .
These days it probably is .
It remains possible to praise the intention and condemn the action .
Though he might have been acting with good intentions I still believe that what Jones did was wrong – and offensive to democratic values .
The points you make about commercial agreements are good ones .
I would love to see scientists use this crisis to campaign for proper public funding of climate science and an end to the jumblesale of public assets .
Robert : thanks for your points on this too .
Let ’s mobilise against these stultifying legal agreements and cost recovery arrangements .
George writes :
Hi Steve et al ,
I ’m reposting a comment by someone calling him or herself Gladiatrix , that has just turned up on the Guardian website .
It ’s pertinent to our discussion .
“ I am going to write this post as an experienced public sector lawyer who has lived through the introduction of the FoI Act and given extensive advice to various clients on its effects .
The FoI Act was clearly expressed from the outset to apply to all public sector bodies of every kind .
It was NEVER intended only to apply to HMG .
The assertion that it was is factually incorrect .
In other words , every body that is funded from the public purse or which carries out a public sector function is subject to the FoI Act and must comply with its provisions .
The FoI Act had a 5 year lead in period during which every public body had ample opportunity to put in place all and any necessary procedures , to appoint its Information Officer ( a statutory office ) and provide training to everyone concerned .
The UEA had and has no excuse .
Commercial agreements and non-disclosure agreements are not exempt from disclosure under the FoI Act and never have been .
They are covered by what is known as a qualified exemption only , i.e. they can be disclosed if the public interest requires disclosure .
All exemptions under the FoI Act are required to be interpreted under what is known as the Public Interest Test .
A public body may disclose a commercial agreement , and may indeed have a separate statutory obligation to do so and this will be upheld by the courts .
See : Veolia ES Nottinghamshire Ltd v Nottinghamshire County Council and Shlomo Dowen and Audit Commission [ 2009 ] EWHC 2382 ( Admin ) .
Under guidance issued by the Office of Government Commerce all public sector FoI contract clauses are expressed such that the public body may disclose commercial data and may consult with its contractor beforehand , but is under no obligation to do so .
This is a direct read across from the FoI Act .
All contractors try to have this clause changed to make consultation mandatory , only very inexperienced public sector officers would agree to this .
In short , UEA and its employees of all grades knew what the Act said , they knew what their legal obligations were , they knew what they could and could not disclose .
Professor Jones and his colleagues and his employers knowingly flouted the law of the land without any excuse whatsoever .
What is worse is that they bullied a junior employee ( who should have blown the whistle to the ICO and the Standards Board ) into allowing them to flout the law .
For myself I would dearly love to know what the UEA ’s legal advisers were doing while all this was going on , what they knew and when they knew it .
This it seems to me is a question that both the Law Society and the Solicitors Regulation Authority could usefully ask . ”

Steve writes :
George : I ’m still at a loss to understand how exactly he ’s supposed to have broken the law .
Gladiatrix ’s comment talks a lot about the nature of the law , and the obligations it places on public institutions , and then goes straight to a guilty verdict .
But , despite lots of sabre rattling in his emails , Phil Jones never deleted any information that was subject to FoI requests ( indeed , it seems he never deleted anything ) , and his institution used the appropriate processes to handle all the FoI requests .
The parliamentary enquiry found no instance in which anyone had broken FoI laws .
So , unless the law prevents people moaning about the FoI act and threatening to withhold information , there ’s nothing here .
No law was broken .
Which brings me back to my original point .
This is all a distraction .
We should n’t be focussing on Phil Jones ’ actions at all .
We should be looking at how the denialist machine is attempting to undermine solid science through these attack campaigns .
George – you wrote in your book about the similarity with the tactics used by the tobacco industry ( and indeed how many of the same players are involved ) .
Why are n’t we discussing how and why people like M&M are allowed to get away with a continual campaign of distraction and obfuscation , by trying to discredit scientists , and pick nits in a solid body of scientific research ?
What concerns me , is that you , along with many other journalists , are still stuck in M&M ’s preferred framing ( i.e. that they ’re sniffing out corruption in the science and trying to free the data ) , rather than recognizing that they set the whole thing up as a smear campaign and that it was never about the data in the first place ?
George writes :
Steve , surely incitement is an offence , regardless of whether anyone acted on that incitement ?
But my intention in reposting that comment was not to turn this into a legalistic discussion , but simply to remind us that commercial confidentiality , the issue we had been discussing , does not automatically exempt you from the FoI Act .
And sure , let ’s also discuss the campaign of distraction and obfuscation : as you know , I have spent much of my career doing just that .
But to retain the moral high ground we have to be sure that we ’ve got our own house in order .
That means demanding the highest standards of scientific openness , transparency and integrity .
Blocking , “ hiding behind ” , urging deletions , regardless of the pressures at play , do n’t meet those standards .
Steve writes :
George ,
So this is what it comes down to ?
Suggesting , in a moment of weakness , that emails should be deleted is now a resigning offense ?
And in the context of an information warfare , where the reason for the suggestion was to avoid further abuse by denialists , rather than to conceal anything ?
And even then , as nothing ever was deleted , and we ’re only seeing carefully selected portions of the email conversation , presumably good judgment eventually prevailed ?
You ’re setting impossible standards for hard pressed scientists .
And that , I think , is the crux of the problem .
This argument that scientists should somehow be more virtuous is a huge fallacy .
Openness is a great virtue to strive for .
But it cannot ever be a standard by which we judge individual scientists .
For a start , no scientific field has ever achieved the levels of openness that are being demanded here .
The data is messy , the meta - data standards are not in place , the resources to curate this data are not in place .
You ’re falling for straight denialist logic here : that we ca n’t act on the science until every last bit of data is out in the public domain .
While , in truth , climate science has developed a better culture of data sharing , replication , and results checking than almost any other scientific field .
One datapoint to back this up : in no other field of computational science are there 25 + teams around the world building the same simulation models independently , and systematically comparing their results on thousands of different scenarios in order to understand the quality of those simulations .
We * should * demand from scientists that they do excellent science .
But we should * not* expect them to also somehow be superhuman .
This argument that scientists should never exhibit human weaknesses is not just fallacious , it ’s dangerous .
It promotes the idea that science depends on perfect people to carry it out , when in fact the opposite is the case .
Science is a process that compensates for the human failings of the people who engage in it , by a continual process of questioning evidence , re-testing ideas , replicating results , collecting more data , and so on .
Mistakes are made all the time .
Individual scientists screw up .
If they do n’t make mistakes , they ’re probably not doing worthwhile science .
It ’s vitally important that we get across to the public that this is how science works , and that the results of this process are more trustworthy than any other way of producing knowledge , precisely because the process is robust in the face of error .
In this particular case , calling for scientists to take the moral high ground , and to be more virtuous , is roughly the equivalent of suggesting that victims of sexual assault should act more virtuous .
And if you think this analogy is over the top , you have n’t understood the nature of the attacks on scientists like Mann , Santer , Briffa , and Jones .
Look at Jones now : he ’s contemplated suicide , he ’s on drugs just to help him get through the day , and more drugs to allow him to sleep at night .
These bastards have destroyed a brilliant scientist .
And you ’re arguing that the response is to be more virtuous .
Who needs women in office ?
Everyone .
That was the title of one of the more powerful panels held at this year 's Pennsylvania Progressive Summit , in Harrisburg , PA .
Sam Bennett , Women ’s Campaign Forum President / CEO and former congressional candidate , led the panel discussion which previewed several of the state 's female candidates and elected officials .
Largely discussing the various ways to get more women into public office , the candidates shared their personal stories on why they chose to run for office , how to personally fund your campaign , and discussed the reasons why more women in office is " essential to the health of our nation " .
In the first two videos , Sam Bennett and other panelists outline the major points on why we need more women in public office .
In the third video , Lois K .

( CNN ) -- Roars , growls and galloping hooves replaced music Tuesday on some of Mogadishu 's radio stations in a protest of a ban on music imposed by Islamic extremists .
Radio Shabelle , along with the stations Tusmo and Hornafrik , were responding to threats from Muslim militant groups that believe music is un-Islamic and want it prohibited .
Mogadishu's 14 private radio stations stopped playing music Tuesday after Hizbul al - Islam , an Islamic extremist group , issued a 10 - day ultimatum .
The threat was backed by the main militant group al - Shabaab , which has been linked to al Qaeda .
A statement from the National Union of Somali Journalists said several stations received calls , warning them that there would be consequences if they failed to comply with the ban within 10 days .
But the three stations decided to broadcast the noises instead of music .
Radio Shabelle announcers could be heard speaking on air , backed by the sounds of hooves , ocean waves , gunfire -- even the roars and growls of big cats .
A radio station director , who could not be identified because of safety concerns , said the stations were unhappy about the ban but were forced to comply " because of fear for our lives . "
A Somali journalist , who also asked not to be identified , said there is widespread fear that this marks the beginning of a wider plot by extremists to silence independent media .
He fears that female journalists may become the the next target .
Hizbul al - Islam is one of many rebel groups operating in the country .
The group has a complicated relationship with al - Shabaab ; between them , the two groups control much of Mogadishu , and several radio stations are in neighborhoods under their control .
Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991 .
Islamic militant groups are fighting the government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law , or Sharia .

Plastics became ubiquitous during the 20th century .
They were hot topics of industrial and academic research , and saw innumerable consumer applications .
While plastics can have a wide variety of mechanical properties , they are almost universally good insulators , both of heat and electricity .
But a paper out of the Pappalardo Micro and Nano Engineering Laboratories reports on a novel processing technique that aligns the polymer chains of polyethylene , which results in a material that has both a high thermal capacitance and a high electrical resistance .
The researchers forced the polyethylene to form into this aligned morphology by slowly drawing the fiber out of solution using the tip of an atomic force microscope .
The new fibrous form of polyethylene conducts heat well along the direction of the fibers — so well , it beats out many pure metals , including iron and platinum .
The resulting fiber was about 300 times more thermally conductive than normal polyethylene .
This surprising ability to move heat could find uses in any number of technologies that currently rely on metal as a heat transfer medium .
This new method differs from previous attempts at creating a more heat - conductive plastic in that it transforms the morphology of the underlying material instead of using an additive .
These prior attempts , while scalable , resulted in only modest gains , since there was high thermal resistance at the interface between the plastic and additive .
It 's not currently known how well , if at all , the process will be able to scale up to production .
So far , the team has only produced single fibers in the laboratory , but they hope to be able to scale up to macro - scale production of entire sheets of this material .

During an appearance on the radio show of Fox NewsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ Alan Colmes , prominent tea party leader Tom Tancredo made it clear he believes President Obama may not be an American citizen , Think Progress reported .
The former GOP congressman responded to questions about a statement he gave to a group of tea partiers : Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ If his wife says Kenya is his homeland , why donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t we just send him back ?
Ã¢â‚¬Â

Tancredo was referring to a speech by Michelle Obama in which she calls Kenya the president ’s “ home country . ”
The following is a partial transcript from the interview :
COLMES : Do you really believe Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ you know he was born in Hawaii right ?
TANCREDO : I have absolutely no idea where he was born .
COLMES : YouÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve seen he was born in Hawaii ; he was in two Hawaiian newspapers within two days of his birth .

TANCREDO : Anybody can put an article in a newspaper .
Just show me your birth certificate !
Later in the interview , Tancredo suggested the Obama administration will not release the president ’s birth certificate as a ploy to cast tea partiers in a negative light .
TANCREDO : Now they very well not want to show it because they want to propagate this whole thing that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s going on about birthers .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â ¦
They may be doing it for that reason ; I do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t know why they donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t want anyone to see it .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â ¦
They want it propagated because you know Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ

COLMES : It makes your party look nuts !
TANCREDO : Yeah well maybe that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s why they donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t produce document , I do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t know .

It does n’t look like the “ birther ” movement will dissipate any time soon .
Americans who deny that the president is a natural - born citizen are preparing to march on the capital May 29 to voice their concerns .
A bill in Arizona , which would require the Arizona secretary of state to review and approve a presidential candidate ’s birth certificate before letting the candidate ’s name appear on the state ballot , still awaits approval from the state senate .
And U.S. Senate candidate J.D. Hayworth has been critical of the “ birther bill ” not because the president has already proved his citizenship , but because the bill does n’t go far enough .
Hayworth said the bill should ensure that all politicians should be required to produce birth certificates , and not just presidential candidates .
# 28 : The Men ’s Bathhouse , by Albrecht Dürer
The Men ’s Bathhouse , by Albrecht Dürer , 1498
In The Complete Woodcuts of Albrecht Dürer by Dover Press .
This analysis copyright 2010 , Scott M. McDaniel
The Image
Last week I said that this time I ’d write about something old .
I hope 1498 qualifies .
Thanks to a timely birthday present from my brother , I ’m doing a woodcut by Albrecht Dürer , a German painter and engraver best known at the time for his highly skilled prints .
At Illuxcon a couple of years ago I saw some fantastic ink work by Ian Miller , like Castles .
He was kind enough to do a portfolio review for me , and during the process recommended that I start with Dürer .
So , here we are .
I chose The Men ’s Bath because we can clearly see the techniques Dürer used in the linework .
This in a medium in which the artist and craftsmen who then cut the blocks had to be aware of and consider every line , every mark .
We ’ll look at examples of how Dürer handled form of the body , textures like wood and stone , and background elements like buildings and trees .
He used hatching , feathering , and cross-hatching to establish values in what is basically a black and white medium .
While that medium may be woodcut , the principles apply equally well to inking with brush and pen today .
In this print I can see lines fulfilling several purposes :
Outline ( showing edges )
Shading ( showing values )
Texture ( indicating how objects might feel )
Form ( wrapping around objects )
Let ’s look at different parts of the print to see how Dürer has combined these purposes .
The People
Three people share the focus .
The first is the musician playing the flute , and the second and third are the men talking in the foreground .
Let ’s start out by taking a look at the musician .
Dürer surrounds the musician with a dark area so that the contrast with his face and figure makes him stand out .
We can see that the light source is in front of the figures and a bit to our left .
It ’s a key thing to decide before putting lines down so that he knew where to have the shading .
Look at the musician ’s arm and biceps on the right side .
We see a heavy line defining the outline .
In the right side of the arm , that line is crisp and clear on the arm side but a little less clear on the background side .
Also , we can see that the forearm is in front of the biceps because its line occludes ( interrupts ) the line of the biceps .
So , based on line weight and occlusion we ’re already getting a sense of form .
Now for the shading .
Dürer uses feathering to build up shadow .
Feathering ( also called hatching ) is a series of lines parallel to each other that , when viewed from a distance , combine to form grey .
Now , the darkness of that grey depends on how thick those lines are and how close together they are .
The musician ’s pectoral muscle on the chest is pretty dark because it is both in the shadow side generally and also under a shadow cast by the forearm .
So it ’s lines are thick and close together .
Compare that to the feathering on the forearm , where the lines are thinner and further apart .
The hatching does double duty because it lets Dürer show the form of the arm and chest there .
He curves the lines so that they seem to wrap around the forms , almost like a contour map .
This is a bedrock technique that ’s used extensively in comics today .
We ’ll look at more examples of it here shortly .
Finally , the musician ’s beard and cap are examples of how Dürer used lines for texture .
Let ’s also look at one of the men in conversation .
We can easily see the outline around him .
On the right side of the rib cage we see a thick line with a white line just inside it .
Since the hatching lines do n’t come right up to the outline , we see a little bit of reflected light .
Outlines are n’t just for the outside of the figure , though .
This kind of line symbolizes an edge , and we can see lots of internal edges .
As artists we have to decide which internal things merit a line and which do n’t .
Some of the things Dürer chose to give lines to include the eyes , mouth , nose , jawline , nipples , and veins in the hand .
He chose not to put down a single line for the cheekbone but instead used light hatching .
Like the cheekbone , Dürer handled the borders between muscle groups with shading .
On the figure ’s left side ( toward the light ) , we have open expanses of white .
The feathering is light , with thin lines .
As before , the lines both provide shadow and describe the muscle ’s form .
On the right side of the figure , where the shadow is darkest , we see some fine examples of cross hatching .
What I think is neat to note is that even when the areas of hatching intersect to form that cross hatch pattern , each individual set of lines is still describing a form .
On the lower part of that rib cage , for example .
the vertical lines show where the rib cage curves down into the abdomen while the horizontal lines show the curvature from the man ’s side to his mid-line .
Here ’s another shading technique .
Just above the rib cage ’s darkest part is some hatching heading up into the chest .
It ’s basically two columns of horizontal lines , though they do n’t connect ( except for a single line ) .
There are other examples of close - but - not - touching groups of hatching throughout the print .
There is relatively little texture on this person , but look at his hair wrap on the upper right side .
Perhaps those lines are edges that show each individual fold in the wrap .
As we get to the right side , though , they begin to merge into texture .
The Structures
Speaking of columns of hatching , take a look at the stones of the foreground wall .
On this stone we see outlines of the sides .
The light source is above the blocks , so we see no shading or texture on their upper surfaces .
The surface facing us , though , is in shade .
Overall we see a curved grain to the stone .
Inside that overall grain the groups of lines give us additional texture .
On the left half of the stone there are what look to be several white lines – they ’re formed by the border between the groups of feathered lines .
This is one way to get keep the overall grey value the same while still injecting some texture .
Another technique is to change the curvature of the lines , like Dürer does on the left side .
When using all these lines for shading , it ’s quite easy for everything to just start merging together into ill - defined blobs .
It gets hard to tell the different objects apart .
( I know this from personal experience . )
Thick outlines around objects help with this , but another important technique is to have the hatching lines go in different directions on different objects .
In the detail above , see how the plant ’s shading lines are generally up - and - down while the stone ’s shading lines are horizontal ?
Parts of the plant are white and therefore easy to see against the stone .
The parts that are in shade , though , have a shadow pattern that clearly differentiates the plant from the stone behind it .
Dürer also gives us some wooden structures , and these show the clearest use of lines that illustrate texture .
The first case is the water pump on the left side of the print .
Here the lines obviously depict not edges but the wood grain itself .
On the side we still see the wood grain pattern but the lines are closer together .
They ’re not any thicker , but the closer spacing makes the side of the block appear to be more in shadow .
Because the grain also follows the form of the wood , we can also say that these lines are doing triple duty : texture , shading , and form .
( As a side note , I have no idea if the German translation holds , but I wonder if Dürer was throwing in a little joke what with the placement of the water pump ’s spout next to the person behind it .
It even has a rooster as the handle .
I got a laugh out of it , anyway . )
Now let ’s look at a more complicated wooden structure , the join of beams in the shelter ’s roof .
Right here we all four purposes for the lines .
The beams have clear outlines around the edges .
There is an internal edge representing the crack in the beam coming in from the roof .
The thick and close lines of the roof thatching provide a dark value , while beams all have light and dark sides according to the light source .
We see the lines following the form of the thatching and curving around the beams .
So we do n’t confuse the structures , the lines on the various beams change direction at the borders between them or at the very least change curvature .
The horizontal beam in particular uses rows of feathering to both indicate shade and provide some texture .
We can see that it ’s a smooth surface overall , but kind of bumpy as well .
The Background
Dürer certainly put a fair amount of detail into the buildings back there .
As it turns out Dürer was one of those interested in perspective theories and did some writing on the topic , but at this point in the Renaissance they were still working out the details .
In this print , anyway , we do n’t see lines converging on a vanishing point .
Nevertheless we get a good sense of space and distance .
Dürer uses feathering to shade the buildings , and the direction of the hatch lines helps us tell the buildings apart .
Because they ’re in the distance , though , the objects are more flat than the people and structures in the foreground .
So , we do n’t see shading lines that curve around the buildings or define forms .
Even further back we see the hillside and trees .
These have no details and only the barest hint of shading .
Though he may not have used the term , that ’s clearly atmospheric perspective in play .
So , in this background detail we see Dürer using lines for outline and shading , but not form .
Actually , that ’s not entirely true .
The direction of the shading lines do help us distinguish the buildings ’ forms .
We can also see texture in the form of the bricks in the far wall and the indication of thatching ( that “ W ” on one of the roofs ) .
Before wrapping up I wanted to point out that while Dürer is certainly best known for his prints , he was a quite talented and well - rounded artist in other media as well .
Take a look at his gouache and watercolor hare , study for praying hands – more good hatching reference , and his self - portrait .
The Elements
To wrap up we ’ll go through Lee Moyer ’s Elements of a Successful Illustration .
Focus :
The main focus is on the flute player , which is helped by the contrast with the trees and bushes behind him .
His flute points to the left conversationalist , who we consider next .
Composition and Design : I did n’t go into composition , but Dürer ’s compositions were quite advanced .
Look at the placement of the figures , for example .
There are many triangles , like the one made by the heads of the observer on the left , the flute player , and the left conversationalist .
Then there is the one formed by the two conversationalists and the flute player .
The two musicans and the right conversationalist .
The beer guzzler and the… Well , you get the idea .
Sometimes objects like the flute or the beer tankard direct our eye , and other times its people ’s gazes .
Palette : Black .
Oh , and white too .
Value : Value happens with feathering and occasional cross hatching .
This kind of shading depends on the spacing and weight of the lines as well as a certain distance from the picture .
Mass : Lines wrap around bodies and structures .
Combined with shading we see volume and mass .
Texture :
We see wood , stone , thatch , bricks , plants , and fabric .
All of these have their distinct textures , all accomplished with lines .
Symbolism : Dürer produced lots of religious work , along with the religious symbolism common at the time .
As others did , he would work local dignitaries into those pictures to enhance their social status .
I ’m probably missing things , but this print does n’t seem to have much in the way of symbolism .
It depicts local life .
Micro / Macro : Dürer includes a lot of detail in his prints and in the linework .
Sometimes I have difficulty telling what ’s going on in a print at first glance .
One of the reasons I chose this one is that we ’re not overwhelmed with detail and can clearly differentiate the figures .
Ornament : Take a look at Dürer ’s monogram just above the lower border .
It serves as both an attractive decoration and as a signature .
Narrative :
While a relaxed scene , we see various things going on .
It ’s not a stiff , static scene , and the focus is on the two musicians .
Juxtaposition : I think I already commented on the water pump .
Stylization : Dürer ’s linework set the standard for generations to come – his approach obviously still relevant today .
Character : Each person has distinct personality .
The guy next to the water pump is intriguing , and I imagine that the two men in conversation are discussing local Nuremburg politics .
Tension :
There ’s little tension – it ’s a relaxed scene .
If you want some tension take a look at some of his depictions of the Apocalypse , like this one of the four horsemen .
Line :
They fulfill a variety of functions , as I noted above .
Research / Reference : I ’m not sure .
I did read that outdoor baths like this one were fairly uncommon at the time – it ’s likely that Dürer was looking for an opportunity to work with landscape and perspective .
Vignette :
We can easily see the figures and get an idea of their mood and actions based on posture .
I ’m amused by the large guy guzzling his beer .
Perspective : Occlusion and relative sizes do most of the work here , with some atmospheric perspective .
I do n’t believe he used vanishing points to line things up , however .
That ’s it for this round .
Next week I ’ll do something new ( compared to 1498 ) , but I ’m not sure what yet .
Maybe I ’ll do a companion piece to this one from Ian Miller .
Far fewer Americans have skin in the tax game than you would imagine from the popular uproar , either for or against government spending and social programs .
Perhaps we need to invert the popular maxim to : no taxation , no representation .

By STEPHEN OHLEMACHER ( AP )
WASHINGTON — Tax Day is a dreaded deadline for millions , but for nearly half of U.S. households it 's simply somebody else 's problem .
About 47 percent will pay no federal income taxes at all for 2009 .
Either their incomes were too low , or they qualified for enough credits , deductions and exemptions to eliminate their liability .
That 's according to projections by the Tax Policy Center , a Washington research organization .
Most people still are required to file returns by the April 15 deadline .
The penalty for skipping it is limited to the amount of taxes owed , but it 's still almost always better to file :
That 's the only way to get a refund of all the income taxes withheld by employers .
In recent years , credits for low - and middle - income families have grown so much that a family of four making as much as $ 50,000 will owe no federal income tax for 2009 , as long as there are two children younger than 17 , according to a separate analysis by the consulting firm Deloitte Tax .
Tax cuts enacted in the past decade have been generous to wealthy taxpayers , too , making them a target for President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress .
Less noticed were tax cuts for low - and middle - income families , which were expanded when Obama signed the massive economic recovery package last year .
The result is a tax system that exempts almost half the country from paying for programs that benefit everyone , including national defense , public safety , infrastructure and education .
It is a system in which the top 10 percent of earners -- households making an average of $ 366,400 in 2006 -- paid about 73 percent of the income taxes collected by the federal government .
The bottom 40 percent , on average , make a profit from the federal income tax , meaning they get more money in tax credits than they would otherwise owe in taxes .
For those people , the government sends them a payment .
" We have 50 percent of people who are getting something for nothing , " said Curtis Dubay , senior tax policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation .
The vast majority of people who escape federal income taxes still pay other taxes , including federal payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare , and excise taxes on gasoline , aviation , alcohol and cigarettes .
Many also pay state or local taxes on sales , income and property .
That helps explain the country 's aversion to taxes , said Clint Stretch , a tax policy expert Deloitte Tax .
He said many people simply look at the difference between their gross pay and their take - home pay and blame the government for the disparity .
" It 's not uncommon for people to think that their Social Security taxes , their 401 ( k ) contributions , their share of employer health premiums , all of that stuff in their mind gets lumped into income taxes , " Stretch said .
The federal income tax is the government 's largest source of revenue , raising more than $ 900 billion -- or a little less than half of all government receipts -- in the budget year that ended last Sept. 30 .
But with deductions and credits , especially for families with children , there have long been people who do n't pay it , mainly lower - income families .
The number of households that do n't pay federal income taxes increased substantially in 2008 , when the poor economy reduced incomes and Congress cut taxes in an attempt to help recovery .
In 2007 , about 38 percent of households paid no federal income tax , a figure that jumped to 49 percent in 2008 , according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center .
In 2008 , President George W. Bush signed a law providing most families with rebate checks of $ 300 to $ 1,200 .
Last year , Obama signed the economic recovery law that expanded some tax credits and created others .
Most targeted low - and middle - income families .
Obama 's Making Work Pay credit provides as much as $ 800 to couples and $ 400 to individuals .
The expanded child tax credit provides $ 1,000 for each child under 17 .
The Earned Income Tax Credit provides up to $ 5,657 to low - income families with at least three children .
There are also tax credits for college expenses , buying a new home and upgrading an existing home with energy - efficient doors , windows , furnaces and other appliances .
Many of the credits are refundable , meaning if the credits exceed the amount of income taxes owed , the taxpayer gets a payment from the government for the difference .
" All these things are ways the government says , if you do this , we 'll reduce your tax bill by some amount , " said Roberton Williams , a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center .
The government could provide the same benefits through spending programs , with the same effect on the federal budget , Williams said .
But it sounds better for politicians to say they cut taxes rather than they started a new spending program , he added .
Obama has pushed tax cuts for low - and middle - income families and tax increases for the wealthy , arguing that wealthier taxpayers fared well in the past decade , so it 's time to pay up .
The nation 's wealthiest taxpayers did get big tax breaks under Bush , with the top marginal tax rate reduced from 39.6 percent to 35 percent , and the second - highest rate reduced from 36 percent to 33 percent .
But income tax rates were lowered at every income level .
The changes made it relatively easy for families of four making $ 50,000 to eliminate their income tax liability .
Here 's how they did it , according to Deloitte Tax :
The family was entitled to a standard deduction of $ 11,400 and four personal exemptions of $ 3,650 apiece , leaving a taxable income of $ 24,000 .
The federal income tax on $ 24,000 is $ 2,769 .
With two children younger than 17 , the family qualified for two $ 1,000 child tax credits .
Its Making Work Pay credit was $ 800 because the parents were married filing jointly .
The $ 2,800 in credits exceeds the $ 2,769 in taxes , so the family makes a $ 31 profit from the federal income tax .
That ought to take the sting out of April 15 .

In light of the recent drug - related violence in Mexico , it is appropriate to reflect on how our current prohibition laws affect crime , law enforcement and the economy .
The Cannabis Grow Bibl ...
Green , Greg Best Price : $ 20.94 Buy New $ 96.90 ( as of 07:40 EST - Details )
Many will have the knee - jerk reaction of wanting to see more of a crackdown on illegal drugs .
But I have to ask :
Have n’t we been cracking down on drugs for several decades only to see the black market flourish and the violence escalate ?
Could there be a more effective approach ?
The illegality of drugs is , in fact , the Number One factor that keeps profits up for dealers and cartels , and ensures that organized crime dominates the market .
Cocaine , for example , has about a 17,000 - percent markup and sells for more than gold in some areas .
This is nothing new or unique to drugs , but a predictable outcome of prohibition .
During alcohol prohibition , Al Capone and others involved in organized crime made fortunes taking advantage of the dangerous and lucrative underground market the laws had created .
Every time law enforcement makes another bust , profits rise for the remaining suppliers .
These types of economic forces are insurmountable for law enforcement , but make for very good business for dealers and cartels .
For the rest of us , however , it is a disaster .
The war on drugs keeps our prisons full to bursting at great expense to taxpayers , but also at great danger to the public at large when the real criminals , the murderers , the rapists , the child molesters , are let out to make room for non-violent drug offenders .

The Best of Ron Paul
Former congressman Eric Massa ( D - NY ) said on Saturday that someone must have forged his signature on a check for a $ 40,000 salary increase for his chief of staff , whose accusations of sexual harassment were revealed only Friday , The Washington Post reported .
According to a statement released by Massa ’s attorney , the ex-congressman never authorized a check from a campaign account to give Joe Racalto a pay raise , suggesting that Racalto must have done it himself .

“ Someone forged then - Congressman Massa ’s signature on forms raising Mr. Racalto ’s own salary as a member of the congressman ’s personal staff from $ 120,000 per year to the maximum permissible level of $ 160,000 , ” the statement from Massa ’s campaign read .
Several aides have accused Massa of sexual harassment , charges that ultimately led to his resignation last month .
“ These matters continue to be under review and the appropriate authorities will be provided with all the relevant information , ” according to Massa ’s campaign ’s statement .
Racalto ’s attorney denied the allegations of forging his own pay raises , and said Massa was well aware of the checks .
The attorney , Camilla McKinney , denied questioned the timing of the charges in light of Racalto ’s sexual harassment complaint .
“ The timing of the allegations is highly questionable and suspicious , ” McKinney said in a telephone interview Saturday with AP .
“ The congressman is trying to discredit someone who is making a sexual harassment complaint against him . ”

Racalto knew a great deal about several male staffers ’ repeated complaints concerning Massa ’s lewd talk and sexual touching , as was also reported by The Washington Post .
The New York Democrat resigned last month in the wake of a House ethics inquiry into charges that he behaved inappropriately with male staffers .
The House ethics committee ended its investigation after Massa resigned .
Jaime Escalante , the legendary Garfield High School math teacher immortalized in the film " Stand and Deliver , " is battling cancer .
The news about Escalante , 79 , was posted on the Web page of actor Edward James Olmos , who portrayed the educator in the critically acclaimed 1988 movie .
Olmos said Escalante was in serious condition and that his family had run out of money to pay the medical bills .
" The treatment he needs has depleted all the funds his family can raise , " Olmos said in the announcement on his website .
The family " did not want to ask for help , but we took it upon ourselves to get the word out to all the country and around the world , to make his final days as comfortable as possible -- and maybe even give him a chance to beat the cancer that has afflicted him .
" Olmos could not be reached Monday night for comment .
Escalante was born in La Paz , Bolivia .
His father and mother were both teachers .
He arrived in Los Angeles in the early 1960s and later landed the job at Garfield High in East Los Angeles .
He was able to transform the school 's calculus program into one of the top public school programs in the country .
In 1999 , Escalante returned to Bolivia to teach math .
" I wanted to do something for my country , like I did something in East L.A. for the barrio , " he told The Times in a 1999 interview in Bolivia .

Anger over the last crash and the bailout of its high rollers spans the political spectrum , from neo -New Dealers on the left to Tea Party protesters on the right .
As the battle over financial regulatory reform began in earnest with Chris Dodd ’s introduction of a Senate bill last week , Lewis told an interviewer , “ There is a war that is about to happen over not just who regulates Wall Street but what the rules are . ”

The question for the politicians at the center of this battleground is simple enough :
Which side of the war are they on ?
The Republican leadership revealed its hand unequivocally last week .
Addressing the American Bankers Association , the party ’s House leader , John Boehner , promised to delay and fight any finance - reform bill .
“ Do n’t let those little punk staffers take advantage of you , and stand up for yourselves , ” Boehner instructed the poor , defenseless bankers .
In late January he met the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase , Jamie Dimon , to make a pitch for donations .
That may have been unnecessary .
Chase and its employees , an A.T.M. for the Democrats in 2008 , gave 73 percent of their contributions to the G.O.P. in the fourth quarter of 2009 .
Republicans in the Senate will be no different .
Mitch McConnell ’s strategy of unmitigated obstructionism remains gospel there .
Just as Charles Grassley and Olympia Snowe played the Democrats with months of fruitless negotiations on health care reform , so Richard Shelby and Bob Corker have been stalling a financial reform bill with similarly arid feints at “ bipartisanship . ”
Corker insisted that any bill exclude regulation of extortionate “ payday lenders , ” who just happen to be among his biggest campaign contributors .
Unlike the Republicans , President Obama sends mixed messages on these issues .
He says a stand - alone consumer protection agency is a priority .
A key appointee , Gary Gensler , the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , says he is determined to fight for serious regulation of derivatives .
But the Treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , still seems more inclined to preserve , not overhaul , the system that failed during his tenure at the New York Fed .
Geithner ’s major calling lately has been a public - relations tour , with full - dress profiles in The New Yorker , The Atlantic and even Vogue , which filled us in on his humble “ off - the - rack ” Brooks Brothers suits .
Last week he also contributed a video testimonial to the on-air fifth anniversary celebration of Jim Cramer ’s “ Mad Money . ”
Like the heedless casino culture it exemplified , that CNBC program has long been back to speculative business - as - usual , pumping stocks as if the crash were just a small , inconvenient bump on the road to larger profits and bonuses .
The particular “ Mad Money ” episode to which the Treasury secretary lent his imprimatur included such choice Cramer bits as a reference to Nancy Pelosi as “ Politburo president ” and a prediction that the passage of “ Obamacare ” could cause the stock market to tank .
Let the G.O.P. be the party of “ Mad Money . ”
Once the protracted health care soap opera at last becomes history , the pivot to financial reform could be a great opportunity for the president , a decisive bid for his party to repossess that anti-establishment truck from Scott Brown .
The Republicans will once again squeal that it ’s political suicide for Obama to try to “ ram through ” a bill , and once again decry his “ socialism . ”
But while the voters were often genuinely divided about health care , they are not about Wall Street reform : polls have consistently shown for a year that a 60 percent majority favors it .
What these voters crave are leaders unambiguously on the side of true fairness and accountability , not apologists for those traitors , as Stieg Larsson aptly called them , whose shell games broke the economy and stuck us with the bill .
The fired - up president who energized the health care endgame by taking on insurance companies does n’t have a year to find his voice for the war ahead .
Not only is the 2010 election season fast approaching , but it will coincide with angry commemorations of the second anniversary of the fall of Lehman Brothers .
Politicians who are still seen as soft on the culprits could yet fall too .
EXCERPT FROM THE US CONSTITUTION , Article I , section 10 : No State shall ... coin Money ; emit Bills of Credit ; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts ....
FROM THE US TREASURY WEBSITE : " Federal Reserve notes are not redeemable in gold , silver or any other commodity , and receive no backing by anything .
The notes have no value for themselves , but for what they will buy . "
A LESSON FROM HISTORY BOOKS :
The past 300 years have proven that ALL fiat money experiments ended in complete devaluation .
From Rome to Britain : every empire vanished into oblivion soon after it went off the gold standard .
It is time to recognize the obvious : Unbacked money has never worked .
On Saturday afternoon against No. 1 Syracuse , the Louisville men's basketball team will play its final game at Freedom Hall , the home of the Cardinals since 1956 .
Pat Forde and Jay Bilas take a trip down memory lane in remembrance of this historic arena :

If you come into the basketball shrine that is Freedom Hall by the media entrance , you 're in for a disappointment .
You park by a decaying baseball stadium .
You walk next to a trail covered with wood chips where they bring in horses when the annual horse show is going on .
( The arena was originally built with equines in mind .
Only in Kentucky . )
You get to a red steel door , which opens onto a dimly lit concrete area .
To the left , cinderblocks .
To the right , cinderblocks .
Straight ahead , a dark downhill ramp .
But there is light at the end of that tunnel .
For me , walking down that tunnel has always been the highlight of coming to Freedom Hall .
Freedom Hall has hosted six Final Fours and countless memorable games involving the hometown Louisville Cardinals .
Mark Zerof / US Presswire
As you half - tumble down the ramp , you see the brightness up ahead , you hear the band , you hear 20,000 fans starting to roar and then , suddenly , you 've arrived at one of the special places in the history of college basketball .
You 've arrived at the place that , for a span of nearly 30 years , was arguably the most relevant address in the game .
From 1958 to 1969 , Freedom Hall hosted six Final Fours .
Lew Alcindor , Oscar Robertson , Jerry West , Elgin Baylor , John Havlicek , Elvin Hayes and many other greats played there during that time ; John Wooden , Adolph Rupp , Dean Smith and other giants coached there .
UCLA added to its dynasty there .
Loyola ( Chicago ) struck the first major blow for full - scale integration there .
And then , right about the time the Final Four moved on , along came former Wooden assistant Denny Crum to build his own dynasty with the home school .
Crum took over as the coach of the Louisville Cardinals in 1971 and had them in the Final Four his first season -- then they went back five more times in the next 14 years .
They became the original collegiate experts on the art of stylistic dunking -- the Doctors of Dunk , they were called .
Well before Phi Slama Jama came along , Crum's Cards were rocking Freedom Hall rims with alley - oops to skywalkers with amazing Afros .
By the time the Cards were winning national titles in 1980 and ' 86 , Freedom Hall was the place to be in college hoops .
But for Louisville fans , it 's been the place to be ever since 1956 .
That 's when the Cardinals first started playing there , forming a bond between program and arena that is shared by few others -- Kansas and Allen Fieldhouse and Duke and Cameron Indoor Stadium are the only others that come to mind among elite programs .
Rupp Arena , Assembly Hall , the Dean Dome -- they 're all late - comers in relation to Freedom Hall .
I moved here from Colorado in 1987 -- after the gold rush for the Cards , but still in time to form a lot of lasting memories .
Many of them had nothing to do with the primary tenant :
There was an incredible high school state championship duel between diminutive hillbilly hero Richie Farmer of Clay County and Allan Houston of Louisville Ballard .
Farmer scored 51 points , on his way to becoming a folk hero at the University of Kentucky ; Houston helped his team win the title , on his way to becoming an NBA All - Star .
There was a 20 - minute , one - on - one interview with Michael Jordan in a training room , before a Bulls exhibition game .
There was the 2007 McDonald 's All - American Game , one of the greatest collections of teenage talent ever : Derrick Rose , Blake Griffin , Michael Beasley , O.J. Mayo , Kevin Love , Eric Gordon , Jerryd Bayless , Kyle Singler , Patrick Patterson , etc .
But mostly there were Louisville games : pitched battles with rival Kentucky , always played in an atmosphere so charged you could feel the tension ; nights when all 20,000 fans focused their energy on spiking Bob Huggins ' blood pressure ; all manner of stunning finishes against Marquette , spiced with crazy shots and the occasional taunting coach ( former Golden Eagles boss Mike Deane remains a wanted man in Louisville after he gave Freedom Hall fans the business running off the floor with a one - point win in the ' 90s ) .
The fans have always been what brought Freedom Hall to life .
Their fervor for the home team and understanding of the game take a backseat to none , making the Hall the shrine it has been for 54 years .
There will be sadness inside its walls Saturday , when Louisville hosts No. 1 Syracuse .
But there also will be noise , propelled by a 54 - year love affair with an aging gym .
The old horse - show arena will shake one last time for the home team .

My formative years in the game were in the 1980s , and during that time , the Louisville Cardinals were known as the Doctors of Dunk .
Under Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum and before the RPI took over our lives , Louisville would go out and play a brutal schedule and lose a couple of barn - burners here and there .
Crum not only coached UL for 30 years , but was a UCLA assistant when the Bruins won the 1969 title at Freedom Hall .
The court is named in his honor .

But it would always get the Cards ready for the NCAA tournament and they would always dunk on your head anyway .
Guys like Darrell Griffith , Derek Smith , Rodney McCray , Scooter McCray and Jerry Eaves would fly all over the court and finish it with a rim - rattler at the other end .
We can talk X's and O's from that time , but those Louisville teams left you with a feeling about them , and the feeling was " explosive " and " exciting . "
You watched Louisville and saw something that left your jaw on the floor every game .
And back in the 1970s and early 80s , when the Saturday Game of the Week was your only exposure to national games , Louisville was the team you wanted to see .
When Dick Enberg would start the broadcast , " From Freedom Hall in Louisville , Kentucky " you knew you were in for a thrill .
I played against Louisville twice in my four years at Duke .
The first time was in 1983 against Crum 's Final Four squad that included the McCray brothers , Lancaster Gordon , Billy Thompson , Milt Wagner and Charles Jones .
I remember playing well against the Cardinals , until late in the game when the Doctors of Dunk showed up and ran away with it .
I also played against the U of L ( with Thompson , Wagner , Pervis Ellison and Herb Crook ) in the 1986 NCAA championship game in Dallas , when Louisville won Crum 's second national title by beating us 72 -69 .
Every time I walk into Freedom Hall , I think not of specific games , but of excellence and the players that pursued it in that building .
Louisville basketball will be great in the new building , but it will never be the same for those that saw the Cardinals soar in Freedom Hall .
It was remarkable .

I love this chart , but it ’s incorrectly titled .
It has nothing to do with young people , as the chart shows previous generations since they were first old enough to be polled .
Really , it should be : America Becoming Less Religious
This fact is being tinged with ageism , but , as time goes on , people are turning away from religions because they are inefficient , outdated paradigms .
In linguistic terms , a question is largely the re-ordering of a statement .
Shuffle the words around , make a couple of other changes , and “ John rode a horse ” becomes “ What did John ride ? ”
Linguists call this re-arranging of words “ wh - movement , ” due to the wh - words used in questions ( who , when , and so on ) and they believe it occurs in two forms .
English displays what linguists call “ overt wh - movement , ” in which word order is shuffled heavily , since many questions begin with wh - words .
( There are exceptions : “ John rode a what ? ” )
But some languages , like Japanese , deploy “ covert wh - movement , ” in which word order remains largely intact as a statement becomes a question , and the wh - words appear in a variety of locations .
But what determines which of these options a given language uses ?
In a new book , “ Uttering Trees , ” MIT linguistics professor Norvin Richards asserts that if we carefully study prosody — the way the pitch of our voices goes up and down — we can determine which kind of wh - movement any language will employ .
In turn , Richards believes , this suggests that for all languages , the sound pattern in sentences is more integral to the syntax — the processes and principles that govern the structure of sentences — than scholars have generally thought .
“ If you were to ask a syntactician why English forms its questions one way and Japanese forms its questions another way , there is n’t really an answer , ” says Richards .
“ But I ’m shooting for a deeper explanation in the book .
And the idea is that there ’s a universal principle explaining the prosody we observe when we ask questions . ”
If the pattern Richards has detected holds up , it could persuade more linguists that the relationship between sound and syntax is a necessity , not a contingency .
“ If what I ’m saying is right , ” Richards says , “ then I think that as the syntax begins to build the sentence structure , it ’s also making a rough draft of the prosody . ”
That could alter linguists ’ views about how the rules of language are laid down , and provide more evidence for the notion of Universal Grammar , the idea that an innate facility for language helps shape the form of languages globally .
Sound system
There are actually two distinct essays in “ Uttering Trees , ” published this month by MIT Press .
( The title refers to the tree - like sentence diagrams linguists use . )
The first essay analyzes how similar elements of sentences must be separated for the sake of comprehension , while the second develops Richards ’ thesis about sound and questions , surveying English , Japanese , Basque , Bengali , Tagalog , French , Portugese , and more .
To get a flavor for his work , consider this second issue .
Recordings of Japanese spoken in Tokyo , when charted by the frequency of the speaker ’s voice , show that the statement “ Naoya - ga nanika - o nomiya - de nonda ” ( “ Naoya drank something at the bar ” ) maintains a rising - and - falling pitch pattern .
But in the question , “ Naoya - ga nani - o nomiya - de nonda no ? ” ( “ What did Naoya drink at the bar ? ” ) , the words “ nomiya - de nonda ” have a low , flat frequency , interrupting the rising - and - falling pattern .
This flat intonation falls between the wh - word , “ nani-o , ” and the question - indicating complementizer , “ no , ” at the end of the sentence .
“ There ’s this prosodic phenomenon , ” says Richards .
“ You get a big pitched peak on the wh - word , then people mutter , so the prosody is kind of flat between the wh - word and the complementizer , then it goes back up .
People squash these words so that they ’re lower than they would be in the corresponding statement .
We have nice phonetic evidence that they ’re creating a prosodic domain that starts with the wh - word and ends with the question mark . ”
So while there are two kinds of wh- movement , Richards proposes that every language ends up like Japanese , in the sense that wh - words and complementizers exist in a single prosodic domain .
In some languages , including Japanese , this is accomplished by direct changes in the prosody , while , others , like English , require a greater transportation of wh - words , so they can be located in the same prosodic domain as question marks .
But if we can locate the question mark and understand how prosody is organized , Richards argues , we can predict where the wh - word will be situated in every tongue — which provides evidence for the common foundations of all languages .
In Bengali , Richards has found , the sentence , “ ora Suneche ke abe ” ( “ They have heard who will come ” ) shifts into a question as , “ ora ke abe Suneche ? ” ( “ Who have they heard will come ? ” ) .
In this case , “ ke ” serves as the wh - word , with the relevant prosodic domain lying between it and the closing question indicator .
Colleagues have praised “ Uttering Trees . ”
Answering questions by e-mail , Elena Anagnostopoulou , a professor of linguistics at the University of Crete , says Richards “ asks a question that has rarely been addressed before , namely why some languages have overt and others covert wh - movement , ” and defends his thesis “ very convincingly . ”
The book , she believes , lays out a “ novel research agenda , where new proposals are raised and the proposals are highly predictive . ”
The predictive aspect of Richards ’ theory is precisely what will be tested by future research .
For all the languages he samples , scores more await evaluation in terms of wh- movement .
For now , though , Richards ’ idea is sound .

マーケティング調査会社のクロス・マーケティングは、2009年秋から業務システムを「 Amazon EC2」を使って運用する。通常の運用スタイルと比較して、3年間で5000万円近くのコスト削減が見込めるという。同社の利用事例を基に、EC2の利点や問題点を検証してみよう。
「 システムを開発するエンジニアの雰囲気が良くなった」――。クロス・マーケティングのシステム開発ユニットでエグゼクティブマネージャーを務める永井秀幸氏は、米アマゾン・ドット・コムの子会社、アマゾン・ウェブ・サービシズが運用するインフラストラクチャサービス「 Amazon EC2 」 を使い始めてすぐに“ 良い効果 ” が現れたと証言する。
Amazon EC2、良いところ 「 初期投資はゼロに。運用コストも25％削減」
「 開発者がサーバーを買ってくれと言わなくなった」
「 セキュリティは想像以上に堅牢。第三者監査で問題は見つからず」
「 標準的 なWebアプリケーションで、遅延は問題にならなかった」
「 サーバーのバックアップやクローニング（複製）が超高速」
Amazon EC2、悪いところ 「 想定以上に使用するサーバー台数が増加する」
「 管理コンソールのユーザーインタフェースがミスを誘発しやすい」
「 Amazonの都合で仮想サーバーが再起動したことがあった」
「 情報がすべて英語で、米本国との交渉が必要」
「 クレジットカード払いなのが不便 」
同社は2009年初めから、システム開発にEC2の仮想サーバーの利用を開始し、09年10月からは顧客企業向けのサービスもEC2上で稼働した。すでに80台弱のEC2仮想サーバーを利用し、コスト削減効果は3年間で5000万円を見込む。しかも単なるコスト削減にとどまらない効果がEC2にはあると語る。「当社は、マーケティング調査システムを自社開発しており、システム開発ユニットには委託先も含めておよそ20人のエンジニアが所属する。そのエンジニアの雰囲気が良くなったのは、EC2によって開発やテスト用サーバーを潤沢に使えるようになったためだ。当社は中国やフィリピン・セブ島にある協力会社にもプログラム開発を依頼しているが、EC2を使うことで外部との連携も容易になった。従来は社内のサーバーを外部から安全にアクセスさせるために、様々なセキュリティ設定が必要だった。それが不要になった」（永井氏）。
永井氏が2009年末に2010年の予算を作成したところ、「EC2があまりに便利なので、現場のエンジニアから『サーバーを買ってほしい』という要望が途絶えた。最近はあきらめたのか、サーバーメーカーの営業も当社に寄りつかない」と話す。もちろん、EC2には「業務用途に使う上で様々な課題もあった」（同）。同社がどのようにしてEC2の課題を克服したか、詳しく見ていこう。
商用システムをEC2で運用
クロス・マーケティングは、食品や家電といった消費財のメーカーなどから消費者アンケートを受託するマーケティング調査会社だ。現在、150万人の消費者モニターを抱え、Webサイトを使って消費者アンケートを行い、その調査結果を顧客企業に提供している。顧客企業には分析用の元データも提供し、マーケティング担当者自らが統計ソフトを使って様々な分析ができるようにしている。
09年10月からは、顧客企業に提供するマーケティング分析サービスをEC2で稼働し始めた。さらに10年からは、消費者モニターがアンケートに答えるシステムもEC2で運用する計画だ。開発用システムやアンケート作成支援システムといった社内向けシステムの一部も、すでにEC2上で運用している（図1）。

09年10月からEC2上で運用を始めた顧客企業向けサービス「research.jp」は、顧客企業のマーケティング担当者がWebブラウザを使って、アンケート調査データに対する様々な分析処理を行うものだ。統計処理ソフトにはオープンソースの「R」を使用する。
統計処理ソフトのRは本来、コマンドラインでソフトを操作する。主に大学で使用されている、操作学習の難しいソフトだ。同社はR用のWebインタフェースを自社開発し、利用者はGUIによる簡単な操作だけで、分析処理が行えるようにした。
顧客企業にはこれまで 、Excelのマクロで開発した「REAL
CROSS 2」という分析ツールを配っていた。「従来は60～90分かかっていた処理が、research.jpでは数分で終了するようになった」（永井氏）という。
Networks that are resilient on their own become fragile and prone to catastrophic failure when connected , suggests a new study with troubling implications for tightly linked modern infrastructures .
Electrical grids , water supplies , computer networks , roads , hospitals , financial systems – all are tied to each other in ways that could make them vulnerable .
" When networks are interdependent , you might think they 're more stable .
It might seem like we 're building in redundancy .
But it can do the opposite , " said Eugene Stanley , a Boston University physicist and co-author of the study , published April 14 in Nature .
Most theoretical research on network properties has focused on single networks in isolation .
In reality , many important networks are tied to each other .
Anecdotal evidence – the crash of communications networks ( .pdf ) in lower Manhattan after 9/11 , the plummeting of markets around the world after the Black Monday stock market collapse of 1987 – hints at their fragility , but the underlying mathematics are largely unexplored .
The Nature researchers modeled the behavior of two networks , each possessing what 's known as " broad degree distribution " :
A few nodes have many connections , some have an intermediate amount of links and many have just a few .
Think of the networks as having only a few hubs , but many spokes .
On their own , such networks are known to be stable .
A random failure is likely to disable a leaf , leaving the rest of the network 's connections mostly intact .
In the new study , the researchers connected two of these networks .
While many node failures were required to crash the networks when they were independent , a few failures crashed the networks when they were linked .
" Networks with broad distributions are robust against random attacks .
But we found that broad interconnected networks are very fragile , " said study co-author Gerald Paul , a Boston University physicist .
The interconnections fueled a cascading effect , with the failures coursing back and forth .
A damaged node in the first network would pull down nodes in the second , which crashed nodes in the first , which brought down more in the second , and so on .
And when they looked at data from a 2003 Italian power blackout , in which the electrical grid was linked to the computer network that controlled it , the patterns matched their models ' math .
That broad networks could be so fragile is surprising , but even more important is how rapidly the crash happened , with sudden catastrophic collapse instead of a gradual breakdown , said Indiana University informaticist Alessandro Vespignani in a commentary accompanying the paper .
" This makes complete system breakdown even more difficult to control or anticipate than in an isolated network , " he wrote .
According to Raissa D'Souza , a University of California , Davis mathematician who studies interdependent networks , the findings are " a starting point for thinking about the implications of interactions . "
D'Souza hopes such research will pull together mathematicians and engineers .
" We now have some analytic tools in place to study interacting networks , but need to refine the models with information on real systems , " she said .
Research into linked systems could help engineers build more resilient networks , or identify existing weaknesses .
At the very least , they stress the importance of preparing for sudden , catastrophic failures .
" We must recognize the possibility of big disasters , and take steps to prepare , " said Stanley , noting how unprepared political and economic leaders were for the financial collapse that triggered the current recession .
" These stories underscore that when trouble happens , we 're surprised .
But we should n't be , " said Stanley .

KUNMING , China —
Chen Mingjing ’s entrepreneurial instincts vaulted him from a peasant upbringing to undreamed - of wealth , acquired in ventures ranging from making electric meters to investing in real estate .
But when he was 44 , the allure of making money for money ’s sake began to wane .
He wanted to run a business that accomplished some good .
And so last September , Mr. Chen did what any socially aware entrepreneur might do :
He opened a theme park of dwarfs , charging tourists about $ 9 a head to watch dozens of dwarfs in pink tutus perform a slapstick version of “ Swan Lake ” along with other skits .
Mr. Chen has big plans for his Kingdom of the Little People .
Imagine a $ 115 million universe in miniature , set amid 13,000 acres of rolling hills and peaceful lakes in southern China ’s Yunnan Province , with tiny dogs , tiny fruit trees , a 230 - foot - high performance hall that looks like the stump of a prehistoric tree and standard - size guest cabins .
Also , a black BMW modified to resemble a flying saucer , from which dwarfs will spill forth to begin their performances .
The 1889 Russian flu pandemic circled the globe in just four months , captivating the world , despite the lack of airplanes or hyperventilating cable news stations .
If that was possible , closing down air traffic in the event of a new pandemic might not do much , argue the authors led by Alain - Jacques Valleron , an epidemiologist at the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale in Paris .
“ The rapid progression of the 1889 pandemic demonstrates that slower surface travel , even with much smaller traveler flows , sufficed to spread the pandemic across all of Europe and the United States in ~ 4 months , ” the researchers wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on April 26 .
“ This observation supports mathematical model results , which anticipated that restricting air transportation would have little , if any , effect .
One possible hypothesis is that the important predictor of the speed of the pandemic is not the absolute numbers of passengers traveling between cities but the connectedness of the network of cities . ”
The data on the disease were assembled for the first time from local records in 172 European and American cities .
The Russian flu is particularly interesting because it was the first major epidemic to strike Europe after the laying down of dense railroad connections .
In 1889 , there were already more than 125,000 miles of rail lines connecting European cities .
( That ’s more mileage than exists today , the authors note ) .
The outbreak began in the spring of 1889 .
It peaked first in St. Petersburg , Russia , in December of that year .
By then , it had spread all across Europe and North America and was front - page news in many places across the country .
In papers like The Evening Bulletin in Maysville , Kentucky , the flu hit the front page in the days after Christmas .
The paper printed dispatches from cities across the world .
“ It is safe to say that over one - tenth of the population is affected by it , ” a Boston reporter wrote .
Meanwhile , doctors in Pittsburgh “ expected [ed ] ‘ la grippe ’ to reach here in all its violence before another month has passed . ”
Reports of royalty afflicted with influenza popped up in papers interspersed with bits of other news .
The Salt Lake City Herald reported that the czar of Russia was “ making favorable progress toward recovery from influenza . ”
While popular culture was receiving its information through the papers and informal information networks , the new study shows that more detailed records exist that make detailed , quantitative epidemiology for 19th - century disease outbreaks possible .
Local authorities in Germany were already conducting massive surveys of 16,000 physicians , of whom 21 percent actually responded .
Tracking the medical response to the outbreak is much harder .
At the time , many different ideas for what caused the disease were floated , according to historian F.B. Smith .
“ In keeping with traditional speculations about epidemics , some doctors invoked earthquakes and volcanic eruptions as material energizers , concentrators , and disseminators , but in mechanistic terms , not as mere erratic signs of Providential displeasure , ” Smith wrote in a 1995 essay on the Russian flu .
“ Earthquakes had been reported in almost every month of 1889 , in such disparate locations as the Isle of Wight and Portsmouth , Manchester , Sicily , Greece , Japan , Samoa , Alabama , and elsewhere round the world . ”
One editorial in The Lancet argued that disease could travel around the world as easily as the dust from Krakatoa , which had exploded in 1883 and delivered brilliant sunsets in Europe .
“ Why should not this troublesome complaint have been produced by injurious emanations from the earth ?
Mild at first . . . [ influenza ] gets worse as it goes on , apparently gathering up other morbific elements on its way , ” he wrote .
“ There is no more difficulty in admitting an atmospheric pollution traveling across the Atlantic to New York than that the red sunsets . . . round the world were lately caused by the dust of a Java volcano . ”
Other theories held that electrical and magnetic phenomenon were “ likely agents , ” Smith wrote , largely because some earlier epidemics had coincided with spectacular northern lights displays .
It was hypothesized that electrical currents in the air could produce ozone , which intensified the illness .
In the end , what doctors did may not have mattered much .
The French researchers found that the mortality of the 1889 pandemic was about the same as the flu outbreaks of 1947 , 1957 , 1968 , and 1977 - 1978 , and ( so far ) 2009 - 2010 .
Transportation , information and medical networks may have changed , but the virulence of the flu — with the huge exception of the 1918 pandemic — appears to have stayed roughly the same .

Recently by Ron Paul : Against Anti-Civilian Sanctions
Listen to Ron Paul .
Click the play button below .
Lately many have characterized this administration as socialist , or having strong socialist leanings .
I differ with this characterization .
This is not to say Mr. Obama believes in free - markets by any means .
On the contrary , he has done and said much that demonstrates his fundamental misunderstanding and hostility towards the truly free market .
But a closer , honest examination of his policies and actions in office reveals that , much like the previous administration , he is very much a corporatist .
This in many ways can be more insidious and worse than being an outright socialist .
Socialism is a system where the government directly owns and manages businesses .
Corporatism is a system where businesses are nominally in private hands , but are in fact controlled by the government .
In a corporatist state , government officials often act in collusion with their favored business interests to design polices that give those interests a monopoly position , to the detriment of both competitors and consumers .
Pillars of Prosperity : ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 4.87 Buy New $ 7.63 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
A careful examination of the policies pursued by the Obama administration and his allies in Congress shows that their agenda is corporatist .
For example , the health care bill that recently passed does not establish a Canadian - style government - run single - payer health care system .
Instead , it relies on mandates forcing every American to purchase private health insurance or pay a fine .
It also includes subsidies for low - income Americans and government - run health care exchanges . 
Contrary to the claims of the proponents of the health care bill , large insurance and pharmaceutical companies were enthusiastic supporters of many provisions of this legislation because they knew in the end their bottom lines would be enriched by Obamacare .
The Revolution : A Mani ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.99 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
Similarly , Obama ’s cap - and - trade legislation provides subsidies and specials privileges to large businesses that engage in carbon trading .
This is why large corporations , such as General Electric support cap - and - trade .
To call the President a corporatist is not to soft - pedal criticism of his administration .
It is merely a more accurate description of the President ’s agenda .
When he is a called a socialist , the President and his defenders can easily deflect that charge by pointing out that the historical meaning of socialism is government ownership of industry ; under the President ’s policies , industry remains in nominally private hands .
Using the more accurate term — corporatism — forces the President to defend his policies that increase government control of private industries and expand de facto subsidies to big businesses .
This also promotes the understanding that though the current system may not be pure socialism , neither is it free - market since government controls the private sector through taxes , regulations , and subsidies , and has done so for decades .
Using precise terms can prevent future statists from successfully blaming the inevitable failure of their programs on the remnants of the free market that are still allowed to exist .
We must not allow the disastrous results of corporatism to be ascribed incorrectly to free market capitalism or used as a justification for more government expansion .
Most importantly , we must learn what freedom really is and educate others on how infringements on our economic liberties caused our economic woes in the first place .
Government is the problem ; it can not be the solution .

What are the haps my friends
all your problems are over
June 27th , 2007 : Since I kinda did a comic about it , here is the latest update on the ' getting my fridge repaired ' situation .
If you 're not interested in the Status of the Fridge of a Guy on the Internet , now would be a good place to stop reading !
Okay SO the repair guy called and said he'd be by , then called JUST NOW to say that he was downstairs and ringing the doorbell .
But the doorbell was n't ringing .
I verified the address and then went downstairs to meet him and he was gone !
And he 's not answering his cell phone either .
POSSIBLE THEORIES :
He was never there , but just a figment of my ice - cream starved mind .
He WAS there , but quickly phased to an alternate universe and right now Alternate Ryan is getting his fridge fixed .
Screw you , Alternate Ryan !
He was at the wrong address , but the person there needed their fridge fixed too and took advantage of the situation .
Screw you , opportunistic dude that fate likes better than me apparently !
MORE UPDATES AS THE SITUATION PROGRESSES
One year ago today : i peeked in high school
– Ryan
Here is your situation :
There is no compassion within a corporation , it is black or red ; profit or loss ; always competing against other corporations for the same most pleasant profit to loss ratio prize .
Corporations now control government , ALL GOVERNMENTS , not just in the United States .
There is no way out and there is no one to save you .
Here is your situation :
Corporation to you ;
Do you want a job for $ 1.00 per hour ?
You - option one ; No
Bingo , you have no job .
The next , more desperate person will take that job at $ 1.00 per hour .
You – option # 2 ; Yes , I need a job .
I will take that job at $ 1.00 per hour .
You have a job .
A few months later ...
Corporation ;
Do you want to keep your job at your new rate which is now $ .75 per hour ?
You – option number one ; No
Bingo , you have no job .
The next , more desperate person will take that job at $ .75 per hour .
Your job will now go to someone in China , North Korea , Cuba , Vietnam Laos or another country that does not support civil liberties and thus , will not have independent , legally recognized Organized Labor unions .
You – option # 2 Yes , I need a job .
I will take that job at $ .75 per hour .
You have a job for a few more months unit the exact ultimatum will take place offering you less money and benefits for the same exact job .
AMERICAN JOBS : AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS IS NOT COMING BACK .
Here is why –
You think your life is improving because you can buy items cheaper & cheaper .
What you ’re doing is supporting and expanding an economic system that will not allow INDIVIDUALS to earn a living wage while still working .
Here is the one tiny catch - YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL .
Now , check the tag on the back of your shirt or blouse – THAT IS YOU .
This insane , illogical selfishness has finally reached from Communist China to our shore :
Our backyards , our kitchens , our bathrooms , dens and workplaces .
Now it ’s in you .
It is you ; your family ; your friends ...
YOU are the Bait & Switch .
The Bait given by companies and corporations is LOWER PRICES .
The Switch is that YOU PAY FOR THE LOWER PRICES UP FRONT AND AFTERWARD .
UP FRONT - in an already existing and continuously lowering standard of living for individuals who manufacture or provide the purchased service .
This started worldwide 30 years ago with the instance of United States President , Ronald Reagan back in the 1980s .
He made it clear that U.S. security and Americans ’ standard of living is second fiddle to the first seat ; corporate greed .
AFTERWARD in a continuously lower standard of living for you , your friends , your immediate family , and your next generation ; your children .
You are eating your own children .
Things are going to get worse , much worse for you because YOU BELIEVE IN NOTHING .
You believe in ON SALE !
You believe in CLEARANCE SALE !
You believe in LESS and you are getting less .
Less services that government is able to give to you ; fewer wage for you and your loved ones to live upon .
Less morals , for EVERYTHING the common denominator is how much does this cost ?
And , Can I get this for less ?
There is no way out and as Americans we are individually and collectively falling from the highest precipice on the economic , worldwide cliff .
YOU NEED TO BELIEVE IN SOMETHING .
SOMETHING REAL but ethically you is hollow .
You have nothing to give or to cling to .
Your opinions are tainted and you sound like a boring , selfish asshole .
Only one thing could save you or any one of us and that is belief .
A new belief ...
But you cannot believe .
Too many other things are more important ...
You cannot bring yourself to say , I believe in the inherent good of Organized Labor .
It ’s just not sexy .
You cannot recognize that you cannot beg to make a living ; you have to bargain to make a living .
YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN .
I apologize up front for being logical .
You are so selfish to realize that other people need not only to make a living wage but wages and benefits that will help them to resist minor catastrophes or will help provide for the next generation , our children to make a better living for themselves .
I ’m standing in front of you with my arms wide open and I repeat to your face , I believe in the inherent good of Organized Labor .
Now , go ahead .
Take your shot .
Hit me with the best talking points corporate media has pumped into you .
Hit me with your best self - rightest , selfish logic you can grasp .
I ’m standing in front of you .
Tell me you are NOT Communist .
Tell me you have more items that are made under an Organized Labor agreement than you have items that are made in a Communist Country .
Finally some of you that are reading this may be able to understand –
YOU ARE A COMMUNIST AND YOU’RE ON SALE !
Now go ahead , KILL THIS MESSENGER .
I ’m standing in front of you .
What makes a runner  who hits the pavement day after day , mile after mile  keep going ?
There is a myth that Tibetan monks run 300 miles in 30 hours by fixating on a distant object and repeating a mantra with each footfall .
Last year 's New York City Marathon winner , Paula Radcliffe , says that she makes it through a tough race by counting her steps .
For the Japanese writer Haruki Murakami , who describes his decades - long dependency on long - distance running in his new memoir , " What I Talk About When I Talk About Running " ( Knopf , 180 pages , $ 21 ) , the secret is consistency : running every day no matter how he feels , pacing himself , and pop music  the Red Hot Chili Peppers , Gorillaz , Beck , Creedence Clearwater Revival  which he loads , with great care , onto a Walkman .

With its mysterious motivations and methods , running carries the same type of mystique as writing .
Interviewers repeatedly use the same facile questions for famous athletes and writers , born of disbelieving incomprehension that someone could complete the superhuman task of composing a literary masterpiece or running a 4 - minute mile .
How do you prepare ?
How do you begin ?
What goes through your head ?
Motionless intellectual activity might seem the opposite of repetitive physical exertion , but as Mr. Murakami shows , the two endeavors are not completely dissimilar .
For Mr. Murakami , running is not only connected to writing in its dark - art aura , it is essential to his literary productivity .
It gives him routine , instills discipline , and regulates his life .
Ascribing to the Graham Greene , 350 - words - a - day - no - matter - what system of writing rather than the fabled Jack Kerouac , wrote - it - on - a - roll - of - toilet - paper - while - drunk methodology , Mr. Murakami commits himself to extreme physical activity in order to pursue pure intellectual activity .
Raymond Carver , one of Mr. Murakami's heroes and whose story , " What We Talk About When We Talk About Love , " provides the title for this book , used to sit at his desk for several hours every day no matter what .
" This sort of daily training was indispensible for him , " Mr. Murakami writes .
In Carver 's opinion , and his , consistent , focused devotion to the act of writing is the only way to remain productive .
" Writing novels ... is basically a kind of manual labor , " Mr. Murakami writes .
" The whole process ... requires far more energy , over a long period , than most people ever imagine . "
Running , he says , is the best training .
If , in equating running and writing , Mr. Murakami takes away some of the glitz of literary creation , he satisfies the desire for writerly eccentricity in a different way .
Mr. Murakami might not be a hard - living , psychologically unstable artist , but his life is filled with a different sort of insanity .
He runs from Athens to Marathon in the middle of the summer , by himself , passing no fewer than 14 flattened cats and dogs by the side of the highway .
He realizes that he is asking his body to do things it assertively does not want to do , but does not let the signals stop him .
While running a 62 - mile ultramarathon he begins to feel " like a piece of beef being run , slowly , through a meat grinder ... my whole body was rebelling .
It felt like a car trying to go up a steep slope with the parking brake on .
My body felt like it was falling apart and would soon come completely undone . "
The pursuit of health and the pursuit of self - destruction are not as far apart as they seem .
It is not just these perversely impressive physical feats that sharpen what might otherwise be a dull treatise on a healthful habit ; Mr. Murakami's work has always combined the ordinary and the extraordinary , and this memoir is no exception .
In his fiction , an elevator ride that starts on the ground floor brings its passenger into a different dimension ; a man makes a bowl of spaghetti and his life irrevocably changes .
In " What I Talk About , " banal description  tying his shoes , picking the songs for his Walkman , feeling a twinge in his knee  sidles up against philosophical inquiry into obsession .
Mr. Murakami is at his best in these passages , fully acknowledging that , while running seems to fall on the bright , healthy side of life , there are deeper and darker drives behind it .
He cannot keep pace with the ponytailed girls who whiz past him on the banks of the Charles River , but this does n't bother him ; he 's in it for the suffering .
" Not to brag , but these girls probably do n't know as much as I do about pain , " he writes .
And in most cases , " learning something essential in life requires physical pain . "
Running may be the antidote for the physical inactivity of writing , but its lessons are not disassociated : Suffering and knowledge often go hand in hand .
" It 's precisely because of the pain , " Mr. Murakami writes , " precisely because we want to overcome that pain , that we can get the feeling , through this process , of really being alive . "
There are times , though , when the lessons become a bit trite .
" Learning from the experience is what makes the triathlon so much fun , " he writes flatly .
A typical day , he tells us at one point , includes running for " an hour and 15 minutes " then , in the afternoon , swimming for " 1,400 yards at the pool , " and in the evening , swimming at the beach .
After that he has a dinner of " walu , a kind of white fish .
They grill it for me over charcoal , and I eat it with soy sauce .
The side dish is vegetable kebabs , plus a large salad . "
This reads like an anorexic 's blog .
And I could not help feeling it was a bit ironic that Mr. Murakami adapted his title from a short story in which four sedentary characters drink two bottles of gin in one sitting .
But , for the most part , Mr. Murakami refrains from adopting the tone of a moralistic lifestyle counselor .
He claims that he 's never recommended running to anyone , and squirms at the very prospect of writing a book about physical activity .
He admits on the first page that " a gentleman should n't go on about what he does to stay fit . "
But , as he says , this is not a book about how to stay fit .
It 's a graceful explanation of Mr. Murakami 's intertwining obsessions , conveyed with his characteristic ability to draw unexpected connections .
Running may be a matter of placing one foot in front of the other on the ground , but , as is so often the case with Mr. Murakami , terrestrial objects have a tendency to take flight .

CAMDEN , N.J. — New Jersey Air National Guard helicopter pilots have helped Camden police with day and nighttime patrols for the last eight months or so on a " routine basis , " Police Chief Scott Thomson said Tuesday night .
" They can help with lighting up an entire block , whether it 's searching for a missing child or a suspect that 's just fled from a vehicle , " Thomson said .
" There 's no hiding from that helicopter . "
Thomson 's comments came after Camden police announced that a 32 - year - old man was arrested and charged with flashing a laser pointer at a National Guard helicopter patrolling with police last week , officials said .
Nelson Villalobos Jr. , 32 , was charged with interference with transportation , a Camden police spokeswoman said .
He was released with a summons .
Villalobos allegedly pointed a green laser at the helicopter on Thursday , temporarily blinding the pilot .
Police on the ground located Villalobos at Alabama and Congress Roads , sitting inside a red Dodge minivan .
Villalobos , of Independence Road in Camden , allegedly told police he thought he was pointing the laser at a news helicopter .
The pointer was found in the minivan 's glove compartment .
Typically , a Jet Ranger helicopter equipped with infrared capabilities , flown by an unarmed guardsman , hovers about 900 to 1,100 feet above Camden , providing aerial surveillance , Thomson said .
Members of the department 's tactical - force unit fly in the helicopter , Thomson said .
The National Guard is often used in times of natural disasters to prevent looting .
But the Posse Comitatus Act , passed in 1878 , restricts what U.S. military forces , including the National Guard , can do to help civilian police keep the peace in most situations .
Thomson said the Jet Rangers can hit speeds of up to 110 m.p.h. and can get around the city quickly .
If need be , the pilots can bring the helicopters as close as 100 feet , he said .
He said the helicopters have scanned rooftops after burglaries , dispersed large crowds by shining a light from above , and tracked people trying to hide from police at night .
He said Camden 's tactical force unit trains regularly with the guardsmen in the Jet Rangers .
Also , at times , the department 's SWAT team trains with guardsmen in Black Hawk helicopters , doing exercises such as fast - roping , a technique for descending on a thick rope , and quick deployments .
" I try to get every resource that I can into the city , " he said .
He said a New Jersey State Police helicopter also provides aerial assistance from time to time .
The department has had a relationship with the National Guard for the last 15 years or so , Thomson said .
He remembers flying with guardsmen when he was a patrolman in the 1990s .
Thomson said he reached out to the National Guard to complement the city 's patrols .
" They know the city .
They work with well with our folks , " Thomson said .
" It 's another tool that we can utilize to help provide public safety to our residents . "

Moore 101
" I 'd discovered American comic books at age 7 , " Alan Moore told the website Comic Book Resources in a 2002 interview .
" I later came to appreciate comics as an art form , and realized that even with glorious exceptions like Will Eisner [ and ]
Harvey Kurtzman , this was a field that was still largely untouched .
Its great work still lay in the future at that point . "
Coming from anyone else , the statement would sound immodest , but Moore 's work backs it up .
Since entering the comics business in the late ' 70s , Moore has helped redefine the medium several times over .
But his work leans more toward the subversive than the radical .
The lion 's share of Moore 's writing can be classified neatly into genres — dystopian science fiction , true crime , more than a few superhero stories — but written in a way that takes the genre 's conventions apart while still paying heed to them .
Moore is a maverick who realizes he needs a tradition to play against .
Advertisement
Moore 's best - known , bestselling work is Watchmen , which calls upon decades of superhero tradition , and helped kick off the trend of " grim ' n ' gritty " adventure comics by placing morally ambiguous characters in a more realistic milieu .
Released in serial form over 12 issues in 1986 and ' 87 , Watchmen was loosely based on the Charlton Comics ' line of Golden Age superheroes ( properties wholly owned by DC Comics , Watchmen 's publisher ) , but it added all manner of pulp archetypes and historical conundrums , from pirate tales and murder mysteries to the Gordian Knot and the quagmire in Vietnam .
Unlike the postmodern superhero stories to come — some by Moore himself — Watchmen does n't take a tongue - in - cheek approach to existing comics history .
It rewrites that history completely , imagining costumed crusaders as pathetic and pathological , less interested in keeping the peace than in living out their self - satisfying fantasies .
But while Watchmen 's characters and plot have become less radical over time — either because they 've been copied so much , or because they were thin and derivative to begin with — the structure and sophistication of the book 's storytelling remain every bit as thrilling now as they were 20 years ago .
Dave Gibbons ' insanely detailed art finds visual rhymes and thematic connections that even Moore did n't know he 'd implied , and Moore 's method of stopping the action in order to look deeper into what a character is reading , as well as his devoting whole chapters to some heroes ' convoluted backstories ( complete with frenetic time - jumps , in the case of the omni-powerful Dr. Manhattan ) has influenced a generation of geek art , right up to the current ABC hit Lost .
The immediate impact of Watchmen was a wave of violent , ugly , and stupid superhero comics .
The long - term impact has been much more resounding .

After swearing off major comics companies over issues of creators ' rights in the late ' 80s , Moore spent much of the '90s doing quirky short - term assignments and work - for - hire jobs for the many upstart independent publishers that sprung up in the early '90s .
Meanwhile , he worked on a pair of long - term projects : Lost Girls ( see below ) and From Hell , a sprawling , copiously researched account of the Jack The Ripper slayings .
As a mystery , it 's a non-starter : Moore reveals the killer early on , and his solution is neither original nor , with its conspiratorial ties to Freemasonry and the Royal Family , plausible .
But that really is n't the point .
From Hell lets Moore vivisect Late Victorian culture , pinpointing the source of the slaying less as one man than as the society that produced him , and tracing a pattern of cause and effect from the architects of Atlantis up to the present day .
Moore 's work has always been best served by artists ready to realize his vision down to the minutest detail , and here , Australia - based artist Eddie Campbell uses quavery black - and - white art to capture the church steeples , downtown billboards , and back - alley blood - spatters with equally unsparing attention .

Moore , a lifelong resident of Northampton , England , ended the '90s by launching the slyly named America 's Best Comics , an imprint consisting , initially at least , of comics penned entirely by Moore .
All the ABC titles have qualities to recommend them , but none has the immediate appeal of Top 10 , a police drama set in a city of superpowered beings inspired more by Ed McBain than Justice League Of America .
Loaded with references both obvious and obscure ( some buried almost subliminally in Gene Ha's penciled art ) , it sends up the conventions of cop and superhero stories without letting the humor overwhelm the emotional pull of its appealing characters .
It breathed fresh life into both genres , before ending unceremoniously after 12 issues .
Moore returned to the Top 10 world twice , with excellent results both times :
Using a pair of characters to explore the conventions of fantasy literature with the spin - off limited series Smax , and delving into the origins of the Top 10 world with the prequel graphic novel Top 10 : The 49ers .
Intermediate Work

After a couple of years of writing short comic - book stories for British magazines — often using pre-existing characters like Captain Britain — Moore started developing ideas for original series .
In 1982 , in the cutting - edge UK anthology Warrior , Moore and artist David Lloyd introduced V For Vendetta , a dark commentary on what they saw as the creeping fascism of the nuclear age .
Moore and Lloyd offer up two protagonists : a philosophical terrorist wearing a mask fashioned after notorious anarchist Guy Fawkes , and an abused young woman whom " V " takes under his wing , to teach her ( and thereby us ) what needs to be done to preserve individuality and free thought .
Built around short chapters , frequent plot twists , and heavy doses of bleak irony , V For Vendetta was a sensation in serialized form , but Moore and Lloyd had to abandon the story when Warrior folded .
They came back to it three years later , when DC offered to let them finish the run , but the completed book feels unbalanced .
It 's two - thirds a gripping yarn , followed by a rushed , shrill third act .
Still , those first two - thirds were enough to prove that Moore had the vision to spin a complex , involving narrative over more than eight pages .

Another densely detailed period piece , this one illustrated by Kevin O'Neill , The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen takes a concept straight out of fan fiction and turns it into an exciting inquiry into how the heroes and villains an era produces reveal its fears and desires .
With explosions .
That premise : What if The Invisible Man , Captain Nemo , Mr. Hyde , Allen Quatermain , and Mina Murray from Dracula teamed up to save the world ?
It works both as high adventure and as a game of spot - the - reference sure to challenge the most hardened devotee of Victorian and Edwardian popular fiction .
But Moore 's treatment of the characters truly distinguishes the book .
He does n't so much redefine his heroes as draw out who they already are .
The Invisible Man becomes the definition of amorality .
Nemo 's opposition to authority becomes a precursor for the coming centuries ' terrorist acts .
After revealing that The League was one of several Leagues that appeared over the centuries , Moore and O'Neill deepened the mythology with a satisfying second volume and the frustrating The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen : The Black Dossier , the latter as much a sourcebook as a proper story .

Watchmen overshadows most of Alan Moore 's other superhero work , but it was neither his first nor his last plunge into the world of capes and tights .
The tangled history of Miracleman — from its origins as a British derivation of the 1940s Captain Marvel character to its current status as the source of a seemingly bottomless legal quagmire — is a Primer unto itself .
Moore 's run on the title stretched from its 1982 revival as a feature in Warrior through 16 issues .
It begins with the middle - aged Micky Moran remembering he has the ability to transform into a superhero with the use of a magic word , and it ends with Moran 's alter ego becoming a god on earth .
In between , Moore teases out the troubling implications always present in the genre .
What do these power fantasies mean , and , if left unchecked , where would they take us ?
Can the gulf between humanity and superhumanity ever be closed ?
" His emotions are so pure , " Moran tells his wife early in the run , " when he loves you it 's gigantic .
His love is so strong and clean …
When I love you it 's all tangled up with who 's not doing their share of the washing up and twisted neurotic things like that . "
By the end of Moore 's story , the part of Moran that asks such questions is gone .
Moore was growing up in public as he wrote Miracleman .
His progression and the wildly variable art — it begins beautifully with pencils by Garry Leach and Alan Davis , and ends with John Totleben 's masterful pointillist work , but suffers in between — makes Miracleman show its seams a bit .
But should it ever become widely available again , it should assume its proper status as one of Moore 's best work .
( The A.V. Club would never endorse illegal downloads , but there are rumors that it 's digitally available online . )

After stripping superheroes down to their base elements in the ' 80s with Miracleman and Watchmen , Moore began putting them back together again in the '90s .
Invited by the artists at Image to do more or less whatever he wanted with their creations — whenever he needed a quick influx of cash to help him finish From Hell — Moore initially responded with the muddled , unfinished miniseries 1963 , and some routine work - for - hire on Spawn and WildC.A.T.s .
Then he took over Rob Liefeld 's grotesque Superman rip - off Supreme , and renewed a love affair with the genre that Watchmen had effectively killed off .
Over the course of 22 Supreme issues , Moore strove to write superhero stories as imaginative and light - hearted as the best of the Silver Age , while subtly acknowledging that times had changed , and that throwback comics can never be more than a self - conscious construct .
Though Moore was mainly spitballing ideas that he'd bring to fruition with the America 's Best Comic line a few years later , and though he never got to bring Supreme to the big battle - royal finale he 'd planned , the series ' individual issues — collected in two sloppily produced trade paperbacks by Checker — are in many ways the most purely " fun " comics Moore has ever written , and some of the best " Superman " stories since the '60s .
Like Supreme , a lot of Alan Moore 's projects in the '90s went unfinished or unrealized , as he struggled to make the transition from genre writer to serious writer , while independent comics publishers and unreliable artists folded all around him .
But in 1991 , Moore completed an entire graphic novella that has gone practically unnoticed .
A Small Killing , illustrated by Argentinean painter Oscar Zarate , jumps around the consciousness of a rising young advertising executive as he prepares to start pitching a soft drink to the Soviets .
He flashes back to his childhood in the low - rent suburbs , and tries to puzzle out the reasons behind his intuition that someone 's trying to kill him .
The secret is n't that hard to figure out , but A Small Killing is n't the kind of story that relies on surprise .
It 's more a poignant depiction of how the ghosts of our choices linger , as well as a demonstration that Moore is capable of writing a sophisticated non-adventure book that does n't descend to pretentious incomprehensibility .
A Small Killing is his most underrated work .

Moore 's interest in fringe science and the occult has grown more intense through the years .
By the mid-'90s , he was publicly professing to worship the Roman snake god Glycon ( though his attraction to the deity seems largely tied to the probability that the original Glycon cult was defrauding the devout ) .
Promethea began as the ABC line 's take on Wonder Woman , and became a clearinghouse for Moore 's thoughts on Alesteir Crowley , tarot , and the Kabbalah , before circling not quite all the way back again in its final apocalyptic issues .
Reading it can feel a lot like being buttonholed by a genial , disturbingly persuasive madman with fully considered ideas about the mystic forces that secretly guide the world .
The gorgeous art by J.H. Williams , who guides Promethea from a slightly dystopian city to the afterlife and all points beyond , stays in lockstep with Moore 's ideas , no matter how outré they become .

DC's Swamp
Thing was on the verge of cancellation when Alan Moore assumed writing duties in 1984 .
It became his breakthrough into American comics , one accomplished by turning the title on its head .
Swamp
Thing 's origin was pretty simple : Alec Holland , a scientist working on a secret project in the Louisiana swamps , has been turned into a horrific vegetable monster thanks to an explosion intended to kill him .
With his second issue , Moore used a story called " The Anatomy Lesson " to unravel that origin , revealing that Holland had died in the explosion , leaving behind a vegetable creature who only thought he was Holland .
Instead of a man who had turned into a plant , he was a plant laboring under the illusion that he'd once been a man .
From that inversion , Moore spun horror stories with a mystical bent , sending Swamp
Thing off to explore the afterlife , the dark side of America ( in a long storyline that introduced acerbic magician John Constantine , soon to star in his own series ) , and , less successfully , outer space .
Stephen Bissette and John Totleben supplied the lion 's share of the art for a run that , by the time it concluded , had helped redefine what could and could n't be done with comics , and built a mythical system out of the fringe elements of the DC Universe .
That 's what makes it simultaneously brilliant and a little forbidding to comics newcomers , who may not immediately get the references to Adam Strange , Deadman , and other venerable - but - obscure characters .
The poetic storytelling that balances creepiness with tenderness — the latter courtesy of Swamp Thing 's odd romance with an understanding woman named Abby — makes the problem easy to overlook .

Soon after Moore launched From Hell in Steve Bissette 's short - lived ( but glorious ) horror anthology Taboo , he added the erotic juvenile fiction deconstruction Lost Girls to the Taboo roster .
When Taboo folded , Moore and artist Melinda Gebbie ( who became Moore 's romantic partner as well ) decided to complete the whole story before publishing it , and 15 years later , they convinced independent publisher Top Shelf to release Lost Girls as a three - volume hardbound box set , retailing for $ 75 .
The book sold more than 30,000 copies , which is a testament to Moore 's reputation , because while Lost Girls is one of his most straightforward stories — divided , like V For Vendetta and so many other Moore works , into digestible chunks — the subject matter could n't be more repellent .
Attempting to demystify pornography and pull apart the psychological underpinning of children 's stories , Moore and Gebbie have The Wizard Of Oz's Dorothy , Peter Pan 's Wendy , and Alice In Wonderland 's Alice enjoying a sexy country vacation on the eve of World War I .
The material set in 1913 is explicit but fairly benign , while the retellings of each woman 's personal history are at times stomach - turningly shocking , including graphic depictions of well - loved children 's book characters — some of them children themselves — engaging in sexual activity .
Lost Girls is a bold work that dares to ask whether fantasy alone can be harmful , and while it is n't always successful as a statement of principles , it 's as emotionally affecting a book as the comics medium has ever produced .

Essential Stories
1. " Whatever Happened To The Man Of Tomorrow ? "
Alan Moore only had three cracks at Superman , but he made all three count : first with the rich Superman 's - greatest - wish story " For The Man Who Has Everything , " then with the surreal Swamp Thing team - up " The Jungle Line , " and finally with " Whatever Happened To The Man Of Tomorrow ? , " a two - issue farewell to Superman designed to clear the decks before the series rebooted in 1986 .
Set free to come up with a logical endpoint to 46 years of Superman lore , Moore made the bad guys badder , brought back nearly every Superman character and concept for one last hurrah , and found a way to spread wanton destruction throughout the DC universe , while still ending with a reassuring wink .
Though it 's far less dense than Watchmen , the same approach pertains :
What if the people who created superhero comics cared as much as the people who read them ?

2. " Greyshirt : How Things Work Out " :
Appearing in Tomorrow Stories , ABC 's uneven but often brilliant anthology series , " How Things Work Out " uses Greyshirt , Moore and Rick Veitch 's homage to Will Eisner 's masked gumshoe The Spirit , as the anchor for a storytelling experiment with a powerful payoff .
Set in a four - story apartment building , with each story of the building capturing a different decade , it follows a father and son 's dashed dreams to their tragic conclusion .

3. " Reversible Man "
A lot of Moore 's early stories for British magazines are tossed - off goofs , heavy on punchlines and gleeful oddity .
But " The Reversible Man " is a powerful exception .
Like a lot of that early work , it explores a single idea — in this case , it 's that old fantasy - fiction chestnut , " What would it be like to live your life backward , from death to birth ? " — but rather than going for laughs , Moore finds the sweetness in the concept , observing how irritation with spouses turns to fervent affection , and how work gets " progressively easier … and I had to give less and less money to the firm every Friday night . "
In four short pages , Moore packs in dozens of touching observations on the pains and pleasures of everyday life , before ending on a moment of existential horror .
Advertisement
4. " Swamp Thing : Pog "
Moore never let his affection for classic comics creations stop him from using them to heartbreaking ends .
Originally published in Swamp Thing # 32 , " Pog " recasts Walt Kelly 's Pogo characters as visitors from another planet who drop by Swamp Thing 's Louisiana turf in search of a more hospitable environment .
Instead , they find the same problems they left behind , discovering that a world overrun with humanity has little use for funny animals , no matter how whimsical their speech or sharp their social commentary .
( Moore has never let his own complicity in the darkening tone of modern comics get in the way of mourning what 's been lost .
See also the brief , brutal one - off story " Pictopia . " )

5 . The Killing Joke
Advertisement
While Watchmen had a lot to do with the darkening of superhero comics in the decade to come , Moore 's 48 - page , Brian Bolland - illustrated Batman story The Killing Joke — along with Frank Miller 's badass Batman revival The Dark Knight Returns — showed future writers and artists how to add a coat of grime to preexisting characters .
Even Moore has regretted the influence of The Killing Joke , a nasty re-telling of the Joker 's origin story that spills over into the sexualized torture of Batgirl .
But while its chin-stroking " are good and evil really the same ? " theme is n't all that profound — and its punk nihilism loses its cool once readers get past their sophomore year of college —
The Killing Joke is undeniably upsetting , and it carries Moore 's obsession with rhyming images to a mind - bending extreme .
Even now , adolescent comic - book fans can read The Killing Joke for the first time and think , " This is how superhero comics are supposed to be , " while middle - aged comics fans read it and think , " This is the moment where the genre went wrong . "
Either way , The Killing Joke remains an impressive achievement .
Demerits
Even the most brilliant writer in comicdom takes some wrong turns .
In Moore 's case , the mistakes have either been the result of his taking a job strictly for money , or trying something that stretches the comics form a little too much .
In the mid-'90s , with From Hell still uncompleted and his other art - comics on hiatus , Moore cashed some checks from Image and Awesome Comics , and worked on their superhero properties .
Some of those comics , like Supreme , Youngblood , and Glory , are slight but highly entertaining , while others are jumbled and indifferent .
Moore spent a year writing the adventures of the interstellar super - team WildC.A.T.s , but while he tries to riff on class conflict and the distinctions between human and artificial intelligence , his plots are overly convoluted , and he does n't seem especially interested in reining them in .
Meanwhile , in the spin - off miniseries Voodoo , Moore crafts a bayou mystery around a telepathic WildC.A.T.s heroine / stripper , but his interjections of local color are blaringly awkward , and the mystery story fairly bland .
Advertisement
On the flip side , Moore has also been involved with some work that exposes his weakness for the willfully obscure .
Periodically , he 's allowed artists to adapt his prose stories and performance - art pieces into comics , and the results have been generally dire .
The book A Disease Of Language collects two Moore lectures on magic , history , and human consciousness , illustrated by From Hell 's Eddie Campbell .
Both " The Birth Caul " and " Snakes And Ladders " are beautifully drawn and sporadically insightful , but they suffer from Moore 's persistent belief that incomprehensibility is a prerequisite to mystic understanding .
Miscellany

Perhaps the biggest " what might 've been " in Moore 's bibliography is Big Numbers , a self - published , serialized graphic novel that he and artist Bill Sienkiewicz completed two issues of in 1990 , before Sienkiewicz crumpled under the workload and Moore 's publishing imprint Mad Love collapsed financially .
In retrospect , maybe it was all for the best .
Big Numbers was insanely ambitious , attempting to connect up the patterns in a handful of strangers ' lives via fractal geometry , while also pushing comics design forward with a purposeful mix of black - and - white and color , collage and paint .
But on the page , Moore 's " everyday people " seem a little shallow , and his " big picture " pretty unfocused .
A lot of the major ideas in Big Numbers were being explored simultaneously in From Hell , and once Moore turned his attention more fully to the latter , he was able to write a stealthier masterpiece , without the pressure of expectation that weighed down Big Numbers .
Continuing the " unfinished " trend , in 1993 Moore crafted an elaborate homage to the boisterous early days of Marvel Comics with the miniseries 1963 , a six - part riff on Stan Lee 's hyperbolic prose and Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko 's dynamic art , featuring characters based on Spider - Man , Nick Fury , The Fantastic Four , Thor , Doctor Strange and the like .
The whole endeavor was supposed to culminate in an 80 - page " annual " that would contrast the imaginative simplicity of early Marvel with the simplistic imagination of the early ' 90s , but 1963 's publisher Image got wrapped up in internal turmoil , and the story never got its contextual epilogue .
All that remains are six issues of overly rigid pastiche , lacking the spirit of later Moore superhero works like Supreme and Tom Strong .

And speaking of Tom Strong , while it hardly counts as " unfinished " ( since Moore masterminded 36 issues and a wealth of spin - offs ) , it may be the one property in the America 's Best Comics line that never hit its full stride .
After a stellar debut issue that introduced the Doc Savage - like superhero and his extended family of do - gooders , Tom Strong rarely recreated the same mix of wonder , wit , and wisdom .
The book quickly became another Supreme - like romp through the Silver Age , full of incomplete thoughts and only mildly amusing structural experiments .
Increasingly , Moore gave the Tom Strong stories over to guest writers and co-writers , and the concept lost cohesion .
One recurring trait in Moore 's career has been that intense focus and follow - through results in greatness , while dabbling produces something , well , less than legendary .

Twilight Of The Superheroes is only slightly less frustrating than Big Numbers or 1963 , if only because , instead of dead - ending , it never got started .
Intended as a Ragnarok for the DC Universe , it imagines a future in which the House Of Steel ( ruled by Superman ) and the House Of Thunder ( ruled by Captain Marvel ) have helped steer the Earth toward its apocalypse .
Moore broke with DC before it could be realized , but not before leaving behind a detailed proposal filled with twists and turns that suggest the mind - blowing comic that might have been .
President Barack Obama has personally ordered the assassination of a U.S. citizen .
Yep !
The C.I.A. is authorized to kill cleric Anwar al - Awlaki wherever and whenever they find him .
At home , on vacation , maybe right behind you .
Crypto- fascists are thrilled !
It just seems like a really , really bad precedent , to decide that the president can do this .
In fact , I am pretty sure the president can't do this .
Obviously , presidents and the CIA have gone around assassinating people willy - nilly for decades , but the point is that they should n't be doing that .
But here 's the good news , President Obama : you have finally done something crazy enough to win the support of former assistant US Attorney , police state enthusiast , and " Obama is just like Ahmadinejad " theorist Andy McCarthy !
McCarthy thinks he has caught " the Left " in a brilliant double - standard .
They like Obama , and they like reading terrorists their rights , and they like holding " trials " for people " accused " of " crimes , " and they presumably like this Assassination Program thing because their boyfriend Barack Obama is doing it .
How illogical !
Because he is a moron , Andy McCarthy does not understand that " the Left " will not like this at all .
Old fashioned , TNR - publishing hawk Democrats will be fine with it , because they are the people who were also totally into that Iraq thing .
But that is not " the Left . "
" The Democrats " do not equal " the Left . "
That is an incredibly , embarrassingly obvious statement , and one that literally any follower of politics would not need to have explained to him or her at any point in the last 100 years besides the immediate , crazy present , when supposed informed pundits like Andy McCarthy are seriously convinced that " The Left " will cheerlead an insane policy devised by Bush 's hack lawyers .
Oh , look , The Nation and The Daily Worker just published a joint editorial announcing their enthusiastic support for " the presidential assassination program , " because words do n't mean anything anymore and everyone is a fucking moron .
Argh .
( Some other guy at The Corner is uneasy about this new policy of the President decided he can kill any American citizen he wants any time he wants .
God , why does this other guy at The Corner want Americans to die from terror ?
When did K - Lo start letting hippies in the clubhouse ? )
Once again , for all the FDR - worship talk from the White House , it really looks like they 're modeling their first term on LBJ .
Sorry , historic domestic achievements , but we have endless illegal warfare to take care of !
The problem is that we live in a finite world , and our resource use cannot continue to grow forever .
In fact , we likely will need to reduce the use of some resources because we are reaching limits , such as depleted fresh - water aquifers and less available oil supply ( higher prices compared to pre-2004 norms ) .
We may also decide to limit fossil fuel use because of climate change concerns .
If we are reaching limits such as these , there is a substantial chance that incomes will no longer grow as they have in the past , making the funding of future promised benefits even more problematic than actuarial forecasts would suggest .
I think , though , that the funding situation for these programs is likely to be even worse than the actuarial forecasts project .
The actuarial forecasts assume that the economy can continue to grow as it has in the past , and that wages will continue to rise .
The forecasts also assume that population will continue to grow .
With these assumptions , the plans tend to stay fairly close to in balance , with contributions , as percentages of wages , remaining unchanged .
If we think about the situation , though , the difference is really academic .
The payments we ( and our employers ) make to Social Security and Medicare are very close to taxes , and the fact that the programs are underfunded is not taken into account in determining the federal deficit does n't make the problem any less real .
If the programs are to be maintained at current levels , young people will have to pay much higher contributions -- does n't this sound a lot like debt ?
When we think about the taxes and the federal deficit , we do n't usually think of Social Security and Medicare , because in government lingo , the payments we make for these programs are n't taxes , they are contributions , and the funding deficit for these programs is not taken into account in determining the federal deficit .
Today is " Tax Day " in the US -- the day that income taxes are due for 2009 .
Another on - line group asked for submission of tax related articles for Tax Day .
The audience there is not particularly peak oil aware , so I put together this post .
Typical View of Funding
Many people believe that somehow the contributions they and their employers make to Social Security and Medicare are set aside for them , earn interest , and when the time comes , will be there for them .
Figure 1 .
Pot of gold some of us imagine at the end of our Social Security and Medicare contributions
This is quite far from the truth ( although this impression is fostered by calling the programs ) .
When Social Security was first begun , it was simply a pay - as - you - go system .
Figure 2 . Social Security contributions ( excluding interest ) and expenditures based on Social Security Administration Data .
One can see from Figure 2 that up until about 1986 , differences between contributions and expenditures were very small .
It was as if the cost of benefit payments in a given year was divided among the current working population .
After about 1986 , there is a greater difference between contributions and expenditures , but the amounts are still fairly close because the funding assumptions assume a fair amount of real growth in wages will occur in the future , limiting the need for advance funding .
Figure 3 . Medicare contributions ( excluding interest ) and expenditures based on Census Spreadsheet .
If one looks at the spreadsheet of Medicare contributions , one finds that expenditures match up fairly closely with the sum of " Contributions " plus " General Revenue , " implying little advance funding .
Detail data indicates while the " Hospital Insurance " portion of the program is funded by contributions , the other portions ( Supplementary Medical Insurance and Drug coverage ) rely to a significant extent on general revenue .
What Happens to Excess Funding
The amount of excess funding for Medicare is pretty minimal , but for Social Security , at least up until to 2009 , there were several years when substantial extra funds ( the difference between Contributions and Expenditures ) were being collected .
What happens to these excess funds ?
There are different accounts with different names , but when one looks beyond the rhetoric , what , in fact , happens is the government takes the contributions that exceed needs on a pay - as - you go basis and spends them on whatever else it might need tax revenue for -- salaries , roads , the war in Iraq or Afghanistan , or whatever .
In its place , it leaves IOUs in the form of special issue bonds and certificates of indebtedness .
As of the end of 2009 , the amount of these bonds amounted to $ 2.5 trillion dollars , and the average interest rate was 4.688 % .
These bonds are held in trust funds .
For more information , see Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds : An Expanded Exposition .
Because of the availability of these funds , the US government has less need for borrowing from " outside " -- for example China or Japan .
For example , at the end of 2009 Wikipedia shows the US having gross debt of $ 12.3 trillion dollars , and " Debt held by the public of $ 7.8 trillion dollars .
By subtraction , $ 4.5 trillion dollars of debt is held by government agencies .
Social Security Trust Fund debt is $ 2.5 trillion out of this $ 4.5 trillion dollars .
The other $ 2 trillion dollars relate to other government programs where the expenditures were lower than cash flow ( perhaps because of premiums collected in advance ) .
The advance funding in these programs were treated similarly to Social Security and Medicare -- that is , the excess funding was spent , and US government debt substituted for it , allowing the US government to borrow less from outsiders .
From the point of view of those putting together the financial statements for Social Security and Medicare , the US government bonds are assets paying interest , and thus reduce the need for Social Security contributions .
But let 's think about this .
Where is the money going to come from , both to repay the government debt , and to pay interest ?
It can only come from higher taxes .
So while Social Security contributions may be a bit lower , essentially the same individuals will likely have to pay higher income taxes ( or other taxes ) in the future to repay this debt plus interest , so the benefit of this whole arrangement is much less than it might otherwise would be .
The actuarial reports for Social Security and Medicare talk about when the trust funds for these organizations ( containing US government debt ) will have exhausted their balances , because outflow will exceed income for enough years that all of the US government debt will need to be redeemed .
While this is one date of interest if you are running the trust funds , it seems to me that at least an equally important issue is when it is no longer possible to use Social Security and Medicare as an easy place to get funding for government programs ( war in Iraq , or whatever ) , without having to sell bonds to outsiders .
Once expenditures start exceeding contributions on an annual basis , the US government loses a place to conveniently fund its debt , and is forced to borrow more from other sources .
Based on Figure 2 , we seem to be reaching the point now where expenditures exceed contributions for Social Security .
If trends continue , and expenditures start to materially exceed outflow , it may be necessary to further ramp up external governmental debt because of the loss of internal debt financing provided by Social Security .
The Role of Limited Resources
If a person stops to think about it , paying for Social Security and Medicare benefits on a pay - as - you - go basis is n't quite as dumb as it sounds .
In some real sense , all beneficiaries can receive in a given year is goods and services that the economy can produce in that year .
These goods and services are a subset of the total of the total goods and services produced by the economy , since the workers who produce the goods and services will also have to have shares as well .
Figure 4 . Schematic drawing created by author of how goods and services in a given year , here 2050 , might be split between workers and retirees .
Allocation shown is just to give an idea of how this works -- does not reflect actual benefit levels .
Each worker or benefits recipient receives a tiny sliver of the total " pie " of goods and services available .
While there is some variability in the size of this " pie " because a service giver or manufacturer can choose to produce more output , this output is limited by necessary inputs .
For example , if gasoline or diesel is in short supply , fewer goods may be manufactured , and food may be in shorter supply , because diesel is used in cultivation , transportation , and refrigeration .
If fresh water pumped from the Ogallala Aquifer is in short supply , less corn may be grown in the Plains States , leading to less ethanol and less food for animals .
Where We are Now with Respect to Resource Limits
Figure 5 . Figure showing world energy production , in tons of oil equivalent , based on BP Statistical data .
Figure from Energy Export Data Browser .
Unfortunately , we are already getting to the point where resource limits are affecting economies .
Figure 5 shows that world oil production hit a plateau , starting about 2004 .
Figure 5 shows data only through 2008 , but production for 2009 still is on the same flat plateau .
Since world population is growing , this means on average , less and less oil products are being produced for each person .
The limiting effect of reduced oil supply ripples through world financial markets , either as higher prices or ( something which is less recognized ) reduced credit availability .
Oil is used for a lot of things -- food production , manufacturing new cars , and in building new homes .
The constricted supply of oil has no doubt played a role in the recent economic contraction -- for example , with higher oil prices after 2004 , homes in distant suburbs no longer were as desirable , leading to loss of demand and lower prices for these homes .
To offset the failure of oil production to expand , Figure 5 shows that there has been a huge ramp up of coal production , and a smaller ramp up of natural gas production .
But coal and gas are not very good substitutes for oil -- they can be used to produce electricity , but electricity does n't fuel our long haul trucks , or supply asphalt to pave our highways , or fill many other roles now handled by oil products .
The ramp - up of coal has been mostly in lesser - developed countries , but the US and other developed countries received the benefit of this ramp up , through cheap goods imported from abroad .
Long term , the ramp up of coal is not a very good strategy from a climate change point of view -- coal is the worst fossil fuel from a point of view of CO2 emissions , and carbon capture and storage is a long way away from a feasibility point of view .
Going forward , there are differing views on whether world oil production can again be ramped up , or if it will soon begin to decline .
We know that in individual locations , oil production seems to reach a maximum level , and then start declining .
Figure 6 . US Oil Production , based on data of the US Energy Information Administration .
As an example , oil production for the US 48 states ( excluding Alaska and Hawaii ) reached a maximum in 1970 .
Drilling was then started in Alaska , and production reached a peak there a few years later .
The same pattern has occurred in many areas around the world where liquid oil is produced - the North Sea , Mexico , and in something over half of the oil producing countries in the world , lead most observers to believe that eventually liquid oil production for the world will begin to decline .
At this point , world oil production is approximately flat , as shown in Figure 5 .
There are various solid forms of oil , which theoretically have longer , flatter production patterns , which might possibly be ramped up to offset declining liquid oil production .
For example , a huge amount of oil is theoretically available from the oil sands in Canada , but extraction is very slow and expensive . .
Oil can also be produced by heating kerogen ( found in oil shale ) for long periods , but this procedure is also expensive and slow to ramp up .
It remains to be seen whether sources such as these will have provide more than a very minor impact .
There are many estimates as to when world oil production will decline .
This recent US military report says ( page 29 ) :
By 2012 , surplus oil production capacity could entirely disappear , and as early as 2015 , the shortfall in output could reach nearly 10 MBD [ million barrels per day ] .
The National Petroleum Council put out a report called Facing Hard Truths about Energy Supply , in response to a request by Samuel Bodman , who was at that time Secretary of Energy .
The report talks about the need to ramp up energy resources of all types , in response to growing demand and uncertain future supply .
An estimate by Tony Eriksen ( " ace " ) of The Oil Drum shows world oil production beginning to decline in 2011 .
Figure 8 . US Consumption of Primary Energy , based on Table 1.3 of the Energy Overview of US Energy Information Administration .
Even without a significant decline in world oil production , Figure 8 shows that the US has seen its oil consumption decline in the last couple of years , as China and the oil exporting countries take more of the available oil .
While some would argue that this decline is the result of the recession , a good case can be made that the causality is as more the other way around -- high oil prices , starting as early as 2004 , had an adverse impact on the US economy .
James Hamilton is one economist who has shown a connection between high oil prices and the current recession .
The adverse impact of oil on the economy is also frequently mentioned by Energy Secretary Steven Chu .
Figure 8 shows that renewables have played a very minor role , and do not come close to offsetting the decline in available oil supply .
If oil is in short supply going forward , there is a significant chance that what we have seen as the recent recession will continue or will reappear , after a short intermission .
In fact , the recession may well get worse .
A cutback on other energy sources , such as coal , would likely cause further recessionary impacts , as would a widespread shortage of fresh water .
What is this Likely to Mean for Social Security and Medicare Funding ?
Social Security and Medicare funding are done through contributions that are computed as percentages of wages .
If wages do not rise , because of recession , neither will contributions to these programs , and this lack of contributions is likely to be a problem .
If a person looks at Figure 2 ( shown above ) , one can see that there has been a very distinct flattening of Social Security funding in the last three years , as wages have plateaued .
At the same time , expenditures have tended to continue to increase .
A big part of this arises from the fact that many people are now reaching retirement age , because the oldest baby boomers are now 64 years old .
With layoffs more frequent , and jobs less available , some may choose to take benefits early , rather than look for another job .
Figure 2 seems to show a larger uptick in expenditures recently , as if more are taking retirement benefits when other options are not available .
Figure 9 .
Author 's estimate of future Social Security contributions and expenditures , if contributions are limited by recession , but expenditures are not .
If , in fact , we are now hitting resource limits , the patterns of the past couple years may repeat themselves .
In Figure 9 , I show a very rough idea of what kind of impact this might be expected to have on the Social Security program .
Trends toward high expenditures and flat contributions would continue .
Eventually , high unemployment rates and lower wages would have an impact on benefits received , but before this happens , contributions ( based on wages ) would likely fall far below expenditures .
I have not tried to make any forecasts for the Medicare program , but note that even with the current actuarial estimates , expenditures are shown as rising much more rapidly than Social Security expenditures .
Medicare expenditures are now about 75 % of Social Security expenditures , but by the late 2020s , Medicare expenditures are expected to exceed Social Security expenditures .
If contributions are based on flat , or possibly even falling salaries , this would cause a real funding problem .
( Of course , plan administrators would have the option of raising contributions or reducing benefits to fix this problem . )
Solutions
There are no easy solutions .
Population growth has always been encouraged , because such growth makes it easier to fund benefits for a rising population of seniors .
It also gives spreads the US debt over a broader base .
But if resources are limited , the last thing we need is a growing population .
We would be better off with a smaller population , so that earth 's limited resources can be shared among a smaller number of people , providing more for each person .
If families start having only one child each , this would be helpful from a resources point of view , but it would make it even more difficult to pay off out all of the outstanding debt , in addition to paying for Social Security and Medicare benefits for all the seniors .
Figure 10 .
Schematic drawing created by the author showing how goods and services in 2050 might be distributed between workers and retirees if benefits continue to grow , but the population of workers shrinks .
I think we need to assume that eventually Social Security and Medicare benefits will need to be cut back - - otherwise the retirees ' share of the resource pie will just become too large .
This will especially be an issue , if resources in total are declining , so everyone is poorer .
Social Security and Medicare will not be an easy issue to fix , because all of us are affected , and no one will welcome the changes .
Politicians are likely to continue to find the issue very difficult to deal with .
Bernie Ebbers leaves the Manhattan court after sentencing
Mr Ebbers was found guilty of fraud and conspiracy in March , following revelations of an $ 11bn ( £ 6.2 bn ) accounting fraud at Worldcom in 2002 .
The 63 - year - old was also guilty of seven counts of filing false documents .
Mr Ebbers will begin serving his sentence at a federal prison in Yazoo City , Mississippi , close to his home .
The sentence was handed down by federal judge Barbara Jones , who earlier this week rejected his request for a new trial .
The sentence was the toughest yet in a string of corporate scandals in the US .
Mr Ebbers did not address the court .
Instead , he wiped his eyes with a white tissue .
Meanwhile , Kristie Ebbers , his wife , cried quietly .
The jail term effectively satisfies pleas from prosecutors for a life sentence to be imposed on Mr Ebbers .
' Leader ' in crime
Defence lawyer Reid Weingarten had called for a more lenient sentence , given Mr Ebbers ' heart condition and his involvement in charitable works .
However , Judge Barbara Jones said she did not believe his heart condition was sufficiently serious to warrant a reduced sentence .
A sentence of anything less would not reflect the seriousness of the crime
Barbara Jones , Federal Judge
She also rejected his lawyers ' contention that the government overstated the losses that investors suffered in the fraud .
And she rejected their contention that Mr Ebbers was not a mastermind of the accounting wrongdoing .
Mr Ebbers " was clearly a leader of criminal activity in this case , " the judge said .
" A sentence of anything less would not reflect the seriousness of the crime . "
Biggest bankruptcy
Worldcom 's collapse was the biggest bankruptcy in US corporate history .
Some 20,000 workers lost their jobs , while shareholders lost about $ 180bn , when the company filed for bankruptcy protection .
Kristie and Bernie Ebbers leaving the court on Wednesday
A former Worldcom salesman , Henry J Bruin Jr , told the hearing in Manhattan that the company 's collapse had caused him " untold human carnage " and that he had suffered " sheer hell " .
Mr Ebbers is the first of six former Worldcom executives and accountants facing sentencing this summer .
The remaining five have already pleaded guilty and agreed to co-operate in the case against their former boss .
On Monday , a judge backed a multi-million dollar settlement under which Mr Ebbers must surrender most of his personal assets , including $ 5 m in cash , to resolve a shareholder lawsuit .
The settlement leaves Mr Ebbers ' wife with about $ 50,000 of her husband 's fortune , and a modest home in Jackson , Mississippi .
Rise and fall
Born in Edmonton , Canada on 27 August , 1941 , Bernard Ebbers worked as a basketball coach , teacher and warehouse manager before running a chain of motels from which he launched his stellar telecoms career .

Profile : Bernie Ebbers
He snapped up rivals and took advantage of the end of AT&T 's monopoly which enabled him to offer phone deals at bargain prices .
With his fortune rapidly growing , in 1995 he paid £ 1.2 bn for WilTel Network Services and changed its name to WorldCom .
By mid-1999 WorldCom shares reached an all - time high and Mr Ebbers became the darling of Wall Street .
" I believe God has a plan for people 's lives , and I believe he had a plan for me , " Mr Ebbers once said .
President Bill Clinton once called him " the symbol of 21st Century America " and said Mr Ebbers was " the embodiment of what I want for the future " .
But in 2001 , his attempts to buy larger rival Sprint were thwarted by regulators and worries about WorldCom 's mounting debt began to emerge .
Mr Ebbers quit the firm in 2002 after admitting borrowing money from WorldCom to cover losses he incurred in buying its shares .
In the same year WorldCom went bankrupt .
It emerged from bankruptcy in 2004 , renaming itself MCI .
